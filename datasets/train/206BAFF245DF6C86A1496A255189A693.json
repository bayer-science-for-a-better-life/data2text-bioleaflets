PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nClear, colourless to pale yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nJavlor is indicated in monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic \ntransitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract after failure of a prior platinum-containing regimen \n \nEfficacy and safety of vinflunine have not been studied in patients with performance status \u2265 2. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nVinflunine treatment should be initiated under the responsibility of a physician qualified in the use of \nanticancer chemotherapy and is confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy. \n \nBefore each cycle, adequate monitoring of complete blood counts should be conducted to verify the \nabsolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelets and haemoglobin as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia are frequent adverse reactions of vinflunine. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is 320 mg/m\u00b2 vinflunine as a 20 minute intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. \n \nIn case of  WHO/ECOG performance status (PS) of 1 or PS of 0 and prior pelvic irradiation, the \ntreatment should be started at the dose of 280 mg/m\u00b2. In the absence of any  haematological toxicity \nduring the first cycle causing treatment delay or dose reduction, the dose will be increased to \n320 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks for the subsequent cycles. \n \nRecommended co-medication  \nIn order to prevent constipation, laxatives and dietary measures including oral hydration are \nrecommended from day 1 to day 5 or 7 after each vinflunine administration (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDose delay or discontinuation due to toxicity \n\nTable 1: Dose delay for subsequent cycles due to toxicity \n\nToxicity Day 1 treatment administration \nNeutropenia (ANC < 1000/mm3 ) \nor \nThrombocytopenia \n(platelets < 100,000/mm3) \n\n- Delay until recovery (ANC \u2265 1,000/mm3 and \nplatelets \u2265 100,000/mm3) and adjust the dose if necessary (see \n\ntable 2) \n- Discontinuation if recovery has not occurred within 2 weeks \n\nOrgan toxicity: moderate, severe or life \nthreatening \n\n- Delay until recovery to mild toxicity or none, or to initial \nbaseline status and adjust the dose if necessary (see table 2) \n\n- Discontinuation if recovery has not occurred within 2 weeks \nCardiac ischaemia in patients with prior \nhistory of myocardial infarction or angina \npectoris \n\n- Discontinuation \n\n \nDose adjustments due to toxicity  \n \n\nTable 2: Dose adjustments due to toxicity \n\nToxicity Dose adjustment \n\n(NCI CTC v 2.0)* Vinflunine initial dose of 320 mg/m\u00b2 Vinflunine initial dose of \n280 mg/m\u00b2 \n\n First  \nEvent \n\n \n\n2nd \nconsecutive \n\nevent \n\n3rd consecutive \nevent \n\nFirst  \nEvent \n\n \n\n2nd consecutive \nevent \n\nNeutropenia Grade 4 \n(ANC < 500/mm3) > 7 days \n\n \n280 mg/m\u00b2 \n\n \n250 mg/m\u00b2 \n\nDefinitive \nTreatment \n\ndiscontinuation \n\n \n250 mg/m\u00b2 \n\n \n\nDefinitive \nTreatment \n\ndiscontinuation \n\nFebrile Neutropenia \n(ANC < 1,000/mm3 and  \nfever \u2265 38,5 \u00b0C)  \nMucositis or Constipation \nGrade 2 \u2265 5 days or \nGrade \u2265 3 any duration1 \nAny other toxicity Grade \u2265 3 \n(severe or life-threatening) \n(except Grade 3 vomiting or \nnausea2) \n*National Cancer Institute, Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.0 (NCI CTC v 2.0) \n1 NCI CTC Grade 2 constipation is defined as requiring laxatives, Grade 3 as an obstipation requiring manual \nevacuation or enema, Grade 4 as an obstruction or toxic megacolon.

Vinflunine pharmacokinetics was not modified in those patients, however \nbased on hepatic biologic parameter modifications following vinflunine administration (gamma \nglutamyl transferases (GGT), transaminases, bilirubin), the dose recommendations are as follows: \n\n\n\n4 \n\n- No dose adjustment is necessary in patients: \n- with a prothrombin time > 70% NV (Normal Value) and presenting at least one of the \n\nfollowing criteria: [ ULN (Upper Limit of Normal) < bilirubin \u2264 1.5\u00d7ULN and/or \n1.5xULN < transaminases \u2264 2.5\u00d7ULN and/or ULN < GGT \u2264 5\u00d7ULN ]. \n\n- with transaminases \u2264 2.5xULN ( < 5xULN only in case of liver metastases). \n \n- The recommended dose of vinflunine is 250 mg/m\u00b2 given once every 3 weeks in patients with mild \nliver impairment (Child-Pugh grade A) or in patients with a prothrombin time \u2265  60% NV and \n1.5\u00d7ULN < bilirubin \u2264 3\u00d7ULN and presenting at least one of the following criteria:  \n[ transaminases > ULN and/or GGT > 5\u00d7ULN ]. \n \n- The recommended dose of vinflunine is 200 mg/m\u00b2 given once every 3 weeks in patients with \nmoderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh grade B) or in patients with a prothrombin time \u2265 50% NV \nand bilirubin > 3\u00d7ULN and transaminases > ULN and GGT > ULN. \n \nVinflunine has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grade C), or \nin patients with a prothrombin time < 50%NV or with bilirubin > 5xULN or with isolated \ntransaminases > 2.5xULN ( \u2265 5xULN only in case of liver metastases) or with GGT > 15xULN. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nIn clinical studies, patients with CrCl (creatinine clearance) > 60 mL/min were included and treated at \nthe recommended dose. \nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (40 mL/min \u2264 CrCl \u2264 60 mL/min), the recommended dose \nis 280 mg/m\u00b2 given once every 3 weeks.  \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (20 mL/min \u2264 CrCl < 40 mL/min) the recommended dose is \n250 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks (see section 5.2). \n \nFor further cycles, the dose should be adjusted in the event of toxicities, as shown in table 3 below. \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 75 years) \nNo age-related dose modification is required in patients less than 75 years old (see section 5.2).  \nThe doses recommended in patients of at least 75 years old are as follows: \n- in patients of at least 75 years old but less than 80 years, the dose of vinflunine to be given is \n280 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks. \n- in patients 80 years old and above, the dose of vinflunine to be given is 250 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks.  \n \nFor further cycles, the dose should be adjusted in the event of toxicities, as shown in table 3 below: \n\nTable 3: Dose adjustments due to toxicity in renal impaired or elderly patients \n\nToxicity \n\n(NCI CTC v 2.0)* \n\nDose adjustment \n\nVinflunine initial dose of \n280 mg/m\u00b2 \n\nVinflunine initial dose of \n250 mg/m\u00b2 \n\n First Event \n2nd consecutive \n\nevent \nFirst \nEvent \n\n2nd consecutive \nevent \n\nNeutropenia Grade 4  \n(ANC < 500/mm3) > 7 days \n\n250 mg/m\u00b2 \n \n\nDefinitive \nTreatment \n\ndiscontinuation \n\n225 mg/m\u00b2 \n \n\nDefinitive \nTreatment \n\ndiscontinuation \n\nFebrile Neutropenia \n(ANC < 1,000/mm3 and \nfever \u2265 38,5 \u00b0C) \nMucositis or Constipation \nGrade 2 \u2265 5  days or Grade \u2265 3 any \nduration1 \nAny other toxicity Grade  \u2265 3 (severe \nor life-threatening) \n(except Grade 3 vomiting or nausea2) \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n*National Cancer Institute, Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.0 (NCI CTC v 2.0)  \n1 NCI CTC Grade 2 constipation is defined as requiring laxatives, Grade 3 as an obstipation requiring manual \nevacuation or enema, Grade 4 as an obstruction or toxic megacolon. Mucositis Grade 2 is defined as \u201cmoderate\u201d, \nGrade 3 as \u201csevere\u201d and Grade 4 as \u201clife-threatening\u201d. \n2 NCI CTC Grade 3 nausea is defined as no significant intake, requiring intravenous fluids.

Javlor is for single use only. \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \nJavlor MUST ONLY be administered intravenously.  \nJavlor should be administered by a 20-minute intravenous infusion and NOT be given by rapid \nintravenous bolus. \n \nEither peripheral lines or a central catheter can be used for vinflunine administration. When infused \nthrough a peripheral vein, vinflunine can induce venous irritation (see section 4.4). In case of small or \nsclerosed veins, lymphoedema or recent venipuncture of the same vein, the use of a central catheter \nmay be preferred. To avoid extravasations it is important to be sure that the needle is correctly \nintroduced before starting the infusion. \n \nIn order to flush the vein, administration of diluted Javlor should always be followed by at least an \nequal volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) \nsolution for infusion.  \nFor detailed instructions on administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or other vinca alkaloids. \nRecent (within 2 weeks) or current severe infection. \nBaseline ANC < 1,500/mm3 for the first administration, baseline ANC < 1,000/mm3 for subsequent \nadministrations (see section 4.4). \nPlatelets < 100,000/mm3(see section 4.4). \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHematological toxicity \nNeutropenia, leucopenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia are frequent adverse reactions of vinflunine. \nAdequate monitoring of complete blood counts should be conducted to verify the ANC, platelet and \nhaemoglobin values before each vinflunine infusion (see section 4.3). \nInitiation of vinflunine is contraindicated in subjects with baseline ANC < 1,500/mm3 or \nplatelets < 100,000/mm3. For subsequent administrations, vinflunine is contraindicated in subjects \nwith baseline ANC < 1,000/mm3 or platelets < 100,000/mm3. \nThe recommended dose should be reduced in patients with haematological toxicity (see section 4.2). \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGrade \u2265 3 constipation occurred in 15.3% of treated patients. NCI CTC Grade 3 constipation is \ndefined as an obstipation requiring manual evacuation or enema, Grade 4 constipation as an \nobstruction or toxic megacolon. Constipation is reversible and can be prevented by special dietary \nmeasures such as oral hydration and fibre intake, and by administration of laxatives such as stimulant \nlaxatives or faecal softners from day 1 to day 5 or 7 of the treatment cycle. Patients at high risk of \nconstipation (concomitant treatment with opiates, peritoneal carcinomas, abdominal masses, prior \n\n\n\n6 \n\nmajor abdominal surgery) should be medicated with an osmotic laxative from day 1 to day 7 \nadministered once a day in the morning before breakfast.  \nIn case of Grade 2 constipation, defined as requiring laxatives, for 5 days or more or Grade \u2265 3 of any \nduration, the dose of vinflunine should be adjusted (see section 4.2).  \n \nIn case of any Grade \u2265 3 gastrointestinal toxicity (except vomiting or nausea) or of mucositis (Grade 2 \nfor 5 days or more or Grade \u2265 3 of any duration) dose adjustment is required. Grade 2 is defined as \n\u201cmoderate\u201d, Grade 3 as \u201csevere\u201d and Grade 4 as \u201clife-threatening\u201d (see Table 2 in section 4.2).  \n \nCardiac disorders \nFew QT interval prolongations have been observed after the administration of vinflunine. This effect \nmay lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias although no ventricular arrhythmias were \nobserved with vinflunine. Nevertheless, vinflunine should be used with caution in patients with \nincrease of the proarrhythmic risk (e.g. congestive heart failure, known history of QT interval \nprolongation, hypokalaemia) (see section 4.8). The concomittant use of two or more QT/QTc interval \nprolonging substances is not recommended (see section 4.5). \nSpecial attention is recommended when vinflunine is administered to patients with prior history of \nmyocardial infarction/ischaemia or angina pectoris (see section 4.8). Ischaemic cardiac events may \noccur, especially in patients who have underlying cardiac disease. Thus, patients receiving Javlor \nshould be vigilantly monitored by physicians for the occurrence of cardiac events. Caution should be \nexercised in patients with a history of cardiac disease and the benefit / risk assessment should be \ncarefully evaluated regularly. Discontinuation of vinflunine should be considered in patients who \ndevelop cardiac ischaemia. \n \nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) \nCases of PRES have been observed after administration of vinflunine. \nThe typical clinical symptoms are, with various degrees: neurological (headache, confusion, seizure, \nvisual disorders), systemic (hypertension), and gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting). \nRadiological signs are white matter abnormalities in the posterior regions of the brain. Blood pressure \nshould be controlled in patients developing symptoms of PRES. To confirm the diagnosis, brain \nimaging is recommended.  \nClinical and radiological features usually resolved rapidly without sequelae after treatment \ndiscontinuation. \nDiscontinuation of vinflunine should be considered in patients who develop neurological signs of \nPRES (see section 4.8). \n \nHyponatraemia \nSevere hyponatraemia, including cases due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone \nsecretion (SIADH), has been observed with the use of vinflunine (see section 4.8). Therefore, regular \nmonitoring of serum sodium levels is recommended during treatment with vinflunine.   \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe recommended dose should be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe recommended dose should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 75 years) \nThe recommended dose should be reduced in patients 75 years old and beyond (see section 4.2). \n \nInteractions \nThe concomitant use of potent inhibitors or potent inducers of CYP3A4 with vinflunine should be \navoided (see section 4.5). \n \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nAdministration \nIntrathecal administration of Javlor may be fatal. \nWhen infused through a peripheral vein, vinflunine can induce Grade 1 (22% of the patients, 14.1% of \nthe cycles), Grade 2 (11.0% of the patients, 6.8% of the cycles) or Grade 3 (0.8% of the patients, 0.2% \nof the cycles) venous irritation. All cases resolved rapidly without treatment discontinuation.  \nInstructions for administration should be followed as described in section 6.6. \n \nContraception \nMen and women with reproductive potential must use an effective method of contraception during the \ntreatment and up to 3 months after the last vinflunine administration (see section 4.6). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro studies showed that vinflunine had neither inducing effects on CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 \nactivity nor inhibition effects on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and \nCYP3A4. \n \nIn vitro studies showed that vinflunine is a Pgp-substrate like other vinca alkaloids, but with a lower \naffinity. Therefore, risks of clinically significant interactions should be unlikely. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed in patients when vinflunine was combined with either \ncisplatin, carboplatin, capecitabine or gemcitabine. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed in patients when vinflunine was combined with \ndoxorubicin. However, this combination was associated with a particularly high risk of haematological \ntoxicity. \n \nA phase I study evaluating the effect of ketoconazole treatment (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) on \nvinflunine pharmacokinetics indicated that co-administration of ketoconazole (400 mg orally once \ndaily for 8 days) resulted in a 30% and 50% increase in blood exposures to vinflunine and its \nmetabolite 4Odeacetyl-vinflunine (DVFL), respectively. \n \nTherefore the concomitant use of vinflunine and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, \nketoconazole, itraconazole and grapefruit juice) or inducers (such as rifampicin and Hypericum \nperforatum (St John\u2019s wort)) should be avoided since they may increase or decrease vinflunine and \nDVFL concentrations (see section 4.4 and 5.2).  \n \nThe concomitant use of vinflunine with others QT/QTc interval prolonging medicinal products should \nbe avoided (see section 4.4). \n \nA pharmacokinetic interaction between vinflunine and pegylated/liposomal doxorubicin was observed, \nresulting in a 15% to 30% apparent increase in vinflunine exposure and a 2 to 3-fold apparent decrease \nof doxorubicin AUC, whereas for doxorubicinol, the concentrations of the metabolite were not \naffected. According to an in vitro study, such changes could be related to adsorption of vinflunine on \nthe liposomes and a modified blood distribution of both compounds. Therefore, caution should be \nexcercised when this type of combination is used. \n \nA possible interaction with paclitaxel and docetaxel (CYP3 substrates) has been suggested from an in \nvitro study (slight inhibition of vinflunine metabolism). No specific clinical studies of vinflunine in \ncombination with these compounds have been carried out yet. \n \nThe concomitant use of opioids could enhance the risk of constipation. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \nBoth male and female patients should take adequate contraceptive measures up to three months after \nthe discontinuation of the therapy.  \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data available on the use of vinflunine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown embryotoxicity and teratogenicity (see section 5.3). On the basis of the results of animal studies \nand the pharmacological action of the medicinal product, there is a potential risk of embryonic and \nfoetal abnormalities. \nVinflunine should therefore not be used during pregnancy, unless it is strictly necessary. If pregnancy \noccurs during treatment, the patient should be informed about the risk for the unborn child and be \nmonitored carefully. The possibility of genetic counselling should be considered. Genetic counselling \nis also recommended for patients wishing to have children after therapy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether vinflunine or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Due to the possible \nvery harmful effects on the infants, breast-feeding during treatment with vinflunine is contraindicated \n(see section 4.3).  \n \nFertility  \nAdvice on conservation of sperm should be sought prior to treatment because of the possibility of \nirreversible infertility due to therapy with vinflunine. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nJavlor may cause adverse reactions such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (common) which \nmay lead to a minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines..Patients should be \nadvised not to drive or use machines if they experience any adverse reaction with a potential impact on \nthe ability to perform these activities (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequent treatment-related adverse reactions reported in the two phase II and one phase III \ntrials in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium (450 patients treated with \nvinflunine) were haematological disorders, mainly neutropenia and anaemia; gastrointestinal \ndisorders, especially constipation, anorexia, nausea, stomatitis/mucositis, vomiting, abdominal pain \nand diarrhoea, and general disorders such as asthenia/fatigue. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions are listed below by System Organ Class, frequency and grade of severity (NCI CTC \nversion 2.0). Frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common \n(\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nTable 4 Adverse reactions observed in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the \n\nurothelium treated with vinflunine \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Reactions Worst NCI Grade per \n\npatient (%) \n\n   All grades Grade 3-4 \nInfections and infestations Common Neutropenic infection 2.4 2.4 \n\nInfections (viral, bacterial, \nfungal) \n\n7.6 3.6 \n\nUncommon Neutropenic sepsis 0.2 0.2 \nNeoplasm benign, \nmalignant and unspecified \n\nUncommon Tumour pain 0.2 0.2 \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nVery common Neutropenia 79.6 54.6 \nLeucopenia 84.5 45.2 \nAnaemia 92.8 17.3 \nThrombocytopenia 53.5 4.9 \n\nCommon Febrile neutropenia 6.7 6.7 \nImmune system disorders Common Hypersensitivity 1.3 0.2 \nEndocrine disorders Uncommon Syndrome of Inappropriate \n\nAntidiuretic Hormone \nSecretion (SIADH) a \n\n0.4 b 0.4 b \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nVery common Hyponatraemia 39.8 11.7 \nDecreased appetite 34.2 2.7 \n\nCommon Dehydration 4.4 2.0 \nPsychiatric disorders Common Insomnia 5.1 0.2 \nNervous system disorders Very common Peripheral sensory \n\nneuropathy 11.3 0.9 \n\nCommon Syncope  1.1 1.1 \nHeadache 6.2 0.7 \nDizziness 5.3 0.4 \nNeuralgia 4.4 0.4 \nDysgeusia 3.3 0 \nNeuropathy 1.3 0 \n\nUncommon Peripheral motor neuropathy 0.4 0 \nRare Posterior Reversible \n\nEncephalopathy Syndromea 0.03\nb 0.03b \n\nEye disorders Uncommon Visual disturbance 0.4 0 \nEar and Labyrinth \ndisorders \n\nCommon Ear pain 1.1 0 \nUncommon Vertigo  0.9 0.4 \n\nTinnitus 0.9 0 \nCardiac disorders Common Tachycardia 1.8 0.2 \n\nUncommon Myocardial ischaemia 0.7 0.7 \nMyocardial infarction 0.2 0.2 \n\nVascular disorders Common Hypertension 3.1 1.6 \nVein thrombosis 3.6 0.4 \nPhlebitis 2.4 0 \nHypotension 1.1 0.2 \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon Dyspnoea 4.2 0.4 \nCough 2.2 0 \n\nUncommon Acute respiratory distress \nsyndrome 0.2 0.2 \n\nPharyngolaryngeal pain 0.9 0 \nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Constipation 54.9 15.1 \n\nAbdominal pain  21.6 4.7 \n\n\n\n10 \n\nVomiting 27.3 2.9 \nNausea 40.9 2.9 \nStomatitis 27.1 2.7 \nDiarrhoea 12.9 0.9 \n\nCommon Ileus 2.7 2.2 \nDysphagia 2.0 0.4 \nBuccal disorders 4.0 0.2 \nDyspepsia 5.1 0.2 \n\nUncommon Odynophagia 0.4 0.2 \nGastric disorders 0.8 0 \nOesophagitis 0.4 0.2 \nGingival disorders 0.7 0 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common Alopecia 28.9 NA \nCommon Rash 1.8 0 \n\nUrticaria 1.1 0 \nPruritus 1.1 0 \nHyperhidrosis 1.1 0 \n\nUncommon Dry skin 0.9 0 \nErythema 0.4 0 \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nVery common Myalgia 16.7 3.1 \nCommon Muscular weakness 1.8 0.7 \n\nArthralgia 7.1 0.4 \nBack pain 4.9 0.4 \nPain in jaw 5.6 0 \nPain in extremity 2.4 0 \nBone pain  2.9 0 \nMusculoskeletal pain 2.7 0.2 \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Renal failure 0.2 0.2 \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nVery common Asthenia/Fatigue 55.3 15.8 \nInjection site reaction 26.4 0.4 \nPyrexia 11.7 0.4 \n\nCommon Chest pain 4.7 0.9 \nChills 2.2 0.2 \nPain 3.1 0.2 \nOedema 1.1 0 \n\nUncommon Extravasation 0.7 0 \nInvestigations Very common Weight decreased 24.0 0.4 \n\nUncommon Transaminases increased 0.4 0 \nWeight increased 0.2 0 \n\naadverse reactions reported from post-marketing experience \nbfrequency calculated on the basis of non-TCCU clinical trial \n \nAdverse reactions in all indications  \nAdverse reactions occurring in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium and in \npatients with other disease than this indication and potentially severe or adverse reactions that are a \nclass effect of the vinca alkaloids are described below: \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nGrade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in 43.8% of patients.

Grade 3/4 ileus reported in 1.9% of patients was reversible when \nmanaged by medical care. Constipation is managed by medical care (see section 4.4). \n \nNervous system disorders \nSensory peripheral neuropathy is a class effect of the vinca alkaloids. Grade 3 was experienced by \n0.6% patients. All resolved during the study. \nRare cases of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome have been reported (see section 4.4). \n \nCardiovascular disorders \nCardiac effects are a known class effect of the vinca alkaloids. Myocardial infarction or ischaemia \nwere experienced by 0.5% of the patients and most of them had a pre-existing cardiovascular disease \nor risk factors. One patient died after myocardial infarction and another one due to a cardiopulmonary \narrest. \nFew QT interval prolongations have been observed after the administration of vinflunine. \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nDyspnoea occurred in 3.2% of the patients but was rarely severe (Grade 3/4: 1.2%). \nBronchospam was reported in one patient treated with vinflunine for a different setting from the \nindication. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe main toxic effect due to an overdose with vinflunine is bone marrow suppression with a risk of \nsevere infection. \nThere is no known antidote for vinflunine overdose. In case of overdose, the patient should be kept in \na specialised unit and vital functions should be closely monitored. Other appropriate measures should \nbe taken, such as blood transfusions, administration of antibiotics and growth factors. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplasic agents, vinca alkaloids and analogues, ATC code: \nL01CA05 \n \nMechanism of action \nVinflunine binds to tubulin at or near to the vinca binding sites inhibiting its polymerisation into \nmicrotubules, which results in treadmilling suppression, disruption of microtubule dynamic, mitotic \narrest and apoptosis. In vivo, vinflunine displays significant antitumor activity against a broad \nspectrum of human xenografts in mice both in terms of survival prolongation and tumour growth \ninhibition. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nOne phase III and two phase II trials support the use of Javlor for treatment of advanced or metastatic \ntransitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium as second-line therapy after failure of a prior platinum-\ncontaining regimen. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nIn the two multi-centre open-label, single-arm phase II clinical trials a total of 202 patients were \ntreated with vinflunine. \n \nIn the multi-centre, open-label controlled phase III clinical trial, 253 patients were randomised to \ntreatment with vinflunine + BSC (best supportive care) and 117 patients to the BSC arm.  \nThe median overall survival was 6.9 months (vinflunine + BSC) vs. 4.6 months (BSC), but the \ndifference did not reach statistical significance; hazard ratio 0.88 (95% CI 0.69, 1.12). However a \nstatistically significant effect was seen on progression-free survival. Median PFS was 3.0 months \n(vinflunine + BSC) vs 1.5 months (BSC) (p=0.0012). \n \nIn addition a pre-specified multivariate analysis performed on the ITT population demonstrated that \nvinflunine had a statistically significant treatment effect (p=0.036) on overall survival when prognostic \nfactors (PS, visceral involvement, alkaline phosphatases, haemoglobin, pelvic irradiation) were taken \ninto consideration; hazard ratio 0.77 (95% CI 0.61, 0.98). A statistically significant difference on \noverall survival (p=0.040) was also seen in the eligible population (which excluded 13 patients with \nclinically significant protocol violations at baseline who were not eligible for treatment); hazard \nratio 0.78 (95% CI 0.61, 0.99). This is considered the most relevant population for the efficacy \nanalysis, as it most closely reflects the population intended for treatment.  \n \nEfficacy was demonstrated in both patients with or without prior cisplatin use.  \nIn the eligible population, the subgroup analyses according to the prior cisplatin use versus BSC on \noverall survival (OS) showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.64 (0.40 \u2013 1.03); p=0.0821] in the absence of prior \ncisplatin, and a HR (95% CI) = [0.80 (0.60 \u2013 1.06); p=0.1263] in the presence of prior cisplatin. When \nadjusted on prognostic factors, the analyses of OS in the subgroups of patients without or with prior \ncisplatin showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.53 (0.32 \u2013 0.88); p=0.0143] and a HR (95% CI) = [0.70 (0.53 \u2013 \n0.94); p=0.0174], respectively. \nIn the subgroup analyses of prior cisplatin use versus BSC for progression free survival (PFS), the \nresults were: HR (95% CI) = [0.55 (0.34 \u2013 0.89); p=0.0129] in the absence of prior cisplatin, and a HR \n(95% CI) = [0.64 (0.48 \u2013 0.85); p=0.0040] in the presence of prior cisplatin. When adjusted on \nprognostic factors, the analyses of PFS in the subgroups of patients without or with prior cisplatin \nshowed a HR (95% CI) = [0.51(0.31 \u2013 0.86); p=0.0111] and a HR (95% CI) = [0.63(0.48 \u2013 0.84); \np=0.0016], respectively. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Javlor \nin all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of ureter and bladder carcinoma and the \ntreatment of breast carcinoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nVinflunine pharmacokinetics is linear in the range of administered doses (from 30 mg/m\u00b2 to \n400 mg/m2) in cancer patients. \nBlood exposure to vinflunine (AUC), significantly correlated with severity of leucopenia, neutropenia \nand fatigue. \n \nDistribution  \nVinflunine is moderately bound to human plasma proteins (67.2\u00b11.1%) with a ratio between plasma \nand whole blood concentrations of 0.80\u00b10.12. Protein binding mainly involves high density \nlipoproteins and serum albumin and is non-saturable on the range of vinflunine concentrations \nobserved in patients. Binding to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein and to platelets is negligible (< 5%). \nThe terminal volume of distribution is large, 2422\u00b1676 litres (about 35 l/kg) suggesting extensive \ndistribution  into tissues.  \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nBiotransformation \nAll metabolites identified are formed by the cytochrome CYP3A4 isoenzyme, except for \n4-O-deacetylvinflunine (DVFL), the only active metabolite and main metabolite in blood which is \nformed by multiple esterases.  \n \nElimination  \nVinflunine is eliminated following a multi-exponential concentration decay, with a terminal half-life \n(t1/2) close to 40 h. DVFL is slowly formed and more slowly eliminated than vinflunine (t1/2 of \napproximately 120 h). \nThe excretion of vinflunine and its metabolites occurs through faeces (2/3) and urine (1/3).  \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 372 patients (656 pharmacokinetic profiles), the total \nblood clearance was 40 l/h with low inter and intra-individual variability (25% and 8%, respectively, \nexpressed as coefficient of variation). \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo modification of vinflunine and DVFL pharmacokinetics was observed in 25 patients presenting \nvarying degrees of hepatic impairment, compared to patients with normal hepatic function. This was \nfurther confirmed by the population pharmacokinetic analysis (absence of relationship between \nvinflunine clearance and biology markers of hepatic impairment). However, dose adjustments are \nrecommended in patients with liver impairment (see section 4.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \nA pharmacokinetic phase I study was performed in 2 groups of patients with renal impairment \nclassified according to the calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) values: group 1 (n=13 patients) with \nmoderate impairment (40 mL/min \u2264 CrCl \u2264 60 mL/min) and group 2 (n=20 patients) with severe \nimpairment (20 mL/min \u2264 CrCl < 40 mL/min). The pharmacokinetic results of this study indicated a \nreduction of vinflunine clearance when CrCl is decreased. This is further confirmed by the population \npharmacokinetic analysis (56 patients with CrCl between 20 mL/min and 60 mL/min), showing that \nvinflunine clearance is influenced by the creatinine clearance value (Cockcroft and Gault formula). \nDose adjustments are recommended in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \nElderly (\u2265 75 years) \nA pharmacokinetic phase I study of vinflunine was performed in elderly patients (n=46). Vinflunine \ndoses were adjusted according to 3 age groups as shown below:  \n \n\nAge (y) Number of patients Vinflunine (mg/m\u00b2) \n\n[ 70 \u2013 75 [   17 320 \n\n[ 75 \u2013 80 [ 15 280 \n\n\u2265 80 14 250 \n \nVinflunine clearance was significantly decreased in patients \u2265 80 years old as compared to a control \ngroup of younger patients < 70 years.  \nPharmacokinetics of vinflunine was not modified for patients 70 \u2264 age < 75 years and \n75 \u2264 age < 80 years.  \nBased on both PK and safety data, dose reductions are recommended in the elder groups: \n75 \u2264 age < 80 years; and age \u2265 80 years.  \nFor further cycles the dose should be adjusted in the event of toxicities (see section 4.2).  \n \nOthers \nAccording to the population pharmacokinetic analysis, neither gender nor performance status (ECOG \nscore) had an impact on vinflunine clearance which is directly proportional to body surface area. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nImaging distribution studies following radioactive vinflunine in rats, illustrated that the compound \nlevels in lungs, kidneys, liver, salivary and endocrine glands, and gastrointestinal tract were rapidly \nhigher than those in blood.  \n \nPreclinical data revealed moderate to severe neutropenia and mild anaemia, in all species tested, with  \nliver toxicity in dogs and rats (characterized by dose-dependent increases in liver transaminases and \nhepatic necrosis/hepatocellular alterations at high doses). These toxic effects were dose-related and \nfully or-partially reversible following a 1-month recovery period. Vinflunine did not induce peripheral \nneuropathy in animals. \nVinflunine has shown to be clastogenic (induces chromosome breakage) in the in vivo micronucleus \ntest in rat as well as mutagenic and clastogenic in a mouse lymphoma assay (without metabolic \nactivation). \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of vinflunine has not been studied.  \nIn the reproduction studies, vinflunine appeared to be embryolethal and teratogenic in rabbits and \nteratogenic in rats. During the pre- and post-natal development study in rat, vinflunine induced \nmalformations of the uterus and vagina in 2 females, and adversely affected mating and/or ovule \nimplantation and markedly lowered the number of concepti. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nWater for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vial  \n3 years. \n \nDiluted solution  \nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for the diluted medicinal product as \nfollows:  \n - protected from light in polyethylene or polyvinylchloride infusion bag: for up to 6 days in a \nrefrigerator (2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C) or for up to 24 hours at 25\u00b0C;  \n - exposed to light in polyethylene or polyvinylchloride infusion set for up to 1 hour at 25\u00b0C. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately after dilution. If not \nused immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user \nand would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, unless dilution has taken place in \ncontrolled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C). \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nClear type I glass vials closed by a grey butyl or black chlorobutyl rubber stopper covered with a \ncrimped-on aluminium ring and a cap. Each vial contains either 2 mL (50 mg vinflunine), 4 mL \n(100 mg vinflunine) or 10 mL (250 mg vinflunine) of concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nPack size of 1 and 10 vials. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nGeneral precautions for preparation and administration. \nVinflunine is a cytotoxic anticancer medicinal product and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, \ncaution should be exercised in handling Javlor. Procedure for proper handling and disposal of \nanticancer medicinal products should be considered. All transfer procedures require strict adherence to \naseptic techniques, preferably employing a vertical laminar flow safety hood. Javlor solution for \ninfusion should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately trained in the handling \nof cytotoxic agents. Pregnant staff should not handle Javlor. The use of gloves, goggles and protective \nclothing is recommended. \nIf the solution comes into contact with the skin, this should be washed immediately and thoroughly \nwith soap and water. If it comes into contact with mucous membranes, the membranes should be \nflushed  thoroughly with water.  \n \nDilution of the concentrate  \nThe volume of Javlor (concentrate) corresponding to the calculated dose of vinflunine should be \nmixed in a 100 mL bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion. Glucose 50 mg/mL \n(5%) solution for infusion may also be used. The diluted solution should be protected from light until \nadministration (see section 6.3). \n \nMethod of administration \nJavlor is for intravenous use ONLY. \nJavlor is for single use only. \nAfter dilution of the Javlor concentrate, the solution for infusion will be administered as follows: \n\n\u2022 A venous access should be established for a 500 mL bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \nsolution for injection or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion, on a large vein \npreferably in the upper part of the forearm or using a central venous line. The veins of the \nhand dorsum and those close to joints should be avoided. \n\n\u2022 The intravenous infusion should be started with half of the 500 mL bag of sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion, i.e. \n250 mL, at a free flowing rate to flush the vein. \n\n\u2022 The Javlor solution for infusion should be piggy-backed to the side injection port closest to the \n500 mL bag to further dilute Javlor during administration.  \n\n\u2022 The Javlor solution for infusion should be infused over 20 minutes. \n\u2022 The patency should be assessed frequently and extravasation precautions should be \n\nmaintained throughout the infusion. \n\u2022 After the infusion is completed, the remaining 250 mL from the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n\n(0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion bag should be \nrun at a flowing rate of 300 mL/h. In order to flush the vein, administration of Javlor solution \nfor infusion should always be followed by at least an equal volume of sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nDisposal \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements for cytotoxic medicinal products. \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again. \n-     If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See Section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n1. What Javlor is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Javlor \n3. How to use Javlor \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Javlor \n6. Content of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Javlor is and what it is used for \n \nJavlor contains the active substance vinflunine, which belongs to a group of anticancer medicines \ncalled  vinca alkaloids.

Procedure for proper handling and disposal of \nanticancer medicinal products should be considered. All transfer procedures require strict adherence to \naseptic techniques, preferably employing a vertical laminar flow safety hood. Javlor solution for \ninfusion should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately trained in the handling \nof cytotoxic agents. Pregnant staff should not handle Javlor. The use of gloves, goggles and protective \nclothing is recommended. \nIf the solution comes into contact with the skin, this should be washed immediately and thoroughly \nwith soap and water. If it comes into contact with mucous membranes, the membranes should be \nflushed  thoroughly with water.  \n \nDilution of the concentrate  \nThe volume of Javlor (concentrate) corresponding to the calculated dose of vinflunine should be \nmixed in a 100 mL bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion. Glucose 50 mg/mL \n(5%) solution for infusion may also be used. The diluted solution should be protected from light until \nadministration (see section 6.3). \n \nMethod of administration \nJavlor is for intravenous use ONLY. \nJavlor is for single use only.  \nAfter dilution of the Javlor concentrate, the solution for infusion will be administered as follows: \n\n\u2022 A venous access should be established for a 500 mL bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \nsolution for injection or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion, on a large vein \npreferably in the upper part of the forearm or using a central venous line. The veins of the \nhand dorsum and those close to joints should be avoided. \n\n\u2022 The intravenous infusion should be started with half of the 500 mL bag of sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion, i.e. \n250 mL, at a free flowing rate to flush the vein. \n\n\u2022 The Javlor solution for infusion should be piggy-backed to the side injection port closest to the \n500 mL bag to further dilute Javlor during administration.  \n\n\u2022 The Javlor solution for infusion should be infused over 20 minutes. \n\u2022 The patency should be assessed frequently and extravasation precautions should be \n\nmaintained throughout the infusion. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n\u2022 After the infusion is completed, the remaining 250 mL from the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n(0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion bag should be \nrun at a flowing rate of 300 mL/h. In order to flush the vein, administration of Javlor solution \nfor infusion should always be followed by at least an equal volume of sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for infusion. \n\n \nDisposal \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements for cytotoxic medicinal products. \n \nStorage conditions \nUnopened vials \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C). \nStore in the original packaging in order to protect from light. \n \nDiluted solution \nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for the diluted medicinal product as \nfollows:  \n - protected from light in polyethylene or polyvinylchloride infusion bag: for up to 6 days in a \nrefrigerator (2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C) or for up to 24 hours at 25\u00b0C;  \n - exposed to light in polyethylene or polyvinylchloride infusion set: for up to 1 hour at 25\u00b0C.  \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately after dilution. If not \nused immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user \nand would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, unless dilution has taken place in \ncontrolled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
