QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nTasigna 50 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\nOne hard capsule contains 50 mg nilotinib (as hydrochloride monohydrate). \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect \n\nOne hard capsule contains 39.03 mg lactose monohydrate. \n\n \n\nTasigna 200 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\nOne hard capsule contains 200 mg nilotinib (as hydrochloride monohydrate). \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect \n\nOne hard capsule contains 156.11 mg lactose monohydrate. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nHard capsule. \n\n \n\nTasigna 50 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\nWhite to yellowish powder in hard gelatin capsule with red opaque cap and light yellow opaque body, \n\nsize 4 with black radial imprint “NVR/ABL” on cap. \n\n \n\nTasigna 200 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\nWhite to yellowish powder in light yellow opaque hard gelatin capsules, size 0 with red axial imprint \n\n“NVR/TKI”. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nTasigna is indicated for the treatment of: \n\n- adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic \nmyelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the chronic phase, \n\n- adult patients with chronic phase and accelerated phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML \nwith resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. Efficacy data in patients with \n\nCML in blast crisis are not available, \n\n- paediatric patients with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML with resistance \nor intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and the treatment of patients \n\nwith CML. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nTreatment should be continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity \n\noccurs. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed the patient should not take an additional dose, but take the usual prescribed next \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nPosology for Philadelphia chromosome positive CML adult patients \n\nThe recommended dose is: \n\n- 300 mg twice daily in newly diagnosed patients with CML in the chronic phase, \n- 400 mg twice daily in patients with chronic or accelerated phase CML with resistance or \n\nintolerance to prior therapy. \n\n \n\nFor a dose of 300 mg twice daily, 150 mg hard capsules are available. \n\n \n\nPosology for Philadelphia chromosome positive CML paediatric patients \n\nDosing in paediatric patients is individualised and is based on body surface area (mg/m2). The \n\nrecommended dose of nilotinib is 230 mg/m2 twice daily, rounded to the nearest 50 mg dose (to a \n\nmaximum single dose of 400 mg) (see Table 1). Different strengths of Tasigna hard capsules can be \n\ncombined to attain the desired dose. \n\n \n\nThere is no experience with treatment of paediatric patients below 2 years of age. There are no data in \n\nnewly diagnosed paediatric patients below 10 years of age and limited data in imatinib-resistant or \n\nintolerant paediatric patients below 6 years of age. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Paediatric dosing scheme of nilotinib 230 mg/m2 twice daily \n\n \n\nBody Surface Area \n\n(BSA) \n\nDose in mg \n\n(twice daily) \n\nUp to 0.32 m2 50 mg \n\n0.33 – 0.54 m2 100 mg \n\n0.55 – 0.76 m2 150 mg \n\n0.77 – 0.97 m2 200 mg \n\n0.98 – 1.19 m2 250 mg \n\n1.20 – 1.41 m2 300 mg \n\n1.42 – 1.63 m2 350 mg \n\n≥1.64 m2 400 mg \n\n \n\nAdult Philadelphia chromosome positive CML patients in chronic phase who have been treated with \n\nnilotinib as first-line therapy and who achieved a sustained deep molecular response (MR4.5) \n\nDiscontinuation of treatment may be considered in eligible adult Philadelphia chromosome positive \n\n(Ph+) CML patients in chronic phase who have been treated with nilotinib at 300 mg twice daily for a \n\nminimum of 3 years if a deep molecular response is sustained for a minimum of one year immediately \n\nprior to discontinuation of therapy. Discontinuation of nilotinib therapy should be initiated by a \n\nphysician experienced in the treatment of patients with CML (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nEligible patients who discontinue nilotinib therapy must have their BCR-ABL transcript levels and \n\ncomplete blood count with differential monitored monthly for one year, then every 6 weeks for the \n\nsecond year, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels must be \n\nperformed with a quantitative diagnostic test validated to measure molecular response levels on the \n\nInternational Scale (IS) with a sensitivity of at least MR4.5 (BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.0032% IS). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nFor patients who lose MR4 (MR4=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.01%IS) but not MMR \n\n(MMR=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.1%IS) during the treatment-free phase, BCR-ABL transcript levels should \n\nbe monitored every 2 weeks until BCR-ABL levels return to a range between MR4 and MR4.5. \n\nPatients who maintain BCR-ABL levels between MMR and MR4 for a minimum of 4 consecutive \n\nmeasurements can return to the original monitoring schedule. \n\n \n\nPatients who lose MMR must re-initiate treatment within 4 weeks of when loss of remission is known \n\nto have occurred. Nilotinib therapy should be re-initiated at 300 mg twice daily or at a reduced dose \n\nlevel of 400 mg once daily if the patient had a dose reduction prior to discontinuation of therapy. \n\nPatients who re-initiate nilotinib therapy should have their BCR-ABL transcript levels monitored \n\nmonthly until MMR is re-established and every 12 weeks thereafter (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAdult Philadelphia chromosome positive CML patients in chronic phase who have achieved a \n\nsustained deep molecular response (MR 4.5) on nilotinib following prior imatinib therapy \n\nDiscontinuation of treatment may be considered in eligible adult Philadelphia chromosome positive \n\n(Ph+) CML patients in chronic phase who have been treated with nilotinib for a minimum of 3 years if \n\na deep molecular response is sustained for a minimum of one year immediately prior to \n\ndiscontinuation of therapy. Discontinuation of nilotinib therapy should be initiated by a physician \n\nexperienced in the treatment of patients with CML (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nEligible patients who discontinue nilotinib therapy must have their BCR-ABL transcript levels and \n\ncomplete blood count with differential monitored monthly for one year, then every 6 weeks for the \n\nsecond year, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels must be \n\nperformed with a quantitative diagnostic test validated to measure molecular response levels on the \n\nInternational Scale (IS) with a sensitivity of at least MR4.5 (BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.0032% IS). \n\n \n\nPatients with confirmed loss of MR4 (MR4= BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.01%IS) during the treatment-free \n\nphase (two consecutive measures separated by at least 4 weeks showing loss of MR4) or loss of major \n\nmolecular response (MMR=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.1%IS) must re-initiate treatment within 4 weeks of \n\nwhen loss of remission is known to have occurred. Nilotinib therapy should be re-initiated at either \n\n300 mg or 400 mg twice daily. Patients who re-initiate nilotinib therapy should have their BCR-ABL \n\ntranscript levels monitored monthly until previous major molecular response or MR4 level is \n\nre-established and every 12 weeks thereafter (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nDose adjustments or modifications \n\nTasigna may need to be temporarily withheld and/or dose reduced for haematological toxicities \n\n(neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) that are not related to the underlying leukaemia (see Table 2). \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nTable 2 Dose adjustments for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nAdult patients with newly \n\ndiagnosed chronic phase \n\nCML at 300 mg twice \n\ndaily \n\nand \n\nimatinib-resistant or \n\nintolerant CML in \n\nchronic phase at 400 mg \n\ntwice daily \n\nANC* <1.0 x 109/l and/or \n\nplatelet counts <50 x 109/l \n\n1.

If blood counts remain low, a dose \nreduction to 400 mg once daily may be \n\nrequired. \n\nAdult patients with \n\nimatinib-resistant or \n\nintolerant CML in \n\naccelerated phase at \n\n400 mg twice daily \n\nANC* <0.5 x 109/l and/or \n\nplatelet counts <10 x 109/l \n\n1.

If blood counts remain low, a dose \nreduction to 230 mg/m2 once daily may \n\nbe required. \n\n4. If event occurs after dose reduction, \nconsider discontinuing treatment. \n\n*ANC = absolute neutrophil count \n\n \n\nIf clinically significant moderate or severe non-haematological toxicity develops, dosing should be \n\ninterrupted, and patients should be monitored and treated accordingly. If the prior dose was 300 mg \n\ntwice daily in adult newly diagnosed patients with CML in the chronic phase, or 400 mg twice daily in \n\nadult patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML in chronic or accelerated phase, or 230 mg/m2 \n\ntwice daily in paediatric patients, dosing may be resumed at 400 mg once daily in adult patients and at \n\n230 mg/m2 once daily in paediatric patients once the toxicity has resolved. If the prior dose was \n\n400 mg once daily in adult patients or 230 mg/m2 once daily in paediatric patients, treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued. If clinically appropriate, re-escalation of the dose to the starting dose of 300 mg twice \n\ndaily in adult newly diagnosed patients with CML in the chronic phase or to 400 mg twice daily in \n\nadult patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML in chronic or accelerated phase or to \n\n230 mg/m2 twice daily in paediatric patients should be considered. \n\n \n\nElevated serum lipase: For Grade 3-4 serum lipase elevations, doses in adult patients should be \n\nreduced to 400 mg once daily or interrupted. In paediatric patients, treatment must be interrupted until \n\nthe event returns to Grade 1. Thereafter, if the prior dose was 230 mg/m2 twice daily, treatment can \n\nbe resumed at 230 mg/m2 once daily. If the prior dose was 230 mg/m2 once daily, treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued. Serum lipase levels should be tested monthly or as clinically indicated (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nElevated bilirubin and hepatic transaminases: For Grade 3-4 bilirubin and hepatic transaminase \n\nelevations in adult patients, doses should be reduced to 400 mg once daily or interrupted. For \n\nGrade 2 bilirubin elevations or Grade 3 hepatic transaminase elevations in paediatric patients, \n\ntreatment must be interrupted until the levels return to Grade 1. Thereafter, if the prior dose was \n\n230 mg/m2 twice daily, treatment can be resumed at 230 mg/m2 once daily. If the prior dose was \n\n230 mg/m2 once daily, and recovery to Grade 1 takes longer than 28 days, treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued. Bilirubin and hepatic transaminases levels should be tested monthly or as clinically \n\nindicated. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nApproximately 12% of subjects in the Phase III study in patients with newly diagnosed CML in \n\nchronic phase and approximately 30% of subjects in the Phase II study in patients with \n\nimatinib-resistant or intolerant CML in chronic phase and accelerated phase were 65 years of age or \n\nover. No major differences were observed for safety and efficacy in patients ≥65 years of age as \n\ncompared to adults aged 18 to 65 years. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nClinical studies have not been performed in patients with impaired renal function. \n\nSince nilotinib and its metabolites are not renally excreted, a decrease in total body clearance is not \n\nanticipated in patients with renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nHepatic impairment has a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib. Dose adjustment is not \n\nconsidered necessary in patients with hepatic impairment. However, patients with hepatic impairment \n\nshould be treated with caution (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nIn clinical studies, patients with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease (e.g., recent myocardial \n\ninfarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia) were \n\nexcluded. Caution should be exercised in patients with relevant cardiac disorders (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIncreases in total serum cholesterol levels have been reported with nilotinib therapy (see section 4.4). \n\nLipid profiles should be determined prior to initiating nilotinib therapy, assessed at month 3 and 6 \n\nafter initiating therapy and at least yearly during chronic therapy. \n\n \n\nIncreases in blood glucose levels have been reported with nilotinib therapy (see section 4.4). Blood \n\nglucose levels should be assessed prior to initiating nilotinib therapy and monitored during treatment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Tasigna in paediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive CML \n\nin chronic phase from 2 to less than 18 years of age have been established (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and \n\n5.2). There is no experience in paediatric patients below 2 years of age or in paediatric patients with \n\nPhiladelphia chromosome positive CML in accelerated phase or blast crisis. There are no data in \n\nnewly diagnosed paediatric patients below 10 years of age and limited data in imatinib-resistant or \n\nintolerant paediatric patients below 6 years of age. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nTasigna should be taken twice daily approximately 12 hours apart and must not be taken with food. \n\nThe hard capsules should be swallowed whole with water. No food should be consumed for 2 hours \n\nbefore the dose is taken and no food should be consumed for at least one hour after the dose is taken. \n\n \n\nFor patients who are unable to swallow hard capsules, the content of each hard capsule may be \n\ndispersed in one teaspoon of apple sauce (puréed apple) and should be taken immediately. Not more \n\nthan one teaspoon of apple sauce and no food other than apple sauce must be used (see sections 4.4 \n\nand 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nMyelosuppression \n\n \n\nTreatment with nilotinib is associated with (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria \n\ngrade 3-4) thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia. Occurrence is more frequent in patients with \n\nimatinib-resistant or intolerant CML, in particular in patients with accelerated-phase CML. Complete \n\nblood counts should be performed every two weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter, \n\nor as clinically indicated. Myelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed by \n\nwithholding Tasigna temporarily or dose reduction (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nQT prolongation \n\n \n\nNilotinib has been shown to prolong cardiac ventricular repolarisation as measured by the QT interval \n\non the surface ECG in a concentration-dependent manner in adult and paediatric patients. \n\n \n\nIn the Phase III study in patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase receiving 300 mg \n\nnilotinib twice daily, the change from baseline in mean time-averaged QTcF interval at steady state \n\nwas 6 msec. No patient had a QTcF >480 msec. No episodes of torsade de pointes were observed. \n\n \n\nIn the Phase II study in imatinib-resistant and intolerant CML patients in chronic and accelerated \n\nphase receiving 400 mg nilotinib twice daily, the change from baseline in mean time-averaged QTcF \n\ninterval at steady state was 5 and 8 msec, respectively. QTcF of >500 msec was observed in <1% of \n\nthese patients. No episodes of torsade de pointes were observed in clinical studies. \n\n \n\nIn a healthy volunteer study with exposures that were comparable to the exposures observed in \n\npatients, the time-averaged mean placebo-subtracted QTcF change from baseline was 7 msec \n\n(CI ± 4 msec). No subject had a QTcF >450 msec. Additionally, no clinically relevant arrhythmias \n\nwere observed during the conduct of the trial. In particular, no episodes of torsade de pointes (transient \n\nor sustained) were observed. \n\n \n\nSignificant prolongation of the QT interval may occur when nilotinib is inappropriately taken with \n\nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or medicinal products with a known potential to prolong the QT \n\ninterval, and/or food (see section 4.5). The presence of hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia may \n\nfurther enhance this effect. Prolongation of the QT interval may expose patients to the risk of fatal \n\noutcome. \n\n \n\nTasigna should be used with caution in patients who have or who are at significant risk of developing \n\nprolongation of QTc, such as those: \n\n- with congenital long QT prolongation \n- with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease including recent myocardial infarction, \n\ncongestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia. \n\n- taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products or other substances that lead to QT prolongation. \n \n\nClose monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable and a baseline ECG is recommended \n\nprior to initiating nilotinib therapy and as clinically indicated. Hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia \n\nmust be corrected prior to Tasigna administration and should be monitored periodically during \n\ntherapy. \n\n \n\nSudden death \n\n \n\nUncommon cases (0.1 to 1%) of sudden deaths have been reported in patients with imatinib-resistant \n\nor intolerant CML in chronic phase or accelerated phase with a past medical history of cardiac disease \n\nor significant cardiac risk factors. Co-morbidities in addition to the underlying malignancy were also \n\nfrequently present as were concomitant medicinal products. Ventricular repolarisation abnormalities \n\nmay have been contributory factors. No cases of sudden death were reported in the Phase III study in \n\nnewly diagnosed patients with CML in chronic phase. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nFluid retention and oedema \n\n \n\nSevere forms of drug-related fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pulmonary oedema, and \n\npericardial effusion were uncommonly (0.1 to 1%) observed in a Phase III study of newly diagnosed \n\nCML patients. Similar events were observed in post-marketing reports. Unexpected, rapid weight gain \n\nshould be carefully investigated. If signs of severe fluid retention appear during treatment with \n\nnilotinib, the aetiology should be evaluated and patients treated accordingly (see section 4.2 for \n\ninstructions on managing non-haematological toxicities). \n\n \n\nCardiovascular events \n\n \n\nCardiovascular events were reported in a randomised Phase III study in newly diagnosed CML \n\npatients and observed in post-marketing reports. In this clinical study with a median on-therapy time \n\nof 60.5 months, Grade 3-4 cardiovascular events included peripheral arterial occlusive disease (1.4% \n\nand 1.1% at 300 mg and 400 mg nilotinib twice daily, respectively), ischaemic heart disease (2.2% and \n\n6.1% at 300 mg and 400 mg nilotinib twice daily, respectively) and ischaemic cerebrovascular events \n\n(1.1% and 2.2% at 300 mg and 400 mg nilotinib twice daily, respectively). Patients should be advised \n\nto seek immediate medical attention if they experience acute signs or symptoms of cardiovascular \n\nevents. The cardiovascular status of patients should be evaluated and cardiovascular risk factors \n\nmonitored and actively managed during nilotinib therapy according to standard guidelines. \n\nAppropriate therapy should be prescribed to manage cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.2 for \n\ninstructions on managing non-haematological toxicities). \n\n \n\nHepatitis B reactivation \n\n \n\nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus has occurred after these \n\npatients received BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or \n\nfulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome. \n\n \n\nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with nilotinib. Experts in liver \n\ndisease and in the treatment of hepatitis B should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients \n\nwith positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who test \n\npositive for HBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with nilotinib \n\nshould be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and \n\nfor several months following termination of therapy (see section 4.8). \n \n\nSpecial monitoring of adult Ph+ CML patients in chronic phase who have achieved a sustained deep \n\nmolecular response \n\n \n\nEligibility for discontinuation of treatment \n\nEligible patients who are confirmed to express the typical BCR-ABL transcripts, e13a2/b2a2 or \n\ne14a2/b3a2, can be considered for treatment discontinuation. Patients must have typical BCR-ABL \n\ntranscripts to allow quantitation of BCR-ABL, evaluation of the depth of molecular response, and \n\ndetermination of a possible loss of molecular remission after discontinuation of treatment with \n\nnilotinib. \n\n \n\nMonitoring of patients who have discontinued therapy \n\nFrequent monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels in patients eligible for treatment discontinuation \n\nmust be performed with a quantitative diagnostic test validated to measure molecular response levels \n\nwith a sensitivity of at least MR4.5 (BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.0032% IS). BCR-ABL transcript levels must \n\nbe assessed prior to and during treatment discontinuation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 \n\nLoss of major molecular response (MMR=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.1%IS) in CML patients who received \n\nnilotinib as first- or second-line therapy, or confirmed loss of MR4 (two consecutive measures \nseparated by at least 4 weeks showing loss of MR4 (MR4=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.01%IS)) in CML \n\npatients who received nilotinib as second-line therapy will trigger treatment re-initiation within \n4 weeks of when loss of remission is known to have occurred. Molecular relapse can occur during the \n\ntreatment-free phase, and long-term outcome data are not yet available. It is therefore crucial to \n\nperform frequent monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels and complete blood count with differential \n\nin order to detect possible loss of remission (see section 4.2). For patients who fail to achieve MMR \n\nafter three months of treatment re-initiation, BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation testing should be \n\nperformed. \n\n \n\nLaboratory tests and monitoring \n\n \n\nBlood lipids \n\nIn a Phase III study in newly diagnosed CML patients, 1.1% of the patients treated with 400 mg \n\nnilotinib twice daily showed a Grade 3-4 elevation in total cholesterol; no Grade 3-4 elevations were \n\nhowever observed in the 300 mg twice daily dose group (see section 4.8). It is recommended that the \n\nlipid profiles be determined before initiating treatment with nilotinib, assessed at month 3 and 6 after \n\ninitiating therapy and at least yearly during chronic therapy (see section 4.2). If a HMG-CoA reductase \n\ninhibitor (a lipid-lowering agent) is required, please refer to section 4.5 before initiating treatment \n\nsince certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are also metabolised by the CYP3A4 pathway. \n\n \n\nBlood glucose \n\nIn a Phase III study in newly diagnosed CML patients, 6.9% and 7.2% of the patients treated with \n\n400 mg nilotinib and 300 mg nilotinib twice daily, respectively, showed a Grade 3-4 elevation in \n\nblood glucose. It is recommended that the glucose levels be assessed before initiating treatment with \n\nTasigna and monitored during treatment, as clinically indicated (see section 4.2). If test results warrant \n\ntherapy, physicians should follow their local standards of practice and treatment guidelines. \n\n \n\nInteractions with other medicinal products \n\n \n\nThe administration of Tasigna with agents that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (including, but not \n\nlimited to, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir) should \n\nbe avoided. Should treatment with any of these agents be required, it is recommended that nilotinib \n\ntherapy be interrupted if possible (see section 4.5). If transient interruption of treatment is not possible, \n\nclose monitoring of the individual for prolongation of the QT interval is indicated (see sections 4.2, \n\n4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of nilotinib with medicinal products that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., \n\nphenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. John’s Wort) is likely to reduce exposure \n\nto nilotinib to a clinically relevant extent. Therefore, in patients receiving nilotinib, co-administration \n\nof alternative therapeutic agents with less potential for CYP3A4 induction should be selected (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\nFood effect \n\n \n\nThe bioavailability of nilotinib is increased by food. Tasigna must not be taken in conjunction with \n\nfood (see sections 4.2 and 4.5) and should be taken 2 hours after a meal. No food should be consumed \n\nfor at least one hour after the dose is taken. Grapefruit juice and other foods that are known to inhibit \n\nCYP3A4 should be avoided. For patients who are unable to swallow hard capsules, the content of each \n\nhard capsule may be dispersed in one teaspoon of apple sauce and should be taken immediately. Not \n\nmore than one teaspoon of apple sauce and no food other than apple sauce must be used (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n10 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment has a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib. Single dose \n\nadministration of 200 mg of nilotinib resulted in increases in AUC of 35%, 35% and 19% in subjects \n\nwith mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to a control group of \n\nsubjects with normal hepatic function. The predicted steady-state Cmax of nilotinib showed an increase \n\nof 29%, 18% and 22%, respectively. Clinical studies have excluded patients with alanine transaminase \n\n(ALT) and/or aspartate transaminase (AST) >2.5 (or >5, if related to disease) times the upper limit of \n\nthe normal range and/or total bilirubin >1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range. Metabolism of \n\nnilotinib is mainly hepatic. Patients with hepatic impairment might therefore have increased exposure \n\nto nilotinib and should be treated with caution (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nSerum lipase \n\n \n\nElevation in serum lipase has been observed. Caution is recommended in patients with previous \n\nhistory of pancreatitis. In case lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, nilotinib \n\ntherapy should be interrupted and appropriate diagnostic measures considered to exclude pancreatitis. \n\n \n\nTotal gastrectomy \n\n \n\nThe bioavailability of nilotinib might be reduced in patients with total gastrectomy (see section 5.2). \n\nMore frequent follow-up of these patients should be considered. \n\n \n\nTumour lysis syndrome \n\n \n\nDue to possible occurrence of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) correction of clinically significant \n\ndehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiating nilotinib \n\ntherapy (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nLactose \n\n \n\nTasigna hard capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \n\nthe Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nLaboratory abnormalities of mild to moderate transient elevations of aminotransferases and total \n\nbilirubin have been observed in children at a higher frequency than in adults, indicating a higher risk \n\nof hepatotoxicity in the paediatric population (see section 4.8). Liver function (bilirubin and hepatic \n\ntransaminases levels) should be monitored monthly or as clinically indicated. Elevations of bilirubin \n\nand hepatic transaminases should be managed by withholding nilotinib temporarily, dose reduction \n\nand/or discontinuation of nilotinib (see section 4.2). The long-term effects of prolonged treatment with \n\nnilotinib in paediatric patients are unknown. In a study in the CML paediatric population, growth \n\nretardation has been documented in patients treated with nilotinib (see section 4.8). Close monitoring \n\nof growth in paediatric patients under nilotinib treatment is recommended. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nTasigna may be given in combination with haematopoietic growth factors such as erythropoietin or \n\ngranulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) if clinically indicated. It may be given with \n\nhydroxyurea or anagrelide if clinically indicated. \n\n \n\nNilotinib is mainly metabolised in the liver with CYP3A4 expected to be the main contributor to the \n\noxidative metabolism. Nilotinib is also a substrate for the multi-drug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein \n\n(P-gp). Therefore, absorption and subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed nilotinib may be \n\ninfluenced by substances that affect CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSubstances that may increase nilotinib serum concentrations \n\n \nConcomitant administration of nilotinib with imatinib (a substrate and moderator of P-gp and \n\nCYP3A4), had a slight inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. The AUC of imatinib was increased \n\nby 18% to 39%, and the AUC of nilotinib was increased by 18% to 40%. These changes are unlikely \n\nto be clinically important. \n\n \n\nThe exposure to nilotinib in healthy subjects was increased 3-fold when co-administered with the \n\nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole. Concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, \n\nincluding ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin, and telithromycin, \n\nshould therefore be avoided (see section 4.4). Increased exposure to nilotinib might also be expected \n\nwith moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Alternative concomitant medicinal products with no or minimal \n\nCYP3A4 inhibition should be considered. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may decrease nilotinib serum concentrations \n\n \nRifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, decreases nilotinib Cmax by 64% and reduces nilotinib AUC by \n\n80%. Rifampicin and nilotinib should not be used concomitantly. \n\n \n\nThe concomitant administration of other medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 (e.g. phenytoin, \n\ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. John’s Wort) is likewise likely to reduce exposure to nilotinib to \n\na clinically relevant extent. In patients for whom CYP3A4 inducers are indicated, alternative agents \n\nwith less enzyme induction potential should be selected. \n\n \n\nNilotinib has pH dependent solubility, with lower solubility at higher pH. In healthy subjects receiving \n\nesomeprazole at 40 mg once daily for 5 days, gastric pH was markedly increased, but nilotinib \n\nabsorption was only decreased modestly (27% decrease in Cmax and 34% decrease in AUC0-∞). \n\nNilotinib may be used concurrently with esomeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as needed. \n\n \n\nIn a healthy subjects study, no significant change in nilotinib pharmacokinetics was observed when a \n\nsingle 400 mg dose of nilotinib was administered 10 hours after and 2 hours before famotidine. \n\nTherefore, when the concurrent use of a H2 blocker is necessary, it may be administered \n\napproximately 10 hours before and approximately 2 hours after the dose of Tasigna. \n\n \n\nIn the same study as above, administration of an antacid (aluminium hydroxide/magnesium \n\nhydroxide/simethicone) 2 hours before or after a single 400 mg dose of nilotinib also did not alter \n\nnilotinib pharmacokinetics. Therefore, if necessary, an antacid may be administered approximately \n\n2 hours before or approximately 2 hours after the dose of Tasigna. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may have their systemic concentration altered by nilotinib \n\n \n\nIn vitro, nilotinib is a relatively strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and \n\nUGT1A1, with Ki value being lowest for CYP2C9 (Ki=0.13 microM). \n\n \n\nA single-dose drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers with 25 mg warfarin, a sensitive \n\nCYP2C9 substrate, and 800 mg nilotinib did not result in any changes in warfarin pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters or warfarin pharmacodynamics measured as prothrombin time (PT) and international \n\nnormalised ratio (INR). There are no steady-state data. This study suggests that a clinically meaningful \n\ndrug-drug interaction between nilotinib and warfarin is less likely up to a dose of 25 mg of warfarin. \n\nDue to lack of steady-state data, control of warfarin pharmacodynamic markers (INR or PT) following \n\ninitiation of nilotinib therapy (at least during the first 2 weeks) is recommended. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\nIn CML patients, nilotinib administered at 400 mg twice daily for 12 days increased the systemic \n\nexposure (AUC and Cmax) of oral midazolam (a substrate of CYP3A4) 2.6-fold and 2.0-fold, \n\nrespectively. Nilotinib is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. As a result, the systemic exposure of other \n\nmedicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) \n\nmay be increased when co-administered with nilotinib. Appropriate monitoring and dose adjustment \n\nmay be necessary for medicinal products that are CYP3A4 substrates and have a narrow therapeutic \n\nindex (including but not limited to alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, \n\nsirolimus and tacrolimus) when co-administered with nilotinib. \n\n \n\nAnti-arrhythmic medicinal products and other substances that may prolong the QT interval \n\n \n\nNilotinib should be used with caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of the QT \n\ninterval, including those patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products such as amiodarone, \n\ndisopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol or other medicinal products that may lead to QT \n\nprolongation such as chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone and \n\nmoxifloxacin (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFood interactions \n\n \n\nThe absorption and bioavailability of nilotinib are increased if it is taken with food, resulting in a \n\nhigher serum concentration (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). Grapefruit juice and other foods that are \n\nknown to inhibit CYP3A4 should be avoided. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use highly effective contraception during treatment with \n\nnilotinib and for up to two weeks after ending treatment. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of nilotinib in pregnant women. Studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Tasigna should not be used during \n\npregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with nilotinib. If it is used \n\nduring pregnancy, the patient must be informed of the potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nIf a woman who is being treated with nilotinib is considering pregnancy, treatment discontinuation \n\nmay be considered based on the eligibility criteria for discontinuing treatment as described in \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4. There is a limited amount of data on pregnancies in patients while attempting \n\ntreatment-free remission (TFR). If pregnancy is planned during the TFR phase, the patient must be \n\ninformed of a potential need to re-initiate nilotinib treatment during pregnancy (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether nilotinib is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological data in animals \n\nhave shown excretion of nilotinib in milk (see section 5.3). Since a risk to the newborns/infants cannot \n\nbe excluded, women should not breast-feed during Tasigna treatment and for 2 weeks after the last \n\ndose. \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nAnimal studies did not show an effect on fertility in male and female rats (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nTasigna has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, it is \n\nrecommended that patients experiencing dizziness, fatigue, visual impairment or other undesirable \n\neffects with a potential impact on the ability to drive or use machines safely should refrain from these \n\nactivities as long as the undesirable effects persist (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe data described below reflect exposure to nilotinib in a total of 737 adult patients from a \n\nrandomised Phase III study in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase treated at the \n\nrecommended dose of 300 mg twice daily (n=279) and from an open-label multicentre Phase II study \n\nin adult patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML in chronic phase (n=321) and accelerated \n\nphase (n=137) treated at the recommended dose of 400 mg twice daily. Safety information from two \n\nTasigna treatment discontinuation studies is also provided. \n\n \n\nIn adult patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase \n\nThe median duration of exposure was 60.5 months (range 0.1-70.8 months). \n\n \n\nThe most frequent (≥10%) non-haematological adverse reactions were rash, pruritus, headache, \n\nnausea, fatigue, alopecia, myalgia and upper abdominal pain. Most of these adverse reactions were \n\nmild to moderate in severity. Constipation, dry skin, asthenia, muscle spasms, diarrhoea, arthralgia, \n\nabdominal pain, vomiting and peripheral oedema were observed less commonly (<10% and ≥5%) \n\nwere of mild to moderate severity, manageable and generally did not require dose reduction. \n\n \n\nTreatment-emergent haematological toxicities include myelosuppression: thrombocytopenia (18%), \n\nneutropenia (15%) and anaemia (8%). Biochemical adverse drug reactions include alanine \n\naminotransferase increased (24%), hyperbilirubinaemia (16%), aspartate aminotransferase increased \n\n(12%), lipase increased (11%), blood bilirubin increased (10%), hyperglycaemia (4%), \n\nhypercholesterolaemia (3%) and hypertriglyceridaemia (<1%). Pleural and pericardial effusions, \n\nregardless of causality, occurred in 2% and <1% of patients, respectively, receiving nilotinib 300 mg \n\ntwice daily. Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, regardless of causality, was reported in 3% of these \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nThe change from baseline in mean time-averaged QTcF interval at steady state was 6 msec. No patient \n\nhad an absolute QTcF >500 msec while on the study medicinal product. QTcF increase from baseline \n\nexceeding 60 msec was observed in <1% of patients while on the study medicinal product. No sudden \n\ndeaths or episodes of torsade de pointes (transient or sustained) were observed. No decrease from \n\nbaseline in mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was observed at any time during treatment. \n\nNo patient had a LVEF of <45% during treatment nor an absolute reduction in LVEF of more than \n\n15%. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation due to adverse drug reactions was observed in 10% of patients. \n\n \n\nIn adult patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML in chronic phase and accelerated phase \n\nThe data described below reflect exposure to nilotinib in 458 adult patients in an open-label \n\nmulticentre Phase II study in patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML in chronic phase \n\n(n=321) and accelerated phase (n=137) treated at the recommended dose of 400 mg twice daily. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n14 \n\nThe most frequent (≥10%) non-haematological drug-related adverse events were rash, pruritus, \n\nnausea, fatigue, headache, vomiting, myalgia, constipation and diarrhoea. Most of these adverse events \n\nwere mild to moderate in severity. Alopecia, muscle spasms, decreased appetite, arthralgia, abdominal \n\npain, bone pain, peripheral oedema, asthenia, upper abdominal pain, dry skin, erythema and pain in \n\nextremity were observed less commonly (<10% and ≥5%) and have been of mild to moderate severity \n\n(Grade 1 or 2). Discontinuation due to adverse drug reactions was observed in 16% of chronic phase \n\nand 10% of accelerated phase patients. \n\n \n\nTreatment-emergent haematological toxicities include myelosuppression: thrombocytopenia (31%), \n\nneutropenia (17%) and anaemia (14%).

\n\nAfter discontinuation of nilotinib therapy within the framework of attempting TFR, patients may \n\nexperience musculoskeletal symptoms more frequently than before treatment discontinuation, e.g., \n\nmyalgia, pain in extremity, arthralgia, bone pain, spinal pain or musculoskeletal pain. \n\n \n\nIn a Phase II clinical study with newly diagnosed adult patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase \n\n(N=190), musculoskeletal symptoms were reported within a year of Tasigna discontinuation in 24.7% \n\nversus 16.3% within the previous year on nilotinib treatment. \n\n \n\nIn a Phase II clinical study with adult patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase on nilotinib treatment \n\nand previously treated with imatinib (N=126), musculoskeletal symptoms were reported within a year \n\nof discontinuation in 42.1% versus 14.3% within the previous year on nilotinib treatment. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nSudden death \n\nUncommon cases (0.1 to 1%) of sudden deaths have been reported in Tasigna clinical trials and/or \n\ncompassionate use programs in patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML in chronic phase or \n\naccelerated phase with a past medical history of cardiac disease or significant cardiac risk factors (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatitis B reactivation \n\nHepatitis B reactivation has been reported in association with BCR-ABL TKIs. Some cases resulted in \n\nacute hepatic failure or fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nPost-marketing experience \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions have been derived from post-marketing experience with Tasigna via \nspontaneous case reports, literature cases, expanded access programmes, and clinical studies other \n\nthan the global registration trials. Since these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of \n\nuncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal \n\nrelationship to nilotinib exposure. \n\n \n\nFrequency very common: Growth retardation has been documented in paediatric patients treated with \n\nnilotinib. \n\n \n\nFrequency rare: Cases of tumour lysis syndrome have been reported in patients treated with nilotinib. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety of nilotinib in paediatric patients (from 2 to <18 years of age) with Philadelphia \n\nchromosome positive CML in chronic phase (n=69) has been investigated in two studies (see \n\nsection 5.1). In paediatric patients, the frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions observed have \n\nbeen generally consistent with those observed in adults, with the exception of the laboratory \n\nabnormalities hyperbilirubinaemia (Grade 3/4: 13.0%) and transaminase elevation (AST Grade 3/4: \n\n1.4%, ALT Grade 3/4: 8.7%) which were reported at a higher frequency than in adult patients. \n\nBilirubin and hepatic transaminase levels should be monitored during treatment (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nGrowth retardation in paediatric population \n\nIn an interim analysis in a study in the CML paediatric population, with a median exposure of \n\n33 months in each cohort (newly diagnosed and resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML-CP), growth \n\nretardation (crossing two main percentile lines from baseline) has been documented in 12.1%. Close \n\nmonitoring of growth in paediatric patients under nilotinib treatment is recommended (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nIsolated reports of intentional overdose with nilotinib were reported, where an unspecified number of \n\nTasigna hard capsules were ingested in combination with alcohol and other medicinal products. Events \n\nincluded neutropenia, vomiting and drowsiness. No ECG changes or hepatotoxicity were reported. \n\nOutcomes were reported as recovered. \n\n \n\nIn the event of overdose, the patient should be observed and appropriate supportive treatment given. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE08 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nNilotinib is a potent inhibitor of the ABL tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein both in \n\ncell lines and in primary Philadelphia-chromosome positive leukaemia cells. The substance binds with \n\nhigh affinity to the ATP-binding site in such a manner that it is a potent inhibitor of wild-type \n\nBCR-ABL and maintains activity against 32/33 imatinib-resistant mutant forms of BCR-ABL. As a \n\nconsequence of this biochemical activity, nilotinib selectively inhibits the proliferation and induces \n\napoptosis in cell lines and in primary Philadelphia-chromosome positive leukaemia cells from CML \n\npatients. In murine models of CML, as a single agent nilotinib reduces tumour burden and prolongs \n\nsurvival following oral administration. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nNilotinib has little or no effect against the majority of other protein kinases examined, including Src, \n\nexcept for the PDGF, KIT and Ephrin receptor kinases, which it inhibits at concentrations within the \n\nrange achieved following oral administration at therapeutic doses recommended for the treatment of \n\nCML (see Table 6). \n\n \n\nTable 6 Kinase profile of nilotinib (phosphorylation IC50 nM) \n\n \n\nBCR-ABL PDGFR KIT \n\n20 69 210 \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nClinical studies in newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase \n\nAn open-label, multicentre, randomised Phase III study was conducted to determine the efficacy of \n\nnilotinib versus imatinib in 846 adult patients with cytogenetically confirmed newly diagnosed \n\nPhiladelphia chromosome positive CML in the chronic phase. Patients were within six months of \n\ndiagnosis and were previously untreated, with the exception of hydroxyurea and/or anagrelide. \n\nPatients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive either nilotinib 300 mg twice daily (n=282), nilotinib \n\n400 mg twice daily (n=281) or imatinib 400 mg once daily (n=283). Randomisation was stratified by \n\nSokal risk score at the time of diagnosis. \n\n \n\nBaseline characteristics were well balanced between the three treatment arms. Median age was \n\n47 years in both nilotinib arms and 46 years in the imatinib arm, with 12.8%, 10.0% and 12.4% of \n\npatients were ≥65 years of age in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, nilotinib 400 mg twice daily and \n\nimatinib 400 mg once daily treatment arms, respectively. There were slightly more male than female \n\npatients (56.0%, 62.3% and 55.8%, in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 400 mg twice daily and \n\nimatinib 400 mg once daily arm, respectively). More than 60% of all patients were Caucasian and 25% \n\nof all patients were Asian. \n\n \n\nThe primary data analysis time point was when all 846 patients completed 12 months of treatment (or \n\ndiscontinued earlier). Subsequent analyses reflect when patients completed 24, 36, 48, 60 and \n\n72 months of treatment (or discontinued earlier). The median time on treatment was approximately \n\n70 months in the nilotinib treatment groups and 64 months in the imatinib group. The median actual \n\ndose intensity was 593 mg/day for nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 772 mg/day for nilotinib 400 mg \n\ntwice daily and 400 mg/day for imatinib 400 mg once daily. This study is ongoing. \n\n  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months. MMR was \n\ndefined as ≤0.1% BCR-ABL/ABL% by international scale (IS) measured by RQ-PCR, which \n\ncorresponds to a ≥3 log reduction of BCR-ABL transcript from standardised baseline. The MMR rate \n\nat 12 months was statistically significantly higher for nilotinib 300 mg twice daily compared to \n\nimatinib 400 mg once daily (44.3% versus 22.3%, p<0.0001). The rate of MMR at 12 months, was \n\nalso statistically significantly higher for nilotinib 400 mg twice daily compared to imatinib 400 mg \n\nonce daily (42.7% versus 22.3%, p<0.0001). \n\n \n\nThe rates of MMR at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were 8.9%, 33.0%, 43.3% and 44.3% for nilotinib 300 mg \n\ntwice daily, 5.0%, 29.5%, 38.1% and 42.7% for nilotinib 400 mg twice daily and 0.7%, 12.0%, 18.0% \n\nand 22.3% for imatinib 400 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nThe MMR rate at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 months is presented in Table 7. \n\n \n\nTable 7 MMR rate \n\n \n\n Nilotinib \n\n300 mg twice daily \n\nn=282 \n\n(%) \n\nNilotinib \n\n400 mg twice daily \n\nn=281 \n\n(%) \n\nImatinib \n\n400 mg once daily \n\nn=283 \n\n(%) \n\nMMRat 12 months    \n\nResponse (95% CI) 44.31 (38.4; 50.3) 42.71 (36.8; 48.7) 22.3 (17.6; 27.6) \n\nMMR at 24 months    \n\nResponse (95% CI) 61.71 (55.8; 67.4) 59.11 (53.1; 64.9) 37.5 (31.8; 43.4) \n\nMMR at 36 months2    \n\nResponse (95% CI) 58.51 (52.5; 64.3) 57.31 (51.3; 63.2) 38.5 (32.8; 44.5) \n\nMMR at 48 months3    \n\nResponse (95% CI) 59.91 (54.0; 65.7) 55.2 (49.1; 61.1) 43.8 (38.0; 49.8) \n\nMMR at 60 months4    \n\nResponse (95% CI) 62.8 (56.8; 68.4) 61.2 (55.2; 66.9) 49.1 (43.2; 55.1) \n\nMMR at 72 months5    \n\nResponse (95% CI) 52.5 (46.5; 58.4) 57.7 (51.6; 63.5) 41.7 (35.9; 47.7) \n1 Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test p-value for response rate (vs. imatinib 400 mg) <0.0001 \n2 Only patients who were in MMR at a specific time point are included as responders for that time \n\npoint.

Efficacy was based on 321 CP patients and 137 AP patients \n\nenrolled. Median duration of treatment was 561 days for CP patients and 264 days for AP patients (see \n\nTable 10). Tasigna was administered on a continuous basis (twice daily 2 hours after a meal and with \n\nno food for at least one hour after administration) unless there was evidence of inadequate response or \n\ndisease progression. The dose was 400 mg twice daily and dose escalation to 600 mg twice daily was \n\nallowed. \n\n \n\nTable 10 Duration of exposure with nilotinib \n\n \n\n Chronic phase \n\nn=321 \n\nAccelerated phase \n\nn=137 \n\nMedian duration of therapy in days \n\n(25th-75th percentiles) \n\n561 \n\n(196-852) \n\n264 \n\n(115-595) \n\n \n\nResistance to imatinib included failure to achieve a complete haematological response (by 3 months), \n\ncytogenetic response (by 6 months) or major cytogenetic response (by 12 months) or progression of \n\ndisease after a previous cytogenetic or haematological response. Imatinib intolerance included patients \n\nwho discontinued imatinib because of toxicity and were not in major cytogenetic response at time of \n\nstudy entry. \n\n \n\nOverall, 73% of patients were imatinib-resistant, while 27% were imatinib-intolerant.

Of the 190 patients \n\nwho entered the TFR phase, 98 patients (51.6% [95% CI: 44.2, 58.9]) were in MMR at 48 weeks. \n\n \n\nEighty-eight patients (46.3%) discontinued the TFR phase due to loss of MMR, and 1 (0.5%), \n\n1 (0.5%), and 3 patients (1.6%) due to death from unknown cause, physician decision and subject \n\ndecision, respectively. Among these 88 patients, 86 patients restarted nilotinib treatment and 2 patients \n\npermanently discontinued the study. Eighty-five of these 86 patients (98.8%) regained MMR, (one \n\npatient discontinued study permanently due to subject decision) and 76 patients (88.4%) regained \n\nMR4.5 by the time of the cut-off date. \n\n \n\nThe Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimated median time on nilotinib treatment to regain MMR and MR4.5 was \n\n7.9 weeks (95% CI: 5.1, 8.0) and 13.1 weeks (95% CI: 12.3, 15.7), respectively. The KM estimated \n\nMMR and MR4.5 rates at 24 weeks of re-initiation were 98.8 % (95% CI: 94.2, 99.9) and 90.9 % \n\n(95% CI: 83.2, 96.0), respectively. \n\n \n\nThe KM estimate of median treatment-free survival (TFS) has not yet been reached (Figure 4); 99 of \n\n190 patients (52.1%) did not have a TFS event. \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nFigure 4 Kaplan-Meier estimate of treatment-free survival after start of TFR (full analysis \n\nset) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nPat   Evt   Cen \n190   91     99 \n\nCensored observations \n\nT\nre\n\na\ntm\n\ne\nn\n\nt-\nfr\n\ne\ne\n\n S\nu\n\nrv\niv\n\na\nl \n\n(%\n) \n\n100 \n\n90 \n\n80 \n\n70 \n\n60 \n\n50 \n\n40 \n\n30 \n\n20 \n\n10 \n\n0 \n\nTime since TFR (weeks) \n\n \n\n96 84 72 60 48 0 \n\n0:9\n1 \n\n1:9\n1 \n\n12:9\n1 \n\n38:9\n1 \n\n90:8\n9 \n\n190:\n0 \n\nAt risk : Events \n \n\n36 \n\n108:8\n1 \n\n24 \n\n120:7\n0 \n\n12 \n\n165:2\n5 \n\n\n\n31 \n\nTreatment discontinuation in adult CML patients in chronic phase who have achieved a sustained \n\ndeep molecular response on nilotinib treatment following prior imatinib therapy \n\nIn an open-label, single-arm study, 163 adult patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase taking tyrosine \n\nkinase inhibitors (TKIs) for ≥3 years (imatinib as initial TKI therapy for more than 4 weeks without \n\ndocumented MR4.5 on imatinib at the time of switch to nilotinib, then switched to nilotinib for at least \n\ntwo years), and who achieved MR4.5 on nilotinib treatment as measured with the MolecularMD \n\nMRDx BCR-ABL test were enrolled to continue nilotinib treatment for additional 52 weeks (nilotinib \n\nconsolidation phase). 126 of 163 patients (77.3%) entered the TFR phase after achieving a sustained \n\ndeep molecular response during the consolidation phase, defined by the following criterion: \n\n- The 4 last quarterly assessments (taken every 12 weeks) showed no confirmed loss of MR4.5 \n(BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.0032% IS) during one year. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients without confirmed loss of MR4.0 or loss of MMR \n\nwithin 48 weeks following treatment discontinuation. Of the 126 patients who entered the TFR phase, \n\n73 patients (57.9%, [95% CI: 48.8, 66.7]) had no loss of MMR, no confirmed loss of MR4.0, and no \n\nre-initiation of nilotinib within 48 weeks. \n\n \n\nAmong the 53 patients who discontinued the TFR phase due to confirmed loss of MR4.0 or loss of \n\nMMR, 51 patients restarted nilotinib and 2 patients discontinued the study.

A total of 69 paediatric patients (from 2 to <18 years of age) with either \n\nnewly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase (n=25) or imatinib/dasatinib resistant or \n\nimatinib-intolerant Ph+ CML in chronic phase (n=44) received nilotinib treatment at a dose of \n\n230 mg/m2 twice daily, rounded to the nearest 50 mg dose (to a maximum single dose of 400 mg). \n\n \n\nIn the pooled CML patient population, the median actual dose intensity was 435.5 mg/m2/day (range: \n\n149 to 517 mg/m2/day), and the median relative dose intensity was 94.7% (range: 32 to 112%). Forty \n\npatients (58.0%) had relative dose intensity superior to 90%. The median time on treatment with \n\nnilotinib was 13.80 months (range: 0.7-30.9 months). \n\n \n\nIn the resistant or intolerant CML patients, the major molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL/ABL \n\n≤0.1% IS) rate was 40.9% (95% CI: 26.3, 56.8) at 12 cycles, with 18 patients being in MMR. In the \n\nnewly diagnosed CML patients, the MMR rate was 60.0% (95% CI: 38.7, 78.9) at 12 cycles, with \n\n15 patients achieving MMR. In resistant or intolerant CML patients, the cumulative MMR rate was \n\n47.7% by cycle 12. In newly diagnosed CML patients, the cumulative MMR rate was 64.0% by \n\ncycle 12. \n\n \n\nAmong the 21 resistant or intolerant CML patients who were in MMR at any time on treatment, the \n\nmedian time to first MMR was 2.76 months (95% CI: 0.03, 5.55). For the 17 newly diagnosed CML \n\npatients who achieved MMR, the median time to first MMR was 5.55 months (95% CI: 5.52, 5.75). \n\n \n\nAmong resistant or intolerant CML patients, the percentage of patients who achieved BCR-ABL/ABL \n\n≤0.01% IS (MR4.0) by the cut-off date was 11.4%, while 4.5% of the patients achieved \n\nBCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.0032% IS (MR4.5). Among newly diagnosed patients, the percentage of patients \n\nwho achieved MR4.0 was 32%, while 28.0% achieved MR4.5. \n\n \n\nNone of the 21 resistant or intolerant CML patients who were in MMR on treatment had confirmed \n\nloss of MMR. Among the 17 newly diagnosed CML patients who achieved MMR, one patient had \n\nconfirmed loss of MMR (the patient lost CHR due to an increase in basophil count, however did not \n\nprogress to AP/BC). \n\n \n\nOne resistant or intolerant CML patient progressed to AP/BC after about 10 months on treatment. \n\n \n\nNo deaths were reported on treatment or after treatment discontinuation in both studies. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nPeak concentrations of nilotinib are reached 3 hours after oral administration. Nilotinib absorption \n\nfollowing oral administration was approximately 30%. The absolute bioavailability of nilotinib has not \n\nbeen determined. As compared to an oral drink solution (pH of 1.2 to 1.3), relative bioavailability of \n\nnilotinib capsule is approximately 50%. In healthy volunteers, Cmax and area under the serum \n\nconcentration-time curve (AUC) of nilotinib are increased by 112% and 82%, respectively, compared \n\nto fasting conditions when Tasigna is given with food. Administration of Tasigna 30 minutes or \n\n2 hours after food increased bioavailability of nilotinib by 29% or 15%, respectively (see sections 4.2, \n\n4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nNilotinib absorption (relative bioavailability) might be reduced by approximately 48% and 22% in \n\npatients with total gastrectomy and partial gastrectomy, respectively. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n33 \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe blood-to-plasma ratio of nilotinib is 0.71. Plasma protein binding is approximately 98% on the \n\nbasis of in vitro experiments. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nMain metabolic pathways identified in healthy subjects are oxidation and hydroxylation. Nilotinib is \n\nthe main circulating component in the serum. None of the metabolites contribute significantly to the \n\npharmacological activity of nilotinib. Nilotinib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4, with possible \n\nminor contribution from CYP2C8. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nAfter a single dose of radiolabelled nilotinib in healthy subjects, more than 90% of the dose was \n\neliminated within 7 days, mainly in faeces (94% of the dose). Unchanged nilotinib accounted for 69% \n\nof the dose. \n\n \n\nThe apparent elimination half-life estimated from the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics with daily \n\ndosing was approximately 17 hours. Inter-patient variability in nilotinib pharmacokinetics was \n\nmoderate to high. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n \n\nSteady-state nilotinib exposure was dose-dependent, with less than dose-proportional increases in \n\nsystemic exposure at dose levels higher than 400 mg given as once-daily dosing. Daily systemic \n\nexposure to nilotinib with 400 mg twice-daily dosing at steady state was 35% higher than with 800 mg \n\nonce-daily dosing. Systemic exposure (AUC) of nilotinib at steady state at a dose level of 400 mg \n\ntwice daily was approximately 13.4% higher than at a dose level of 300 mg twice daily. The average \n\nnilotinib trough and peak concentrations over 12 months were approximately 15.7% and 14.8% higher \n\nfollowing 400 mg twice-daily dosing compared to 300 mg twice daily. There was no relevant increase \n\nin exposure to nilotinib when the dose was increased from 400 mg twice daily to 600 mg twice daily. \n\n \n\nSteady-state conditions were essentially achieved by day 8. An increase in serum exposure to nilotinib \n\nbetween the first dose and steady state was approximately 2-fold for daily dosing and 3.8-fold for \n\ntwice-daily dosing. \n\n \n\nBioavailability/bioequivalence studies \n\n \n\nSingle-dose administration of 400 mg nilotinib, using 2 hard capsules of 200 mg whereby the content \n\nof each hard capsule was dispersed in one teaspoon of apple sauce, was shown to be bioequivalent \n\nwith a single-dose administration of 2 intact hard capsules of 200 mg. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of nilotinib in paediatric patients at 230 mg/m2 twice daily, rounded to the \n\nnearest 50 mg dose (to a maximum single dose of 400 mg), steady-state exposure and clearance of \n\nnilotinib were found to be similar (within 2-fold) to adult patients treated with 400 mg twice daily. The \n\npharmacokinetic exposure of nilotinib following a single or multiple doses appeared to be comparable \n\nbetween paediatric patients from 2 years to <10 years and from ≥10 years to <18 years. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n34 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNilotinib has been evaluated in safety pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, \n\nreproductive toxicity, phototoxicity and carcinogenicity (rats and mice) studies. \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies \n\n \n\nNilotinib did not have effects on CNS or respiratory functions. In vitro cardiac safety studies \n\ndemonstrated a preclinical signal for QT prolongation, based upon block of hERG currents and \n\nprolongation of the action potential duration in isolated rabbit hearts by nilotinib. No effects were seen \n\nin ECG measurements in dogs or monkeys treated for up to 39 weeks or in a special telemetry study in \n\ndogs. \n\n \n\nRepeated-dose toxicity studies \n\n \n\nRepeated-dose toxicity studies in dogs of up to 4 weeks’ duration and in cynomolgus monkeys of up \n\nto 9 months’ duration revealed the liver as the primary target organ of toxicity of nilotinib. Alterations \n\nincluded increased alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activity and histopathology \n\nfindings (mainly sinusoidal cell or Kupffer cell hyperplasia/hypertrophy, bile duct hyperplasia and \n\nperiportal fibrosis). In general the changes in clinical chemistry were fully reversible after a four-week \n\nrecovery period and the histological alterations showed partial reversibility. Exposures at the lowest \n\ndose levels at which the liver effects were seen were lower than the exposure in humans at a dose of \n\n800 mg/day. Only minor liver alterations were seen in mice or rats treated for up to 26 weeks. Mainly \n\nreversible increases in cholesterol levels were seen in rats, dogs and monkeys. \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies in bacterial in vitro systems and in mammalian in vitro and in vivo systems with \n\nand without metabolic activation did not reveal any evidence for a mutagenic potential of nilotinib. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity studies \n\n \n\nIn the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, the major target organ for non-neoplastic lesions was the uterus \n\n(dilatation, vascular ectasia, endothelial cell hyperplasia, inflammation and/or epithelial hyperplasia). \n\nThere was no evidence of carcinogenicity upon administration of nilotinib at 5, 15 and 40 mg/kg/day. \n\nExposures (in terms of AUC) at the highest dose level represented approximately 2x to 3x human \n\ndaily steady-state exposure (based on AUC) to nilotinib at the dose of 800 mg/day. \n\n \n\nIn the 26-week Tg.rasH2 mouse carcinogenicity study, in which nilotinib was administered at 30, 100 \n\nand 300 mg/kg/day, skin papillomas/carcinomas were detected at 300 mg/kg, representing \n\napproximately 30 to 40 times (based on AUC) the human exposure at the maximum approved dose of \n\n800 mg/day (administered as 400 mg twice daily). The No-Observed-Effect-Level for the skin \n\nneoplastic lesions was 100 mg/kg/day, representing approximately 10 to 20 times the human exposure \n\nat the maximum approved dose of 800 mg/day (administered as 400 mg twice daily). The major target \n\norgans for non-neoplastic lesions were the skin (epidermal hyperplasia), the growing teeth \n\n(degeneration/atrophy of the enamel organ of upper incisors and inflammation of the \n\ngingiva/odontogenic epithelium of incisors) and the thymus (increased incidence and/or severity of \n\ndecreased lymphocytes). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n35 \n\nReproductive toxicity and fertility studies \n\n \n\nNilotinib did not induce teratogenicity, but did show embryo- and foetotoxicity at doses that also \n\nshowed maternal toxicity. Increased post-implantation loss was observed in both the fertility study, \n\nwhich involved treatment of both males and females, and the embryotoxicity study, which involved \n\ntreatment of females. Embryo-lethality and foetal effects (mainly decreased foetal weights, premature \n\nfusion of the facial bones (fused maxilla/zygomatic) visceral and skeletal variations) in rats and \n\nincreased resorption of foetuses and skeletal variations in rabbits were present in the embryotoxicity \n\nstudies. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, maternal exposure to nilotinib caused \n\nreduced pup body weight with associated changes in physical development parameters as well as \n\nreduced mating and fertility indices in the offspring. Exposure to nilotinib in females at \n\nNo-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Levels was generally less or equal to that in humans at 800 mg/day. \n\n \n\nNo effects on sperm count/motility or on fertility were noted in male and female rats up to the highest \n\ntested dose, approximately 5 times the recommended dosage for humans. \n\n \n\nJuvenile animal studies \n\n \n\nIn a juvenile development study, nilotinib was administered via oral gavage to juvenile rats from the \n\nfirst week post partum through young adult (day 70 post partum) at doses of 2, 6 and 20 mg/kg/day. \n\nBesides standard study parameters, evaluations of developmental landmarks, CNS effects, mating and \n\nfertility were performed. Based on a reduction in body weight in both genders and a delayed preputial \n\nseparation in males (which may be associated with the reduction in weight), the \n\nNo-Observed-Effect-Level in juvenile rats was considered to be 6 mg/kg/day. The juvenile animals \n\ndid not exert increased sensitivity to nilotinib relative to adults. In addition, the toxicity profile in \n\njuvenile rats was comparable to that observed in adult rats. \n\n \n\nPhototoxicity studies \n\n \n\nNilotinib was shown to absorb light in the UV-B and UV-A range, is distributed into the skin and \n\nshowed a phototoxic potential in vitro, but no effects have been observed in vivo. Therefore the risk \n\nthat nilotinib causes photosensitisation in patients is considered very low. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nTasigna 150 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nOne hard capsule contains 150 mg nilotinib (as hydrochloride monohydrate). \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect \n\n \n\nOne hard capsule contains 117.08 mg lactose monohydrate. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nHard capsule. \n\n \n\nWhite to yellowish powder in red opaque hard gelatin capsules, size 1 with black axial imprint \n\n“NVR/BCR”. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nTasigna is indicated for the treatment of: \n\n- adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic \nmyelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the chronic phase, \n\n- paediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive CML in chronic phase with \nresistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and the treatment of patients \n\nwith CML. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nTreatment should be continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity \n\noccurs. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed the patient should not take an additional dose, but take the usual prescribed next \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nPosology for Philadelphia chromosome positive CML adult patients \n\nThe recommended dose is 300 mg twice daily. \n\n \n\nFor a dose of 400 mg once daily (see dose adjustments below), 200 mg hard capsules are available. \n\n \n\nPosology for Philadelphia chromosome positive CML paediatric patients \n\nDosing in paediatric patients is individualised and is based on body surface area (mg/m2). The \n\nrecommended dose of nilotinib is 230 mg/m2 twice daily, rounded to the nearest 50 mg dose (to a \n\nmaximum single dose of 400 mg) (see Table 1). Different strengths of Tasigna hard capsules can be \n\ncombined to attain the desired dose. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nThere is no experience with treatment of paediatric patients below 2 years of age. There are no data in \n\nnewly diagnosed paediatric patients below 10 years of age and limited data in imatinib-resistant or \n\nintolerant paediatric patients below 6 years of age. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Paediatric dosing scheme of nilotinib 230 mg/m2 twice daily \n\n \n\nBody Surface Area \n\n(BSA) \n\nDose in mg \n\n(twice daily) \n\nUp to 0.32 m2 50 mg \n\n0.33 – 0.54 m2 100 mg \n\n0.55 – 0.76 m2 150 mg \n\n0.77 – 0.97 m2 200 mg \n\n0.98 – 1.19 m2 250 mg \n\n1.20 – 1.41 m2 300 mg \n\n1.42 – 1.63 m2 350 mg \n\n≥1.64 m2 400 mg \n\n \n\nAdult Philadelphia chromosome positive CML patients in chronic phase who have been treated with \n\nnilotinib as first-line therapy and who achieved a sustained deep molecular response (MR4.5) \n\nDiscontinuation of treatment may be considered in eligible adult Philadelphia chromosome positive \n\n(Ph+) CML patients in chronic phase who have been treated with nilotinib at 300 mg twice daily for a \n\nminimum of 3 years if a deep molecular response is sustained for a minimum of one year immediately \n\nprior to discontinuation of therapy. Discontinuation of nilotinib therapy should be initiated by a \n\nphysician experienced in the treatment of patients with CML (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nEligible patients who discontinue nilotinib therapy must have their BCR-ABL transcript levels and \n\ncomplete blood count with differential monitored monthly for one year, then every 6 weeks for the \n\nsecond year, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels must be \n\nperformed with a quantitative diagnostic test validated to measure molecular response levels on the \n\nInternational Scale (IS) with a sensitivity of at least MR4.5 (BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.0032% IS). \n\n \n\nFor patients who lose MR4 (MR4=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.01%IS) but not MMR \n\n(MMR=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.1%IS) during the treatment-free phase, BCR-ABL transcript levels should \n\nbe monitored every 2 weeks until BCR-ABL levels return to a range between MR4 and MR4.5. \n\nPatients who maintain BCR-ABL levels between MMR and MR4 for a minimum of 4 consecutive \n\nmeasurements can return to the original monitoring schedule. \n\n \n\nPatients who lose MMR must re-initiate treatment within 4 weeks of when loss of remission is known \n\nto have occurred. Nilotinib therapy should be re-initiated at 300 mg twice daily or at a reduced dose \n\nlevel of 400 mg once daily if the patient had a dose reduction prior to discontinuation of therapy. \n\nPatients who re-initiate nilotinib therapy should have their BCR-ABL transcript levels monitored \n\nmonthly until MMR is re-established and every 12 weeks thereafter (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nDose adjustments or modifications \n\nTasigna may need to be temporarily withheld and/or dose reduced for haematological toxicities \n\n(neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) that are not related to the underlying leukaemia (see Table 2). \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nTable 2 Dose adjustments for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nAdult patients with \n\nnewly diagnosed \n\nchronic phase CML at \n\n300 mg twice daily \n\nANC* <1.0 x 109/l and/or \n\nplatelet counts <50 x 109/l \n\n1. Treatment with nilotinib must be \ninterrupted and blood count \n\nmonitored. \n\n2. Treatment must be resumed within \n2 weeks at prior dose if ANC \n\n>1.0 x 109/l and/or platelets \n\n>50 x 109/l. \n\n3. If blood counts remain low, a dose \nreduction to 400 mg once daily may \n\nbe required. \n\nPaediatric patients with \n\nnewly diagnosed \n\nchronic phase CML at \n\n230 mg/m2 twice daily \n\nand \n\nimatinib-resistant or \n\nintolerant CML in \n\nchronic phase at \n\n230 mg/m2 twice daily \n\nANC* <1.0 x 109/l and/or \n\nplatelet counts <50 x 109/l \n\n1. Treatment with nilotininb must be \ninterrupted and blood count \n\nmonitored. \n\n2. Treatment must be resumed within \n2 weeks at prior dose if ANC \n\n>1.5 x 109/l and/or platelets \n\n>75 x 109/l. \n\n3. If blood counts remain low, a dose \nreduction to 230 mg/m2 once daily \n\nmay be required. \n\n4. If event occurs after dose reduction, \nconsider discontinuing treatment. \n\n*ANC = absolute neutrophil count \n\n \n\nIf clinically significant moderate or severe non-haematological toxicity develops, dosing should be \n\ninterrupted, and patients should be monitored and treated accordingly. If the prior dose was 300 mg \n\ntwice daily in adult patients or 230 mg/m2 twice daily in paediatric patients, dosing may be resumed at \n\n400 mg once daily in adult patients and at 230 mg/m2 once daily in paediatric patients once the \n\ntoxicity has resolved. If the prior dose was 400 mg once daily in adult patients or 230 mg/m2 once \n\ndaily in paediatric patients, treatment should be discontinued. If clinically appropriate, re-escalation of \n\nthe dose to 300 mg twice daily in adult patients or to 230 mg/m2 twice daily in paediatric patients \n\nshould be considered. \n\n \n\nElevated serum lipase: For Grade 3-4 serum lipase elevations, doses in adult patients should be \n\nreduced to 400 mg once daily or interrupted. In paediatric patients, treatment must be interrupted until \n\nthe event returns to Grade 1. Thereafter, if the prior dose was 230 mg/m2 twice daily, treatment can \n\nbe resumed at 230 mg/m2 once daily. If the prior dose was 230 mg/m2 once daily, treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued. Serum lipase levels should be tested monthly or as clinically indicated (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nElevated bilirubin and hepatic transaminases: For Grade 3-4 bilirubin and hepatic transaminase \n\nelevations in adult patients, doses should be reduced to 400 mg once daily or interrupted. For \n\nGrade 2 bilirubin elevations or Grade 3 hepatic transaminase elevations in paediatric patients, \n\ntreatment must be interrupted until the levels return to Grade 1. Thereafter, if the prior dose was \n\n230 mg/m2 twice daily, treatment can be resumed at 230 mg/m2 once daily. If the prior dose was \n\n230 mg/m2 once daily, and recovery to Grade 1 takes longer than 28 days, treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued. Bilirubin and hepatic transaminases levels should be tested monthly or as clinically \n\nindicated. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nApproximately 12% of subjects in the clinical study were 65 years of age or over. No major \n\ndifferences were observed for safety and efficacy in patients ≥65 years of age as compared to adults \n\naged 18 to 65 years. \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nRenal impairment \n\nClinical studies have not been performed in patients with impaired renal function. \n\nSince nilotinib and its metabolites are not renally excreted, a decrease in total body clearance is not \n\nanticipated in patients with renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nHepatic impairment has a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib. Dose adjustment is not \n\nconsidered necessary in patients with hepatic impairment. However, patients with hepatic impairment \n\nshould be treated with caution (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nIn clinical studies, patients with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease (e.g., recent myocardial \n\ninfarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia) were \n\nexcluded. Caution should be exercised in patients with relevant cardiac disorders (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIncreases in total serum cholesterol levels have been reported with nilotinib therapy (see section 4.4). \n\nLipid profiles should be determined prior to initiating nilotinib therapy, assessed at month 3 and 6 \n\nafter initiating therapy and at least yearly during chronic therapy. \n\n \n\nIncreases in blood glucose levels have been reported with nilotinib therapy (see section 4.4). Blood \n\nglucose levels should be assessed prior to initiating nilotinib therapy and monitored during treatment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Tasigna in paediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive CML \n\nin chronic phase from 2 to less than 18 years of age have been established (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and \n\n5.2). There is no experience in paediatric patients below 2 years of age or in paediatric patients with \n\nPhiladelphia chromosome positive CML in accelerated phase or blast crisis. There are no data in \n\nnewly diagnosed paediatric patients below 10 years of age and limited data in imatinib-resistant or \n\nintolerant paediatric patients below 6 years of age. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nTasigna should be taken twice daily approximately 12 hours apart and must not be taken with food. \n\nThe hard capsules should be swallowed whole with water. No food should be consumed for 2 hours \n\nbefore the dose is taken and for at least one hour after. \n\n \n\nFor patients who are unable to swallow hard capsules, the content of each hard capsule may be \n\ndispersed in one teaspoon of apple sauce (puréed apple) and should be taken immediately. Not more \n\nthan one teaspoon of apple sauce and no food other than apple sauce must be used (see sections 4.4 \n\nand 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nMyelosuppression \n\n \n\nTreatment with nilotinib is associated with (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria \n\ngrade 3-4) thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia. Complete blood counts should be performed \n\nevery two weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. \n\nMyelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed by withholding Tasigna temporarily \n\nor dose reduction (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nQT prolongation \n\n \n\nNilotinib has been shown to prolong cardiac ventricular repolarisation as measured by the QT interval \n\non the surface ECG in a concentration-dependent manner in adult and paediatric patients. \n\n \n\nIn the Phase III study in patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase receiving 300 mg \n\nnilotinib twice daily, the change from baseline in mean time-averaged QTcF interval at steady state \n\nwas 6 msec. No patient had a QTcF >480 msec. No episodes of torsade de pointes were observed. \n\n \n\nIn a healthy volunteer study with exposures that were comparable to the exposures observed in \n\npatients, the time-averaged mean placebo-subtracted QTcF change from baseline was 7 msec \n\n(CI ± 4 msec). No subject had a QTcF >450 msec. Additionally, no clinically relevant arrhythmias \n\nwere observed during the conduct of the trial. In particular, no episodes of torsade de pointes (transient \n\nor sustained) were observed. \n\n \n\nSignificant prolongation of the QT interval may occur when nilotinib is inappropriately taken with \n\nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or medicinal products with a known potential to prolong the QT \n\ninterval, and/or food (see section 4.5). The presence of hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia may \n\nfurther enhance this effect. Prolongation of the QT interval may expose patients to the risk of fatal \n\noutcome. \n\n \n\nTasigna should be used with caution in patients who have or who are at significant risk of developing \n\nprolongation of QTc, such as those: \n\n- with congenital long QT prolongation \n- with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease including recent myocardial infarction, \n\ncongestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia. \n\n- taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products or other substances that lead to QT prolongation. \n \n\nClose monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable and a baseline ECG is recommended \n\nprior to initiating nilotinib therapy and as clinically indicated. Hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia \n\nmust be corrected prior to Tasigna administration and should be monitored periodically during \n\ntherapy. \n\n \n\nSudden death \n\n \n\nUncommon cases (0.1 to 1%) of sudden deaths have been reported in patients with imatinib-resistant \n\nor intolerant CML in chronic phase or accelerated phase with a past medical history of cardiac disease \n\nor significant cardiac risk factors. Co-morbidities in addition to the underlying malignancy were also \n\nfrequently present as were concomitant medicinal products. Ventricular repolarisation abnormalities \n\nmay have been contributory factors. No cases of sudden death were reported in the Phase III study in \n\nnewly diagnosed patients with CML in chronic phase. \n\n \n\nFluid retention and oedema \n\n \n\nSevere forms of drug-related fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pulmonary oedema, and \n\npericardial effusion were uncommonly (0.1 to 1%) observed in a Phase III study of newly diagnosed \n\nCML patients. Similar events were observed in post-marketing reports. Unexpected, rapid weight gain \n\nshould be carefully investigated. If signs of severe fluid retention appear during treatment with \n\nnilotinib, the aetiology should be evaluated and patients treated accordingly (see section 4.2 for \n\ninstructions on managing non-haematological toxicities). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n43 \n\nCardiovascular events \n\n \n\nCardiovascular events were reported in a randomised Phase III study in newly diagnosed CML \n\npatients and observed in post-marketing reports. In this clinical study with a median on-therapy time \n\nof 60.5 months, Grade 3-4 cardiovascular events included peripheral arterial occlusive disease (1.4% \n\nand 1.1% at 300 mg and 400 mg nilotinib twice daily, respectively), ischaemic heart disease (2.2% and \n\n6.1% at 300 mg and 400 mg nilotinib twice daily, respectively) and ischaemic cerebrovascular events \n\n(1.1% and 2.2% at 300 mg and 400 mg nilotinib twice daily, respectively). Patients should be advised \n\nto seek immediate medical attention if they experience acute signs or symptoms of cardiovascular \n\nevents. The cardiovascular status of patients should be evaluated and cardiovascular risk factors \n\nmonitored and actively managed during nilotinib therapy according to standard guidelines. \n\nAppropriate therapy should be prescribed to manage cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.2 for \n\ninstructions on managing non-haematological toxicities). \n\n \n\nHepatitis B reactivation \n\n \n\nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus has occurred after these \n\npatients received BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or \n\nfulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome. \n\n \n\nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with nilotinib. Experts in liver \n\ndisease and in the treatment of hepatitis B should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients \n\nwith positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who test \n\npositive for HBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with nilotinib \n\nshould be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and \n\nfor several months following termination of therapy (see section 4.8). \n \n\nSpecial monitoring of adult Ph+ CML patients in chronic phase who have achieved a sustained deep \n\nmolecular response \n\n \n\nEligibility for discontinuation of treatment \n\nEligible patients who are confirmed to express the typical BCR-ABL transcripts, e13a2/b2a2 or \n\ne14a2/b3a2, can be considered for treatment discontinuation. Patients must have typical BCR-ABL \n\ntranscripts to allow quantitation of BCR-ABL, evaluation of the depth of molecular response, and \n\ndetermination of a possible loss of molecular remission after discontinuation of treatment with \n\nnilotinib. \n\n \n\nMonitoring of patients who have discontinued therapy \n\nFrequent monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels in patients eligible for treatment discontinuation \n\nmust be performed with a quantitative diagnostic test validated to measure molecular response levels \n\nwith a sensitivity of at least MR4.5 (BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.0032% IS). BCR-ABL transcript levels must \n\nbe assessed prior to and during treatment discontinuation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nLoss of major molecular response (MMR=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.1%IS) will trigger treatment \n\nre-initiation within 4 weeks of when loss of remission is known to have occurred. Molecular relapse \n\ncan occur during the treatment-free phase, and long-term outcome data are not yet available. It is \n\ntherefore crucial to perform frequent monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels and complete blood \n\ncount with differential in order to detect possible loss of remission (see section 4.2). For patients who \n\nfail to achieve MMR after three months of treatment re-initiation, BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation \n\ntesting should be performed. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n44 \n\nLaboratory tests and monitoring \n\n \n\nBlood lipids \n\nIn a Phase III study in newly diagnosed CML patients, 1.1% of the patients treated with 400 mg \n\nnilotinib twice daily showed a Grade 3-4 elevation in total cholesterol; no Grade 3-4 elevations were \n\nhowever observed in the 300 mg twice daily dose group (see section 4.8). It is recommended that the \n\nlipid profiles be determined before initiating treatment with nilotinib, assessed at month 3 and 6 after \n\ninitiating therapy and at least yearly during chronic therapy (see section 4.2). If a HMG-CoA reductase \n\ninhibitor (a lipid-lowering agent) is required, please refer to section 4.5 before initiating treatment \n\nsince certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are also metabolised by the CYP3A4 pathway. \n\n \n\nBlood glucose \n\nIn a Phase III study in newly diagnosed CML patients, 6.9% and 7.2% of the patients treated with \n\n400 mg nilotinib and 300 mg nilotinib twice daily, respectively, showed a Grade 3-4 elevation in \n\nblood glucose. It is recommended that the glucose levels be assessed before initiating treatment with \n\nTasigna and monitored during treatment, as clinically indicated (see section 4.2). If test results warrant \n\ntherapy, physicians should follow their local standards of practice and treatment guidelines. \n\n \n\nInteractions with other medicinal products \n\n \n\nThe administration of Tasigna with agents that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (including, but not \n\nlimited to, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir) should \n\nbe avoided. Should treatment with any of these agents be required, it is recommended that nilotinib \n\ntherapy be interrupted if possible (see section 4.5). If transient interruption of treatment is not possible, \n\nclose monitoring of the individual for prolongation of the QT interval is indicated (see sections 4.2, \n\n4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of nilotinib with medicinal products that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., \n\nphenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. John’s Wort) is likely to reduce exposure \n\nto nilotinib to a clinically relevant extent. Therefore, in patients receiving nilotinib, co-administration \n\nof alternative therapeutic agents with less potential for CYP3A4 induction should be selected (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\nFood effect \n\n \n\nThe bioavailability of nilotinib is increased by food. Tasigna must not be taken in conjunction with \n\nfood (see sections 4.2 and 4.5) and should be taken 2 hours after a meal. No food should be consumed \n\nfor at least one hour after the dose is taken. Grapefruit juice and other foods that are known to inhibit \n\nCYP3A4 should be avoided. For patients who are unable to swallow hard capsules, the content of each \n\nhard capsule may be dispersed in one teaspoon of apple sauce and should be taken immediately. Not \n\nmore than one teaspoon of apple sauce and no food other than apple sauce must be used (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment has a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib. Single dose \n\nadministration of 200 mg of nilotinib resulted in increases in AUC of 35%, 35% and 19% in subjects \n\nwith mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to a control group of \n\nsubjects with normal hepatic function. The predicted steady-state Cmax of nilotinib showed an increase \n\nof 29%, 18% and 22%, respectively. Clinical studies have excluded patients with alanine transaminase \n\n(ALT) and/or aspartate transaminase (AST) >2.5 (or >5, if related to disease) times the upper limit of \n\nthe normal range and/or total bilirubin >1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range. Metabolism of \n\nnilotinib is mainly hepatic. Patients with hepatic impairment might therefore have increased exposure \n\nto nilotinib and should be treated with caution (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nSerum lipase \n\n \n\nElevation in serum lipase has been observed. Caution is recommended in patients with previous \n\nhistory of pancreatitis. In case lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, nilotinib \n\ntherapy should be interrupted and appropriate diagnostic measures considered to exclude pancreatitis. \n\n \n\nTotal gastrectomy \n\n \n\nThe bioavailability of nilotinib might be reduced in patients with total gastrectomy (see section 5.2). \n\nMore frequent follow-up of these patients should be considered. \n\n \n\nTumour lysis syndrome \n\n \n\nDue to possible occurrence of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) correction of clinically significant \n\ndehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiating nilotinib \n\ntherapy (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nLactose \n\n \n\nTasigna hard capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \n\nthe Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nLaboratory abnormalities of mild to moderate transient elevations of aminotransferases and total \n\nbilirubin have been observed in children at a higher frequency than in adults, indicating a higher risk \n\nof hepatotoxicity in the paediatric population (see section 4.8). Liver function (bilirubin and hepatic \n\ntransaminases levels) should be monitored monthly or as clinically indicated. Elevations of bilirubin \n\nand hepatic transaminases should be managed by withholding nilotinib temporarily, dose reduction \n\nand/or discontinuation of nilotinib (see section 4.2). The long-term effects of prolonged treatment with \n\nnilotinib in paediatric patients are unknown. In a study in the CML paediatric population, growth \n\nretardation has been documented in patients treated with nilotinib (see section 4.8). Close monitoring \n\nof growth in paediatric patients under nilotinib treatment is recommended. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nTasigna may be given in combination with haematopoietic growth factors such as erythropoietin or \n\ngranulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) if clinically indicated. It may be given with \n\nhydroxyurea or anagrelide if clinically indicated. \n\n \n\nNilotinib is mainly metabolised in the liver with CYP3A4 expected to be the main contributor to the \n\noxidative metabolism. Nilotinib is also a substrate for the multi-drug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein \n\n(P-gp). Therefore, absorption and subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed nilotinib may be \n\ninfluenced by substances that affect CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may increase nilotinib serum concentrations \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of nilotinib with imatinib (a substrate and moderator of P-gp and \n\nCYP3A4), had a slight inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. The AUC of imatinib was increased \n\nby 18% to 39%, and the AUC of nilotinib was increased by 18% to 40%. These changes are unlikely \n\nto be clinically important. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n46 \n\nThe exposure to nilotinib in healthy subjects was increased 3-fold when co-administered with the \n\nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole. Concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, \n\nincluding ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin, and telithromycin, \n\nshould therefore be avoided (see section 4.4). Increased exposure to nilotinib might also be expected \n\nwith moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Alternative concomitant medicinal products with no or minimal \n\nCYP3A4 inhibition should be considered. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may decrease nilotinib serum concentrations \n\n \n\nRifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, decreases nilotinib Cmax by 64% and reduces nilotinib AUC by \n\n80%. Rifampicin and nilotinib should not be used concomitantly. \n\n \n\nThe concomitant administration of other medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, \n\ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. John’s Wort) is likewise likely to reduce exposure to nilotinib to \n\na clinically relevant extent. In patients for whom CYP3A4 inducers are indicated, alternative agents \n\nwith less enzyme induction potential should be selected. \n\n \n\nNilotinib has pH dependent solubility, with lower solubility at higher pH. In healthy subjects receiving \n\nesomeprazole at 40 mg once daily for 5 days, gastric pH was markedly increased, but nilotinib \n\nabsorption was only decreased modestly (27% decrease in Cmax and 34% decrease in AUC0-∞). \n\nNilotinib may be used concurrently with esomeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as needed. \n\n \n\nIn a healthy subjects study, no significant change in nilotinib pharmacokinetics was observed when a \n\nsingle 400 mg dose of nilotinib was administered 10 hours after and 2 hours before famotidine. \n\nTherefore, when the concurrent use of a H2 blocker is necessary, it may be administered \n\napproximately 10 hours before and approximately 2 hours after the dose of Tasigna. \n\n \n\nIn the same study as above, administration of an antacid (aluminium hydroxide/magnesium \n\nhydroxide/simethicone) 2 hours before or after a single 400 mg dose of nilotinib also did not alter \n\nnilotinib pharmacokinetics. Therefore, if necessary, an antacid may be administered approximately \n\n2 hours before or approximately 2 hours after the dose of Tasigna. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may have their systemic concentration altered by nilotinib \n\n \n\nIn vitro, nilotinib is a relatively strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and \n\nUGT1A1, with Ki value being lowest for CYP2C9 (Ki=0.13 microM). \n\n \n\nA single-dose drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers with 25 mg warfarin, a sensitive \n\nCYP2C9 substrate, and 800 mg nilotinib did not result in any changes in warfarin pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters or warfarin pharmacodynamics measured as prothrombin time (PT) and international \n\nnormalised ratio (INR). There are no steady-state data. This study suggests that a clinically meaningful \n\ndrug-drug interaction between nilotinib and warfarin is less likely up to a dose of 25 mg of warfarin. \n\nDue to lack of steady-state data, control of warfarin pharmacodynamic markers (INR or PT) following \n\ninitiation of nilotinib therapy (at least during the first 2 weeks) is recommended. \n\n \n\nIn CML patients, nilotinib administered at 400 mg twice daily for 12 days increased the systemic \n\nexposure (AUC and Cmax) of oral midazolam (a substrate of CYP3A4) 2.6-fold and 2.0-fold, \n\nrespectively. Nilotinib is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. As a result, the systemic exposure of other \n\nmedicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g., certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) \n\nmay be increased when co-administered with nilotinib. Appropriate monitoring and dose adjustment \n\nmay be necessary for medicinal products that are CYP3A4 substrates and have a narrow therapeutic \n\nindex (including but not limited to alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, \n\nsirolimus and tacrolimus) when co-administered with nilotinib. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n47 \n\nAnti-arrhythmic medicinal products and other substances that may prolong the QT interval \n\n \n\nNilotinib should be used with caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of the QT \n\ninterval, including those patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products such as amiodarone, \n\ndisopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol or other medicinal products that may lead to QT \n\nprolongation such as chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone and \n\nmoxifloxacin (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFood interactions \n\n \n\nThe absorption and bioavailability of nilotinib are increased if it is taken with food, resulting in a \n\nhigher serum concentration (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). Grapefruit juice and other foods that are \n\nknown to inhibit CYP3A4 should be avoided. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use highly effective contraception during treatment with \n\nnilotinib and for up to two weeks after ending treatment. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of nilotinib in pregnant women. Studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Tasigna should not be used during \n\npregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with nilotinib. If it is used \n\nduring pregnancy, the patient must be informed of the potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nIf a woman who is being treated with nilotinib is considering pregnancy, treatment discontinuation \n\nmay be considered based on the eligibility criteria for discontinuing treatment as described in \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4. There is a limited amount of data on pregnancies in patients while attempting \n\ntreatment-free remission (TFR). If pregnancy is planned during the TFR phase, the patient must be \n\ninformed of a potential need to re-initiate nilotinib treatment during pregnancy (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether nilotinib is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological data in animals \n\nhave shown excretion of nilotinib in milk (see section 5.3). Since a risk to the newborns/infants cannot \n\nbe excluded, women should not breast-feed during Tasigna treatment and for 2 weeks after the last \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nAnimal studies did not show an effect on fertility in male and female rats (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nTasigna has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, it is \n\nrecommended that patients experiencing dizziness, fatigue, visual impairment or other undesirable \n\neffects with a potential impact on the ability to drive or use machines safely should refrain from these \n\nactivities as long as the undesirable effects persist (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe data described below reflect exposure to nilotinib in 279 adult patients from a randomised \n\nPhase III study in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase treated with 300 mg of \n\nnilotinib twice daily. Safety information from a Tasigna treatment discontinuation study in CML \n\npatients who have been treated with nilotinib as first-line therapy is also provided. \n\n \n\nThe median duration of exposure was 60.5 months (range 0.1-70.8 months). \n\n \n\nThe most frequent (≥10%) non-haematological adverse reactions were rash, pruritus, headache, \n\nnausea, fatigue, alopecia, myalgia and upper abdominal pain. Most of these adverse reactions were \n\nmild to moderate in severity. Constipation, dry skin, asthenia, muscle spasms, diarrhoea, arthralgia, \n\nabdominal pain, vomiting and peripheral oedema were observed less commonly (<10% and ≥5%), \n\nwere of mild to moderate severity, manageable and generally did not require dose reduction. \n\n \n\nTreatment-emergent haematological toxicities include myelosuppression: thrombocytopenia (18%), \n\nneutropenia (15%) and anaemia (8%). Biochemical adverse drug reactions include alanine \n\naminotransferase increased (24%), hyperbilirubinaemia (16%), aspartate aminotransferase increased \n\n(12%), lipase increased (11%), blood bilirubin increased (10%), hyperglycaemia (4%), \n\nhypercholesterolaemia (3%) and hypertriglyceridaemia (<1%). Pleural and pericardial effusions, \n\nregardless of causality, occurred in 2% and <1% of patients, respectively, receiving nilotinib 300 mg \n\ntwice daily. Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, regardless of causality, was reported in 3% of these \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nThe change from baseline in mean time-averaged QTcF interval at steady state was 6 msec. No patient \n\nhad an absolute QTcF >500 msec while on the study medicinal product. QTcF increase from baseline \n\nexceeding 60 msec was observed in <1% of patients while on the study medicinal product. No sudden \n\ndeaths or episodes of torsade de pointes (transient or sustained) were observed. No decrease from \n\nbaseline in mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was observed at any time during treatment. \n\nNo patient had a LVEF of <45% during treatment nor an absolute reduction in LVEF of more than \n\n15%. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation due to adverse drug reactions was observed in 10% of patients. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions are ranked under heading of frequency using the following convention: very \n\ncommon (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to \n\n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

nilotinib therapy within the framework of attempting TFR, patients may \n\nexperience musculoskeletal symptoms more frequently than before treatment discontinuation, e.g., \n\nmyalgia, pain in extremity, arthralgia, bone pain, spinal pain or musculoskeletal pain. \n\n \n\nIn a Phase II clinical study with newly diagnosed adult patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase \n\n(N=190), musculoskeletal symptoms were reported within a year of Tasigna discontinuation in 24.7% \n\nversus 16.3% within the previous year on nilotinib treatment. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nHepatitis B reactivation \n\nHepatitis B reactivation has been reported in association with BCR-ABL TKIs. Some cases resulted in \n\nacute hepatic failure or fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nPost-marketing experience \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions have been derived from post-marketing experience with Tasigna via \n\nspontaneous case reports, literature cases, expanded access programmes, and clinical studies other \n\nthan the global registration trials. Since these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of \n\nuncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal \n\nrelationship to nilotinib exposure. \n\n \n\nFrequency very common: Growth retardation has been documented in paediatric patients treated with \n\nnilotinib. \n\n \n\nFrequency rare: Cases of tumour lysis syndrome have been reported in patients treated with nilotinib. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety of nilotinib in paediatric patients (from 2 to <18 years of age) with Philadelphia \n\nchromosome positive CML in chronic phase (n=69) has been investigated in two studies (see \n\nsection 5.1). In paediatric patients, the frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions observed have \n\nbeen generally consistent with those observed in adults, with the exception of the laboratory \n\nabnormalities hyperbilirubinaemia (Grade 3/4: 13.0%) and transaminase elevation (AST Grade 3/4: \n\n1.4%, ALT Grade 3/4: 8.7%) which were reported at a higher frequency than in adult patients. \n\nBilirubin and hepatic transaminase levels should be monitored during treatment (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nGrowth retardation in paediatric population \n\nIn an interim analysis in a study in the CML paediatric population, with a median exposure of \n\n33 months in each cohort (newly diagnosed and resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML-CP), growth \n\nretardation (crossing two main percentile lines from baseline) has been documented in 12.1%. Close \n\nmonitoring of growth in paediatric patients under nilotinib treatment is recommended (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n\n\n53 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nIsolated reports of intentional overdose with nilotinib were reported, where an unspecified number of \n\nTasigna hard capsules were ingested in combination with alcohol and other medicinal products. Events \n\nincluded neutropenia, vomiting and drowsiness. No ECG changes or hepatotoxicity were reported. \n\nOutcomes were reported as recovered. \n\n \n\nIn the event of overdose, the patient should be observed and appropriate supportive treatment given. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE08 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nNilotinib is a potent inhibitor of the ABL tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein both in \n\ncell lines and in primary Philadelphia-chromosome positive leukaemia cells. The substance binds with \n\nhigh affinity to the ATP-binding site in such a manner that it is a potent inhibitor of wild-type \n\nBCR-ABL and maintains activity against 32/33 imatinib-resistant mutant forms of BCR-ABL. As a \n\nconsequence of this biochemical activity, nilotinib selectively inhibits the proliferation and induces \n\napoptosis in cell lines and in primary Philadelphia-chromosome positive leukaemia cells from CML \n\npatients. In murine models of CML, as a single agent nilotinib reduces tumour burden and prolongs \n\nsurvival following oral administration. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nNilotinib has little or no effect against the majority of other protein kinases examined, including Src, \n\nexcept for the PDGF, KIT and Ephrin receptor kinases, which it inhibits at concentrations within the \n\nrange achieved following oral administration at therapeutic doses recommended for the treatment of \n\nCML (see Table 6). \n\n \n\nTable 6 Kinase profile of nilotinib (phosphorylation IC50 nM) \n\n \n\nBCR-ABL PDGFR KIT \n\n20 69 210 \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nClinical studies in newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase \n\nAn open-label, multicentre, randomised Phase III study was conducted to determine the efficacy of \n\nnilotinib versus imatinib in 846 adult patients with cytogenetically confirmed newly diagnosed \n\nPhiladelphia chromosome positive CML in the chronic phase. Patients were within six months of \n\ndiagnosis and were previously untreated, with the exception of hydroxyurea and/or anagrelide. \n\nPatients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive either nilotinib 300 mg twice daily (n=282), nilotinib \n\n400 mg twice daily (n=281) or imatinib 400 mg once daily (n=283). Randomisation was stratified by \n\nSokal risk score at the time of diagnosis. \n\n \n\nBaseline characteristics were well balanced between the three treatment arms. Median age was \n\n47 years in both nilotinib arms and 46 years in the imatinib arm, with 12.8%, 10.0% and 12.4% of \n\npatients were ≥65 years of age in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, nilotinib 400 mg twice daily and \n\nimatinib 400 mg once daily treatment arms, respectively. There were slightly more male than female \n\npatients (56.0%, 62.3% and 55.8%, in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 400 mg twice daily and \n\nimatinib 400 mg once daily arm, respectively). More than 60% of all patients were Caucasian and 25% \n\nof all patients were Asian. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nThe primary data analysis time point was when all 846 patients completed 12 months of treatment (or \n\ndiscontinued earlier). Subsequent analyses reflect when patients completed 24, 36, 48, 60 and \n\n72 months of treatment (or discontinued earlier). The median time on treatment was approximately \n\n70 months in the nilotinib treatment groups and 64 months in the imatinib group. The median actual \n\ndose intensity was 593 mg/day for nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 772 mg/day for nilotinib 400 mg \n\ntwice daily and 400 mg/day for imatinib 400 mg once daily. This study is ongoing. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months. MMR was \n\ndefined as ≤0.1% BCR-ABL/ABL% by international scale (IS) measured by RQvPCR, which \n\ncorresponds to a ≥3 log reduction of BCR-ABL transcript from standardised baseline. The MMR rate \n\nat 12 months was statistically significantly higher for nilotinib 300 mg twice daily compared to \n\nimatinib 400 mg once daily (44.3% versus 22.3%, p<0.0001). The rate of MMR at 12 months, was \n\nalso statistically significantly higher for nilotinib 400 mg twice daily compared to imatinib 400 mg \n\nonce daily (42.7% versus 22.3%, p<0.0001). \n\n \n\nThe rates of MMR at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were 8.9%, 33.0%, 43.3% and 44.3% for nilotinib 300 mg \n\ntwice daily, 5.0%, 29.5%, 38.1% and 42.7% for nilotinib 400 mg twice daily and 0.7%, 12.0%, 18.0% \n\nand 22.3% for imatinib 400 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nThe MMR rate at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 months is presented in Table 7. \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nTable 7 MMR rate \n\n \n\n Nilotinib \n\n300 mg twice daily \n\nn=282 \n\n(%) \n\nNilotinib \n\n400 mg twice daily \n\nn=281 \n\n(%) \n\nImatinib \n\n400 mg once daily \n\nn=283 \n\n(%) \n\nMMR at 12 months    \n\nResponse (95% CI) 44.31 (38.4; 50.3) 42.71 (36.8; 48.7) 22.3 (17.6; 27.6) \n\nMMR at 24 months    \n\nResponse (95% CI) 61.71 (55.8; 67.4) 59.11 (53.1; 64.9) 37.5 (31.8; 43.4) \n\nMMR at 36 months2    \n\nResponse (95% CI) 58.51 (52.5; 64.3) 57.31 (51.3; 63.2) 38.5 (32.8; 44.5) \n\nMMR at 48 months3    \n\nResponse (95% CI) 59.91 (54.0; 65.7) 55.2 (49.1; 61.1) 43.8 (38.0; 49.8) \n\nMMR at 60 months4    \n\nResponse (95% CI) 62.8 (56.8; 68.4) 61.2 (55.2; 66.9) 49.1 (43.2; 55.1) \n\nMMR at 72 months5    \n\nResponse (95% CI) 52.5 (46.5; 58.4) 57.7 (51.6; 63.5) 41.7 (35.9; 47.7) \n1 Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test p-value for response rate (vs. imatinib 400 mg) <0.0001 \n2 Only patients who were in MMR at a specific time point are included as responders for that time \n\npoint.

Of the 190 patients \n\nwho entered the TFR phase, 98 patients (51.6% [95% CI: 44.2, 58.9]) were in MMR at 48 weeks. \n\n \n\nEighty-eight patients (46.3%) discontinued the TFR phase due to loss of MMR, and 1 (0.5%), \n\n1 (0.5%), and 3 patients (1.6%) due to death from unknown cause, physician decision and subject \n\ndecision, respectively. Among these 88 patients, 86 patients restarted nilotinib treatment and 2 patients \n\npermanently discontinued the study. Eighty-five of these 86 patients (98.8%) regained MMR, (one \n\npatient discontinued study permanently due to subject decision) and 76 patients (88.4%) regained \n\nMR4.5 by the time of the cut-off date. \n\n \n\nThe Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimated median time on nilotinib treatment to regain MMR and MR4.5 was \n\n7.9 weeks (95% CI: 5.1, 8.0) and 13.1 weeks (95% CI: 12.3, 15.7), respectively.

A total of 69 paediatric patients (from 2 to <18 years of age) with either \n\nnewly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase (n=25) or imatinib/dasatinib resistant or \n\nimatinib-intolerant Ph+ CML in chronic phase (n=44) received nilotinib treatment at a dose of \n\n230 mg/m2 twice daily, rounded to the nearest 50 mg dose (to a maximum single dose of 400 mg). \n\n \n\nIn the pooled CML patient population, the median actual dose intensity was 435.5 mg/m2/day (range: \n\n149 to 517 mg/m2/day), and the median relative dose intensity was 94.7% (range: 32 to 112%). Forty \n\npatients (58.0%) had relative dose intensity superior to 90%. The median time on treatment with \n\nnilotinib was 13.80 months (range: 0.7-30.9 months). \n\n \n\nIn the resistant or intolerant CML patients, the major molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL/ABL \n\n≤0.1% IS) rate was 40.9% (95% CI: 26.3, 56.8) at 12 cycles, with 18 patients being in MMR. In the \n\nnewly diagnosed CML patients, the MMR rate was 60.0% (95% CI: 38.7, 78.9) at 12 cycles, with \n\n15 patients achieving MMR. In resistant or intolerant CML patients, the cumulative MMR rate was \n\n47.7% by cycle 12. In newly diagnosed CML patients, the cumulative MMR rate was 64.0% by \n\ncycle 12. \n\n \n\nAmong the 21 resistant or intolerant CML patients who were in MMR at any time on treatment, the \n\nmedian time to first MMR was 2.76 months (95% CI: 0.03, 5.55). For the 17 newly diagnosed CML \n\npatients who achieved MMR, the median time to first MMR was 5.55 months (95% CI: 5.52, 5.75). \n\n \n\nAmong resistant or intolerant CML patients, the percentage of patients who achieved BCR-ABL/ABL \n\n≤0.01% IS (MR4.0) by the cut-off date was 11.4%, while 4.5% of the patients achieved \n\nBCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.0032% IS (MR4.5). Among newly diagnosed patients, the percentage of patients \n\nwho achieved MR4.0 was 32%, while 28.0% achieved MR4.5. \n\n \n\nNone of the 21 resistant or intolerant CML patients who were in MMR on treatment, had confirmed \n\nloss of MMR. Among the 17 newly diagnosed CML patients who achieved MMR, one patient had \n\nconfirmed loss of MMR (the patient lost CHR due to an increase in basophil count, however, did not \n\nprogress to AP/BC). \n\n \n\nOne resistant or intolerant CML patient progressed to AP/BC after about 10 months on treatment. \n\n \n\nNo deaths were reported on treatment or after treatment discontinuation in both studies. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nPeak concentrations of nilotinib are reached 3 hours after oral administration. Nilotinib absorption \n\nfollowing oral administration was approximately 30%. The absolute bioavailability of nilotinib has not \n\nbeen determined. As compared to an oral drink solution (pH of 1.2 to 1.3), relative bioavailability of \n\nnilotinib capsule is approximately 50%. In healthy volunteers, Cmax and area under the serum \n\nconcentration-time curve (AUC) of nilotinib are increased by 112% and 82%, respectively, compared \n\nto fasting conditions when Tasigna is given with food. Administration of Tasigna 30 minutes or \n\n2 hours after food increased bioavailability of nilotinib by 29% or 15%, respectively (see sections 4.2, \n\n4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nNilotinib absorption (relative bioavailability) might be reduced by approximately 48% and 22% in \n\npatients with total gastrectomy and partial gastrectomy, respectively. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n62 \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe blood-to-plasma ratio of nilotinib is 0.71. Plasma protein binding is approximately 98% on the \n\nbasis of in vitro experiments. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nMain metabolic pathways identified in healthy subjects are oxidation and hydroxylation. Nilotinib is \n\nthe main circulating component in the serum. None of the metabolites contribute significantly to the \n\npharmacological activity of nilotinib. Nilotinib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4, with possible \n\nminor contribution from CYP2C8. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nAfter a single dose of radiolabelled nilotinib in healthy subjects, more than 90% of the dose was \n\neliminated within 7 days, mainly in faeces (94% of the dose). Unchanged nilotinib accounted for 69% \n\nof the dose. \n\n \n\nThe apparent elimination half-life estimated from the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics with daily \n\ndosing was approximately 17 hours. Inter-patient variability in nilotinib pharmacokinetics was \n\nmoderate to high. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n \n\nSteady-state nilotinib exposure was dose-dependent, with less than dose-proportional increases in \n\nsystemic exposure at dose levels higher than 400 mg given as once-daily dosing. Daily systemic \n\nexposure to nilotinib with 400 mg twice-daily dosing at steady state was 35% higher than with 800 mg \n\nonce-daily dosing. Systemic exposure (AUC) of nilotinib at steady state at a dose level of 400 mg \n\ntwice daily was approximately 13.4% higher than at a dose level of 300 mg twice daily. The average \n\nnilotinib trough and peak concentrations over 12 months were approximately 15.7% and 14.8% higher \n\nfollowing 400 mg twice daily dosing compared to 300 mg twice daily. There was no relevant increase \n\nin exposure to nilotinib when the dose was increased from 400 mg twice daily to 600 mg twice daily. \n\n \n\nSteady-state conditions were essentially achieved by day 8. An increase in serum exposure to nilotinib \n\nbetween the first dose and steady state was approximately 2-fold for daily dosing and 3.8-fold for \n\ntwice-daily dosing. \n\n \n\nBioavailability/bioequivalence studies \n\n \n\nSingle-dose administration of 400 mg nilotinib, using 2 hard capsules of 200 mg whereby the content \n\nof each hard capsule was dispersed in one teaspoon of apple sauce, was shown to be bioequivalent \n\nwith a single-dose administration of 2 intact hard capsules of 200 mg. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of nilotinib in paediatric patients at 230 mg/m2 twice daily, rounded to the \n\nnearest 50 mg dose (to a maximum single dose of 400 mg), steady-state exposure and clearance of \n\nnilotinib were found to be similar (within 2-fold) to adult patients treated with 400 mg twice daily. The \n\npharmacokinetic exposure of nilotinib following a single or multiple doses appeared to be comparable \n\nbetween paediatric patients from 2 years to <10 years and from ≥10 years to <18 years. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNilotinib has been evaluated in safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, \n\nreproductive toxicity, phototoxicity and carcinogenicity (rats and mice) studies. \n\n \n\n\n\n63 \n\nSafety pharmacology studies \n\n \n\nNilotinib did not have effects on CNS or respiratory functions. In vitro cardiac safety studies \n\ndemonstrated a preclinical signal for QT prolongation, based upon block of hERG currents and \n\nprolongation of the action potential duration in isolated rabbit hearts by nilotinib. No effects were seen \n\nin ECG measurements in dogs or monkeys treated for up to 39 weeks or in a special telemetry study in \n\ndogs. \n\n \n\nRepeated-dose toxicity studies \n\n \n\nRepeated-dose toxicity studies in dogs of up to 4 weeks’ duration and in cynomolgus monkeys of up \n\nto 9 months’ duration revealed the liver as the primary target organ of toxicity of nilotinib. Alterations \n\nincluded increased alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activity and histopathology \n\nfindings (mainly sinusoidal cell or Kupffer cell hyperplasia/hypertrophy, bile duct hyperplasia and \n\nperiportal fibrosis). In general the changes in clinical chemistry were fully reversible after a four-week \n\nrecovery period and the histological alterations showed partial reversibility. Exposures at the lowest \n\ndose levels at which the liver effects were seen were lower than the exposure in humans at a dose of \n\n800 mg/day. Only minor liver alterations were seen in mice or rats treated for up to 26 weeks. Mainly \n\nreversible increases in cholesterol levels were seen in rats, dogs and monkeys. \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies in bacterial in vitro systems and in mammalian in vitro and in vivo systems with \n\nand without metabolic activation did not reveal any evidence for a mutagenic potential of nilotinib. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity studies \n\n \n\nIn the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, the major target organ for non-neoplastic lesions was the uterus \n\n(dilatation, vascular ectasia, endothelial cell hyperplasia, inflammation and/or epithelial hyperplasia). \n\nThere was no evidence of carcinogenicity upon administration of nilotinib at 5, 15 and 40 mg/kg/day. \n\nExposures (in terms of AUC) at the highest dose level represented approximately 2x to 3x human \n\ndaily steady-state exposure (based on AUC) to nilotinib at the dose of 800 mg/day. \n\n \n\nIn the 26-week Tg.rasH2 mouse carcinogenicity study, in which nilotinib was administered at 30, 100 \n\nand 300 mg/kg/day, skin papillomas/carcinomas were detected at 300 mg/kg, representing \n\napproximately 30 to 40 times (based on AUC) the human exposure at the maximum approved dose of \n\n800 mg/day (administered as 400 mg twice daily). The No-Observed-Effect-Level for the skin \n\nneoplastic lesions was 100 mg/kg/day, representing approximately 10 to 20 times the human exposure \n\nat the maximum approved dose of 800 mg/day (administered as 400 mg twice daily). The major target \n\norgans for non-neoplastic lesions were the skin (epidermal hyperplasia), the growing teeth \n\n(degeneration/atrophy of the enamel organ of upper incisors and inflammation of the \n\ngingiva/odontogenic epithelium of incisors) and the thymus (increased incidence and/or severity of \n\ndecreased lymphocytes). \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity and fertility studies \n\n \n\nNilotinib did not induce teratogenicity, but did show embryo- and foetotoxicity at doses that also \n\nshowed maternal toxicity. Increased post-implantation loss was observed in both the fertility study, \n\nwhich involved treatment of both males and females, and the embryotoxicity study, which involved \n\ntreatment of females. Embryo-lethality and foetal effects (mainly decreased foetal weights, premature \n\nfusion of the facial bones (fused maxilla/zygomatic) visceral and skeletal variations) in rats and \n\nincreased resorption of foetuses and skeletal variations in rabbits were present in the embryotoxicity \n\nstudies. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, maternal exposure to nilotinib caused \n\nreduced pup body weight with associated changes in physical development parameters as well as \n\nreduced mating and fertility indices in the offspring. Exposure to nilotinib in females at \n\nNo-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Levels was generally less or equal to that in humans at 800 mg/day. \n\n \n\n\n\n64 \n\nNo effects on sperm count/motility or on fertility were noted in male and female rats up to the highest \n\ntested dose, approximately 5 times the recommended dosage for humans. \n\n \n\nJuvenile animal studies \n\n \n\nIn a juvenile development study, nilotinib was administered via oral gavage to juvenile rats from the \n\nfirst week post partum through young adult (day 70 post partum) at doses of 2, 6 and 20 mg/kg/day. \n\nBesides standard study parameters, evaluations of developmental landmarks, CNS effects, mating and \n\nfertility were performed. Based on a reduction in body weight in both genders and a delayed preputial \n\nseparation in males (which may be associated with the reduction in weight), the \n\nNo-Observed-Effect-Level in juvenile rats was considered to be 6 mg/kg/day. The juvenile animals \n\ndid not exert increased sensitivity to nilotinib relative to adults. In addition, the toxicity profile in \n\njuvenile rats was comparable to that observed in adult rats. \n\n \n\nPhototoxicity studies \n\n \n\nNilotinib was shown to absorb light in the UV-B and UV-A range, is distributed into the skin and \n\nshowed a phototoxic potential in vitro, but no effects have been observed in vivo. Therefore the risk \n\nthat nilotinib causes photosensitisation in patients is considered very low. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n91 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nTasigna 50 mg hard capsules \n\nnilotinib \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Tasigna is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Tasigna \n\n3. How to take Tasigna \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Tasigna \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Tasigna is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Tasigna is \nTasigna is a medicine containing an active substance called nilotinib. \n\n \n\nWhat Tasigna is used for \n\nTasigna is used to treat a type of leukaemia called Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid \n\nleukaemia (Ph-positive CML). CML is a cancer of the blood which makes the body produce too many \n\nabnormal white blood cells. \n\n \n\nTasigna is used in adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed CML or in patients with CML \n\nwho are no longer benefiting from previous treatment including imatinib. It is also used in adult and \n\npaediatric patients who experienced serious side effects with previous treatment and are not able to \n\ncontinue taking it. \n\n \n\nHow Tasigna works \n\nIn patients with CML, a change in DNA (genetic material) triggers a signal that tells the body to \n\nproduce abnormal white blood cells. Tasigna blocks this signal, and thus stops the production of these \n\ncells. \n\n \n\nMonitoring during Tasigna treatment \n\nRegular tests, including blood tests, will be performed during treatment. These tests will monitor: \n\n- the amount of blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) in the body to see \nhow Tasigna is tolerated. \n\n- pancreas and liver function in the body to see how Tasigna is tolerated. \n- the electrolytes in the body (potassium, magnesium). These are important in the functioning of \n\nthe heart. \n\n- the level of sugar and fats in the blood. \nThe heart rate will also be checked using a machine that measures electrical activity of the heart (a test \n\ncalled an “ECG”). \n\n \n\n\n\n92 \n\nYour doctor will regularly evaluate your treatment and decide whether you should continue to take \n\nTasigna. If you are told to discontinue this medicine, your doctor will continue to monitor your CML \n\nand may tell you to re-start Tasigna if your condition indicates that this is necessary. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Tasigna works or why it has been prescribed for you or your \n\nchild, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Tasigna \n\n \n\nFollow all the doctor’s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information contained \n\nin this leaflet. \n\n \n\nDo not take Tasigna \n- if you are allergic to nilotinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic, tell your doctor before taking Tasigna. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasigna: \n\n- if you have suffered prior cardiovascular events such as a heart attack, chest pain (angina), \nproblems with the blood supply to your brain (stroke) or problems with the blood flow to your \n\nleg (claudication) or if you have risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood \n\npressure (hypertension), diabetes or problems with the level of fats in your blood (lipid \n\ndisorders). \n\n- if you have a heart disorder, such as an abnormal electrical signal called “prolongation of the \nQT interval”. \n\n- if you are being treated with medicines that affect the heart beat (anti-arrhythmics) or the liver \n(see Other medicines and Tasigna). \n\n- if you suffer from lack of potassium or magnesium. \n- if you have a liver or pancreas disorder. \n- if you have symptoms such as easy bruising, feeling tired or short of breath or have experienced \n\nrepeated infections. \n\n- if you have had a surgical procedure involving the removal of the entire stomach (total \ngastrectomy). \n\n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Tasigna could \ncause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be \n\ncarefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\nIf any of these apply to you or your child, tell your doctor. \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with Tasigna \n\n- if you faint (loss of consciousness) or have an irregular heart beat while taking this medicine, \ntell your doctor immediately as this may be a sign of a serious heart condition. Prolongation of \n\nthe QT interval or an irregular heart beat may lead to sudden death. Uncommon cases of sudden \n\ndeath have been reported in patients taking Tasigna. \n\n- if you have sudden heart palpitations, severe muscle weakness or paralysis, seizures or sudden \nchanges in your thinking or level of alertness, tell your doctor immediately as this may be a \n\nsign of a fast breakdown of cancer cells called tumour lysis syndrome. Rare cases of tumour \n\nlysis syndrome have been reported in patients treated with Tasigna. \n\n- if you develop chest pain or discomfort, numbness or weakness, problems with walking or with \nyour speech, pain, discolouration or a cool feeling in a limb, tell your doctor immediately as \n\nthis may be a sign of a cardiovascular event. Serious cardiovascular events including problems \n\nwith the blood flow to the leg (peripheral arterial occlusive disease), ischaemic heart disease and \n\nproblems with the blood supply to the brain (ischaemic cerebrovascular disease) have been \n\nreported in patients taking Tasigna. Your doctor should assess the level of fats (lipids) and sugar \n\nin your blood before initiating treatment with Tasigna and during treatment. \n\n  \n\n\n\n93 \n\n- if you develop swelling of the feet or hands, generalised swelling or rapid weight gain tell your \ndoctor as these may be signs of severe fluid retention. Uncommon cases of severe fluid \n\nretention have been reported in patients treated with Tasigna. \n\nIf you are the parent of a child who is being treated with Tasigna, tell the doctor if any of the above \n\nconditions apply to your child. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nTasigna is a treatment for children and adolescents with CML. There is no experience with the use of \n\nthis medicine in children below 2 years of age. There is no experience with the use of Tasigna in \n\nnewly diagnosed children below 10 years of age and limited experience in patients below 6 years of \n\nage who are no longer benefiting from previous treatment for CML. The long-term effects of treating \n\nchildren with Tasigna for long periods of time are not known. \n\n \n\nSome children and adolescents taking Tasigna may have slower than normal growth. The doctor will \n\nmonitor growth at regular visits. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Tasigna \nTasigna may interfere with some other medicines. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This includes in particular: \n\n- anti-arrhythmics – used to treat irregular heart beat; \n- chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin - medicines \n\nthat may have an unwanted effect on the electrical activity of the heart; \n\n- ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin – used to treat \ninfections; \n\n- ritonavir – a medicine from the class “ antiproteases” used to treat HIV; \n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin – used to treat epilepsy; \n- rifampicin – used to treat tuberculosis; \n- St. John’s Wort – a herbal product used to treat depression and other conditions (also known as \n\nHypericum perforatum); \n\n- midazolam – used to relieve anxiety before surgery; \n\n- alfentanil and fentanyl – used to treat pain and as a sedative before or during surgery or medical \nprocedures; \n\n- cyclosporine, sirolimus and tacrolimus – medicines that suppress the “self-defence” ability of \nthe body and fight infections and are commonly used to prevent the rejection of transplanted \n\norgans such as the liver, heart and kidney; \n\n- dihydroergotamine and ergotamine – used to treat dementia; \n- lovastatin, simvastatin – used to treat high level of fats in blood; \n- warfarin – used to treat blood coagulation disorders (such as blood clots or thromboses); \n- astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, \n\ndihydroergotamine). \n\n \n\nThese medicines should be avoided during your treatment with Tasigna. If you are taking any of these, \n\nyour doctor might prescribe other alternative medicines. \n\n \n\nIn addition, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasigna if you are taking any antacids, which \n\nare medicines against heartburn. These medicines need to be taken separately from Tasigna: \n\n- H2 blockers, which decrease the production of acid in the stomach. H2 blockers should be taken \n\napproximately 10 hours before and approximately 2 hours after you take Tasigna; \n\n- antacids such as those containing aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and simethicone, \n\nwhich neutralise high acidity in the stomach. These antacids should be taken approximately \n\n2 hours before or approximately 2 hours after you take Tasigna. \n\n \n\nYou should also tell your doctor if you are already taking Tasigna and you are prescribed a new \n\nmedicine that you have not taken previously during Tasigna treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n94 \n\nTasigna with food and drink \nDo not take Tasigna with food. Food may enhance the absorption of Tasigna and therefore increase \n\nthe amount of Tasigna in the blood, possibly to a harmful level. Do not drink grapefruit juice or eat \ngrapefruit. It may increase the amount of Tasigna in the blood, possibly to a harmful level. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n- Tasigna is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant \nor think that you may be, tell your doctor who will discuss with you whether you can take this \n\nmedicine during your pregnancy. \n\n- Women who might get pregnant are advised to use highly effective contraception during \ntreatment and for up to two weeks after ending treatment. \n\n- Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with Tasigna and for two weeks after the \nlast dose. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nIf you experience side effects (such as dizziness or visual disorders) with a potential impact on the \n\nability to safely drive or use any tools or machines after taking this medicine, you should refrain from \n\nthese activities until the effect has disappeared. \n\n \n\nTasigna contains lactose \n\nThis medicine contains lactose (also known as milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that \n\nyou have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Tasigna \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow much Tasigna to take \n\n \n\nUse in adults \n\n- Patients newly diagnosed with CML: The recommended dose is 600 mg per day. This dose is \nachieved by taking two hard capsules of 150 mg twice a day. \n\n- Patients who are no longer benefiting from previous treatment for CML: The \nrecommended dose is 800 mg per day. This dose is achieved by taking two hard capsules of \n\n200 mg twice a day. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\n- The dose given to your child will depend on your child’s body weight and height. The doctor \nwill calculate the correct dose to use and tell you which and how many capsules of Tasigna to \n\ngive to your child. The total daily dose you give to your child must not exceed 800 mg. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may prescribe a lower dose depending on how you respond to treatment. \n\n \n\nOlder people (age 65 years and over) \n\nTasigna can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults. \n\n \n\nWhen to take Tasigna \nTake the hard capsules: \n\n- twice a day (approximately every 12 hours); \n- at least 2 hours after any food; \n- then wait 1 hour before eating again. \nIf you have questions about when to take this medicine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. Taking \n\nTasigna at the same time each day will help you remember when to take your hard capsules. \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\nHow to take Tasigna \n- Swallow the hard capsules whole with water. \n- Do not take any food together with the hard capsules. \n- Do not open the hard capsules unless you are unable to swallow them.

What Tasigna is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Tasigna is \nTasigna is a medicine containing an active substance called nilotinib. \n\n \n\nWhat Tasigna is used for \n\nTasigna is used to treat a type of leukaemia called Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid \n\nleukaemia (Ph-positive CML). CML is a cancer of the blood which makes the body produce too many \n\nabnormal white blood cells. \n\n \n\nTasigna is used in adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed CML. It is also used in \n\npaediatric patients with CML who are no longer benefiting from previous treatment including imatinib \n\nor who experienced serious side effects with previous treatment and are not able to continue taking it. \n\n \n\nHow Tasigna works \n\nIn patients with CML, a change in DNA (genetic material) triggers a signal that tells the body to \n\nproduce abnormal white blood cells. Tasigna blocks this signal, and thus stops the production of these \n\ncells. \n\n \n\nMonitoring during Tasigna treatment \n\nRegular tests, including blood tests, will be performed during treatment. These tests will monitor: \n\n- the amount of blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) in the body to see \nhow Tasigna is tolerated. \n\n- pancreas and liver function in the body to see how Tasigna is tolerated. \n- the electrolytes in the body (potassium, magnesium). These are important in the functioning of \n\nthe heart. \n\n- the level of sugar and fats in the blood. \nThe heart rate will also be checked using a machine that measures electrical activity of the heart (a test \n\ncalled an “ECG”). \n\n \n\nYour doctor will regularly evaluate your treatment and decide whether you should continue to take \n\nTasigna. If you are told to discontinue this medicine, your doctor will continue to monitor your CML \n\nand may tell you to re-start Tasigna if your condition indicates that this is necessary. \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Tasigna works or why it has been prescribed for you or your \n\nchild, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Tasigna \n\n \n\nFollow all the doctor’s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information contained \n\nin this leaflet. \n\n \n\nDo not take Tasigna \n- if you are allergic to nilotinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic, tell your doctor before taking Tasigna. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasigna: \n\n- if you have suffered prior cardiovascular events such as a heart attack, chest pain (angina), \nproblems with the blood supply to your brain (stroke) or problems with the blood flow to your \n\nleg (claudication) or if you have risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood \n\npressure (hypertension), diabetes or problems with the level of fats in your blood (lipid \n\ndisorders). \n\n- if you have a heart disorder, such as an abnormal electrical signal called “prolongation of the \nQT interval”. \n\n- if you are being treated with medicines that affect the heart beat (anti-arrhythmics) or the liver \n(see Other medicines and Tasigna). \n\n- if you suffer from lack of potassium or magnesium. \n- if you have a liver or pancreas disorder. \n- if you have symptoms such as easy bruising, feeling tired or short of breath or have experienced \n\nrepeated infections. \n\n- if you have had a surgical procedure involving the removal of the entire stomach (total \ngastrectomy). \n\n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Tasigna could \ncause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be \n\ncarefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\nIf any of these apply to you or your child, tell your doctor. \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with Tasigna \n\n- if you faint (loss of consciousness) or have an irregular heart beat while taking this medicine, \ntell your doctor immediately as this may be a sign of a serious heart condition. Prolongation of \n\nthe QT interval or an irregular heart beat may lead to sudden death. Uncommon cases of sudden \n\ndeath have been reported in patients taking Tasigna. \n\n- if you have sudden heart palpitations, severe muscle weakness or paralysis, seizures or sudden \nchanges in your thinking or level of alertness, tell your doctor immediately as this may be a \n\nsign of a fast breakdown of cancer cells called tumour lysis syndrome. Rare cases of tumour \n\nlysis syndrome have been reported in patients treated with Tasigna. \n\n- if you develop chest pain or discomfort, numbness or weakness, problems with walking or with \nyour speech, pain, discolouration or a cool feeling in a limb, tell your doctor immediately as \n\nthis may be a sign of a cardiovascular event. Serious cardiovascular events including problems \n\nwith the blood flow to the leg (peripheral arterial occlusive disease), ischaemic heart disease and \n\nproblems with the blood supply to the brain (ischaemic cerebrovascular disease) have been \n\nreported in patients taking Tasigna. Your doctor should assess the level of fats (lipids) and sugar \n\nin your blood before initiating treatment with Tasigna and during treatment. \n\n- if you develop swelling of the feet or hands, generalised swelling or rapid weight gain tell your \ndoctor as these may be signs of severe fluid retention. Uncommon cases of severe fluid \n\nretention have been reported in patients treated with Tasigna. \n\n  \n\n\n\n103 \n\nIf you are the parent of a child who is being treated with Tasigna, tell the doctor if any of the above \n\nconditions apply to your child. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nTasigna is a treatment for children and adolescents with CML. There is no experience with the use of \n\nthis medicine in children below 2 years of age. There is no experience with the use of Tasigna in \n\nnewly diagnosed children below 10 years of age and limited experience in patients below 6 years of \n\nage who are no longer benefiting from previous treatment for CML. The long-term effects of treating \n\nchildren with Tasigna for long periods of time are not known. \n\n \n\nSome children and adolescents taking Tasigna may have slower than normal growth. The doctor will \n\nmonitor growth at regular visits. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Tasigna \nTasigna may interfere with some other medicines. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This includes in particular: \n\n- anti-arrhythmics – used to treat irregular heart beat; \n- chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin - medicines \n\nthat may have an unwanted effect on the electrical activity of the heart; \n\n- ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin – used to treat \ninfections; \n\n- ritonavir – a medicine from the class “ antiproteases” used to treat HIV; \n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin – used to treat epilepsy; \n- rifampicin – used to treat tuberculosis; \n- St. John’s Wort – a herbal product used to treat depression and other conditions (also known as \n\nHypericum perforatum); \n\n- midazolam – used to relieve anxiety before surgery; \n- alfentanil and fentanyl – used to treat pain and as a sedative before or during surgery or medical \n\nprocedures; \n\n- cyclosporine, sirolimus and tacrolimus – medicines that suppress the “self-defence” ability of \nthe body and fight infections and are commonly used to prevent the rejection of transplanted \n\norgans such as the liver, heart and kidney; \n\n- dihydroergotamine and ergotamine – used to treat dementia; \n- lovastatin, simvastatin – used to treat high level of fats in blood; \n- warfarin – used to treat blood coagulation disorders (such as blood clots or thromboses); \n- astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, \n\ndihydroergotamine). \n\n \n\nThese medicines should be avoided during your treatment with Tasigna. If you are taking any of these, \n\nyour doctor might prescribe other alternative medicines. \n\n \n\nIn addition, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasigna if you are taking any antacids, which \n\nare medicines against heartburn. These medicines need to be taken separately from Tasigna: \n\n- H2 blockers, which decrease the production of acid in the stomach. H2 blockers should be taken \n\napproximately 10 hours before and approximately 2 hours after you take Tasigna; \n\n- antacids such as those containing aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and simethicone, \n\nwhich neutralise high acidity in the stomach. These antacids should be taken approximately \n\n2 hours before or approximately 2 hours after you take Tasigna. \n\n \n\nYou should also tell your doctor if you are already taking Tasigna and you are prescribed a new \n\nmedicine that you have not taken previously during Tasigna treatment. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n104 \n\nTasigna with food and drink \nDo not take Tasigna with food. Food may enhance the absorption of Tasigna and therefore increase \n\nthe amount of Tasigna in the blood, possibly to a harmful level. Do not drink grapefruit juice or eat \ngrapefruit. It may increase the amount of Tasigna in the blood, possibly to a harmful level. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n- Tasigna is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant \nor think that you may be, tell your doctor who will discuss with you whether you can take this \n\nmedicine during your pregnancy. \n\n- Women who might get pregnant are advised to use highly effective contraception during \ntreatment and for up to two weeks after ending treatment. \n\n- Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with Tasigna and for two weeks after the \nlast dose. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nIf you experience side effects (such as dizziness or visual disorders) with a potential impact on the \n\nability to safely drive or use any tools or machines after taking this medicine, you should refrain from \n\nthese activities until the effect has disappeared. \n\n \n\nTasigna contains lactose \n\nThis medicine contains lactose (also known as milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that \n\nyou have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Tasigna \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow much Tasigna to take \n\n \n\nUse in adults \n\n- The recommended dose is 600 mg per day. This dose is achieved by taking two hard capsules of \n150 mg twice a day. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\n- The dose given to your child will depend on your child’s body weight and height. The doctor \nwill calculate the correct dose to use and tell you which and how many capsules of Tasigna to \n\ngive to your child. The total daily dose you give to your child must not exceed 800 mg. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may prescribe a lower dose depending on how you respond to treatment. \n\n \n\nOlder people (age 65 years and over) \n\nTasigna can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults. \n\n \n\nWhen to take Tasigna \nTake the hard capsules: \n\n- twice a day (approximately every 12 hours); \n- at least 2 hours after any food; \n- then wait 1 hour before eating again. \nIf you have questions about when to take this medicine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What Tasigna is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Tasigna is \nTasigna is a medicine containing an active substance called nilotinib. \n\n \n\nWhat Tasigna is used for \n\nTasigna is used to treat a type of leukaemia called Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid \n\nleukaemia (Ph-positive CML). CML is a cancer of the blood which makes the body produce too many \n\nabnormal white blood cells. \n\n \n\nTasigna is used in adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed CML or in patients with CML \n\nwho are no longer benefiting from previous treatment including imatinib. It is also used in adult and \n\npaediatric patients who experienced serious side effects with previous treatment and are not able to \n\ncontinue taking it. \n\n \n\nHow Tasigna works \n\nIn patients with CML, a change in DNA (genetic material) triggers a signal that tells the body to \n\nproduce abnormal white blood cells. Tasigna blocks this signal, and thus stops the production of these \n\ncells. \n\n \n\nMonitoring during Tasigna treatment \n\nRegular tests, including blood tests, will be performed during treatment. These tests will monitor: \n\n- the amount of blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) in the body to see \nhow Tasigna is tolerated. \n\n- pancreas and liver function in the body to see how Tasigna is tolerated. \n- the electrolytes in the body (potassium, magnesium). These are important in the functioning of \n\nthe heart. \n\n- the level of sugar and fats in the blood. \nThe heart rate will also be checked using a machine that measures electrical activity of the heart (a test \n\ncalled an “ECG”). \n\n \n\n\n\n111 \n\nYour doctor will regularly evaluate your treatment and decide whether you should continue to take \n\nTasigna. If you are told to discontinue this medicine, your doctor will continue to monitor your CML \n\nand may tell you to re-start Tasigna if your condition indicates that this is necessary. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Tasigna works or why it has been prescribed for you or your \n\nchild, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Tasigna \n\n \n\nFollow all the doctor’s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information contained \n\nin this leaflet. \n\n \n\nDo not take Tasigna \n- if you are allergic to nilotinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic, tell your doctor before taking Tasigna. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasigna: \n\n- if you have suffered prior cardiovascular events such as a heart attack, chest pain (angina), \nproblems with the blood supply to your brain (stroke) or problems with the blood flow to your \n\nleg (claudication) or if you have risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood \n\npressure (hypertension), diabetes or problems with the level of fats in your blood (lipid \n\ndisorders). \n\n- if you have a heart disorder, such as an abnormal electrical signal called “prolongation of the \nQT interval”. \n\n- if you are being treated with medicines that affect the heart beat (anti-arrhythmics) or the liver \n(see Other medicines and Tasigna). \n\n- if you suffer from lack of potassium or magnesium. \n- if you have a liver or pancreas disorder. \n- if you have symptoms such as easy bruising, feeling tired or short of breath or have experienced \n\nrepeated infections. \n\n- if you have had a surgical procedure involving the removal of the entire stomach (total \ngastrectomy). \n\n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Tasigna could \ncause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be \n\ncarefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\nIf any of these apply to you or your child, tell your doctor. \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with Tasigna \n\n- if you faint (loss of consciousness) or have an irregular heart beat while taking this medicine, \ntell your doctor immediately as this may be a sign of a serious heart condition. Prolongation of \n\nthe QT interval or an irregular heart beat may lead to sudden death. Uncommon cases of sudden \n\ndeath have been reported in patients taking Tasigna. \n\n- if you have sudden heart palpitations, severe muscle weakness or paralysis, seizures or sudden \nchanges in your thinking or level of alertness, tell your doctor immediately as this may be a \n\nsign of a fast breakdown of cancer cells called tumour lysis syndrome. Rare cases of tumour \n\nlysis syndrome have been reported in patients treated with Tasigna. \n\n- if you develop chest pain or discomfort, numbness or weakness, problems with walking or with \nyour speech, pain, discolouration or a cool feeling in a limb, tell your doctor immediately as \n\nthis may be a sign of a cardiovascular event. Serious cardiovascular events including problems \n\nwith the blood flow to the leg (peripheral arterial occlusive disease), ischaemic heart disease and \n\nproblems with the blood supply to the brain (ischaemic cerebrovascular disease) have been \n\nreported in patients taking Tasigna. Your doctor should assess the level of fats (lipids) and sugar \n\nin your blood before initiating treatment with Tasigna and during treatment. \n\n  \n\n\n\n112 \n\n- if you develop swelling of the feet or hands, generalised swelling or rapid weight gain tell your \ndoctor as these may be signs of severe fluid retention. Uncommon cases of severe fluid \n\nretention have been reported in patients treated with Tasigna. \n\nIf you are the parent of a child who is being treated with Tasigna, tell the doctor if any of the above \n\nconditions apply to your child. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nTasigna is a treatment for children and adolescents with CML. There is no experience with the use of \n\nthis medicine in children below 2 years of age. There is no experience with the use of Tasigna in \n\nnewly diagnosed children below 10 years of age and limited experience in patients below 6 years of \n\nage who are no longer benefiting from previous treatment for CML. The long-term effects of treating \n\nchildren with Tasigna for long periods of time are not known. \n\n \n\nSome children and adolescents taking Tasigna may have slower than normal growth. The doctor will \n\nmonitor growth at regular visits. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Tasigna \nTasigna may interfere with some other medicines. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This includes in particular: \n\n- anti-arrhythmics – used to treat irregular heart beat; \n- chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin - medicines \n\nthat may have an unwanted effect on the electrical activity of the heart; \n\n- ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin – used to treat \ninfections; \n\n- ritonavir – a medicine from the class “ antiproteases” used to treat HIV; \n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin – used to treat epilepsy; \n- rifampicin – used to treat tuberculosis; \n- St. John’s Wort – a herbal product used to treat depression and other conditions (also known as \n\nHypericum perforatum); \n\n- midazolam – used to relieve anxiety before surgery; \n\n- alfentanil and fentanyl – used to treat pain and as a sedative before or during surgery or medical \nprocedures; \n\n- cyclosporine, sirolimus and tacrolimus – medicines that suppress the “self-defence” ability of \nthe body and fight infections and are commonly used to prevent the rejection of transplanted \n\norgans such as the liver, heart and kidney; \n\n- dihydroergotamine and ergotamine – used to treat dementia; \n- lovastatin, simvastatin – used to treat high level of fats in blood; \n- warfarin – used to treat blood coagulation disorders (such as blood clots or thromboses); \n- astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, \n\ndihydroergotamine). \n\n \n\nThese medicines should be avoided during your treatment with Tasigna. If you are taking any of these, \n\nyour doctor might prescribe other alternative medicines. \n\n \n\nIn addition, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasigna if you are taking any antacids, which \n\nare medicines against heartburn. These medicines need to be taken separately from Tasigna: \n\n- H2 blockers, which decrease the production of acid in the stomach. H2 blockers should be taken \n\napproximately 10 hours before and approximately 2 hours after you take Tasigna; \n\n- antacids such as those containing aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and simethicone, \n\nwhich neutralise high acidity in the stomach. These antacids should be taken approximately \n\n2 hours before or approximately 2 hours after you take Tasigna. \n\n \n\nYou should also tell your doctor if you are already taking Tasigna and you are prescribed a new \n\nmedicine that you have not taken previously during Tasigna treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n113 \n\nTasigna with food and drink \nDo not take Tasigna with food. Food may enhance the absorption of Tasigna and therefore increase \n\nthe amount of Tasigna in the blood, possibly to a harmful level. Do not drink grapefruit juice or eat \ngrapefruit. It may increase the amount of Tasigna in the blood, possibly to a harmful level. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n- Tasigna is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant \nor think that you may be, tell your doctor who will discuss with you whether you can take this \n\nmedicine during your pregnancy. \n\n- Women who might get pregnant are advised to use highly effective contraception during \ntreatment and for up to two weeks after ending treatment. \n\n- Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with Tasigna and for two weeks after the \nlast dose. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nIf you experience side effects (such as dizziness or visual disorders) with a potential impact on the \n\nability to safely drive or use any tools or machines after taking this medicine, you should refrain from \n\nthese activities until the effect has disappeared. \n\n \n\nTasigna contains lactose \n\nThis medicine contains lactose (also known as milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that \n\nyou have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Tasigna \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow much Tasigna to take \n\n \n\nUse in adults \n\n- The recommended dose is 800 mg per day. This dose is achieved by taking two hard capsules of \n200 mg twice a day. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\n- The dose given to your child will depend on your child’s body weight and height. The doctor \nwill calculate the correct dose to use and tell you which and how many capsules of Tasigna to \n\ngive to your child. The total daily dose you give to your child must not exceed 800 mg. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may prescribe a lower dose depending on how you respond to treatment. \n\n \n\nOlder people (age 65 years and over) \n\nTasigna can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults. \n\n \n\nWhen to take Tasigna \nTake the hard capsules: \n\n- twice a day (approximately every 12 hours); \n- at least 2 hours after any food; \n- then wait 1 hour before eating again. \nIf you have questions about when to take this medicine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
