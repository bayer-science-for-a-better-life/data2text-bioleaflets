NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRasilez 150 mg film-coated tablets \nRasilez 300 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nRasilez 150 mg film-coated tablets \nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate). \n \nRasilez 300 mg film-coated tablets \nEach film-coated tablet contains 300 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nRasilez 150 mg film-coated tablets \nLight-pink, biconvex, round tablet, imprinted \u201cIL\u201d on one side and \u201cNVR\u201d on the other side. \n \nRasilez 300 mg film-coated tablets \nLight-red, biconvex, ovaloid tablet, imprinted \u201cIU\u201d on one side and \u201cNVR\u201d on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Rasilez is 150 mg once daily. In patients whose blood pressure is not \nadequately controlled, the dose may be increased to 300 mg once daily. \n \nThe antihypertensive effect is substantially present within two weeks (85-90%) after initiating therapy \nwith 150 mg once daily. \n \nRasilez may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents with the exception of \nuse in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor \nblockers (ARB) in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR \n< 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nHepatic impairment \nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nElderly patients aged 65 years and over \nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful \nadditional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of \nelderly patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nRasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years. Rasilez should not be used in \nchildren aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure \n(see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3). The safety and efficacy of Rasilez in children aged 6 to 17 years \nhave not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. Use \nof Rasilez is not recommended in this population.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. Rasilez should be taken once a \nday, always with or always without food, preferably at the same time each day. Patients should \nestablish a convenient daily schedule of medicinal product intake and maintain a steady temporal \nrelationship with food intake. Concomitant intake with fruit juice and/or drinks containing plant \nextracts (including herbal teas) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n- History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n \n- Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n \n- Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n- The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent  \n\nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n \n- The concomitant use of Rasilez with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor(ACEI) or an \n\nangiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or \nrenal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n- Children from birth to less than 2 years (see sections 4.2 and 5.3). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \n \nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Rasilez therapy should be stopped (see section 4.8). \n \nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure (New York \nHeart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV) (see section 5.1). \n \nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with heart failure treated with furosemide or \ntorasemide (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n \nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and decreased renal function (including acute renal \nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the RAAS by combining aliskiren with an ACEI \nor an ARB is therefore not recommended. If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, \nthis should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal \nfunction, electrolytes and blood pressure. \n \nRisk of symptomatic hypotension \n \nSymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with aliskiren in the following \ncases: \n- Patients with marked volume depletion or patients with salt depletion (e.g. those receiving high \n\ndoses of diuretics) or \n- Combined use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS. \nThe volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Rasilez, or the treatment \nshould start under close medical supervision. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn clinical studies aliskiren has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal \nimpairment (serum creatinine \u2265 150 \u03bcmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and \u2265 177 \u03bcmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in \nmen and/or estimated GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or \nrenovascular hypertension. It is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR \n< 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n \nAs for other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin system, caution should be exercised \nwhen aliskiren is given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as \nhypovolaemia (e.g. due to blood loss, severe prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart \ndisease, liver disease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. Acute renal failure, reversible upon \ndiscontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in post-marketing \nexperience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be promptly \ndiscontinued. \n \nIncreases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing experience and \nthese may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by non-steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, periodic determination \nof renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is considered necessary. \n \nRenal artery stenosis \n \nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of aliskiren in patients with unilateral or bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, there is an increased risk of renal \ninsufficiency, including acute renal failure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with \naliskiren. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment \nshould be discontinued. \n \nAnaphylactic reactions and angioedema \n \nAnaphylactic reactions have been observed during treatment with aliskiren from post-marketing \nexperience (see section 4.8). Angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the \nface, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated with aliskiren. \n \nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicinal product that can cause angioedema, including \n\n\n\n5 \n\nRAAS blockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nIn post-marketing experience, angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported when \naliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs (see section 4.8). \n \nIn a post-authorisation observational study, the co-administration of aliskiren with ACEIs or ARBs \nhas been associated with an increased risk of angioedema. The mechanism of this effect has not been \nestablished. In general, dual blockade of the RAAS by combining aliskiren with an ACEI or an ARB \nis not recommended (see section \u201cDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \n(RAAS)\u201d above and also sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nSpecial caution is necessary in patients with a hypersensitivity predisposition. \n \nPatients with a history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n \nIf anaphylactic reactions or angioedema occur, treatment should be promptly discontinued and \nappropriate therapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and \nsymptoms has occurred. Patients should be informed to report to the physician any signs suggestive of \nallergic reactions, in particular difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of face, extremities, \neyes, lips or tongue. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be \nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAliskiren is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and there is a potential for aliskiren overexposure in \nchildren with an immature P-gp drug transporter system. The age at which the transporter system is \nmature cannot be determined (see sections 5.2 and 5.3). Therefore, Rasilez is contraindicated in \nchildren from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.3). The safety and efficacy of aliskiren in children aged 6 to 17 years have not \nyet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n \nP-gp potent inhibitors \nA single dose interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase \nmay be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC \nand Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of \naliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nNot recommended \n \nFruit juice and drinks containing plant extracts \nAdministration of fruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. \nCo-administration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren \nAUC and co-administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. \nCo-administration of orange or apple juice with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 62% decrease in \naliskiren AUC or in a 63% decrease in aliskiren AUC, respectively. This decrease is likely due to an \ninhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by components of \nfruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, fruit juice \n\n\n\n6 \n\nshould not be taken together with aliskiren. The effect of drinks containing plant extracts (including \nherbal teas) on the absorption of aliskiren has not been investigated. However, compounds potentially \ninhibiting organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren are widely present in \nfruits, vegetables, and many other plant products. Therefore, drinks containing plant extracts, \nincluding herbal teas, should not be taken together with aliskiren (see section 4.2) \n \nDual blockade of the RAAS with aliskiren, ARBs or ACEIs \nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the RAAS through the combined use of ACEIs, \nARBs or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, stroke, \nhyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a \nsingle RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nCaution required with concomitant use \n \nP-gp interactions \nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies (see section 5.2). Rifampicin, which is an inducer \nof P-gp, reduced aliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other inducers of \nP-gp (St. John\u2019s wort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. Although this has not been \ninvestigated for aliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates \nand P-gp inhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors \nmay increase tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site \nwill likely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n \nModerate P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted \nin a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in \nthe presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if \nthe dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest \nrecommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical studies. \nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren \ngastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised \nwhen aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors \n(clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n \nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-administration with an agent \naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, routine monitoring of potassium levels \nwould be advisable. \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \nNSAIDs may reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised \nrenal function (dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs \nmay result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is \nusually reversible. Therefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially \nin elderly patients. \n \nFurosemide and torasemide \nOral co-administration of aliskiren and furosemide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren \nbut reduced exposure to furosemide by 20-30% (the effect of aliskiren on furosemide administered \nintramuscularly or intravenously has not been investigated). After multiple doses of furosemide \n(60 mg/day) co-administered with aliskiren (300 mg/day) to patients with heart failure the urinary \nsodium excretion and the urine volume were reduced during the first 4 hours by 31% and 24%, \nrespectively, as compared to furosemide alone. The mean weight of patients concomitantly treated \n\n\n\n7 \n\nwith furosemide and 300 mg aliskiren (84.6 kg) was higher than the weight of patients treated with \nfurosemide alone (83.4 kg). Smaller changes in furosemide pharmacokinetics and efficacy were \nobserved with aliskiren 150 mg/day. \n \nThe available clinical data did not indicate that higher doses of torasemide were used after \nco-administration with aliskiren. Torasemide renal excretion is known to be mediated by organic \nanion transporters (OATs). Aliskiren is minimally excreted via the renal route, and only 0.6% of the \naliskiren dose is recovered in urine following oral administration (see section 5.2). However, since \naliskiren has been shown to be a substrate for the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 \n(OATP1A2) (see section \u201cOrganic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP\u201d below) inhibitors), there is \na potential for aliskiren to reduce plasma torasemide exposure by an interference with the absorption \nprocess. \n \nIn patients treated with both aliskiren and oral furosemide or torasemide, it is therefore recommended \nthat the effects of furosemide or torasemide be monitored when initiating and adjusting furosemide, \ntorasemide or aliskiren therapy to avoid changes in extracellular fluid volume and possible situations \nof volume overload (see section 4.4). \n \nWarfarin \nThe effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n \nFood interactions \nAlthough meals (low or high fat content) have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren \nsubstantially, the efficacy of aliskiren was shown to be similar when taken either with a light meal or \nwithout a meal (see section 4.2). The available clinical data do not suggest an additive effect of \ndifferent types of foods and/or drinks, however the potential for decreased aliskiren bioavailability \ndue to this additive effect has not been studied and therefore cannot be excluded. \n \nPharmacokinetic interaction with other medicinal products \nCompounds that have been investigated in clinical pharmacokinetic studies include acenocoumarol, \natenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and hydrochlorothiazide. No \ninteractions have been identified. \n \nCo-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (\u219328%), amlodipine (\u219129%) or cimetidine \n(\u219119%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of Rasilez. When administered with \natorvastatin, steady-state Rasilez AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-administration of Rasilez had \nno significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine pharmacokinetics. As a result no dose \nadjustment for Rasilez or these co-administered medicinal products is necessary. \n \nDigoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by Rasilez. \n \nCYP450 interactions \nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore, aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect \nP-gp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit \nP-gp can therefore be expected (see other P-gp references in section 4.5). \n \nP-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n50%. In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of Rasilez \nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John\u2019s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \nbioavailability of Rasilez. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nOrganic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \nwhen administered concomitantly (see section \u201cFruit juice and drinks containing plant extracts\u201d \nabove). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with \nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAAS, \nalsikiren should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become \npregnant and is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). Healthcare \nprofessionals prescribing any agents acting on the RAAS should counsel women of childbearing \npotential about the potential risk of these agents during pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected during \ntherapy, treatment should be discontinued accordingly. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether aliskiren/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was secreted in the \nmilk of lactating rats. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Aliskiren should not be used \nduring breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no clinical data on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRasilez has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. When driving vehicles or using \nmachines it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may occasionally occur when taking \nRasilez. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nSerious adverse reactions include anaphylactic reaction and angioedema which have been reported in \npost-marketing experience and may occur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients). The most \ncommon adverse reaction is diarrhoea. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAliskiren has been evaluated for safety in more than 7,800 patients, including over 2,300 treated for \nover 6 months, and more than 1,200 for over 1 year. The adverse reactions are ranked under heading \nof frequency, the most frequent first, using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 1 \n \nImmune system disorders \n Rare: Anaphylactic reactions, hypersensitivity reactions \nNervous system disorders \n Common: Dizziness \nEar and labyrinth disorders \n Not known: Vertigo \nCardiac disorders \n Uncommon: Palpitations, oedema peripheral \nVascular disorders \n Uncommon: Hypotension \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n Uncommon: Cough \n Not known: Dyspnoea \nGastrointestinal disorders \n Common: Diarrhoea \n Not known: Nausea, vomiting \nHepatobiliary disorders \n Not known: Liver disorder*, jaundice, hepatitis, liver failure** \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Uncommon: Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens \n\nJohnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and oral mucosal \nreactions, rash, pruritus, urticaria \n\n Rare: Angioedema, erythema \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n Common: Arthralgia \nRenal and urinary disorders \n Uncommon: Acute renal failure, renal impairment \nInvestigations \n Common: Hyperkalaemia \n Uncommon: Liver enzyme increased \n Rare: Haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased, blood creatinine \n\nincreased \n Not known: Hyponatraemia \n\n*Isolated cases of liver disorder with clinical symptoms and laboratory evidence of more marked \nhepatic dysfunction. \n**Including one case of \u2018liver failure fulminant\u2019 reported in the post-marketing experience, for which \na causal relationship with aliskiren cannot be excluded. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema \nIn controlled clinical studies, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during \ntreatment with aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. \n \nCases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or \ntongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a \nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \nwith the administration of other medicines known to cause angioedema, including RAAS blockers \n(ACEIs or ARBs). \n \nIn post-marketing experience, cases of angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported \nwhen aliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in post-marketing \n\n\n\n10 \n\nexperience (see section 4.4). \n \nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \nin breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n \nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \nhypersensitivity reaction. \n \nRenal dysfunction \nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n \nLaboratory findings \nIn controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were \nuncommonly associated with the administration of aliskiren. In clinical studies in hypertensive \npatients, Rasilez had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein \ncholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n \nHaemoglobin and haematocrit \nSmall decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.05 mmol/l and \n0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients discontinued therapy due to anaemia. \nThis effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, such as ACEIs and \nARBs. \n \nSerum potassium \nIncreases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be exacerbated by \nconcomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with standard medical \npractice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if \nco-administration is considered necessary. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAliskiren has been evaluated for safety in a randomised, double-blind, 8-week study in \n267 hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years, mostly overweight/obese, followed by an extension \nstudy including 208 patients treated for 52 weeks. An additional 52 to 104 week non-interventional \nobservational extension study in 106 patients (no study treatment administered) was conducted with \nthe objective to evaluate the long-term safety in terms of growth and development of children 6-17 \nyears of age with hypertension (primary or secondary) at baseline in the core study, previously treated \nwith aliskiren.  \nThe frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children were generally similar to those seen \nin hypertensive adults. No overall clinically relevant adverse impact on paediatric patients aged 6 to \n17 years was observed after treatment with aliskiren for up to one year based on physical \ndevelopment, assessed in patients with primary or secondary hypertension, and  neurocognitive \ndevelopment assessed only in patients with secondary hypertension (19 patients: 9 previously treated \nwith aliskiren and  10 previously treated with enalapril) (see section 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nLimited data are available related to overdose in humans. The most likely manifestations of \noverdosage would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren. \n \nTreatment \n \nIf symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n \nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, \ndialysis clearance of aliskiren was low (< 2% of oral clearance). Therefore, dialysis is not adequate to \ntreat aliskiren over-exposure. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system; renin inhibitor, ATC \ncode: C09XA02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin \nII. Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)) \ncause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in \nhypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was \ncombined with other antihypertensive agents. The clinical implications of the differences in effect on \nPRA are not known at the present time. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal \nblood-pressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \nsustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and \nethnicity. Aliskiren has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in 426 patients aged \n75 years or older. \n \nAliskiren monotherapy studies have shown blood pressure lowering effects comparable to other \nclasses of antihypertensive agents including ACEI and ARB. Compared to a diuretic \n(hydrochlorothiazide - HCTZ), Rasilez 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by \n17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to 14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. \n \nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well \ntolerated. It induced an additive blood-pressure-lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. In \n\n\n\n12 \n\npatients who did not adequately respond to 5 mg of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the \naddition of aliskiren 150 mg had a blood-pressure-lowering effect similar to that obtained by \nincreasing amlodipine dose to 10 mg, but had a lower incidence of oedema (aliskiren \n150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg 2.1% vs. amlodipine 10 mg 11.2%). \n \nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a \n9-month non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the doses chosen and the differences in \nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in \nboth treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the \naliskiren regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen \nthan for the ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n \nIn a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (\u2265 65 years) and very elderly patients (30% \u2265 75 years) \naliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction in \nblood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood pressure \nlowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses \nwere well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. In a pooled analysis of efficacy and \nsafety data from clinical studies up to 12 months duration, there was no statistically significant \ndifference in blood pressure reduction between aliskiren 300 mg and aliskiren 150 mg in elderly \npatients (\u2265 65 years). \n \nIn obese hypertensive patients who did not adequately respond to HCTZ 25 mg, add-on treatment with \naliskiren 300 mg provided additional blood pressure reduction that was comparable to add-on \ntreatment with irbesartan 300 mg or amlodipine 10 mg. \n \nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \nuncomplicated hypertension treated with aliskiren alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive agents. With cessation of treatment, blood \npressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence \nof a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n \nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \nventricular re-modelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n \nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n \nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled \nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \nproteinuria and/or GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n \nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \nThe final study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.097 in favour of placebo \n\n\n\n13 \n\n(95.4% Confidence Interval: 0.987, 1.218, 2-sided p=0.0787). In addition, an increased incidence of \nadverse events was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo (38.2% versus 30.3%). In particular \nthere was an increased incidence of renal dysfunction (14.5% versus 12.4%), hyperkalaemia (39.1% \nversus 29.0%), hypotension-related events (19.9% versus 16.3%) and adjudicated stroke endpoints \n(3.4% versus 2.7%). The increased incidence of stroke was greater in patients with renal \ninsufficiency. \n \nAliskiren 150 mg (increased to 300 mg if tolerated) added to conventional therapy was evaluated in a \ndouble-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial in 1,639 patients with reduced ejection fraction \nhospitalised for an episode of acute heart failure (NYHA Class III\u2013IV) who were haemodynamically \nstable at baseline. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death or heart failure rehospitalisation \nwithin 6 months; secondary endpoints were assessed within 12 months. \n \nThe study showed no benefit of aliskiren when administered on top of standard therapy for acute heart \nfailure and an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus. Study results \nindicated a non-significant effect of aliskiren with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95% Confidence Interval: \n0.76-1.12; p=0.41, aliskiren vs. placebo). Different treatment effects of aliskiren were reported for \noverall mortality within 12 months dependent on diabetes mellitus status. In the subgroup of patients \nwith diabetes mellitus the hazard ratio was 1.64 in favour of placebo (95% Confidence Interval: \n1.15-2.33), whereas the hazard ratio in the subgroup of patients without diabetes was 0.69 in favour of \naliskiren (95% Confidence Interval: 0.50-0.94); p-value for interaction = 0.0003. An increased \nincidence of hyperkalaemia (20.9% versus 17.5%), renal impairment/renal failure (16.6% versus \n12.1%) and hypotension (17.1% versus 12.6%) was observed in the aliskiren group compared with \nplacebo and was greater in patients with diabetes. \n \nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity benefit in a double-blind active \ncontrolled randomised study in 7,064 patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular \nejection fraction, of which 62% had a history of hypertension. The primary endpoint was a composite \nof cardiovascular death and first hospitalisation for heart failure. \n \nIn this study, aliskiren at a target dose of 300 mg was compared to enalapril at a target dose of 20 mg \nwhen added to standard of care which included a beta blocker (and a mineralocorticoid receptor \nantagonist in 37% of patients) and a diuretic as needed. The study also evaluated the combination of \naliskiren and enalapril. Mean duration of follow-up was 3.5 years. The final results of the study did \nnot demonstrate statistically that aliskiren was non-inferior to enalapril on the primary endpoint, \nhowever there was essentially no difference in the observed incidence rates between aliskiren and \nenalapril (hazard ratio of 0.99 with 95% Confidence Interval: 0.90-1.10). There was no significant \nbenefit of adding aliskiren to enalapril (primary endpoint: hazard ratio of 0.93 with 95% Confidence \nInterval: 0.85-1.03; p=0.1724, combination versus enalapril). Treatment effects were similar in \npatients with diabetes and with renal insufficiency. The incidence of adjudicated stroke was not \nsignificantly different between the aliskiren and enalapril groups (4.4% versus 4.0%; HR 1.12, 95% \nCI 0.848, 1.485) or between the combination and enalapril groups (3.7% versus 4.0%; HR 0.93, 95% \nCI 0.697, 1.251). The incidence of adverse events tended to be higher in patients with diabetes, or \nwith GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2, or with age \u2265 65 years; however, there was no difference between \npatients treated with aliskiren and those treated with enalapril. \n \nThe incidence of certain adverse events was similar between aliskiren and enalapril groups while \nthere was an increased incidence of adverse events with the combination of aliskiren and enalapril: \nhyperkalaemia (21.4%, 13.2%, and 15.9% for combination, aliskiren and enalapril respectively); renal \nimpairment/renal failure (23.2%, 17.4% and 18.7%) and hypotension related events (27.0%, 22.3% \nand 22.4%). \n \nThere was a statistically significant increased incidence of syncope with the combination of aliskiren \nand enalapril compared to enalapril in the overall population (4.2% versus 2.8%; RR 1.51, 95% CI \n1.11-2.05) and in the subgroups NYHA I/II overall (4.8% versus 3.0%; RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.14-2.29). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nThe incidence of atrial fibrillation was 11.1%, 13.3%, and 11.0% in the combination, aliskiren, and \nenalapril groups, respectively. \n \nStatistically significantly higher incidences in the occurrence of cardiac failure and ischaemic stroke \nwere also found for aliskiren compared to enalapril in patients with NYHA I/II with hypertension, and \nin the occurrence of chronic cardiac failure and ventricular extrasystole in patients with NYHA III/IV \nwith hypertension. For the combination of aliskiren and enalapril there were statistically significant \ndifferences in the rate of angina unstable compared to enalapril. \n \nNo clinically relevant differences in efficacy or safety results were observed in the subpopulation of \nelderly patients with a history of hypertension and chronic heart failure Class I-II compared to the \noverall study population. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \n \nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 8-week study with aliskiren monotherapy (3 dose groups \nby weight category [\u226520 kg to <50 kg; \u226550 kg to <80 kg; \u226580 kg to \u2264150 kg]: low 6.25/12.5/25 mg \n[0.13-0.31 mg/kg]; mid 37.5/75/150 mg [0.75-1.88 mg/kg]; and high dose 150/300/600 mg \n[3.0-7.5 mg/kg], with a wide dose ratio between the low, mid and high dose groups [1:6:24]) in 267 \npaediatric hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years, mostly overweight/obese, aliskiren lowered office \nand ambulatory blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner during the initial 4 week dose-finding \nphase of the study (Phase 1). However, in the subsequent 4 week randomised withdrawal phase of the \nstudy (Phase 2), the effect of aliskiren overlapped with the effects observed in patients switched to \nplacebo in all dose groups (low, p=0.8894; mid, p=0.9511; high, p=0.0563). The average differences \nbetween aliskiren and placebo for the low and mid dose groups were <0.2 mmHg. The treatment with \naliskiren was well tolerated in this study. \n \nThis study was extended with a 52-week double-blind, randomised study to evaluate the safety, \ntolerability and efficacy of aliskiren compared to enalapril in 208 paediatric hypertensive patients \naged 6 to 17 years (at baseline in the previous study). The starting dose in each group was assigned \ndepending on weight with three groups: \u226520 to <50 kg, \u226550 to <80 kg, and \u226580 to \u2264150 kg. The \nstarting doses for aliskiren were 37.5/75/150 mg in the low, mid and high weight groups, respectively. \nThe starting doses for enalapril were 2.5/5/10 mg in the low, mid and high weight groups, \nrespectively. Optional titration of the respective study drug doses to the next highest weight-based \ndose level was available by doubling the dose with each of the two allowed dose titrations, up to \n600 mg (highest studied dose in adults) for aliskiren and 40 mg for enalapril in the \u226580 to \u2264150 kg \nweight group, if medically necessary to control the mean sitting systolic blood pressure (i.e. msSBP \nshould be less than the 90th percentile for age, gender and height). Overall, the mean age of the \npatients was 11.8 years with 48.6% of patients being in the 6-11 years age group and 51.4% in the \n12-17 years age group. Mean weight was 68.0 kg with 57.7% of patients having BMI greater than or \nequal to the 95th percentile for age and gender. At the end of this extension study, changes in msSBP \nfrom baseline were similar with aliskiren compared to enalapril (-7.63 mmHg vs. -7.94 mmHg) in the \nfull analysis set. However, the significance of the non-inferiority testing was not maintained when the \nanalysis was performed on the per-protocol set in which the least square mean change in msSBP from \nbaseline was -7.84 mmHg with aliskiren and -9.04 mmHg with enalapril. In addition, due to the \npossibility of up-titration if medically necessary to control the msSBP, no conclusion can be drawn on \nthe appropriate posology of aliskiren in patients aged 6 to 17 years. \n \nAfter the first 52 week extension study, eligible male and female paediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years \nwith primary or secondary hypertension, were enrolled in a 52 to 104 week off-therapy non-\ninterventional observational extension study designed to evaluate the LT growth and development, \n\n\n\n15 \n\nthrough height and weight measurement, with added neurocognitive and renal function evaluations as \nfollow-up measures performed only in patients with secondary hypertension (19 patients: 9 previously \ntreated with aliskiren and  10 previously treated with enalapril). \n \nThere were no statistically significant differences in the mean changes in weight, height, or BMI \nbetween the treatment groups from Baseline to LT Visit 18 (Week 104) (primary analysis). \n \nIn patients after 104 weeks (at LT Visit 19 [Week 156]), there were LS mean decreases from Baseline \nin weight and BMI in both treatment groups, with a slightly larger decrease in the aliskiren compared \nto the enalapril treatment group.  \n \nThere was a greater LS mean increase from Baseline in height after 104 weeks (at LT Visit 19 [Week \n156], secondary hypertension patients) compared to the increase observed after 52 weeks (at LT Visit \n18 [Week 104], primary hypertension patients), which is expected in these growing paediatric \npatients.  \n \nResults of the neurocognitive assessments showed some improvements in most of the test scores, with \nno meaningful difference between the treatment groups. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \naliskiren in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \nby 85% and AUC by 70%. At steady state meals with low fat content reduce Cmax by 76% and \nAUC0-tau by 67% in hypertensive patients. However, the efficacy of aliskiren was similar when taken \nwith a light meal or under fasted state. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days \nfollowing once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with \nthe initial dose. \n \nTransporters \n \nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in pre-clinical studies. \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is \napproximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. \nAliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nApproximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme responsible for this \nmetabolism is CYP3A4. \n \nElimination \n \nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \ncompound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine following oral \nadministration. Following intravenous administration, the mean plasma clearance is approximately \n\n\n\n16 \n\n9 l/h. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and \n2.6-fold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n \nCharacteristics in patients \n \nAliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \nadjustment of the initial dosage of treatment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). It is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment \n(glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild \nto severe hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly patients aged 65 years and over \nThe AUC is 50% higher in elderly (> 65 years) than in young subjects. Gender, weight and ethnicity \nhave no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 paediatric hypertensive patients aged 6 to \n17 years given daily doses of 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg aliskiren administered as granules (3.125 mg/tablet), \npharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those in adults. The results of this study did not suggest \nthat age, body weight or gender have any significant effect on aliskiren systemic exposure (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nIn an 8-week randomised, double-blind study with aliskiren monotherapy in 267 paediatric \nhypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years, mostly overweight/obese, fasting trough aliskiren \nconcentrations at day 28 were comparable to those observed in other studies in both adults and \nchildren using similar aliskiren doses (see section 5.1). \n \nResults from an in vitro MDR1 human tissue study suggested an age and tissue dependent pattern of \nMDR1 (P-gp) transporter maturation. A high inter-individual variability of mRNA expression levels \n\n\n\n17 \n\nwas observed (up to 600-fold). Hepatic MDR1 mRNA expression was statistically significantly lower \nin samples from foetuses, neonates and infants up to 23 months. \n \nThe age at which the transporter system is mature cannot be determined. There is a potential for \naliskiren overexposure in children with an immature MDR1 (P-gp) system (see section \u201cTransporters\u201d \nabove and sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.3). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \nthe known local (gastrointestinal tract) irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of \naliskiren. \n \nNo carcinogenic potential for aliskiren was detected in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic \nmouse study. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded in rats at the dose of \n1500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. \n \nAlthough aliskiren has known local (gastrointestinal tract) irritation potential, safety margins obtained \nin humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy volunteers were considered to be \nappropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold based on mucosa concentrations in \ncomparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n \nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. \n \nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n \nJuvenile animal studies \n \nIn a juvenile toxicity study in 8-day-old rats, aliskiren administration at 100 mg/kg/day and \n300 mg/kg/day (2.3- and 6.8-fold the maximum recommended human dose) was associated with high \nmortality and severe morbidity. In another juvenile toxicity study in 14-day-old rats, aliskiren \nadministration at 300 mg/kg/day (8.5-fold the maximum recommended human dose) was associated \nwith delayed mortality. The systemic exposure to aliskiren in 8-day old rats was >400-fold higher than \nin adult rats. Results from a mechanistic study showed that the MDR1 (P-gp) gene expression in \njuvenile rats was significantly lower when compared to adult rats. The increased aliskiren exposure in \njuvenile rats appears to be attributed mainly to lack of maturation of P-gp in the gastrointestinal tract. \nThere is therefore a potential for aliskiren overexposure in paediatric patients with immature MDR1 \nefflux system (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nRasilez 150 mg film-coated tablets \nRasilez 300 mg film-coated tablets \n\nAliskiren \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Rasilez is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Rasilez \n3. How to take Rasilez \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Rasilez \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rasilez is and what it is used for \n \nThis medicine contains an active substance called aliskiren. Aliskiren belongs to a class of medicines \ncalled renin inhibitors. Renin inhibitors reduce the amount of angiotensin II the body can produce. \nAngiotensin II causes blood vessels to tighten, which increases the blood pressure. Reducing the \namount of angiotensin II allows the blood vessels to relax, which lowers blood pressure. \n \nThis helps to lower high blood pressure in adult patients. High blood pressure increases the workload \nof the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, it can damage the blood vessels of the brain, \nheart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart failure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering \nthe blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk of developing these disorders. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Rasilez \n \nDo not take Rasilez \n- if you are allergic to aliskiren or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n- if you have experienced the following forms of angioedema (difficulties in breathing or \n\nswallowing, or swelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue): \n- angioedema when taking aliskiren. \n- hereditary angioedema. \n- angioedema without any known cause. \n\n- during the last 6 months of pregnancy or if you are breast-feeding, see section \u201cPregnancy and \nbreastfeeding\u201d. \n\n- if you are taking ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or \nfor other conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), itraconazole (a medicine \nused to treat fungal infections) or quinidine (a medicine used to correct heart rhythm). \n\n\n\n56 \n\n- if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with either of the \nfollowing classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n- an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril \nor \n- an angiotensin II receptor blocker such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan. \n\n- if the patient is less than 2 years of age. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Rasilez: \n- if you are taking a diuretic (a type of medicine also known as \u201cwater\u201d tablets which increases \n\nthe amount of urine you produce). \n- if you are taking either of the following classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril \nor \n- an angiotensin II receptor blocker such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan. \n\n- if you have impaired kidney function, your doctor will carefully consider whether this medicine \nis suitable for you and may wish to monitor you carefully. \n\n- if you have already experienced angioedema (difficulties in breathing or swallowing, or \nswelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue). If this happens, stop taking this \nmedicine and contact your doctor. \n\n- if you have renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys). \n- if you have serious congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease where the heart cannot \n\npump enough blood around the body). \n \nIf you have severe and persistent diarrhoea you should stop taking Rasilez. \n \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also section \u201cDo not take Rasilez\u201d. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine must not be used in babies from birth to less than 2 years of age. It should not be used \nin children from 2 to less than 6 years of age, and is not recommended for use in children and \nadolescents from 6 to less than 18 years of age. This is because the safety and benefits of this \nmedicine are not known in this population.  \n \n \nElderly \nThe usual recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients aged 65 years or older is 150 mg. \nIn the majority of patients aged 65 years or older, the 300 mg dose of Rasilez shows no additional \nbenefit in reducing blood pressure compared to the 150 mg dose. \n \nOther medicines and Rasilez \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions if you are taking one of \nthe following medicines: \n- medicines that increase the amount of potassium in your blood. These include \n\npotassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements. \n- furosemide or torasemide, medicines belonging to the type known as diuretics, or \u201cwater\u201d \n\ntablets, which are used to increase the amount of urine you produce. \n- an angiotensin II receptor blocker or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (see sections \n\n\u201cDo not take Rasilez\u201d and \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n- ketoconazole, a medicine used to treat fungal infections. \n\n\n\n57 \n\n- verapamil, a medicine used to lower high blood pressure, to correct heart rhythm or to treat \nangina pectoris. \n\n- certain types of pain killers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs). \n \nRasilez with food and drink \nYou should take this medicine either with a light meal or without a meal once a day, preferably at the \nsame time each day. You should avoid taking this medicine together with fruit juice and/or drinks \ncontaining plant extracts (including herbal teas), as it could cause a decrease in the effectiveness of \nthis medicine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nDo not take this medicine if you are pregnant (see section \u201cDo not take Rasilez\u201d). If you become \npregnant while taking this medicine, stop taking it immediately and talk to your doctor. If you think \nyou may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before \ntaking this medicine. Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking this medicine before you \nbecome pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of this medicine. It is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. This medicine is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \nyou if you wish to breast-feed. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine may make you feel dizzy and this can affect your ability to concentrate. Before you \ndrive a vehicle, use machinery, or carry out other activities that require concentration, you should \nmake sure you know how you react to the effects of this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Rasilez \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nPeople who have high blood pressure often do not notice any signs of the problem. Many may feel \nquite normal. It is very important that you take this medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to get the \nbest results and reduce the risk of side effects. Keep your appointments with the doctor even if you \nare feeling well. \n \nThe usual starting dose is one 150 mg tablet once daily. The blood pressure lowering effect is present \nwithin two weeks after beginning treatment. \n \nElderly people \n \nThe usual recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. In the majority of \npatients aged 65 years or older, the 300 mg dose of aliskiren shows no additional benefit in reducing \nblood pressure compared to the 150 mg dose. \n \nDepending on how you respond to the treatment your doctor may prescribe a higher dose of one \n300 mg tablet once daily. Your doctor may prescribe this medicine together with other medicines used \nto treat high blood pressure. \n \nMethod of administration \nSwallow the tablet whole with some water. You should take this medicine once a day, always with or \n\n\n\n58 \n\nalways without food, preferably at the same time each day. You should establish a convenient daily \nschedule to take the medicine the same way each day, in a regular pattern with respect to the timing of \nyour meals. You should avoid taking this medicine together with fruit juice and/or drinks containing \nplant extracts (including herbal teas). During your treatment, your doctor may adjust your dose \ndepending on your blood pressure response. \n \nIf you take more Rasilez than you should \nIf you have accidentally taken too many tablets of this medicine, consult a doctor immediately. You \nmay require medical attention. \n \nIf you forget to take Rasilez \nIf you forget to take a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as you remember and then take the next \ndose at its usual time. However, if it is almost time for your next dose you should simply take the next \ntablet at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSome side effects can be serious (frequency not known): \nA few patients have experienced these serious side effects. If any of the following occur, tell your \ndoctor straight away: \n\u2022 Severe allergic reaction with symptoms such as rash, itching, swelling of face or lips or tongue, \n\ndifficulty breathing, dizziness. \n \nPossible side effects: \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): Diarrhoea, joint pain (arthralgia), high level of potassium \nin the blood, dizziness. \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): Skin rash (this may also be a sign of allergic reactions \nor angioedema \u2013 see \u201cRare\u201d side effects below), kidney problems including acute renal failure \n(severely decreased urine output), swelling of hands, ankles or feet (peripheral oedema), severe skin \nreactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis and/or oral mucosal reactions - red skin, blistering of the lips, \neyes or mouth, skin peeling, fever), low blood pressure, palpitations, cough, itching, itchy rash \n(urticaria), increased liver enzymes. \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): increased level of creatinine in the blood, decreased level of \nhaemoglobin in the blood (anaemia), decreased level of red blood cells, red skin (erythema). \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): spinning sensation, low level of \nsodium in the blood, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, signs of liver disorder (nausea, loss of \nappetite, dark coloured urine or yellowing of skin and eyes). \n \nIf any of these affect you severely, tell your doctor. You may need to stop Rasilez. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet.
