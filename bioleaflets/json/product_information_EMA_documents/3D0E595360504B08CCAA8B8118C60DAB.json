CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\n \n\nXolair is indicated in adults, adolescents and children (6 to <12 years of age). \n\n \n\nXolair treatment should only be considered for patients with convincing IgE (immunoglobulin E) \n\nmediated asthma (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAdults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) \nXolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent \n\nallergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and who \n\nhave reduced lung function (FEV1 <80%) as well as frequent daytime symptoms or night-time \n\nawakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-\n\ndose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist. \n\n \n\nChildren (6 to <12 years of age) \nXolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent \n\nallergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and \n\nfrequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe \n\nasthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-\n\nagonist. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\n \n\nXolair is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids (INC) for the treatment of \n\nadults (18 years and above) with severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with INC does not provide \n\nadequate disease control. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nXolair treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe \n\npersistent asthma or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nDosing for allergic asthma and CRSwNP follows the same dosing principles. The appropriate dose \n\nand frequency of Xolair for these conditions is determined by baseline IgE (IU/ml), measured before \n\nthe start of treatment, and body weight (kg). Prior to administration of the initial dose, patients should \n\nhave their IgE level determined by any commercial serum total IgE assay for their dose assignment. \n\nBased on these measurements, 75 to 600 mg of Xolair in 1 to 4 injections may be needed for each \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma patients with baseline IgE lower than 76 IU/ml were less likely to experience benefit \n\n(see section 5.1). Prescribing physicians should ensure that adult and adolescent patients with IgE \n\nbelow 76 IU/ml and children (6 to < 12 years of age) with IgE below 200 IU/ml have unequivocal in \n\nvitro reactivity (RAST) to a perennial allergen before starting therapy. \n\n \n\nSee Table 1 for a conversion chart and Tables 2 and 3 for the dose determination charts. \n\n \n\nPatients whose baseline IgE levels or body weight in kilograms are outside the limits of the dose table \n\nshould not be given Xolair. \n\n \n\nThe maximum recommended dose is 600 mg omalizumab every two weeks. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Conversion from dose to number of vials, number of injections and total injection \n\nvolume for each administration \n\n \n\nDose (mg) Number of vials Number of injections Total injection volume (ml) \n\n 75 mg a 150 mg b   \n\n75 1c 0 1 0.6 \n\n150 0 1 1 1.2 \n\n225 1c 1 2 1.8 \n\n300 0 2 2 2.4 \n\n375 1c 2 3 3.0 \n\n450 0 3 3 3.6 \n\n525 1c 3 4 4.2 \n\n600 0 4 4 4.8 \na 0.6 ml = maximum delivered volume per vial (Xolair 75 mg). \nb 1.2 ml = maximum delivered volume per vial (Xolair 150 mg). \n\nc or use 0.6 ml from a 150 mg vial. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 2 ADMINISTRATION EVERY 4 WEEKS.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that it takes at least \n\n12-16 weeks for Xolair treatment to show effectiveness. At 16 weeks after commencing Xolair \n\ntherapy patients should be assessed by their physician for treatment effectiveness before further \n\ninjections are administered. The decision to continue Xolair following the 16-week timepoint, or on \n\nsubsequent occasions, should be based on whether a marked improvement in overall asthma control is \n\nseen (see section 5.1, Physician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness). \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nIn clinical trials for CRSwNP, changes in nasal polyps score (NPS) and nasal congestion score (NCS) \n\nwere observed at 4 weeks. The need for continued therapy should be periodically reassessed based \n\nupon the patient’s disease severity and level of symptom control. \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nDiscontinuation of Xolair treatment generally results in a return to elevated free IgE levels and \n\nassociated symptoms. Total IgE levels are elevated during treatment and remain elevated for up to one \n\nyear after the discontinuation of treatment. Therefore, re-testing of IgE levels during Xolair treatment \n\ncannot be used as a guide for dose determination. Dose determination after treatment interruptions \n\nlasting less than one year should be based on serum IgE levels obtained at the initial dose \n\ndetermination. Total serum IgE levels may be re-tested for dose determination if treatment with Xolair \n\nhas been interrupted for one year or more. \n\n \n\nDoses should be adjusted for significant changes in body weight (see Tables 2 and 3). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly (65 years of age and older) \n\nThere are limited data available on the use of Xolair in patients older than 65 years but there is no \n\nevidence that elderly patients require a different dose from younger adult patients. \n\n \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment \n\nThere have been no studies on the effect of impaired renal or hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics \n\nof Xolair. Because omalizumab clearance at clinical doses is dominated by the reticular endothelial \n\nsystem (RES) it is unlikely to be altered by renal or hepatic impairment. While no particular dose \n\nadjustment is recommended for these patients, Xolair should be administered with caution (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn allergic asthma, the safety and efficacy of Xolair in patients below the age of 6 years have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nIn CRSwNP, the safety and efficacy of Xolair in patients below the age of 18 years have not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor subcutaneous administration only. Xolair must not be administered by the intravenous or \n\nintramuscular route. \n\n \n\nDoses of more than 150 mg (Table 1) should be divided across two or more injection sites. \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience with self-administration of Xolair powder and solvent for solution for \n\ninjection. Therefore, treatment with this formulation is intended to be administered by a healthcare \n\nprovider only. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and \n\nalso information for the healthcare professional section of the package leaflet. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nXolair is not indicated for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations, acute bronchospasm or status \n\nasthmaticus. \n\n \n\nXolair has not been studied in patients with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome or allergic \n\nbronchopulmonary aspergillosis or for the prevention of anaphylactic reactions, including those \n\nprovoked by food allergy, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis. Xolair is not indicated for the \n\ntreatment of these conditions. \n\n \n\nXolair therapy has not been studied in patients with autoimmune diseases, immune complex-mediated \n\nconditions, or pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). Caution should be exercised \n\nwhen administering Xolair in these patient populations. \n\n \n\nAbrupt discontinuation of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids after initiation of Xolair therapy in \n\nallergic asthma or CRSwNP is not recommended. Decreases in corticosteroids should be performed \n\nunder the direct supervision of a physician and may need to be performed gradually. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions type I \n\nType I local or systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, may occur \n\nwhen taking omalizumab, even after a long duration of treatment. However, most of these reactions \n\noccurred within 2 hours after the first and subsequent injections of Xolair but some started beyond \n\n2 hours and even beyond 24 hours after the injection. The majority of anaphylactic reactions occurred \n\nwithin the first 3 doses of Xolair. A history of anaphylaxis unrelated to omalizumab may be a risk \n\nfactor for anaphylaxis following Xolair administration. Therefore medicinal products for the treatment \n\nof anaphylactic reactions should always be available for immediate use following administration of \n\nXolair. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Xolair must be \n\ndiscontinued immediately, and appropriate therapy initiated. Patients should be informed that such \n\nreactions are possible, and prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur. \n\n \n\nAntibodies to omalizumab have been detected in a low number of patients in clinical trials (see \n\nsection 4.8). The clinical relevance of anti-Xolair antibodies is not well understood. \n\n \n\nSerum sickness \n\nSerum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions, which are delayed allergic type III reactions, have \n\nbeen seen in patients treated with humanised monoclonal antibodies including omalizumab. The \n\nsuggested pathophysiologic mechanism includes immune-complex formation and deposition due to \n\ndevelopment of antibodies against omalizumab. The onset has typically been 1-5 days after \n\nadministration of the first or subsequent injections, also after long duration of treatment. Symptoms \n\nsuggestive of serum sickness include arthritis/arthralgias, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever and \n\nlymphadenopathy. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be useful for preventing or treating this \n\ndisorder, and patients should be advised to report any suspected symptoms. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nChurg-Strauss syndrome and hypereosinophilic syndrome \n\nPatients with severe asthma may rarely present systemic hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic \n\neosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), both of which are usually treated \n\nwith systemic corticosteroids. \n\n \n\nIn rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma medicinal products, including omalizumab, may \n\npresent or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis. These events are commonly associated with \n\nthe reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. \n\n \n\nIn these patients, physicians should be alert to the development of marked eosinophilia, vasculitic \n\nrash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, paranasal sinus abnormalities, cardiac complications, and/or \n\nneuropathy. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation of omalizumab should be considered in all severe cases with the above mentioned \n\nimmune system disorders. \n\n \n\nParasitic (helminth) infections \n\n \n\nIgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. In patients at chronic \n\nhigh risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight increase in infection rate \n\nwith omalizumab, although the course, severity, and response to treatment of infection were unaltered. \n\nThe helminth infection rate in the overall clinical programme, which was not designed to detect such \n\ninfections, was less than 1 in 1,000 patients. However, caution may be warranted in patients at high \n\nrisk of helminth infection, in particular when travelling to areas where helminthic infections are \n\nendemic. If patients do not respond to recommended anti-helminth treatment, discontinuation of \n\nXolair should be considered. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nSince IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections, Xolair may \n\nindirectly reduce the efficacy of medicinal products for the treatment of helminthic or other parasitic \n\ninfections (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the \n\nclearance of omalizumab; thus, there is little potential for drug-drug interactions. Medicinal product or \n\nvaccine interaction studies have not been performed with Xolair. There is no pharmacological reason \n\nto expect that commonly prescribed medicinal products used in the treatment of asthma or CRSwNP \n\nwill interact with omalizumab. \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies Xolair was commonly used in conjunction with inhaled and oral corticosteroids, \n\ninhaled short-acting and long-acting beta agonists, leukotriene modifiers, theophyllines and oral \n\nantihistamines. There was no indication that the safety of Xolair was altered with these other \n\ncommonly used anti-asthma medicinal products. Limited data are available on the use of Xolair in \n\ncombination with specific immunotherapy (hypo-sensitisation therapy). In a clinical trial where Xolair \n\nwas co-administered with immunotherapy, the safety and efficacy of Xolair in combination with \n\nspecific immunotherapy were found to be no different to that of Xolair alone. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies Xolair was used in conjunction with intranasal mometasone spray as per protocol. \n\nOther commonly used concomitant medicinal products included other intranasal corticosteroids, \n\nbronchodilators, antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, adrenergics/sympathomimetics and \n\nlocal nasal anaesthetics. There was no indication that the safety of Xolair was altered by the \n\nconcomitant use of these other commonly used medicinal products. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nA moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1,000 pregnancy outcomes) based on \n\npregnancy registry and post-marketing spontaneous reports, indicates no malformative or \n\nfoeto/neonatal toxicity. A prospective pregnancy registry study (EXPECT) in 250 pregnant women \n\nwith asthma exposed to Xolair showed the prevalence of major congenital anomalies was similar \n\n(8.1% vs. 8.9%) between EXPECT and disease-matched (moderate and severe asthma) patients. The \n\ninterpretation of data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small \n\nsample size and non-randomised design. \n\n \n\nOmalizumab crosses the placental barrier. However, animal studies do not indicate either direct or \n\nindirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nOmalizumab has been associated with age-dependent decreases in blood platelets in non-human \n\nprimates, with a greater relative sensitivity in juvenile animals (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nIf clinically needed, the use of Xolair may be considered during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nImmunoglobulins G (IgGs) are present in human milk and therefore it is expected that omalizumab \n\nwill be present in human milk. Available data in non-human primates have shown excretion of \n\nomalizumab into milk (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nThe EXPECT study, with 154 infants who had been exposed to Xolair during pregnancy and through \n\nbreast-feeding did not indicate adverse effects on the breast-fed infant. The interpretation of data may \n\nbe impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-\n\nrandomised design. \n\n \n\nGiven orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and have poor bioavailability. \n\nNo effects on the breast-fed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, if clinically needed, the \n\nuse of Xolair may be considered during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no human fertility data for omalizumab. In specifically-designed non-clinical fertility studies \n\nin non-human primates, including mating studies, no impairment of male or female fertility was \n\nobserved following repeated dosing with omalizumab at dose levels up to 75 mg/kg. Furthermore, no \n\ngenotoxic effects were observed in a separate non-clinical genotoxicity study. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nXolair has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nDuring allergic asthma clinical trials in adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older, the \n\nmost commonly reported adverse reactions were headaches and injection site reactions, including \n\ninjection site pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus. In clinical trials in children 6 to <12 years of age, \n\nthe most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, pyrexia and upper abdominal pain. \n\nMost of the reactions were mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials in patients ≥18 years of age \n\n\n\n10 \n\nin CRSwNP, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, dizziness, arthralgia, \n\nabdominal pain upper and injection site reactions. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nTable 4 lists the adverse reactions recorded in clinical studies in the total allergic asthma and CRSwNP \n\nsafety population treated with Xolair by MedDRA system organ class and frequency. Within each \n\nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequency \n\ncategories are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n\n<1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000). Reactions reported in the post-\n\nmarketing setting are listed with frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nTable 4 Adverse reactions in allergic asthma and CRSwNP \n\n \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nUncommon Pharyngitis \n\nRare Parasitic infection \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nNot known Idiopathic thrombocytopenia, including severe cases \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nRare Anaphylactic reaction, other serious allergic conditions, anti-\n\nomalizumab antibody development \n\nNot known Serum sickness, may include fever and lymphadenopathy \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon Headache* \n\nUncommon Syncope, paraesthesia, somnolence, dizziness# \n\nVascular disorders \n\nUncommon Postural hypotension, flushing \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Allergic bronchospasm, coughing \n\nRare Laryngoedema \n\nNot known Allergic granulomatous vasculitis (i.e. Churg-Strauss syndrome) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon Abdominal pain upper**,# \n\nUncommon Dyspeptic signs and symptoms, diarrhoea, nausea \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nUncommon Photosensitivity, urticaria, rash, pruritus \n\nRare Angioedema \n\nNot known Alopecia \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Athralgia† \n\nRare Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) \n\nNot known Myalgia, joint swelling \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nVery common Pyrexia** \n\nCommon Injection site reactions such as swelling, erythema, pain, pruritus \n\nUncommon Influenza-like illness, swelling arms, weight increase, fatigue \n\n*: Very common in children 6 to <12 years of age \n\n**: In children 6 to <12 years of age \n#: Common in nasal polyp trials \n\n†: Unknown in allergic asthma trials \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n11 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nFor further information, see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nAnaphylaxis \n\nAnaphylactic reactions were rare in clinical trials. However, post-marketing data following a \n\ncumulative search in the safety database retrieved a total of 898 anaphylaxis cases. Based on an \n\nestimated exposure of 566,923 patient treatment years, this results in a reporting rate of approximately \n\n0.20%. \n\n \n\nArterial thromboembolic events (ATE) \n\nIn controlled clinical trials and during interim analyses of an observational study, a numerical \n\nimbalance of ATE was observed. The definition of the composite endpoint ATE included stroke, \n\ntransient ischaemic attack, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiovascular death (including \n\ndeath from unknown cause). In the final analysis of the observational study, the rate of ATE per 1,000 \n\npatient years was 7.52 (115/15,286 patient years) for Xolair-treated patients and 5.12 (51/9,963 patient \n\nyears) for control patients. In a multivariate analysis controlling for available baseline cardiovascular \n\nrisk factors, the hazard ratio was 1.32 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.91). In a separate analysis of \n\npooled clinical trials, which included all randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials \n\nlasting 8 or more weeks, the rate of ATE per 1,000 patient years was 2.69 (5/1,856 patient years) for \n\nXolair-treated patients and 2.38 (4/1,680 patient years) for placebo patients (rate ratio 1.13, 95% \n\nconfidence interval 0.24-5.71). \n\n \n\nPlatelets \n\nIn clinical trials few patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of the normal laboratory range. \n\nNone of these changes were associated with bleeding episodes or a decrease in haemoglobin. No \n\npattern of persistent decrease in platelet counts, as observed in non-human primates (see section 5.3), \n\nhas been reported in humans (patients above 6 years of age), even though isolated cases of idiopathic \n\nthrombocytopenia, including severe cases, have been reported in the post-marketing setting. \n\n \n\nParasitic infections \n\nIn patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight \n\nnumerical increase in infection rate with omalizumab that was not statistically significant. The course, \n\nseverity, and response to treatment of infections were unaltered (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nClinical trial and post-marketing cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in \n\npatients with moderate to severe asthma and CSU. The pathogenesis of SLE is not well understood. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nMaximum tolerated dose of Xolair has not been determined. Single intravenous doses up to 4,000 mg \n\nhave been administered to patients without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. The highest \n\ncumulative dose administered to patients was 44,000 mg over a 20-week period and this dose did not \n\nresult in any untoward acute effects. \n\n \n\nIf an overdose is suspected, the patient should be monitored for any abnormal signs or symptoms. \n\nMedical treatment should be sought and instituted appropriately. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for \n\nobstructive airway diseases, ATC code: R03DX05 \n\n \n\nOmalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to \n\nhuman immunoglobulin E (IgE). The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that contains human framework \n\nregions with the complementary-determining regions of a murine parent antibody that binds to IgE. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nOmalizumab binds to IgE and prevents binding of IgE to FcRI (high-affinity IgE receptor) on \n\nbasophils and mast cells, thereby reducing the amount of free IgE that is available to trigger the \n\nallergic cascade. Treatment of atopic subjects with omalizumab resulted in a marked down-regulation \n\nof FcRI receptors on basophils. Treatment with Xolair inhibits IgE-mediated inflammation, as \n\nevidenced by reduced blood and tissue eosinophils and reduced inflammatory mediators, including IL-\n\n4, IL-5, and IL-13 by innate, adaptive and non-immune cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nThe in vitro histamine release from basophils isolated from Xolair-treated subjects was reduced by \n\napproximately 90% following stimulation with an allergen compared to pre-treatment values. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies in allergic asthma patients, serum free IgE levels were reduced in a dose-dependent \n\nmanner within one hour following the first dose and maintained between doses. One year after \n\ndiscontinuation of Xolair dosing, the IgE levels had returned to pre-treatment levels with no observed \n\nrebound in IgE levels after washout of the medicinal product. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nIn clinical studies in patients with CRSwNP, Xolair treatment led to a reduction in serum free IgE \n\n(approx. 95%) and an increase in serum total IgE levels, to a similar extent as observed in patients \n\nwith allergic asthma. Total IgE levels in serum increased due to the formation of omalizumab-IgE \n\ncomplexes that have a slower elimination rate compared with free IgE. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nAdults and adolescents ≥12 years of age \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Xolair were demonstrated in a 28-week double-blind placebo-controlled \n\nstudy (study 1) involving 419 severe allergic asthmatics, ages 12-79 years, who had reduced lung \n\nfunction (FEV1 40-80% predicted) and poor asthma symptom control despite receiving high dose \n\ninhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Eligible patients had experienced multiple \n\nasthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment or had been hospitalised or attended \n\nan emergency room due to a severe asthma exacerbation in the past year despite continuous treatment \n\nwith high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Subcutaneous Xolair or \n\nplacebo were administered as add-on therapy to >1,000 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate (or \n\nequivalent) plus a long-acting beta2-agonist. Oral corticosteroid, theophylline and leukotriene-\n\nmodifier maintenance therapies were allowed (22%, 27%, and 35% of patients, respectively). \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nThe rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with bursts of systemic corticosteroids was the \n\nprimary endpoint. Omalizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 19% (p = 0.153). Further \n\nevaluations which did show statistical significance (p<0.05) in favour of Xolair included reductions in \n\nsevere exacerbations (where patient’s lung function was reduced to below 60% of personal best and \n\nrequiring systemic corticosteroids) and asthma-related emergency visits (comprised of \n\nhospitalisations, emergency room, and unscheduled doctor visits), and improvements in Physician’s \n\noverall assessment of treatment effectiveness, Asthma-related Quality of Life (AQL), asthma \n\nsymptoms and lung function. \n\n \n\nIn a subgroup analysis, patients with pre-treatment total IgE ≥76 IU/ml were more likely to experience \n\nclinically meaningful benefit to Xolair. In these patients in study 1 Xolair reduced the rate of asthma \n\nexacerbations by 40% (p = 0.002). In addition more patients had clinically meaningful responses in the \n\ntotal IgE ≥76 IU/ml population across the Xolair severe asthma programme. Table 5 includes results in \n\nthe study 1 population. \n\n \n\nTable 5 Results of study 1 \n\n \n\n Whole study 1 population \n\n Xolair \n\nN=209 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=210 \n\nAsthma exacerbations   \n\nRate per 28-week period 0.74 0.92 \n\n% reduction, p-value for rate ratio 19.4%, p = 0.153 \n\nSevere asthma exacerbations   \n\nRate per 28-week period 0.24 0.48 \n\n% reduction, p-value for rate ratio 50.1%, p = 0.002 \n\nEmergency visits   \n\nRate per 28-week period 0.24 0.43 \n\n% reduction, p-value for rate ratio 43.9%, p = 0.038 \n\nPhysician’s overall assessment   \n\n% responders* 60.5% 42.8% \n\np-value** <0.001 \n\nAQL improvement   \n\n% of patients ≥0.5 improvement 60.8% 47.8% \n\np-value 0.008 \n\n* marked improvement or complete control \n\n** p-value for overall distribution of assessment \n\n \n\nStudy 2 assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in a population of 312 severe allergic asthmatics \n\nwhich matched the population in study 1. Treatment with Xolair in this open label study led to a 61% \n\nreduction in clinically significant asthma exacerbation rate compared to current asthma therapy alone. \n\n \n\nFour additional large placebo-controlled supportive studies of 28 to 52 weeks duration in 1,722 adults \n\nand adolescents (studies 3, 4, 5, 6) assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in patients with severe \n\npersistent asthma. Most patients were inadequately controlled but were receiving less concomitant \n\nasthma therapy than patients in studies 1 or 2. Studies 3-5 used exacerbation as primary endpoint, \n\nwhereas study 6 primarily evaluated inhaled corticosteroid sparing. \n\n \n\nIn studies 3, 4 and 5 patients treated with Xolair had respective reductions in asthma exacerbation \n\nrates of 37.5% (p = 0.027), 40.3% (p<0.001) and 57.6% (p<0.001) compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nIn study 6, significantly more severe allergic asthma patients on Xolair were able to reduce their \n\nfluticasone dose to 500 micrograms/day without deterioration of asthma control (60.3%) compared to \n\nthe placebo group (45.8%, p<0.05). \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nQuality of life scores were measured using the Juniper Asthma-related Quality of Life Questionnaire. \n\nFor all six studies there was a statistically significant improvement from baseline in quality of life \n\nscores for Xolair patients versus the placebo or control group. \n\n \n\nPhysician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness: \n\nPhysician’s overall assessment was performed in five of the above studies as a broad measure of \n\nasthma control performed by the treating physician. The physician was able to take into account PEF \n\n(peak expiratory flow), day and night time symptoms, rescue medication use, spirometry and \n\nexacerbations. In all five studies a significantly greater proportion of Xolair treated patients were \n\njudged to have achieved either a marked improvement or complete control of their asthma compared \n\nto placebo patients. \n\n \n\nChildren 6 to <12 years of age \n\nThe primary support for safety and efficacy of Xolair in the group aged 6 to <12 years comes from one \n\nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial (study 7). \n\n \n\nStudy 7 was a placebo-controlled trial which included a specific subgroup (n=235) of patients as \n\ndefined in the present indication, who were treated with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids \n\n(≥500 µg/day fluticasone equivalent) plus long-acting beta agonist. \n\n \n\nA clinically significant exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms as judged \n\nclinically by the investigator, requiring doubling of the baseline inhaled corticosteroid dose for at least \n\n3 days and/or treatment with rescue systemic (oral or intravenous) corticosteroids for at least 3 days. \n\n \n\nIn the specific subgroup of patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroids, the omalizumab group had a \n\nstatistically significantly lower rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations than the placebo \n\ngroup. At 24 weeks, the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 34% (rate ratio \n\n0.662, p = 0.047) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. In the second double-blind 28-\n\nweek treatment period the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 63% (rate ratio \n\n0.37, p<0.001) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. \n\n \n\nDuring the 52-week double-blind treatment period (including the 24-week fixed-dose steroid phase \n\nand the 28-week steroid adjustment phase) the difference in rates between treatment groups \n\nrepresented a 50% (rate ratio 0.504, p<0.001) relative decrease in exacerbations for omalizumab \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nThe omalizumab group showed greater decreases in beta-agonist rescue medication use than the \n\nplacebo group at the end of the 52-week treatment period, although the difference between treatment \n\ngroups was not statistically significant. For the global evaluation of treatment effectiveness at the end \n\nof the 52-week double-blind treatment period in the subgroup of severe patients on high-dose inhaled \n\ncorticosteroids plus long-acting beta agonists, the proportion of patients rated as having ‘excellent’ \n\ntreatment effectiveness was higher, and the proportions having ‘moderate’ or ‘poor’ treatment \n\neffectiveness lower in the omalizumab group compared to the placebo group; the difference between \n\ngroups was statistically significant (p<0.001), while there were no differences between the \n\nomalizumab and placebo groups for patients’ subjective Quality of Life ratings. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n15 \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Xolair were evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \n\ntrials in patients with CRSwNP (Table 7). Patients received Xolair or placebo subcutaneously every 2 \n\nor 4 weeks (see section 4.2). All patients received background intranasal mometasone therapy \n\nthroughout the study.

There were no sino-nasal surgeries reported in either study. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of omalizumab have been studied in adult and adolescent patients with allergic \n\nasthma as well as in adult patients with CRSwNP. The general pharmacokinetic characteristics of \n\nomalizumab are similar in these patient populations. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nAfter subcutaneous administration, omalizumab is absorbed with an average absolute bioavailability \n\nof 62%. Following a single subcutaneous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma, \n\nomalizumab was absorbed slowly, reaching peak serum concentrations after an average of 7-8 days. \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of omalizumab are linear at doses greater than 0.5 mg/kg. Following multiple \n\ndoses of omalizumab, areas under the serum concentration-time curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady \n\nstate were up to 6-fold of those after the first dose. \n\n \n\nAdministration of Xolair manufactured as a lyophilised or liquid formulation resulted in similar serum \n\nconcentration-time profiles of omalizumab. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nIn vitro, omalizumab forms complexes of limited size with IgE. Precipitating complexes and \n\ncomplexes larger than one million Daltons in molecular weight are not observed in vitro or in vivo. \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution in patients following subcutaneous administration was \n\n78 ± 32 ml/kg. \n\n \n\nStudy 1 / Placebo (N=66) \n\nStudy 1 / Omalizumab (N=72) \n\nStudy 1 / Placebo (N=66) \n\nStudy 1 / Omalizumab (N=72) \n\n \n\nStudy 2 / Placebo (N=65) \n\nStudy 2 / Omalizumab (N=62) \n\n \n\nStudy 2 / Placebo (N=65) \n\nStudy 2 / Omalizumab (N=62) \n\n \n\nSecondary \n\nefficacy analysis \n\nSecondary \n\nefficacy analysis \n\nPrimary efficacy \n\nanalysis \n\nPrimary efficacy \n\nanalysis \n\nBaseline 24 20 16 12 8 4 4 8 12 16 20 24 \n\nWeek Week \n\nBaseline \nM\n\nea\nn\n c\n\nh\nan\n\ng\ne \n\nfr\no\nm\n\n b\nas\n\nel\nin\n\ne \nin\n\n N\nas\n\nal\n C\n\no\nn\ng\nes\n\nti\no\nn\n S\n\nco\nre\n\n \n\nM\nea\n\nn\n c\n\nh\nan\n\ng\ne \n\nfr\no\nm\n\n b\nas\n\nel\nin\n\ne \nin\n\n N\nas\n\nal\n P\n\no\nly\n\np\n S\n\nco\nre\n\n \n\n0.25 0.25 \n\n0.00 0.00 \n\n-0.25 -0.25 \n\n-0.50 -0.50 \n\n-0.75 -0.75 \n\n-1.00 -1.00 \n\n-1.25 -1.25 \n\n\n\n18 \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nClearance of omalizumab involves IgG clearance processes as well as clearance via specific binding \n\nand complex formation with its target ligand, IgE. Liver elimination of IgG includes degradation in the \n\nreticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells. Intact IgG is also excreted in bile. In asthma patients \n\nthe omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 26 days, with apparent clearance averaging \n\n2.4  1.1 ml/kg/day. In addition, doubling of body weight approximately doubled apparent clearance. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patient populations \n\n \nAge, Race/Ethnicity, Gender, Body Mass Index \n\nThe population pharmacokinetics of Xolair were analysed to evaluate the effects of demographic \n\ncharacteristics. Analyses of these limited data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age \n\n(6-76 years for patients with allergic asthma; 18 to 75 years for patients with CRSwNP), \n\nrace/ethnicity, gender or Body Mass Index (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\nThere are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data in patients with renal or hepatic impairment \n\n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe safety of omalizumab has been studied in the cynomolgus monkey, since omalizumab binds to \n\ncynomolgus and human IgE with similar affinity. Antibodies to omalizumab were detected in some \n\nmonkeys following repeated subcutaneous or intravenous administration. However, no apparent \n\ntoxicity, such as immune complex-mediated disease or complement-dependent cytotoxicity, was seen. \n\nThere was no evidence of an anaphylactic response due to mast-cell degranulation in cynomolgus \n\nmonkeys. \n\n \n\nChronic administration of omalizumab at dose levels of up to 250 mg/kg (at least 14 times the highest \n\nrecommended clinical dose in mg/kg according to the recommended dosing table) was well tolerated \n\nin non-human primates (both adult and juvenile animals), with the exception of a dose-related and age-\n\ndependent decrease in blood platelets, with a greater sensitivity in juvenile animals. The serum \n\nconcentration required to attain a 50% drop in platelets from baseline in adult cynomolgus monkeys \n\nwas roughly 4- to 20-fold higher than anticipated maximum clinical serum concentrations. In addition, \n\nacute haemorrhage and inflammation were observed at injection sites in cynomolgus monkeys. \n\n \n\nFormal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with omalizumab. \n\n \n\nIn reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg per week (at least \n\n8 times the highest recommended clinical dose in mg/kg over a 4-week period) did not elicit maternal \n\ntoxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity when administered throughout organogenesis and did not \n\nelicit adverse effects on foetal or neonatal growth when administered throughout late gestation, \n\ndelivery and nursing. \n\n \n\nOmalizumab is excreted in breast milk in cynomolgus monkeys. Milk levels of omalizumab were \n\n0.15% of the maternal serum concentration. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\n \n\nXolair is indicated in adults, adolescents and children (6 to <12 years of age). \n\n \n\nXolair treatment should only be considered for patients with convincing IgE (immunoglobulin E) \n\nmediated asthma (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAdults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) \n\nXolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent \n\nallergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and who \n\nhave reduced lung function (FEV1 <80%) as well as frequent daytime symptoms or night-time \n\nawakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-\n\ndose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist. \n\n \n\nChildren (6 to <12 years of age) \n\nXolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent \n\nallergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and \n\nfrequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe \n\nasthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-\n\nagonist. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n22 \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\n \n\nXolair is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids (INC) for the treatment of \n\nadults (18 years and above) with severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with INC does not provide \n\nadequate disease control. \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\n \n\nXolair is indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in adult and \n\nadolescent (12 years and above) patients with inadequate response to H1 antihistamine treatment. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nXolair treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe \n\npersistent asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) or chronic spontaneous \n\nurticaria. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nDosing for allergic asthma and CRSwNP follows the same dosing principles. The appropriate dose \n\nand frequency of Xolair for these conditions is determined by baseline IgE (IU/ml), measured before \n\nthe start of treatment, and body weight (kg). Prior to administration of the initial dose, patients should \n\nhave their IgE level determined by any commercial serum total IgE assay for their dose assignment. \n\nBased on these measurements, 75 to 600 mg of Xolair in 1 to 4 injections may be needed for each \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma patients with baseline IgE lower than 76 IU/ml were less likely to experience benefit \n\n(see section 5.1). Prescribing physicians should ensure that adult and adolescent patients with IgE \n\nbelow 76 IU/ml and children (6 to < 12 years of age) with IgE below 200 IU/ml have unequivocal in \n\nvitro reactivity (RAST) to a perennial allergen before starting therapy. \n\n \n\nSee Table 1 for a conversion chart and Tables 2 and 3 for the dose determination charts. \n\n \n\nPatients whose baseline IgE levels or body weight in kilograms are outside the limits of the dose table \n\nshould not be given Xolair. \n\n \n\nThe maximum recommended dose is 600 mg omalizumab every two weeks. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n23 \n\nTable 1 Conversion from dose to number of vials, number of injections and total injection \n\nvolume for each administration \n\n \n\nDose (mg) Number of vials Number of injections Total injection volume (ml) \n\n 75 mg a 150 mg b   \n\n75 1c 0 1 0.6 \n\n150 0 1 1 1.2 \n\n225 1c 1 2 1.8 \n\n300 0 2 2 2.4 \n\n375 1c 2 3 3.0 \n\n450 0 3 3 3.6 \n\n525 1c 3 4 4.2 \n\n600 0 4 4 4.8 \na 0.6 ml = maximum delivered volume per vial (Xolair 75 mg). \nb 1.2 ml = maximum delivered volume per vial (Xolair 150 mg). \n\nc or use 0.6 ml from a 150 mg vial. \n\n \n\nTable 2 ADMINISTRATION EVERY 4 WEEKS.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that it takes at least \n\n12-16 weeks for Xolair treatment to show effectiveness. At 16 weeks after commencing Xolair \n\ntherapy patients should be assessed by their physician for treatment effectiveness before further \n\ninjections are administered. The decision to continue Xolair following the 16-week timepoint, or on \n\nsubsequent occasions, should be based on whether a marked improvement in overall asthma control is \n\nseen (see section 5.1, Physician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness). \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nIn clinical trials for CRSwNP, changes in nasal polyps score (NPS) and nasal congestion score (NCS) \n\nwere observed at 4 weeks. The need for continued therapy should be periodically reassessed based \n\nupon the patient’s disease severity and level of symptom control. \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nDiscontinuation of Xolair treatment generally results in a return to elevated free IgE levels and \n\nassociated symptoms. Total IgE levels are elevated during treatment and remain elevated for up to one \n\nyear after the discontinuation of treatment. Therefore, re-testing of IgE levels during Xolair treatment \n\ncannot be used as a guide for dose determination. Dose determination after treatment interruptions \n\nlasting less than one year should be based on serum IgE levels obtained at the initial dose \n\ndetermination. Total serum IgE levels may be re-tested for dose determination if treatment with Xolair \n\nhas been interrupted for one year or more. \n\n \n\nDoses should be adjusted for significant changes in body weight (see Tables 2 and 3). \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\nThe recommended dose is 300 mg by subcutaneous injection every four weeks. \n\n \n\nPrescribers are advised to periodically reassess the need for continued therapy. \n\n \n\nClinical trial experience of long-term treatment beyond 6 months in this indication is limited. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly (65 years of age and older) \n\nThere are limited data available on the use of Xolair in patients older than 65 years but there is no \n\nevidence that elderly patients require a different dose from younger adult patients. \n\n \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment \n\nThere have been no studies on the effect of impaired renal or hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics \n\nof omalizumab. Because omalizumab clearance at clinical doses is dominated by the reticular \n\nendothelial system (RES) it is unlikely to be altered by renal or hepatic impairment. While no \n\nparticular dose adjustment is recommended for these patients, Xolair should be administered with \n\ncaution (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn allergic asthma, the safety and efficacy of Xolair in patients below the age of 6 years have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nIn CRSwNP, the safety and efficacy of Xolair in patients below the age of 18 years have not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nIn CSU, the safety and efficacy of Xolair in patients below the age of 12 years have not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor subcutaneous administration only. Xolair must not be administered by the intravenous or \n\nintramuscular route. \n\n \n\nDoses of more than 150 mg (Table 1) should be divided across two or more injection sites. \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience with self-administration of Xolair powder and solvent for solution for \n\ninjection. Therefore, treatment with this formulation is intended to be administered by a healthcare \n\nprovider only. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and \n\nalso information for the healthcare professional section of the package leaflet. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nXolair is not indicated for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations, acute bronchospasm or status \n\nasthmaticus. \n\n \n\nXolair has not been studied in patients with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome or allergic \n\nbronchopulmonary aspergillosis or for the prevention of anaphylactic reactions, including those \n\nprovoked by food allergy, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis. Xolair is not indicated for the \n\ntreatment of these conditions. \n\n \n\nXolair therapy has not been studied in patients with autoimmune diseases, immune complex-mediated \n\nconditions, or pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). Caution should be exercised \n\nwhen administering Xolair in these patient populations. \n\n \n\nAbrupt discontinuation of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids after initiation of Xolair therapy in \n\nallergic asthma or CRSwNP is not recommended. Decreases in corticosteroids should be performed \n\nunder the direct supervision of a physician and may need to be performed gradually. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions type I \n\nType I local or systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, may occur \n\nwhen taking omalizumab, even after a long duration of treatment. However, most of these reactions \n\noccurred within 2 hours after the first and subsequent injections of Xolair but some started beyond \n\n2 hours and even beyond 24 hours after the injection. The majority of anaphylactic reactions occurred \n\nwithin the first 3 doses of Xolair. A history of anaphylaxis unrelated to omalizumab may be a risk \n\nfactor for anaphylaxis following Xolair administration. Therefore medicinal products for the treatment \n\nof anaphylactic reactions should always be available for immediate use following administration of \n\nXolair. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Xolair must be \n\ndiscontinued immediately, and appropriate therapy initiated. Patients should be informed that such \n\nreactions are possible, and prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur. \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nAntibodies to omalizumab have been detected in a low number of patients in clinical trials (see \n\nsection 4.8). The clinical relevance of anti-Xolair antibodies is not well understood. \n\n \n\nSerum sickness \n\nSerum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions, which are delayed allergic type III reactions, have \n\nbeen seen in patients treated with humanised monoclonal antibodies including omalizumab. The \n\nsuggested pathophysiologic mechanism includes immune-complex formation and deposition due to \n\ndevelopment of antibodies against omalizumab. The onset has typically been 1-5 days after \n\nadministration of the first or subsequent injections, also after long duration of treatment. Symptoms \n\nsuggestive of serum sickness include arthritis/arthralgias, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever and \n\nlymphadenopathy. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be useful for preventing or treating this \n\ndisorder, and patients should be advised to report any suspected symptoms. \n\n \n\nChurg-Strauss syndrome and hypereosinophilic syndrome \n\nPatients with severe asthma may rarely present systemic hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic \n\neosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), both of which are usually treated \n\nwith systemic corticosteroids. \n\n \n\nIn rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma medicinal products, including omalizumab, may \n\npresent or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis. These events are commonly associated with \n\nthe reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. \n\n \n\nIn these patients, physicians should be alert to the development of marked eosinophilia, vasculitic \n\nrash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, paranasal sinus abnormalities, cardiac complications, and/or \n\nneuropathy. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation of omalizumab should be considered in all severe cases with the above mentioned \n\nimmune system disorders. \n\n \n\nParasitic (helminth) infections \n\n \n\nIgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. In patients at chronic \n\nhigh risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial in allergic patients showed a slight increase \n\nin infection rate with omalizumab, although the course, severity, and response to treatment of infection \n\nwere unaltered. The helminth infection rate in the overall clinical programme, which was not designed \n\nto detect such infections, was less than 1 in 1,000 patients. However, caution may be warranted in \n\npatients at high risk of helminth infection, in particular when travelling to areas where helminthic \n\ninfections are endemic. If patients do not respond to recommended anti-helminth treatment, \n\ndiscontinuation of Xolair should be considered. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nSince IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helmith infections, Xolair may \n\nindirectly reduce the efficacy of medicinal products for the treatment of helminthic or other parasitic \n\ninfections (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the \n\nclearance of omalizumab; thus, there is little potential for drug-drug interactions. Medicinal product or \n\nvaccine interaction studies have not been performed with Xolair. There is no pharmacological reason \n\nto expect that commonly prescribed medicinal products used in the treatment of asthma, CRSwNP or \n\nCSU will interact with omalizumab. \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nAllergic asthma \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies Xolair was commonly used in conjunction with inhaled and oral corticosteroids, \n\ninhaled short-acting and long-acting beta agonists, leukotriene modifiers, theophyllines and oral \n\nantihistamines. There was no indication that the safety of Xolair was altered with these other \n\ncommonly used anti-asthma medicinal products. Limited data are available on the use of Xolair in \n\ncombination with specific immunotherapy (hypo-sensitisation therapy). In a clinical trial where Xolair \n\nwas co-administered with immunotherapy, the safety and efficacy of Xolair in combination with \n\nspecific immunotherapy were found to be no different to that of Xolair alone. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies Xolair was used in conjunction with intranasal mometasone spray as per protocol. \n\nOther commonly used concomitant medicinal products included other intranasal corticosteroids, \n\nbronchodilators, antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, adrenergics/sympathomimetics and \n\nlocal nasal anaesthetics. There was no indication that the safety of Xolair was altered by the \n\nconcomitant use of these other commonly used medicinal products. \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies in CSU, Xolair was used in conjunction with antihistamines (anti-H1, anti-H2) and \n\nleukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs). There was no evidence that the safety of omalizumab was \n\naltered when used with these medicinal products relative to its known safety profile in allergic asthma. \n\nIn addition, a population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no relevant effect of H2 antihistamines and \n\nLTRAs on omalizumab pharmacokinetics (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nClinical studies in CSU included some patients aged 12 to 17 years taking Xolair in conjunction with \n\nantihistamines (anti-H1, anti-H2) and LTRAs. No studies have been performed in children under \n\n12 years. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nA moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1,000 pregnancy outcomes) based on \n\npregnancy registry and post-marketing spontaneous reports, indicates no malformative or \n\nfoeto/neonatal toxicity. A prospective pregnancy registry study (EXPECT) in 250 pregnant women \n\nwith asthma exposed to Xolair showed the prevalence of major congenital anomalies was similar \n\n(8.1% vs. 8.9%) between EXPECT and disease-matched (moderate and severe asthma) patients. The \n\ninterpretation of data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small \n\nsample size and non-randomised design. \n\n \n\nOmalizumab crosses the placental barrier. However, animal studies do not indicate either direct or \n\nindirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nOmalizumab has been associated with age-dependent decreases in blood platelets in non-human \n\nprimates, with a greater relative sensitivity in juvenile animals (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nIf clinically needed, the use of Xolair may be considered during pregnancy. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n29 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nImmunoglobulins G (IgGs) are present in human milk and therefore it is expected that omalizumab \n\nwill be present in human milk. Available data in non-human primates have shown excretion of \n\nomalizumab into milk (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nThe EXPECT study, with 154 infants who had been exposed to Xolair during pregnancy and through \n\nbreast-feeding did not indicate adverse effects on the breast-fed infant. The interpretation of data may \n\nbe impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-\n\nrandomised design. \n\n \n\nGiven orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and have poor bioavailability. \n\nNo effects on the breast-fed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, if clinically needed, the \n\nuse of Xolair may be considered during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no human fertility data for omalizumab. In specifically-designed non-clinical fertility \n\nstudies, in non-human primates including mating studies, no impairment of male or female fertility \n\nwas observed following repeated dosing with omalizumab at dose levels up to 75 mg/kg. Furthermore, \n\nno genotoxic effects were observed in a separate non-clinical genotoxicity study. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nXolair has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\n \n\nSummary of safety profile \n\nDuring allergic asthma clinical trials in adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older, the \n\nmost commonly reported adverse reactions were headaches and injection site reactions, including \n\ninjection site pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus. In clinical trials in children 6 to <12 years of age, \n\nthe most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, pyrexia and upper abdominal pain. \n\nMost of the reactions were mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials in patients ≥18 years of age \n\nin CRSwNP, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, dizziness, arthralgia, \n\nabdominal pain upper and injection site reactions. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nTable 4 lists the adverse reactions recorded in clinical studies in the total allergic asthma and CRSwNP \n\nsafety population treated with Xolair by MedDRA system organ class and frequency. Within each \n\nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequency \n\ncategories are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n\n<1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000). Reactions reported in the post-\n\nmarketing setting are listed with frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n30 \n\nTable 4 Adverse reactions in allergic asthma and CRSwNP \n\n \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nUncommon Pharyngitis \n\nRare Parasitic infection \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nNot known Idiopathic thrombocytopenia, including severe cases \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nRare Anaphylactic reaction, other serious allergic conditions, anti-\n\nomalizumab antibody development \n\nNot known Serum sickness, may include fever and lymphadenopathy \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon Headache* \n\nUncommon Syncope, paraesthesia, somnolence, dizziness# \n\nVascular disorders \n\nUncommon Postural hypotension, flushing \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Allergic bronchospasm, coughing \n\nRare Laryngoedema \n\nNot known Allergic granulomatous vasculitis (i.e. Churg-Strauss syndrome) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon Abdominal pain upper**,# \n\nUncommon Dyspeptic signs and symptoms, diarrhoea, nausea \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nUncommon Photosensitivity, urticaria, rash, pruritus \n\nRare Angioedema \n\nNot known Alopecia \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Athralgia† \nRare Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) \n\nNot known Myalgia, joint swelling \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nVery common Pyrexia** \n\nCommon Injection site reactions such as swelling, erythema, pain, pruritus \n\nUncommon Influenza-like illness, swelling arms, weight increase, fatigue \n\n*: Very common in children 6 to <12 years of age \n\n**: In children 6 to <12 years of age \n#: Common in nasal polyp trials \n\n†: Unknown in allergic asthma trials \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n31 \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\n \n\nSummary of safety profile \n\nThe safety and tolerability of omalizumab were investigated with doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nevery four weeks in 975 CSU patients, 242 of whom received placebo. Overall, 733 patients were \n\ntreated with omalizumab for up to 12 weeks and 490 patients for up to 24 weeks. Of those, \n\n412 patients were treated for up to 12 weeks and 333 patients were treated for up to 24 weeks at the \n\n300 mg dose. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nA separate table (Table 5) shows the adverse reactions for the CSU indication resulting from \n\ndifferences in dosages and treatment populations (with significantly different risk factors, \n\ncomorbidities, co-medications and ages [e.g. asthma trials included children from 6-12 years of age]). \n\n \n\nTable 5 lists the adverse reactions (events occurring in ≥1% of patients in any treatment group and \n\n≥2% more frequently in any omalizumab treatment group than with placebo (after medical review)) \n\nreported with 300 mg in the three pooled phase III studies. The adverse reactions presented are divided \n\ninto two groups: those identified in the 12-week and the 24-week treatment periods. \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the \n\nadverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions listed first. The \n\ncorresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: \n\nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 \n\nto <1/1000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nTable 5 Adverse reactions from the pooled CSU safety database (day 1 to week 24) at \n\n300 mg omalizumab \n\n \n\n12-Week \nOmalizumab studies 1, 2 and 3 Pooled Frequency category \n\nPlacebo N=242 300 mg N=412  \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nSinusitis 5 (2.1%) 20 (4.9%) Common \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nHeadache 7 (2.9%) 25 (6.1%) Common \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nArthralgia 1 (0.4%) 12 (2.9%) Common \n\nGeneral disorder and administration site conditions \nInjection site reaction* 2 (0.8%) 11 (2.7%) Common \n\n24-Week \nOmalizumab studies 1 and 3 Pooled Frequency category \n\nPlacebo N=163 300 mg N=333  \n\nInfections and infestations \nUpper respiratory tract \n\ninfection \n5 (3.1%) 19 (5.7%) Common \n\n* Despite not showing a 2% difference to placebo, injection site reactions were included as all cases \n\nwere assessed causally related to study treatment. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n32 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nFor further information, see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nAnaphylaxis \n\nAnaphylactic reactions were rare in clinical trials. However, post-marketing data following a \n\ncumulative search in the safety database retrieved a total of 898 anaphylaxis cases. Based on an \n\nestimated exposure of 566,923 patient treatment years, this results in a reporting rate of approximately \n\n0.20%. \n\n \n\nArterial thromboembolic events (ATE) \n\nIn controlled clinical trials and during interim analyses of an observational study, a numerical \n\nimbalance of ATE was observed. The definition of the composite endpoint ATE included stroke, \n\ntransient ischaemic attack, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiovascular death (including \n\ndeath from unknown cause). In the final analysis of the observational study, the rate of ATE per 1,000 \n\npatient years was 7.52 (115/15,286 patient years) for Xolair-treated patients and 5.12 (51/9,963 patient \n\nyears) for control patients. In a multivariate analysis controlling for available baseline cardiovascular \n\nrisk factors, the hazard ratio was 1.32 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.91). In a separate analysis of \n\npooled clinical trials, which included all randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials \n\nlasting 8 or more weeks, the rate of ATE per 1,000 patient years was 2.69 (5/1,856 patient years) for \n\nXolair-treated patients and 2.38 (4/1,680 patient years) for placebo patients (rate ratio 1.13, 95% \n\nconfidence interval 0.24-5.71). \n\n \n\nPlatelets \n\nIn clinical trials few patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of the normal laboratory range. \n\nNone of these changes were associated with bleeding episodes or a decrease in haemoglobin. No \n\npattern of persistent decrease in platelet counts, as observed in non-human primates (see section 5.3), \n\nhas been reported in humans (patients above 6 years of age), even though isolated cases of idiopathic \n\nthrombocytopenia, including severe cases, have been reported in the post-marketing setting. \n\n \n\nParasitic infections \n\nIn allergic patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight \n\nnumerical increase in infection rate with omalizumab that was not statistically significant. The course, \n\nseverity, and response to treatment of infections were unaltered (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nClinical trial and post-marketing cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in \n\npatients with moderate to severe asthma and CSU. The pathogenesis of SLE is not well understood. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nMaximum tolerated dose of Xolair has not been determined. Single intravenous doses up to 4,000 mg \n\nhave been administered to patients without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. The highest \n\ncumulative dose administered to patients was 44,000 mg over a 20-week period and this dose did not \n\nresult in any untoward acute effects. \n\n \n\nIf an overdose is suspected, the patient should be monitored for any abnormal signs or symptoms. \n\nMedical treatment should be sought and instituted appropriately. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for \n\nobstructive airway diseases, ATC code: R03DX05 \n\n \n\nOmalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to \n\nhuman immunoglobulin E (IgE). The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that contains human framework \n\nregions with the complementary-determining regions of a murine parent antibody that binds to IgE. \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nOmalizumab binds to IgE and prevents binding of IgE to FcRI (high-affinity IgE receptor) on \n\nbasophils and mast cells, thereby reducing the amount of free IgE that is available to trigger the \n\nallergic cascade. Treatment of atopic subjects with omalizumab resulted in a marked down-regulation \n\nof FcRI receptors on basophils. Treatment with Xolair inhibits IgE-mediated inflammation, as \n\nevidenced by reduced blood and tissue eosinophils and reduced inflammatory mediators, including \n\nIL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 by innate, adaptive and non-immune cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nThe in vitro histamine release from basophils isolated from Xolair-treated subjects was reduced by \n\napproximately 90% following stimulation with an allergen compared to pre-treatment values. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies in allergic asthma patients, serum free IgE levels were reduced in a dose-dependent \n\nmanner within one hour following the first dose and maintained between doses. One year after \n\ndiscontinuation of Xolair dosing, the IgE levels had returned to pre-treatment levels with no observed \n\nrebound in IgE levels after washout of the medicinal product. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nIn clinical studies in patients with CRSwNP, Xolair treatment led to a reduction in serum free IgE \n\n(approx. 95%) and an increase in serum total IgE levels, to a similar extent as observed in patients \n\nwith allergic asthma. Total IgE levels in serum increased due to the formation of omalizumab-IgE \n\ncomplexes that have a slower elimination rate compared with free IgE. \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nOmalizumab binds to IgE and lowers free IgE levels. Subsequently, IgE receptors (FcεRI) on cells \n\ndown-regulate. It is not entirely understood how this results in an improvement of CSU symptoms. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effect \n\nIn clinical studies in CSU patients, maximum suppression of free IgE was observed 3 days after the \n\nfirst subcutaneous dose. After repeated dosing once every 4 weeks, pre-dose serum free IgE levels \n\nremained stable between 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. After discontinuation of Xolair, free IgE levels \n\nincreased towards pre-treatment levels over a 16-week treatment-free follow-up period. \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nAdults and adolescents ≥12 years of age \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Xolair were demonstrated in a 28-week double-blind placebo-controlled \n\nstudy (study 1) involving 419 severe allergic asthmatics, ages 12-79 years, who had reduced lung \n\nfunction (FEV1 40-80% predicted) and poor asthma symptom control despite receiving high dose \n\ninhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Eligible patients had experienced multiple \n\nasthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment or had been hospitalised or attended \n\nan emergency room due to a severe asthma exacerbation in the past year despite continuous treatment \n\nwith high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Subcutaneous Xolair or \n\nplacebo were administered as add-on therapy to >1,000 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate (or \n\nequivalent) plus a long-acting beta2-agonist. Oral corticosteroid, theophylline and leukotriene-\n\nmodifier maintenance therapies were allowed (22%, 27%, and 35% of patients, respectively). \n\n \n\nThe rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with bursts of systemic corticosteroids was the \n\nprimary endpoint. Omalizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 19% (p = 0.153). Further \n\nevaluations which did show statistical significance (p<0.05) in favour of Xolair included reductions in \n\nsevere exacerbations (where patient’s lung function was reduced to below 60% of personal best and \n\nrequiring systemic corticosteroids) and asthma-related emergency visits (comprised of \n\nhospitalisations, emergency room, and unscheduled doctor visits), and improvements in Physician’s \n\noverall assessment of treatment effectiveness, Asthma-related Quality of Life (AQL), asthma \n\nsymptoms and lung function. \n\n \n\nIn a subgroup analysis, patients with pre-treatment total IgE ≥76 IU/ml were more likely to experience \n\nclinically meaningful benefit to Xolair. In these patients in study 1 Xolair reduced the rate of asthma \n\nexacerbations by 40% (p = 0.002). In addition more patients had clinically meaningful responses in the \n\ntotal IgE ≥76 IU/ml population across the Xolair severe asthma programme.

Treatment with Xolair in this open label study led to a 61% \n\nreduction in clinically significant asthma exacerbation rate compared to current asthma therapy alone. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nFour additional large placebo-controlled supportive studies of 28 to 52 weeks duration in 1,722 adults \n\nand adolescents (studies 3, 4, 5, 6) assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in patients with severe \n\npersistent asthma. Most patients were inadequately controlled but were receiving less concomitant \n\nasthma therapy than patients in studies 1 or 2. Studies 3-5 used exacerbation as primary endpoint, \n\nwhereas study 6 primarily evaluated inhaled corticosteroid sparing. \n\n \n\nIn studies 3, 4 and 5 patients treated with Xolair had respective reductions in asthma exacerbation \n\nrates of 37.5% (p = 0.027), 40.3% (p<0.001) and 57.6% (p<0.001) compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nIn study 6, significantly more severe allergic asthma patients on Xolair were able to reduce their \n\nfluticasone dose to 500 micrograms/day without deterioration of asthma control (60.3%) compared to \n\nthe placebo group (45.8%, p<0.05). \n\n \n\nQuality of life scores were measured using the Juniper Asthma-related Quality of Life Questionnaire. \n\nFor all six studies there was a statistically significant improvement from baseline in quality of life \n\nscores for Xolair patients versus the placebo or control group. \n\n \n\nPhysician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness: \n\nPhysician’s overall assessment was performed in five of the above studies as a broad measure of \n\nasthma control performed by the treating physician. The physician was able to take into account PEF \n\n(peak expiratory flow), day and night time symptoms, rescue medication use, spirometry and \n\nexacerbations. In all five studies a significantly greater proportion of Xolair treated patients were \n\njudged to have achieved either a marked improvement or complete control of their asthma compared \n\nto placebo patients. \n\n \n\nChildren 6 to <12 years of age \n\nThe primary support for safety and efficacy of Xolair in the group aged 6 to <12 years comes from one \n\nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial (study 7). \n\n \n\nStudy 7 was a placebo-controlled trial which included a specific subgroup (n=235) of patients as \n\ndefined in the present indication, who were treated with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids \n\n(≥500 µg/day fluticasone equivalent) plus long-acting beta agonist. \n\n \n\nA clinically significant exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms as judged \n\nclinically by the investigator, requiring doubling of the baseline inhaled corticosteroid dose for at least \n\n3 days and/or treatment with rescue systemic (oral or intravenous) corticosteroids for at least 3 days. \n\n \n\nIn the specific subgroup of patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroids, the omalizumab group had a \n\nstatistically significantly lower rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations than the placebo \n\ngroup. At 24 weeks, the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 34% (rate ratio \n\n0.662, p = 0.047) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. In the second double-blind 28-\n\nweek treatment period the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 63% (rate ratio \n\n0.37, p<0.001) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. \n\n \n\nDuring the 52-week double-blind treatment period (including the 24-week fixed-dose steroid phase \n\nand the 28-week steroid adjustment phase) the difference in rates between treatment groups \n\nrepresented a 50% (rate ratio 0.504, p<0.001) relative decrease in exacerbations for omalizumab \n\npatients. \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nThe omalizumab group showed greater decreases in beta-agonist rescue medication use than the \n\nplacebo group at the end of the 52-week treatment period, although the difference between treatment \n\ngroups was not statistically significant. For the global evaluation of treatment effectiveness at the end \n\nof the 52-week double-blind treatment period in the subgroup of severe patients on high-dose inhaled \n\ncorticosteroids plus long-acting beta agonists, the proportion of patients rated as having ‘excellent’ \n\ntreatment effectiveness was higher, and the proportions having ‘moderate’ or ‘poor’ treatment \n\neffectiveness lower in the omalizumab group compared to the placebo group; the difference between \n\ngroups was statistically significant (p<0.001), while there were no differences between the \n\nomalizumab and placebo groups for patients’ subjective Quality of Life ratings. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Xolair were evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \n\ntrials in patients with CRSwNP (Table 8). Patients received Xolair or placebo subcutaneously every 2 \n\nor 4 weeks (see section 4.2). All patients received background intranasal mometasone therapy \n\nthroughout the study. Prior sino-nasal surgery or prior systemic corticosteroid usage were not required \n\nfor inclusion in the studies. Patients received Xolair or placebo for 24 weeks followed by a 4-week \n\nfollow-up period.

The \n\nodds-ratio of having taken rescue treatment in Xolair compared to placebo was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.10, \n\n1.49). There were no sino-nasal surgeries reported in either study. \n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Xolair were demonstrated in two randomised, placebo-controlled phase III \n\nstudies (study 1 and 2) in patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine \n\ntherapy at the approved dose. A third study (study 3) primarily evaluated the safety of Xolair in \n\npatients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite treatment with H1 antihistamines at up to four \n\ntimes the approved dose and H2 antihistamine and/or LTRA treatment. The three studies enrolled \n\n975 patients aged between 12 and 75 years (mean age 42.3 years; 39 patients 12-17 years, 54 patients \n\n≥65 years; 259 males and 716 females). All patients were required to have inadequate symptom \n\ncontrol, as assessed by a weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7, range 0-42) of ≥16, and a weekly itch \n\nseverity score (which is a component of the UAS7; range 0-21) of ≥8 for the 7 days prior to \n\nrandomisation, despite having used an antihistamine for at least 2 weeks beforehand. \n\n \n\nIn studies 1 and 2, patients had a mean weekly itch severity score of between 13.7 and 14.5 at baseline \n\nand a mean UAS7 score of 29.5 and 31.7 respectively. Patients in safety study 3 had a mean weekly \n\nitch severity score of 13.8 and a mean UAS7 score of 31.2 at baseline. Across all three studies, \n\npatients reported receiving on average 4 to 6 medications (including H1 antihistamines) for CSU \n\nsymptoms prior to study enrollment.

Results for the 300 mg are available for 9 patients at week 12 and 6 patients at \n\nweek 24, and show a similar magnitude of response to omalizumab treatment compared to the adult \n\npopulation. Mean change from baseline in weekly itch severity score showed a reduction of 8.25 at \n\nweek 12 and of 8.95 at week 24.

The \n\ngeneral pharmacokinetic characteristics of omalizumab are similar in these patient populations. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nAfter subcutaneous administration, omalizumab is absorbed with an average absolute bioavailability \n\nof 62%. Following a single subcutaneous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma or CSU, \n\nomalizumab was absorbed slowly, reaching peak serum concentrations after an average of 6-8 days. In \n\npatients with asthma, following multiple doses of omalizumab, areas under the serum concentration-\n\ntime curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady state were up to 6-fold of those after the first dose. \n\n \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40\n\n      \n\nWeek 12 \n\nPrimary \n\nEndpoint Omalizumab 300 mg \n\nPlacebo \nM\n\nea\nn\n\n w\nee\n\nk\nly\n\n i\ntc\n\nh\n s\n\nev\ner\n\nit\ny\n\n s\nco\n\nre\n \n\nWeek \n\nOmalizumab or placebo administered \n\n\n\n41 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of omalizumab are linear at doses greater than 0.5 mg/kg. Following doses of \n\n75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg every 4 weeks in patients with CSU, trough serum concentrations of \n\nomalizumab increased proportionally with the dose level. \n\n \n\nAdministration of Xolair manufactured as a lyophilised or liquid formulation resulted in similar serum \n\nconcentration-time profiles of omalizumab. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nIn vitro, omalizumab forms complexes of limited size with IgE. Precipitating complexes and \n\ncomplexes larger than one million Daltons in molecular weight are not observed in vitro or in vivo. \n\nBased on population pharmacokinetics, distribution of omalizumab was similar in patients with \n\nallergic asthma and patients with CSU. The apparent volume of distribution in patients with asthma \n\nfollowing subcutaneous administration was 78 ± 32 ml/kg. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nClearance of omalizumab involves IgG clearance processes as well as clearance via specific binding \n\nand complex formation with its target ligand, IgE. Liver elimination of IgG includes degradation in the \n\nreticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells. Intact IgG is also excreted in bile. In asthma patients \n\nthe omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 26 days, with apparent clearance averaging \n\n2.4  1.1 ml/kg/day. Doubling of body weight approximately doubled apparent clearance. In CSU \n\npatients, based on population pharmacokinetic simulations, omalizumab serum elimination half-life at \n\nsteady state averaged 24 days and apparent clearance at steady state for a patient of 80 kg weight was \n\n3.0 ml/kg/day. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patient populations \n\n \n\nAge, Race/Ethnicity, Gender, Body Mass Index \n\nPatients with allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nThe population pharmacokinetics of omalizumab were analysed to evaluate the effects of demographic \n\ncharacteristics. Analyses of these limited data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age \n\n(6-76 years for patients with allergic asthma; 18 to 75 years for patients with CRSwNP), \n\nrace/ethnicity, gender or body mass index (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPatients with CSU \n\nThe effects of demographic characteristics and other factors on omalizumab exposure were evaluated \n\nbased on population pharmacokinetics. In addition, covariate effects were evaluated by analysing the \n\nrelationship between omalizumab concentrations and clinical responses. These analyses suggest that \n\nno dose adjustments are necessary in patients with CSU for age (12-75 years), race/ethnicity, gender, \n\nbody weight, body mass index, baseline IgE, anti-FcRI autoantibodies or concomitant use of H2 \n\nantihistamines or LTRAs. \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\nThere are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data in allergic asthma or CSU patients with renal \n\nor hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe safety of omalizumab has been studied in the cynomolgus monkey, since omalizumab binds to \n\ncynomolgus and human IgE with similar affinity. Antibodies to omalizumab were detected in some \n\nmonkeys following repeated subcutaneous or intravenous administration. However, no apparent \n\ntoxicity, such as immune complex-mediated disease or complement-dependent cytotoxicity, was seen. \n\nThere was no evidence of an anaphylactic response due to mast-cell degranulation in cynomolgus \n\nmonkeys. \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nChronic administration of omalizumab at dose levels of up to 250 mg/kg (at least 14 times the highest \n\nrecommended clinical dose in mg/kg according to the recommended dosing table) was well tolerated \n\nin non-human primates (both adult and juvenile animals), with the exception of a dose-related and age-\n\ndependent decrease in blood platelets, with a greater sensitivity in juvenile animals. The serum \n\nconcentration required to attain a 50% drop in platelets from baseline in adult cynomolgus monkeys \n\nwas roughly 4- to 20-fold higher than anticipated maximum clinical serum concentrations. In addition, \n\nacute haemorrhage and inflammation were observed at injection sites in cynomolgus monkeys. \n\n \n\nFormal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with omalizumab. \n\n \n\nIn reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg per week (at least \n\n8 times the highest recommended clinical dose in mg/kg over a 4-week period) did not elicit maternal \n\ntoxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity when administered throughout organogenesis and did not \n\nelicit adverse effects on foetal or neonatal growth when administered throughout late gestation, \n\ndelivery and nursing. \n\n \n\nOmalizumab is excreted in breast milk in cynomolgus monkeys. Milk levels of omalizumab were \n\n0.15% of the maternal serum concentration. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\n \n\nXolair is indicated in adults, adolescents and children (6 to <12 years of age). \n\n \n\nXolair treatment should only be considered for patients with convincing IgE (immunoglobulin E) \n\nmediated asthma (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAdults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) \n\nXolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent \n\nallergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and who \n\nhave reduced lung function (FEV1 <80%) as well as frequent daytime symptoms or night-time \n\nawakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-\n\ndose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist. \n\n \n\nChildren (6 to <12 years of age) \n\nXolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent \n\nallergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and \n\nfrequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe \n\nasthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-\n\nagonist. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\n \n\nXolair is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids (INC) for the treatment of \n\nadults (18 years and above) with severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with INC does not provide \n\nadequate disease control. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n46 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nXolair treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe \n\npersistent asthma or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nDosing for allergic asthma and CRSwNP follows the same dosing principles. The appropriate dose \n\nand frequency of Xolair for these conditions is determined by baseline IgE (IU/ml), measured before \n\nthe start of treatment, and body weight (kg). Prior to administration of the initial dose, patients should \n\nhave their IgE level determined by any commercial serum total IgE assay for their dose assignment. \n\nBased on these measurements, 75 to 600 mg of Xolair in 1 to 4 injections may be needed for each \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma patients with baseline IgE lower than 76 IU/ml were less likely to experience benefit \n\n(see section 5.1). Prescribing physicians should ensure that adult and adolescent patients with IgE \n\nbelow 76 IU/ml and children (6 to < 12 years of age) with IgE below 200 IU/ml have unequivocal in \n\nvitro reactivity (RAST) to a perennial allergen before starting therapy. \n\n \n\nSee Table 1 for a conversion chart and Tables 2 and 3 for the dose determination charts. \n\n \n\nPatients whose baseline IgE levels or body weight in kilograms are outside the limits of the dose table \n\nshould not be given Xolair. \n\n \n\nThe maximum recommended dose is 600 mg omalizumab every two weeks. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Conversion from dose to number of syringes, number of injections and total \n\ninjection volume for each administration \n\n \n\nDose (mg) Number of syringes Number of injections Total injection volume (ml) \n\n 75 mg  150 mg    \n\n75 1 0 1 0.5 \n\n150 0 1 1 1.0 \n\n225 1 1 2 1.5 \n\n300 0 2 2 2.0 \n\n375 1 2 3 2.5 \n\n450 0 3 3 3.0 \n\n525 1 3 4 3.5 \n\n600 0 4 4 4.0 \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nTable 2 ADMINISTRATION EVERY 4 WEEKS.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that it takes at least \n\n12-16 weeks for Xolair treatment to show effectiveness. At 16 weeks after commencing Xolair \n\ntherapy patients should be assessed by their physician for treatment effectiveness before further \n\ninjections are administered. The decision to continue Xolair following the 16-week timepoint, or on \n\nsubsequent occasions, should be based on whether a marked improvement in overall asthma control is \n\nseen (see section 5.1, Physician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness). \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nIn clinical trials for CRSwNP, changes in nasal polyps score (NPS) and nasal congestion score (NCS) \n\nwere observed at 4 weeks. The need for continued therapy should be periodically reassessed based \n\nupon the patient’s disease severity and level of symptom control. \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nDiscontinuation of Xolair treatment generally results in a return to elevated free IgE levels and \n\nassociated symptoms. Total IgE levels are elevated during treatment and remain elevated for up to one \n\nyear after the discontinuation of treatment. Therefore, re-testing of IgE levels during Xolair treatment \n\ncannot be used as a guide for dose determination. Dose determination after treatment interruptions \n\nlasting less than one year should be based on serum IgE levels obtained at the initial dose \n\ndetermination. Total serum IgE levels may be re-tested for dose determination if treatment with Xolair \n\nhas been interrupted for one year or more. \n\n \n\nDoses should be adjusted for significant changes in body weight (see Tables 2 and 3). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly (65 years of age and older) \n\nThere are limited data available on the use of Xolair in patients older than 65 years but there is no \n\nevidence that elderly patients require a different dose from younger adult patients. \n\n \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment \n\nThere have been no studies on the effect of impaired renal or hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics \n\nof Xolair. Because omalizumab clearance at clinical doses is dominated by the reticular endothelial \n\nsystem (RES) it is unlikely to be altered by renal or hepatic impairment. While no particular dose \n\nadjustment is recommended for these patients, Xolair should be administered with caution (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn allergic asthma, the safety and efficacy of Xolair in patients below the age of 6 years have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nIn CRSwNP, the safety and efficacy of Xolair in patients below the age of 18 years have not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor subcutaneous administration only. Xolair must not be administered by the intravenous or \n\nintramuscular route. \n\n \n\nDoses of more than 150 mg (Table 1) should be divided across two or more injection sites. \n\n \n\nPatients with no known history of anaphylaxis may self-inject Xolair or be injected by a caregiver \n\nfrom the 4th dose onwards if a physician determines that this is appropriate (see section 4.4). The \n\npatient or the caregiver must have been trained in the correct injection technique and the recognition of \n\nthe early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions. \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nPatients or caregivers should be instructed to inject the full amount of Xolair according to the \n\ninstructions provided in the package leaflet. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nXolair is not indicated for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations, acute bronchospasm or status \n\nasthmaticus. \n\n \n\nXolair has not been studied in patients with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome or allergic \n\nbronchopulmonary aspergillosis or for the prevention of anaphylactic reactions, including those \n\nprovoked by food allergy, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis. Xolair is not indicated for the \n\ntreatment of these conditions. \n\n \n\nXolair therapy has not been studied in patients with autoimmune diseases, immune complex-mediated \n\nconditions, or pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). Caution should be exercised \n\nwhen administering Xolair in these patient populations. \n\n \n\nAbrupt discontinuation of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids after initiation of Xolair therapy in \n\nallergic asthma or CRSwNP is not recommended. Decreases in corticosteroids should be performed \n\nunder the direct supervision of a physician and may need to be performed gradually. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions type I \n\nType I local or systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, may occur \n\nwhen taking omalizumab, even after a long duration of treatment. However, most of these reactions \n\noccurred within 2 hours after the first and subsequent injections of Xolair but some started beyond \n\n2 hours and even beyond 24 hours after the injection. The majority of anaphylactic reactions occurred \n\nwithin the first 3 doses of Xolair. Therefore, the first 3 doses must be administered either by or under \n\nthe supervision of a healthcare professional. A history of anaphylaxis unrelated to omalizumab may be \n\na risk factor for anaphylaxis following Xolair administration. Therefore for patients with a known \n\nhistory of anaphylaxis, Xolair must be administered by a health care professional, who should always \n\nhave medicinal products for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions available for immediate use \n\nfollowing administration of Xolair. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, \n\nadministration of Xolair must be discontinued immediately, and appropriate therapy initiated. Patients \n\nshould be informed that such reactions are possible, and prompt medical attention should be sought if \n\nallergic reactions occur. \n\n \n\nAntibodies to omalizumab have been detected in a low number of patients in clinical trials (see \n\nsection 4.8). The clinical relevance of anti-Xolair antibodies is not well understood. \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nSerum sickness \n\nSerum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions, which are delayed allergic type III reactions, have \n\nbeen seen in patients treated with humanised monoclonal antibodies including omalizumab. The \n\nsuggested pathophysiologic mechanism includes immune-complex formation and deposition due to \n\ndevelopment of antibodies against omalizumab. The onset has typically been 1-5 days after \n\nadministration of the first or subsequent injections, also after long duration of treatment. Symptoms \n\nsuggestive of serum sickness include arthritis/arthralgias, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever and \n\nlymphadenopathy. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be useful for preventing or treating this \n\ndisorder, and patients should be advised to report any suspected symptoms. \n\n \n\nChurg-Strauss syndrome and hypereosinophilic syndrome \n\nPatients with severe asthma may rarely present systemic hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic \n\neosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), both of which are usually treated \n\nwith systemic corticosteroids. \n\n \n\nIn rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma medicinal products, including omalizumab, may \n\npresent or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis. These events are commonly associated with \n\nthe reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. \n\n \n\nIn these patients, physicians should be alert to the development of marked eosinophilia, vasculitic \n\nrash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, paranasal sinus abnormalities, cardiac complications, and/or \n\nneuropathy. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation of omalizumab should be considered in all severe cases with the above mentioned \n\nimmune system disorders. \n\n \n\nParasitic (helminth) infections \n\n \n\nIgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. In patients at chronic \n\nhigh risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight increase in infection rate \n\nwith omalizumab, although the course, severity, and response to treatment of infection were unaltered. \n\nThe helminth infection rate in the overall clinical programme, which was not designed to detect such \n\ninfections, was less than 1 in 1,000 patients. However, caution may be warranted in patients at high \n\nrisk of helminth infection, in particular when travelling to areas where helminthic infections are \n\nendemic. If patients do not respond to recommended anti-helminth treatment, discontinuation of \n\nXolair should be considered. \n\n \n\nLatex-sensitive individuals \n\n \n\nThe removable needle cap of this pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of natural rubber latex. No \n\nnatural rubber latex has to date been detected in the removable needle cap. Nevertheless, the use of \n\nXolair solution for injection in pre-filled syringe in latex-sensitive individuals has not been studied and \n\nthus there is a potential risk for hypersensitivity reactions which cannot be completely ruled out. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nSince IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections, Xolair may \n\nindirectly reduce the efficacy of medicinal products for the treatment of helminthic or other parasitic \n\ninfections (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the \n\nclearance of omalizumab; thus, there is little potential for drug-drug interactions. Medicinal product or \n\nvaccine interaction studies have not been performed with Xolair. There is no pharmacological reason \n\nto expect that commonly prescribed medicinal products used in the treatment of asthma or CRSwNP \n\nwill interact with omalizumab. \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n\nAllergic asthma \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies Xolair was commonly used in conjunction with inhaled and oral corticosteroids, \n\ninhaled short-acting and long-acting beta agonists, leukotriene modifiers, theophyllines and oral \n\nantihistamines. There was no indication that the safety of Xolair was altered with these other \n\ncommonly used anti-asthma medicinal products. Limited data are available on the use of Xolair in \n\ncombination with specific immunotherapy (hypo-sensitisation therapy). In a clinical trial where Xolair \n\nwas co-administered with immunotherapy, the safety and efficacy of Xolair in combination with \n\nspecific immunotherapy were found to be no different to that of Xolair alone. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies Xolair was used in conjunction with intranasal mometasone spray as per protocol. \n\nOther commonly used concomitant medicinal products included other intranasal corticosteroids, \n\nbronchodilators, antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, adrenergics/sympathomimetics and \n\nlocal nasal anaesthetics. There was no indication that the safety of Xolair was altered by the \n\nconcomitant use of these other commonly used medicinal products. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nA moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1,000 pregnancy outcomes) based on \n\npregnancy registry and post-marketing spontaneous reports, indicates no malformative or \n\nfoeto/neonatal toxicity. A prospective pregnancy registry study (EXPECT) in 250 pregnant women \n\nwith asthma exposed to Xolair showed the prevalence of major congenital anomalies was similar \n\n(8.1% vs. 8.9%) between EXPECT and disease-matched (moderate and severe asthma) patients. The \n\ninterpretation of data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small \n\nsample size and non-randomised design. \n\n \n\nOmalizumab crosses the placental barrier. However, animal studies do not indicate either direct or \n\nindirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nOmalizumab has been associated with age-dependent decreases in blood platelets in non-human \n\nprimates, with a greater relative sensitivity in juvenile animals (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nIf clinically needed, the use of Xolair may be considered during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nImmunoglobulins G (IgGs) are present in human milk and therefore it is expected that omalizumab \n\nwill be present in human milk. Available data in non-human primates have shown excretion of \n\nomalizumab into milk (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nThe EXPECT study, with 154 infants who had been exposed to Xolair during pregnancy and through \n\nbreast-feeding did not indicate adverse effects on the breast-fed infant. The interpretation of data may \n\nbe impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-\n\nrandomised design. \n\n \n\nGiven orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and have poor bioavailability. \n\nNo effects on the breast-fed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, if clinically needed, the \n\nuse of Xolair may be considered during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\n\n\n53 \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no human fertility data for omalizumab. In specifically-designed non-clinical fertility \n\nstudies, in non-human primates including mating studies, no impairment of male or female fertility \n\nwas observed following repeated dosing with omalizumab at dose levels up to 75 mg/kg. Furthermore, \n\nno genotoxic effects were observed in a separate non-clinical genotoxicity study. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nXolair has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nDuring allergic asthma clinical trials in adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older, the \n\nmost commonly reported adverse reactions were headaches and injection site reactions, including \n\ninjection site pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus. In clinical trials in children 6 to <12 years of age, \n\nthe most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, pyrexia and upper abdominal pain. \n\nMost of the reactions were mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials in patients ≥18 years of age \n\nin CRSwNP, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, dizziness, arthralgia, \n\nabdominal pain upper and injection site reactions. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nTable 4 lists the adverse reactions recorded in clinical studies in the total allergic asthma and CRSwNP \n\nsafety population treated with Xolair by MedDRA system organ class and frequency. Within each \n\nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequency \n\ncategories are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n\n<1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000). Reactions reported in the post-\n\nmarketing setting are listed with frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n54 \n\nTable 4 Adverse reactions in allergic asthma and CRSwNP \n\n \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nUncommon Pharyngitis \n\nRare Parasitic infection \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nNot known Idiopathic thrombocytopenia, including severe cases \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nRare Anaphylactic reaction, other serious allergic conditions, anti-\n\nomalizumab antibody development \n\nNot known Serum sickness, may include fever and lymphadenopathy \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon Headache* \n\nUncommon Syncope, paraesthesia, somnolence, dizziness# \n\nVascular disorders \n\nUncommon Postural hypotension, flushing \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Allergic bronchospasm, coughing \n\nRare Laryngoedema \n\nNot known Allergic granulomatous vasculitis (i.e. Churg-Strauss syndrome) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon Abdominal pain upper**,# \n\nUncommon Dyspeptic signs and symptoms, diarrhoea, nausea \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nUncommon Photosensitivity, urticaria, rash, pruritus \n\nRare Angioedema \n\nNot known Alopecia \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Athralgia† \nRare Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) \n\nNot known Myalgia, joint swelling \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nVery common Pyrexia** \n\nCommon Injection site reactions such as swelling, erythema, pain, pruritus \n\nUncommon Influenza-like illness, swelling arms, weight increase, fatigue \n\n*: Very common in children 6 to <12 years of age \n\n**: In children 6 to <12 years of age \n#: Common in nasal polyp trials \n\n†: Unknown in allergic asthma trials \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nFor further information, see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nAnaphylaxis \n\nAnaphylactic reactions were rare in clinical trials. However, post-marketing data following a \n\ncumulative search in the safety database retrieved a total of 898 anaphylaxis cases. Based on an \n\nestimated exposure of 566,923 patient treatment years, this results in a reporting rate of approximately \n\n0.20%. \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nArterial thromboembolic events (ATE) \n\nIn controlled clinical trials and during interim analyses of an observational study, a numerical \n\nimbalance of ATE was observed. The definition of the composite endpoint ATE included stroke, \n\ntransient ischaemic attack, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiovascular death (including \n\ndeath from unknown cause). In the final analysis of the observational study, the rate of ATE per 1,000 \n\npatient years was 7.52 (115/15,286 patient years) for Xolair-treated patients and 5.12 (51/9,963 patient \n\nyears) for control patients. In a multivariate analysis controlling for available baseline cardiovascular \n\nrisk factors, the hazard ratio was 1.32 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.91). In a separate analysis of \n\npooled clinical trials, which included all randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials \n\nlasting 8 or more weeks, the rate of ATE per 1,000 patient years was 2.69 (5/1,856 patient years) for \n\nXolair-treated patients and 2.38 (4/1,680 patient years) for placebo patients (rate ratio 1.13, 95% \n\nconfidence interval 0.24-5.71). \n\n \n\nPlatelets \n\nIn clinical trials few patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of the normal laboratory range. \n\nNone of these changes were associated with bleeding episodes or a decrease in haemoglobin. No \n\npattern of persistent decrease in platelet counts, as observed in non-human primates (see section 5.3), \n\nhas been reported in humans (patients above 6 years of age), even though isolated cases of idiopathic \n\nthrombocytopenia, including severe cases, have been reported in the post-marketing setting. \n\n \n\nParasitic infections \n\nIn patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight \n\nnumerical increase in infection rate with omalizumab that was not statistically significant. The course, \n\nseverity, and response to treatment of infections were unaltered (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nClinical trial and post-marketing cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in \n\npatients with moderate to severe asthma and CSU. The pathogenesis of SLE is not well understood. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nMaximum tolerated dose of Xolair has not been determined. Single intravenous doses up to 4,000 mg \n\nhave been administered to patients without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. The highest \n\ncumulative dose administered to patients was 44,000 mg over a 20-week period and this dose did not \n\nresult in any untoward acute effects. \n\n \n\nIf an overdose is suspected, the patient should be monitored for any abnormal signs or symptoms. \n\nMedical treatment should be sought and instituted appropriately. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n56 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for \n\nobstructive airway diseases, ATC code: R03DX05 \n\n \n\nOmalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to \n\nhuman immunoglobulin E (IgE). The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that contains human framework \n\nregions with the complementary-determining regions of a murine parent antibody that binds to IgE. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nOmalizumab binds to IgE and prevents binding of IgE to FcRI (high-affinity IgE receptor) on \n\nbasophils and mast cells, thereby reducing the amount of free IgE that is available to trigger the \n\nallergic cascade. Treatment of atopic subjects with omalizumab resulted in a marked down-regulation \n\nof FcRI receptors on basophils. Treatment with Xolair inhibits IgE-mediated inflammation, as \n\nevidenced by reduced blood and tissue eosinophils and reduced inflammatory mediators, including IL-\n\n4, IL-5, and IL-13 by innate, adaptive and non-immune cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nThe in vitro histamine release from basophils isolated from Xolair-treated subjects was reduced by \n\napproximately 90% following stimulation with an allergen compared to pre-treatment values. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies in allergic asthma patients, serum free IgE levels were reduced in a dose-dependent \n\nmanner within one hour following the first dose and maintained between doses. One year after \n\ndiscontinuation of Xolair dosing, the IgE levels had returned to pre-treatment levels with no observed \n\nrebound in IgE levels after washout of the medicinal product. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nIn clinical studies in patients with CRSwNP, Xolair treatment led to a reduction in serum free IgE \n\n(approx. 95%) and an increase in serum total IgE levels, to a similar extent as observed in patients \n\nwith allergic asthma. Total IgE levels in serum increased due to the formation of omalizumab-IgE \n\ncomplexes that have a slower elimination rate compared with free IgE. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma \nAdults and adolescents ≥12 years of age \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Xolair were demonstrated in a 28-week double-blind placebo-controlled \n\nstudy (study 1) involving 419 severe allergic asthmatics, ages 12-79 years, who had reduced lung \n\nfunction (FEV1 40-80% predicted) and poor asthma symptom control despite receiving high dose \n\ninhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Eligible patients had experienced multiple \n\nasthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment or had been hospitalised or attended \n\nan emergency room due to a severe asthma exacerbation in the past year despite continuous treatment \n\nwith high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Subcutaneous Xolair or \n\nplacebo were administered as add-on therapy to >1,000 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate (or \n\nequivalent) plus a long-acting beta2-agonist. Oral corticosteroid, theophylline and leukotriene-\n\nmodifier maintenance therapies were allowed (22%, 27%, and 35% of patients, respectively). \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n\nThe rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with bursts of systemic corticosteroids was the \n\nprimary endpoint. Omalizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 19% (p = 0.153). Further \n\nevaluations which did show statistical significance (p<0.05) in favour of Xolair included reductions in \n\nsevere exacerbations (where patient’s lung function was reduced to below 60% of personal best and \n\nrequiring systemic corticosteroids) and asthma-related emergency visits (comprised of \n\nhospitalisations, emergency room, and unscheduled doctor visits), and improvements in Physician’s \n\noverall assessment of treatment effectiveness, Asthma-related Quality of Life (AQL), asthma \n\nsymptoms and lung function. \n\n \n\nIn a subgroup analysis, patients with pre-treatment total IgE ≥76 IU/ml were more likely to experience \n\nclinically meaningful benefit to Xolair. In these patients in study 1 Xolair reduced the rate of asthma \n\nexacerbations by 40% (p = 0.002). In addition more patients had clinically meaningful responses in the \n\ntotal IgE ≥76 IU/ml population across the Xolair severe asthma programme. Table 5 includes results in \n\nthe study 1 population. \n\n \n\nTable 5 Results of study 1 \n\n \n\n Whole study 1 population \n\n Xolair \n\nN=209 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=210 \n\nAsthma exacerbations   \n\nRate per 28-week period 0.74 0.92 \n\n% reduction, p-value for rate ratio 19.4%, p = 0.153 \n\nSevere asthma exacerbations   \n\nRate per 28-week period 0.24 0.48 \n\n% reduction, p-value for rate ratio 50.1%, p = 0.002 \n\nEmergency visits   \n\nRate per 28-week period 0.24 0.43 \n\n% reduction, p-value for rate ratio 43.9%, p = 0.038 \n\nPhysician’s overall assessment   \n\n% responders* 60.5% 42.8% \n\np-value** <0.001 \n\nAQL improvement   \n\n% of patients ≥0.5 improvement 60.8% 47.8% \n\np-value 0.008 \n\n* marked improvement or complete control \n\n** p-value for overall distribution of assessment \n\n \n\nStudy 2 assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in a population of 312 severe allergic asthmatics \n\nwhich matched the population in study 1. Treatment with Xolair in this open label study led to a 61% \n\nreduction in clinically significant asthma exacerbation rate compared to current asthma therapy alone. \n\n \n\nFour additional large placebo-controlled supportive studies of 28 to 52 weeks duration in 1,722 adults \n\nand adolescents (studies 3, 4, 5, 6) assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in patients with severe \n\npersistent asthma. Most patients were inadequately controlled but were receiving less concomitant \n\nasthma therapy than patients in studies 1 or 2. Studies 3-5 used exacerbation as primary endpoint, \n\nwhereas study 6 primarily evaluated inhaled corticosteroid sparing. \n\n \n\nIn studies 3, 4 and 5 patients treated with Xolair had respective reductions in asthma exacerbation \n\nrates of 37.5% (p = 0.027), 40.3% (p<0.001) and 57.6% (p<0.001) compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nIn study 6, significantly more severe allergic asthma patients on Xolair were able to reduce their \n\nfluticasone dose to 500 micrograms/day without deterioration of asthma control (60.3%) compared to \n\nthe placebo group (45.8%, p<0.05). \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n\nQuality of life scores were measured using the Juniper Asthma-related Quality of Life Questionnaire. \n\nFor all six studies there was a statistically significant improvement from baseline in quality of life \n\nscores for Xolair patients versus the placebo or control group. \n\n \n\nPhysician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness: \n\nPhysician’s overall assessment was performed in five of the above studies as a broad measure of \n\nasthma control performed by the treating physician. The physician was able to take into account PEF \n\n(peak expiratory flow), day and night time symptoms, rescue medication use, spirometry and \n\nexacerbations. In all five studies a significantly greater proportion of Xolair treated patients were \n\njudged to have achieved either a marked improvement or complete control of their asthma compared \n\nto placebo patients. \n\n \n\nChildren 6 to <12 years of age \n\nThe primary support for safety and efficacy of Xolair in the group aged 6 to <12 years comes from one \n\nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial (study 7). \n\n \n\nStudy 7 was a placebo-controlled trial which included a specific subgroup (n=235) of patients as \n\ndefined in the present indication, who were treated with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids \n\n(≥500 µg/day fluticasone equivalent) plus long-acting beta agonist. \n\n \n\nA clinically significant exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms as judged \n\nclinically by the investigator, requiring doubling of the baseline inhaled corticosteroid dose for at least \n\n3 days and/or treatment with rescue systemic (oral or intravenous) corticosteroids for at least 3 days. \n\n \n\nIn the specific subgroup of patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroids, the omalizumab group had a \n\nstatistically significantly lower rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations than the placebo \n\ngroup. At 24 weeks, the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 34% (rate ratio \n\n0.662, p = 0.047) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. In the second double-blind 28-\n\nweek treatment period the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 63% (rate ratio \n\n0.37, p<0.001) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. \n\n \n\nDuring the 52-week double-blind treatment period (including the 24-week fixed-dose steroid phase \n\nand the 28-week steroid adjustment phase) the difference in rates between treatment groups \n\nrepresented a 50% (rate ratio 0.504, p<0.001) relative decrease in exacerbations for omalizumab \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nThe omalizumab group showed greater decreases in beta-agonist rescue medication use than the \n\nplacebo group at the end of the 52-week treatment period, although the difference between treatment \n\ngroups was not statistically significant. For the global evaluation of treatment effectiveness at the end \n\nof the 52-week double-blind treatment period in the subgroup of severe patients on high-dose inhaled \n\ncorticosteroids plus long-acting beta agonists, the proportion of patients rated as having ‘excellent’ \n\ntreatment effectiveness was higher, and the proportions having ‘moderate’ or ‘poor’ treatment \n\neffectiveness lower in the omalizumab group compared to the placebo group; the difference between \n\ngroups was statistically significant (p<0.001), while there were no differences between the \n\nomalizumab and placebo groups for patients’ subjective Quality of Life ratings. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n59 \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Xolair were evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \n\ntrials in patients with CRSwNP (Table 7). Patients received Xolair or placebo subcutaneously every 2 \n\nor 4 weeks (see section 4.2). All patients received background intranasal mometasone therapy \n\nthroughout the study. Prior sino-nasal surgery or prior systemic corticosteroid usage were not required \n\nfor inclusion in the studies. Patients received Xolair or placebo for 24 weeks followed by a 4-week \n\nfollow-up period.

The \n\nodds-ratio of having taken rescue treatment in Xolair compared to placebo was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.10, \n\n1.49). There were no sino-nasal surgeries reported in either study. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of omalizumab have been studied in adult and adolescent patients with allergic \n\nasthma as well as in adult patients with CRSwNP. The general pharmacokinetic characteristics of \n\nomalizumab are similar in these patient populations. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nAfter subcutaneous administration, omalizumab is absorbed with an average absolute bioavailability \n\nof 62%. Following a single subcutaneous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma, \n\nomalizumab was absorbed slowly, reaching peak serum concentrations after an average of 7-8 days. \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of omalizumab are linear at doses greater than 0.5 mg/kg. Following multiple \n\ndoses of omalizumab, areas under the serum concentration-time curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady \n\nstate were up to 6-fold of those after the first dose. \n\n \n\nAdministration of Xolair manufactured as a lyophilised or liquid formulation resulted in similar serum \n\nconcentration-time profiles of omalizumab. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nIn vitro, omalizumab forms complexes of limited size with IgE. Precipitating complexes and \n\ncomplexes larger than one million Daltons in molecular weight are not observed in vitro or in vivo. \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution in patients following subcutaneous administration was \n\n78 ± 32 ml/kg. \n\n \n\nStudy 1 / Placebo (N=66) \n\nStudy 1 / Omalizumab (N=72) \n\nStudy 1 / Placebo (N=66) \n\nStudy 1 / Omalizumab (N=72) \n\n \n\nStudy 2 / Placebo (N=65) \n\nStudy 2 / Omalizumab (N=62) \n\n \n\nStudy 2 / Placebo (N=65) \n\nStudy 2 / Omalizumab (N=62) \n\n \n\nSecondary \n\nefficacy analysis \n\nSecondary \n\nefficacy analysis \n\nPrimary efficacy \n\nanalysis \n\nPrimary efficacy \n\nanalysis \n\nBaseline 24 20 16 12 8 4 4 8 12 16 20 24 \n\nWeek Week \n\nBaseline \nM\n\nea\nn\n c\n\nh\nan\n\ng\ne \n\nfr\no\nm\n\n b\nas\n\nel\nin\n\ne \nin\n\n N\nas\n\nal\n C\n\no\nn\ng\nes\n\nti\no\nn\n S\n\nco\nre\n\n \n\nM\nea\n\nn\n c\n\nh\nan\n\ng\ne \n\nfr\no\nm\n\n b\nas\n\nel\nin\n\ne \nin\n\n N\nas\n\nal\n P\n\no\nly\n\np\n S\n\nco\nre\n\n \n\n0.25 0.25 \n\n0.00 0.00 \n\n-0.25 -0.25 \n\n-0.50 -0.50 \n\n-0.75 -0.75 \n\n-1.00 -1.00 \n\n-1.25 -1.25 \n\n\n\n62 \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nClearance of omalizumab involves IgG clearance processes as well as clearance via specific binding \n\nand complex formation with its target ligand, IgE. Liver elimination of IgG includes degradation in the \n\nreticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells. Intact IgG is also excreted in bile. In asthma patients \n\nthe omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 26 days, with apparent clearance averaging \n\n2.4  1.1 ml/kg/day. In addition, doubling of body weight approximately doubled apparent clearance. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patient populations \n\n \nAge, Race/Ethnicity, Gender, Body Mass Index \n\nThe population pharmacokinetics of Xolair were analysed to evaluate the effects of demographic \n\ncharacteristics. Analyses of these limited data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age \n\n(6-76 years for patients with allergic asthma; 18 to 75 years for patients with CRSwNP), \n\nrace/ethnicity, gender or Body Mass Index (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\nThere are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data in patients with renal or hepatic impairment \n\n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe safety of omalizumab has been studied in the cynomolgus monkey, since omalizumab binds to \n\ncynomolgus and human IgE with similar affinity. Antibodies to omalizumab were detected in some \n\nmonkeys following repeated subcutaneous or intravenous administration. However, no apparent \n\ntoxicity, such as immune complex-mediated disease or complement-dependent cytotoxicity, was seen. \n\nThere was no evidence of an anaphylactic response due to mast-cell degranulation in cynomolgus \n\nmonkeys. \n\n \n\nChronic administration of omalizumab at dose levels of up to 250 mg/kg (at least 14 times the highest \n\nrecommended clinical dose in mg/kg according to the recommended dosing table) was well tolerated \n\nin non-human primates (both adult and juvenile animals), with the exception of a dose-related and age-\n\ndependent decrease in blood platelets, with a greater sensitivity in juvenile animals. The serum \n\nconcentration required to attain a 50% drop in platelets from baseline in adult cynomolgus monkeys \n\nwas roughly 4- to 20-fold higher than anticipated maximum clinical serum concentrations. In addition, \n\nacute haemorrhage and inflammation were observed at injection sites in cynomolgus monkeys. \n\n \n\nFormal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with omalizumab. \n\n \n\nIn reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg per week (at least \n\n8 times the highest recommended clinical dose in mg/kg over a 4-week period) did not elicit maternal \n\ntoxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity when administered throughout organogenesis and did not \n\nelicit adverse effects on foetal or neonatal growth when administered throughout late gestation, \n\ndelivery and nursing. \n\n \n\nOmalizumab is excreted in breast milk in cynomolgus monkeys. Milk levels of omalizumab were \n\n0.15% of the maternal serum concentration. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n63 \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\n \n\nXolair is indicated in adults, adolescents and children (6 to <12 years of age). \n\n \n\nXolair treatment should only be considered for patients with convincing IgE (immunoglobulin E) \n\nmediated asthma (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAdults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) \n\nXolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent \n\nallergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and who \n\nhave reduced lung function (FEV1 <80%) as well as frequent daytime symptoms or night-time \n\nawakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-\n\ndose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist. \n\n \n\nChildren (6 to <12 years of age) \n\nXolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent \n\nallergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and \n\nfrequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe \n\nasthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-\n\nagonist. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\n \n\nXolair is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids (INC) for the treatment of \n\nadults (18 years and above) with severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with INC does not provide \n\nadequate disease control. \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\n \n\nXolair is indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in adult and \n\nadolescent (12 years and above) patients with inadequate response to H1 antihistamine treatment. \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nXolair treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe \n\npersistent asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) or chronic spontaneous \n\nurticaria. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \nDosing for allergic asthma and CRSwNP follows the same dosing principles. The appropriate dose \n\nand frequency of Xolair for these conditions is determined by baseline IgE (IU/ml), measured before \n\nthe start of treatment, and body weight (kg). Prior to administration of the initial dose, patients should \n\nhave their IgE level determined by any commercial serum total IgE assay for their dose assignment. \n\nBased on these measurements, 75 to 600 mg of Xolair in 1 to 4 injections may be needed for each \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma patients with baseline IgE lower than 76 IU/ml were less likely to experience benefit \n\n(see section 5.1). Prescribing physicians should ensure that adult and adolescent patients with IgE \n\nbelow 76 IU/ml and children (6 to < 12 years of age) with IgE below 200 IU/ml have unequivocal in \n\nvitro reactivity (RAST) to a perennial allergen before starting therapy. \n\n \n\nSee Table 1 for a conversion chart and Tables 2 and 3 for the dose determination charts. \n\n \n\nPatients whose baseline IgE levels or body weight in kilograms are outside the limits of the dose table \n\nshould not be given Xolair. \n\n \n\nThe maximum recommended dose is 600 mg omalizumab every two weeks. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Conversion from dose to number of syringes, number of injections and total \n\ninjection volume for each administration \n\n \n\nDose (mg) Number of syringes Number of injections Total injection volume (ml) \n\n 75 mg  150 mg    \n\n75 1 0 1 0.5 \n\n150 0 1 1 1.0 \n\n225 1 1 2 1.5 \n\n300 0 2 2 2.0 \n\n375 1 2 3 2.5 \n\n450 0 3 3 3.0 \n\n525 1 3 4 3.5 \n\n600 0 4 4 4.0 \n\n \n\n\n\n67 \n\nTable 2 ADMINISTRATION EVERY 4 WEEKS.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that it takes at least \n\n12-16 weeks for Xolair treatment to show effectiveness. At 16 weeks after commencing Xolair \n\ntherapy patients should be assessed by their physician for treatment effectiveness before further \n\ninjections are administered. The decision to continue Xolair following the 16-week timepoint, or on \n\nsubsequent occasions, should be based on whether a marked improvement in overall asthma control is \n\nseen (see section 5.1, Physician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness). \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nIn clinical trials for CRSwNP, changes in nasal polyps score (NPS) and nasal congestion score (NCS) \n\nwere observed at 4 weeks. The need for continued therapy should be periodically reassessed based \n\nupon the patient’s disease severity and level of symptom control. \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nDiscontinuation of Xolair treatment generally results in a return to elevated free IgE levels and \n\nassociated symptoms. Total IgE levels are elevated during treatment and remain elevated for up to one \n\nyear after the discontinuation of treatment. Therefore, re-testing of IgE levels during Xolair treatment \n\ncannot be used as a guide for dose determination. Dose determination after treatment interruptions \n\nlasting less than one year should be based on serum IgE levels obtained at the initial dose \n\ndetermination. Total serum IgE levels may be re-tested for dose determination if treatment with Xolair \n\nhas been interrupted for one year or more. \n\n \n\nDoses should be adjusted for significant changes in body weight (see Tables 2 and 3). \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\nThe recommended dose is 300 mg by subcutaneous injection every four weeks. \n\n \n\nPrescribers are advised to periodically reassess the need for continued therapy. \n\n \n\nClinical trial experience of long-term treatment beyond 6 months in this indication is limited. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly (65 years of age and older) \n\nThere are limited data available on the use of Xolair in patients older than 65 years but there is no \n\nevidence that elderly patients require a different dose from younger adult patients. \n\n \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment \n\nThere have been no studies on the effect of impaired renal or hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics \n\nof omalizumab. Because omalizumab clearance at clinical doses is dominated by the reticular \n\nendothelial system (RES) it is unlikely to be altered by renal or hepatic impairment. While no \n\nparticular dose adjustment is recommended for these patients, Xolair should be administered with \n\ncaution (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn allergic asthma, the safety and efficacy of Xolair in patients below the age of 6 years have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nIn CRSwNP, the safety and efficacy of Xolair in patients below the age of 18 years have not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nIn CSU, the safety and efficacy of Xolair in patients below the age of 12 years have not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor subcutaneous administration only. Xolair must not be administered by the intravenous or \n\nintramuscular route. \n\n \n\nDoses of more than 150 mg (Table 1) should be divided across two or more injection sites. \n\n \n\nPatients with no known history of anaphylaxis may self-inject Xolair or be injected by a caregiver \n\nfrom the 4th dose onwards if a physician determines that this is appropriate (see section 4.4). The \n\npatient or the caregiver must have been trained in the correct injection technique and the recognition of \n\nthe early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions. \n\n \nPatients or caregivers should be instructed to inject the full amount of Xolair according to the \n\ninstructions provided in the package leaflet. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nXolair is not indicated for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations, acute bronchospasm or status \n\nasthmaticus. \n\n \n\nXolair has not been studied in patients with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome or allergic \n\nbronchopulmonary aspergillosis or for the prevention of anaphylactic reactions, including those \n\nprovoked by food allergy, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis. Xolair is not indicated for the \n\ntreatment of these conditions. \n\n \n\nXolair therapy has not been studied in patients with autoimmune diseases, immune complex-mediated \n\nconditions, or pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). Caution should be exercised \n\nwhen administering Xolair in these patient populations. \n\n \n\nAbrupt discontinuation of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids after initiation of Xolair therapy in \n\nallergic asthma or CRSwNP is not recommended. Decreases in corticosteroids should be performed \n\nunder the direct supervision of a physician and may need to be performed gradually. \n\n \n\n\n\n71 \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions type I \n\nType I local or systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, may occur \n\nwhen taking omalizumab, even after a long duration of treatment. However, most of these reactions \n\noccurred within 2 hours after the first and subsequent injections of Xolair but some started beyond \n\n2 hours and even beyond 24 hours after the injection. The majority of anaphylactic reactions occurred \n\nwithin the first 3 doses of Xolair. Therefore, the first 3 doses must be administered either by or under \n\nthe supervision of a healthcare professional. A history of anaphylaxis unrelated to omalizumab may be \n\na risk factor for anaphylaxis following Xolair administration. Therefore for patients with a known \n\nhistory of anaphylaxis, Xolair must be administered by a health care professional, who should always \n\nhave medicinal products for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions available for immediate use \n\nfollowing administration of Xolair. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, \n\nadministration of Xolair must be discontinued immediately, and appropriate therapy initiated. Patients \n\nshould be informed that such reactions are possible, and prompt medical attention should be sought if \n\nallergic reactions occur. \n\n \n\nAntibodies to omalizumab have been detected in a low number of patients in clinical trials (see \n\nsection 4.8). The clinical relevance of anti-Xolair antibodies is not well understood. \n\n \n\nSerum sickness \n\nSerum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions, which are delayed allergic type III reactions, have \n\nbeen seen in patients treated with humanised monoclonal antibodies including omalizumab. The \n\nsuggested pathophysiologic mechanism includes immune-complex formation and deposition due to \n\ndevelopment of antibodies against omalizumab. The onset has typically been 1-5 days after \n\nadministration of the first or subsequent injections, also after long duration of treatment. Symptoms \n\nsuggestive of serum sickness include arthritis/arthralgias, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever and \n\nlymphadenopathy. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be useful for preventing or treating this \n\ndisorder, and patients should be advised to report any suspected symptoms. \n\n \n\nChurg-Strauss syndrome and hypereosinophilic syndrome \n\nPatients with severe asthma may rarely present systemic hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic \n\neosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), both of which are usually treated \n\nwith systemic corticosteroids. \n\n \n\nIn rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma medicinal products, including omalizumab, may \n\npresent or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis. These events are commonly associated with \n\nthe reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. \n\n \n\nIn these patients, physicians should be alert to the development of marked eosinophilia, vasculitic \n\nrash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, paranasal sinus abnormalities, cardiac complications, and/or \n\nneuropathy. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation of omalizumab should be considered in all severe cases with the above mentioned \n\nimmune system disorders. \n\n \n\nParasitic (helminth) infections \n\n \n\nIgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. In patients at chronic \n\nhigh risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial in allergic patients showed a slight increase \n\nin infection rate with omalizumab, although the course, severity, and response to treatment of infection \n\nwere unaltered. The helminth infection rate in the overall clinical programme, which was not designed \n\nto detect such infections, was less than 1 in 1,000 patients. However, caution may be warranted in \n\npatients at high risk of helminth infection, in particular when travelling to areas where helminthic \n\ninfections are endemic. If patients do not respond to recommended anti-helminth treatment, \n\ndiscontinuation of Xolair should be considered. \n\n \n\n\n\n72 \n\nLatex-sensitive individuals \n\n \n\nThe removable needle cap of this pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of natural rubber latex. No \n\nnatural rubber latex has to date been detected in the removable needle cap. Nevertheless, the use of \n\nXolair solution for injection in pre-filled syringe in latex-sensitive individuals has not been studied and \n\nthus there is a potential risk for hypersensitivity reactions which cannot be completely ruled out. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nSince IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections, Xolair may \n\nindirectly reduce the efficacy of medicinal products for the treatment of helminthic or other parasitic \n\ninfections (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the \n\nclearance of omalizumab; thus, there is little potential for drug-drug interactions. Medicinal product or \n\nvaccine interaction studies have not been performed with Xolair. There is no pharmacological reason \n\nto expect that commonly prescribed medicinal products used in the treatment of asthma, CRSwNP or \n\nCSU will interact with omalizumab. \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies Xolair was commonly used in conjunction with inhaled and oral corticosteroids, \n\ninhaled short-acting and long-acting beta agonists, leukotriene modifiers, theophyllines and oral \n\nantihistamines. There was no indication that the safety of Xolair was altered with these other \n\ncommonly used anti-asthma medicinal products. Limited data are available on the use of Xolair in \n\ncombination with specific immunotherapy (hypo-sensitisation therapy). In a clinical trial where Xolair \n\nwas co-administered with immunotherapy, the safety and efficacy of Xolair in combination with \n\nspecific immunotherapy were found to be no different to that of Xolair alone. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies Xolair was used in conjunction with intranasal mometasone spray as per protocol. \n\nOther commonly used concomitant medicinal products included other intranasal corticosteroids, \n\nbronchodilators antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, adrenergics/sympathomimetics and \n\nlocal nasal anesthetics. There was no indication that the safety of Xolair was altered by the \n\nconcomitant use of these other commonly used medicinal products. \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies in CSU, Xolair was used in conjunction with antihistamines (anti-H1, anti-H2) and \n\nleukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs). There was no evidence that the safety of omalizumab was \n\naltered when used with these medicinal products relative to its known safety profile in allergic asthma. \n\nIn addition, a population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no relevant effect of H2 antihistamines and \n\nLTRAs on omalizumab pharmacokinetics (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nClinical studies in CSU included some patients aged 12 to 17 years taking Xolair in conjunction with \n\nantihistamines (anti-H1, anti-H2) and LTRAs. No studies have been performed in children under \n\n12 years. \n\n \n\n\n\n73 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nA moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1,000 pregnancy outcomes) based on \n\npregnancy registry and post-marketing spontaneous reports, indicates no malformative or \n\nfoeto/neonatal toxicity. A prospective pregnancy registry study (EXPECT) in 250 pregnant women \n\nwith asthma exposed to Xolair showed the prevalence of major congenital anomalies was similar \n\n(8.1% vs. 8.9%) between EXPECT and disease-matched (moderate and severe asthma) patients. The \n\ninterpretation of data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small \n\nsample size and non-randomised design. \n\n \n\nOmalizumab crosses the placental barrier. However, animal studies do not indicate either direct or \n\nindirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nOmalizumab has been associated with age-dependent decreases in blood platelets in non-human \n\nprimates, with a greater relative sensitivity in juvenile animals (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nIf clinically needed, the use of Xolair may be considered during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nImmunoglobulins G (IgGs) are present in human milk and therefore it is expected that omalizumab \n\nwill be present in human milk. Available data in non-human primates have shown excretion of \n\nomalizumab into milk (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nThe EXPECT study, with 154 infants who had been exposed to Xolair during pregnancy and through \n\nbreast-feeding did not indicate adverse effects on the breast-fed infant. The interpretation of data may \n\nbe impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-\n\nrandomised design. \n\n \n\nGiven orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and have poor bioavailability. \n\nNo effects on the breast-fed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, if clinically needed, the \n\nuse of Xolair may be considered during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no human fertility data for omalizumab. In specifically-designed non-clinical fertility \n\nstudies, in non-human primates including mating studies, no impairment of male or female fertility \n\nwas observed following repeated dosing with omalizumab at dose levels up to 75 mg/kg. Furthermore, \n\nno genotoxic effects were observed in a separate non-clinical genotoxicity study. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nXolair has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nDuring allergic asthma clinical trials in adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older, the \n\nmost commonly reported adverse reactions were headaches and injection site reactions, including \n\ninjection site pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus. In clinical trials in children 6 to <12 years of age, \n\nthe most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, pyrexia and upper abdominal pain. \n\nMost of the reactions were mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials in patients ≥18 years of age \n\n\n\n74 \n\nin CRSwNP, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, dizziness, arthralgia, \n\nabdominal pain upper and injection site reactions. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nTable 4 lists the adverse reactions recorded in clinical studies in the total allergic asthma and CRSwNP \n\nsafety population treated with Xolair by MedDRA system organ class and frequency. Within each \n\nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequency \n\ncategories are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n\n<1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000).

Overall, 733 patients were \n\ntreated with omalizumab for up to 12 weeks and 490 patients for up to 24 weeks. Of those, \n\n412 patients were treated for up to 12 weeks and 333 patients were treated for up to 24 weeks at the \n\n300 mg dose. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nA separate table (Table 5) shows the adverse reactions for the CSU indication resulting from \n\ndifferences in dosages and treatment populations (with significantly different risk factors, \n\ncomorbidities, co-medications and ages [e.g. asthma trials included children from 6-12 years of age]). \n\n \n\nTable 5 lists the adverse reactions (events occurring in ≥1% of patients in any treatment group and \n\n≥2% more frequently in any omalizumab treatment group than with placebo (after medical review)) \n\nreported with 300 mg in the three pooled phase III studies. The adverse reactions presented are divided \n\ninto two groups: those identified in the 12-week and the 24-week treatment periods. \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the \n\nadverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions listed first. The \n\ncorresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: \n\nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 \n\nto <1/1000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nTable 5 Adverse reactions from the pooled CSU safety database (day 1 to week 24) at \n\n300 mg omalizumab \n\n \n\n12-Week \nOmalizumab studies 1, 2 and 3 Pooled Frequency category \n\nPlacebo N=242 300 mg N=412  \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nSinusitis 5 (2.1%) 20 (4.9%) Common \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nHeadache 7 (2.9%) 25 (6.1%) Common \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nArthralgia 1 (0.4%) 12 (2.9%) Common \n\nGeneral disorder and administration site conditions \nInjection site reaction* 2 (0.8%) 11 (2.7%) Common \n\n24-Week \nOmalizumab studies 1 and 3 Pooled Frequency category \n\nPlacebo N=163 300 mg N=333  \n\nInfections and infestations \nUpper respiratory tract \n\ninfection \n5 (3.1%) 19 (5.7%) Common \n\n* Despite not showing a 2% difference to placebo, injection site reactions were included as all cases \n\nwere assessed causally related to study treatment. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n76 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nFor further information, see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nAnaphylaxis \n\nAnaphylactic reactions were rare in clinical trials. However, post-marketing data following a \n\ncumulative search in the safety database retrieved a total of 898 anaphylaxis cases. Based on an \n\nestimated exposure of 566,923 patient treatment years, this results in a reporting rate of approximately \n\n0.20%. \n\n \n\nArterial thromboembolic events (ATE) \n\nIn controlled clinical trials and during interim analyses of an observational study, a numerical \n\nimbalance of ATE was observed. The definition of the composite endpoint ATE included stroke, \n\ntransient ischaemic attack, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiovascular death (including \n\ndeath from unknown cause). In the final analysis of the observational study, the rate of ATE per 1,000 \n\npatient years was 7.52 (115/15,286 patient years) for Xolair-treated patients and 5.12 (51/9,963 patient \n\nyears) for control patients. In a multivariate analysis controlling for available baseline cardiovascular \n\nrisk factors, the hazard ratio was 1.32 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.91). In a separate analysis of \n\npooled clinical trials, which included all randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials \n\nlasting 8 or more weeks, the rate of ATE per 1,000 patient years was 2.69 (5/1,856 patient years) for \n\nXolair-treated patients and 2.38 (4/1,680 patient years) for placebo patients (rate ratio 1.13, 95% \n\nconfidence interval 0.24-5.71). \n\n \n\nPlatelets \n\nIn clinical trials few patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of the normal laboratory range. \n\nNone of these changes were associated with bleeding episodes or a decrease in haemoglobin. No \n\npattern of persistent decrease in platelet counts, as observed in non-human primates (see section 5.3), \n\nhas been reported in humans (patients above 6 years of age), even though isolated cases of idiopathic \n\nthrombocytopenia, including severe cases, have been reported in the post-marketing setting. \n\n \n\nParasitic infections \n\nIn allergic patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight \n\nnumerical increase in infection rate with omalizumab that was not statistically significant. The course, \n\nseverity, and response to treatment of infections were unaltered (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nClinical trial and post-marketing cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in \n\npatients with moderate to severe asthma and CSU. The pathogenesis of SLE is not well understood. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nMaximum tolerated dose of Xolair has not been determined. Single intravenous doses up to 4,000 mg \n\nhave been administered to patients without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. The highest \n\ncumulative dose administered to patients was 44,000 mg over a 20-week period and this dose did not \n\nresult in any untoward acute effects. \n\n \n\nIf an overdose is suspected, the patient should be monitored for any abnormal signs or symptoms. \n\nMedical treatment should be sought and instituted appropriately. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for \n\nobstructive airway diseases, ATC code: R03DX05 \n\n \n\nOmalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to \n\nhuman immunoglobulin E (IgE). The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that contains human framework \n\nregions with the complementary-determining regions of a murine parent antibody that binds to IgE. \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nOmalizumab binds to IgE and prevents binding of IgE to FcRI (high-affinity IgE receptor) on \n\nbasophils and mast cells, thereby reducing the amount of free IgE that is available to trigger the \n\nallergic cascade. Treatment of atopic subjects with omalizumab resulted in a marked down-regulation \n\nof FcRI receptors on basophils. Treatment with Xolair inhibits IgE-mediated inflammation, as \n\nevidenced by reduced blood and tissue eosinophils and reduced inflammatory mediators, including \n\nIL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 by innate, adaptive and non-immune cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nThe in vitro histamine release from basophils isolated from Xolair-treated subjects was reduced by \n\napproximately 90% following stimulation with an allergen compared to pre-treatment values. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies in allergic asthma patients, serum free IgE levels were reduced in a dose-dependent \n\nmanner within one hour following the first dose and maintained between doses. One year after \n\ndiscontinuation of Xolair dosing, the IgE levels had returned to pre-treatment levels with no observed \n\nrebound in IgE levels after washout of the medicinal product. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nIn clinical studies in patients with CRSwNP, Xolair treatment led to a reduction in serum free IgE \n\n(approx. 95%) and an increase in serum total IgE levels, to a similar extent as observed in patients \n\nwith allergic asthma. Total IgE levels in serum increased due to the formation of omalizumab-IgE \n\ncomplexes that have a slower elimination rate compared with free IgE. \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nOmalizumab binds to IgE and lowers free IgE levels. Subsequently, IgE receptors (FcεRI) on cells \n\ndown-regulate. It is not entirely understood how this results in an improvement of CSU symptoms. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nIn clinical studies in CSU patients, maximum suppression of free IgE was observed 3 days after the \n\nfirst subcutaneous dose. After repeated dosing once every 4 weeks, pre-dose serum free IgE levels \n\nremained stable between 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. After discontinuation of Xolair, free IgE levels \n\nincreased towards pre-treatment levels over a 16-week treatment-free follow-up period. \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nAdults and adolescents ≥12 years of age \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Xolair were demonstrated in a 28-week double-blind placebo-controlled \n\nstudy (study 1) involving 419 severe allergic asthmatics, ages 12-79 years, who had reduced lung \n\nfunction (FEV1 40-80% predicted) and poor asthma symptom control despite receiving high dose \n\ninhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Eligible patients had experienced multiple \n\nasthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment or had been hospitalised or attended \n\nan emergency room due to a severe asthma exacerbation in the past year despite continuous treatment \n\nwith high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Subcutaneous Xolair or \n\nplacebo were administered as add-on therapy to >1,000 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate (or \n\nequivalent) plus a long-acting beta2-agonist. Oral corticosteroid, theophylline and leukotriene-\n\nmodifier maintenance therapies were allowed (22%, 27%, and 35% of patients, respectively). \n\n \n\nThe rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with bursts of systemic corticosteroids was the \n\nprimary endpoint. Omalizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 19% (p = 0.153). Further \n\nevaluations which did show statistical significance (p<0.05) in favour of Xolair included reductions in \n\nsevere exacerbations (where patient’s lung function was reduced to below 60% of personal best and \n\nrequiring systemic corticosteroids) and asthma-related emergency visits (comprised of \n\nhospitalisations, emergency room, and unscheduled doctor visits), and improvements in Physician’s \n\noverall assessment of treatment effectiveness, Asthma-related Quality of Life (AQL), asthma \n\nsymptoms and lung function. \n\n \n\nIn a subgroup analysis, patients with pre-treatment total IgE ≥76 IU/ml were more likely to experience \n\nclinically meaningful benefit to Xolair. In these patients in study 1 Xolair reduced the rate of asthma \n\nexacerbations by 40% (p = 0.002). In addition more patients had clinically meaningful responses in the \n\ntotal IgE ≥76 IU/ml population across the Xolair severe asthma programme. Table 6 includes results in \n\nthe study 1 population. \n\n \n\nTable 6 Results of study 1 \n\n \n\n Whole study 1 population \n\n Xolair \n\nN=209 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=210 \n\nAsthma exacerbations   \n\nRate per 28-week period 0.74 0.92 \n\n% reduction, p-value for rate ratio 19.4%, p = 0.153 \n\nSevere asthma exacerbations   \n\nRate per 28-week period 0.24 0.48 \n\n% reduction, p-value for rate ratio 50.1%, p = 0.002 \n\nEmergency visits   \n\nRate per 28-week period 0.24 0.43 \n\n% reduction, p-value for rate ratio 43.9%, p = 0.038 \n\nPhysician’s overall assessment   \n\n% responders* 60.5% 42.8% \n\np-value** <0.001 \n\nAQL improvement   \n\n% of patients ≥0.5 improvement 60.8% 47.8% \n\np-value 0.008 \n\n* marked improvement or complete control \n\n** p-value for overall distribution of assessment \n\n \n\nStudy 2 assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in a population of 312 severe allergic asthmatics \n\nwhich matched the population in study 1. Treatment with Xolair in this open label study led to a 61% \n\nreduction in clinically significant asthma exacerbation rate compared to current asthma therapy alone. \n\n \n\n\n\n79 \n\nFour additional large placebo-controlled supportive studies of 28 to 52 weeks duration in 1,722 adults \n\nand adolescents (studies 3, 4, 5, 6) assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in patients with severe \n\npersistent asthma. Most patients were inadequately controlled but were receiving less concomitant \n\nasthma therapy than patients in studies 1 or 2. Studies 3-5 used exacerbation as primary endpoint, \n\nwhereas study 6 primarily evaluated inhaled corticosteroid sparing. \n\n \n\nIn studies 3, 4 and 5 patients treated with Xolair had respective reductions in asthma exacerbation \n\nrates of 37.5% (p = 0.027), 40.3% (p<0.001) and 57.6% (p<0.001) compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nIn study 6, significantly more severe allergic asthma patients on Xolair were able to reduce their \n\nfluticasone dose to 500 micrograms/day without deterioration of asthma control (60.3%) compared to \n\nthe placebo group (45.8%, p<0.05). \n\n \n\nQuality of life scores were measured using the Juniper Asthma-related Quality of Life Questionnaire. \n\nFor all six studies there was a statistically significant improvement from baseline in quality of life \n\nscores for Xolair patients versus the placebo or control group. \n\n \n\nPhysician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness: \n\nPhysician’s overall assessment was performed in five of the above studies as a broad measure of \n\nasthma control performed by the treating physician. The physician was able to take into account PEF \n\n(peak expiratory flow), day and night time symptoms, rescue medication use, spirometry and \n\nexacerbations. In all five studies a significantly greater proportion of Xolair treated patients were \n\njudged to have achieved either a marked improvement or complete control of their asthma compared \n\nto placebo patients. \n\n \n\nChildren 6 to <12 years of age \n\nThe primary support for safety and efficacy of Xolair in the group aged 6 to <12 years comes from one \n\nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial (study 7). \n\n \n\nStudy 7 was a placebo-controlled trial which included a specific subgroup (n=235) of patients as \n\ndefined in the present indication, who were treated with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids \n\n(≥500 µg/day fluticasone equivalent) plus long-acting beta agonist. \n\n \n\nA clinically significant exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms as judged \n\nclinically by the investigator, requiring doubling of the baseline inhaled corticosteroid dose for at least \n\n3 days and/or treatment with rescue systemic (oral or intravenous) corticosteroids for at least 3 days. \n\n \n\nIn the specific subgroup of patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroids, the omalizumab group had a \n\nstatistically significantly lower rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations than the placebo \n\ngroup. At 24 weeks, the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 34% (rate ratio \n\n0.662, p = 0.047) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. In the second double-blind 28-\n\nweek treatment period the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 63% (rate ratio \n\n0.37, p<0.001) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. \n\n \n\nDuring the 52-week double-blind treatment period (including the 24-week fixed-dose steroid phase \n\nand the 28-week steroid adjustment phase) the difference in rates between treatment groups \n\nrepresented a 50% (rate ratio 0.504, p<0.001) relative decrease in exacerbations for omalizumab \n\npatients. \n\n \n\n\n\n80 \n\nThe omalizumab group showed greater decreases in beta-agonist rescue medication use than the \n\nplacebo group at the end of the 52-week treatment period, although the difference between treatment \n\ngroups was not statistically significant. For the global evaluation of treatment effectiveness at the end \n\nof the 52-week double-blind treatment period in the subgroup of severe patients on high-dose inhaled \n\ncorticosteroids plus long-acting beta agonists, the proportion of patients rated as having ‘excellent’ \n\ntreatment effectiveness was higher, and the proportions having ‘moderate’ or ‘poor’ treatment \n\neffectiveness lower in the omalizumab group compared to the placebo group; the difference between \n\ngroups was statistically significant (p<0.001), while there were no differences between the \n\nomalizumab and placebo groups for patients’ subjective Quality of Life ratings. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Xolair were evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \n\ntrials in patients with CRSwNP (Table 8). Patients received Xolair or placebo subcutaneously every 2 \n\nor 4 weeks (see section 4.2). All patients received background intranasal mometasone therapy \n\nthroughout the study. Prior sino-nasal surgery or prior systemic corticosteroid usage were not required \n\nfor inclusion in the studies. Patients received Xolair or placebo for 24 weeks followed by a 4-week \n\nfollow-up period.

The \n\nodds-ratio of having taken rescue treatment in Xolair compared to placebo was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.10, \n\n1.49). There were no sino-nasal surgeries reported in either study. \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Xolair were demonstrated in two randomised, placebo-controlled phase III \n\nstudies (study 1 and 2) in patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine \n\ntherapy at the approved dose. A third study (study 3) primarily evaluated the safety of Xolair in \n\npatients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite treatment with H1 antihistamines at up to four \n\ntimes the approved dose and H2 antihistamine and/or LTRA treatment. The three studies enrolled \n\n975 patients aged between 12 and 75 years (mean age 42.3 years; 39 patients 12-17 years, 54 patients \n\n≥65 years; 259 males and 716 females). All patients were required to have inadequate symptom \n\ncontrol, as assessed by a weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7, range 0-42) of ≥16, and a weekly itch \n\nseverity score (which is a component of the UAS7; range 0-21) of ≥8 for the 7 days prior to \n\nrandomisation, despite having used an antihistamine for at least 2 weeks beforehand. \n\n \n\nIn studies 1 and 2, patients had a mean weekly itch severity score of between 13.7 and 14.5 at baseline \n\nand a mean UAS7 score of 29.5 and 31.7 respectively. Patients in safety study 3 had a mean weekly \n\nitch severity score of 13.8 and a mean UAS7 score of 31.2 at baseline. Across all three studies, \n\npatients reported receiving on average 4 to 6 medications (including H1 antihistamines) for CSU \n\nsymptoms prior to study enrollment. Patients received Xolair at 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg or placebo \n\nby subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 24 and 12 weeks in studies 1 and 2, respectively, and \n\n300 mg or placebo by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 24 weeks in study 3.

Statistically significant results were further \n\nobserved in the responder rates for UAS7≤6 (at week 12) which were higher for the 300 mg treatment \n\ngroups, ranging from 52-66% (p<0.0001) compared to 11-19% for the placebo groups, and complete \n\nresponse (UAS7=0) was achieved by 34-44% (p<0.0001) of patients treated with 300 mg compared to \n\n5-9% of patients in the placebo groups. Patients in the 300 mg treatment groups achieved the highest \n\nmean proportion of angioedema-free days from week 4 to week 12, (91.0-96.1%; p<0.001) compared \n\nto the placebo groups (88.1-89.2%). Mean change from baseline to week 12 in the overall DLQI for \n\nthe 300 mg treatment groups was greater (p<0.001) than for placebo showing an improvement ranging \n\nfrom 9.7-10.3 points compared to 5.1-6.1 points for the corresponding placebo groups. \n\n \n\nTable 9 Change from baseline to week 12 in weekly itch severity score, studies 1, 2 and 3 \n\n(mITT population*) \n\n \n\n \n\nPlacebo \n\nOmalizumab \n\n300 mg \n\nStudy 1   \n\n N 80 81 \n\n Mean (SD) −3.63 (5.22) −9.40 (5.73) \n\n Difference in LS means vs. placebo1 - −5.80 \n\n 95% CI for difference - −7.49,−4.10 \n\n P-value vs. placebo2 - <0.0001 \n\nStudy 2   \n\n N 79 79 \n\n Mean (SD) −5.14 (5.58) −9.77 (5.95) \n\n Difference in LS means vs. placebo1 - −4.81 \n\n 95% CI for difference - −6.49,−3.13 \n\n P-value vs. placebo2 - <0.0001 \n\nStudy 3   \n\n N 83 252 \n\n Mean (SD) −4.01 (5.87) −8.55 (6.01) \n\n Difference in LS means vs. placebo1 - -4.52 \n\n 95% CI for difference - −5.97, −3.08 \n\n P-value vs. placebo2 - <0.0001 \n\n*Modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population: included all patients who were randomised and received \n\nat least one dose of study medication. \n\nBOCF (Baseline Observation Carried Forward) was used to impute missing data. \n1 The LS mean was estimated using an ANCOVA model.

Results for the 300 mg are available for 9 patients at week 12 and 6 patients at \n\nweek 24, and show a similar magnitude of response to omalizumab treatment compared to the adult \n\npopulation. Mean change from baseline in weekly itch severity score showed a reduction of 8.25 at \n\nweek 12 and of 8.95 at week 24. The responder rates were: 33% at week 12 and 67% at week 24 for \n\nUAS7=0, and 56% at week 12 and 67% at week 24 for UAS7≤6. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of omalizumab have been studied in adult and adolescent patients with allergic \n\nasthma as well as in adult patients with CRSwNP, and adult and adolescent patients with CSU. The \n\ngeneral pharmacokinetic characteristics of omalizumab are similar in these patient populations. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nAfter subcutaneous administration, omalizumab is absorbed with an average absolute bioavailability \n\nof 62%. Following a single subcutaneous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma or CSU, \n\nomalizumab was absorbed slowly, reaching peak serum concentrations after an average of 6-8 days. In \n\npatients with asthma, following multiple doses of omalizumab, areas under the serum concentration-\n\ntime curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady state were up to 6-fold of those after the first dose. \n\n \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40\n\n      \n\nWeek 12 \n\nPrimary \n\nEndpoint Omalizumab 300 mg \n\nM\nea\n\nn\n w\n\nee\nk\n\nly\n i\n\ntc\nh\n\n s\nev\n\ner\nit\n\ny\n s\n\nco\nre\n\n  \n\nWeek \n\nOmalizumab or placebo administered \n\nPlacebo \n\n\n\n85 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of omalizumab are linear at doses greater than 0.5 mg/kg. Following doses of \n\n75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg every 4 weeks in patients with CSU, trough serum concentrations of \n\nomalizumab increased proportionally with the dose level. \n\n \n\nAdministration of Xolair manufactured as a lyophilised or liquid formulation resulted in similar serum \n\nconcentration-time profiles of omalizumab. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \nIn vitro, omalizumab forms complexes of limited size with IgE. Precipitating complexes and \n\ncomplexes larger than one million Daltons in molecular weight are not observed in vitro or in vivo. \n\nBased on population pharmacokinetics, distribution of omalizumab was similar in patients with \n\nallergic asthma and patients with CSU. The apparent volume of distribution in patients with asthma \n\nfollowing subcutaneous administration was 78 ± 32 ml/kg. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \nClearance of omalizumab involves IgG clearance processes as well as clearance via specific binding \n\nand complex formation with its target ligand, IgE. Liver elimination of IgG includes degradation in the \n\nreticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells. Intact IgG is also excreted in bile. In asthma patients \n\nthe omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 26 days, with apparent clearance averaging \n\n2.4  1.1 ml/kg/day. Doubling of body weight approximately doubled apparent clearance. In CSU \n\npatients, based on population pharmacokinetic simulations, omalizumab serum elimination half-life at \n\nsteady state averaged 24 days and apparent clearance at steady state for a patient of 80 kg weight was \n\n3.0 ml/kg/day. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patient populations \n\n \n\nAge, Race/ethnicity, Gender, Body Mass Index \n\nPatients with allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) \n\nThe population pharmacokinetics of omalizumab were analysed to evaluate the effects of demographic \n\ncharacteristics. Analyses of these limited data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age \n\n(6-76 years for patients with allergic asthma; 18 to 75 for patients with CRSwNP), race/ethnicity, \n\ngender or body mass index (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPatients with CSU \n\nThe effects of demographic characteristics and other factors on omalizumab exposure were evaluated \n\nbased on population pharmacokinetics. In addition, covariate effects were evaluated by analysing the \n\nrelationship between omalizumab concentrations and clinical responses. These analyses suggest that \n\nno dose adjustments are necessary in patients with CSU for age (12-75 years), race/ethnicity, gender, \n\nbody weight, body mass index, baseline IgE, anti-FcRI autoantibodies or concomitant use of H2 \n\nantihistamines or LTRAs. \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\nThere are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data in allergic asthma or CSU patients with renal \n\nor hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe safety of omalizumab has been studied in the cynomolgus monkey, since omalizumab binds to \n\ncynomolgus and human IgE with similar affinity. Antibodies to omalizumab were detected in some \n\nmonkeys following repeated subcutaneous or intravenous administration. However, no apparent \n\ntoxicity, such as immune complex-mediated disease or complement-dependent cytotoxicity, was seen. \n\nThere was no evidence of an anaphylactic response due to mast-cell degranulation in cynomolgus \n\nmonkeys. \n\n \n\n\n\n86 \n\nChronic administration of omalizumab at dose levels of up to 250 mg/kg (at least 14 times the highest \n\nrecommended clinical dose in mg/kg according to the recommended dosing table) was well tolerated \n\nin non-human primates (both adult and juvenile animals), with the exception of a dose-related and age-\n\ndependent decrease in blood platelets, with a greater sensitivity in juvenile animals. The serum \n\nconcentration required to attain a 50% drop in platelets from baseline in adult cynomolgus monkeys \n\nwas roughly 4- to 20-fold higher than anticipated maximum clinical serum concentrations. In addition, \n\nacute haemorrhage and inflammation were observed at injection sites in cynomolgus monkeys. \n\n \n\nFormal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with omalizumab. \n\n \n\nIn reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg per week (at least \n\n8 times the highest recommended clinical dose in mg/kg over a 4-week period) did not elicit maternal \n\ntoxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity when administered throughout organogenesis and did not \n\nelicit adverse effects on foetal or neonatal growth when administered throughout late gestation, \n\ndelivery and nursing. \n\n \n\nOmalizumab is excreted in breast milk in cynomolgus monkeys. Milk levels of omalizumab were \n\n0.15% of the maternal serum concentration. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n125 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nXolair 75 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nomalizumab \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Xolair is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Xolair \n\n3. How Xolair is given \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Xolair \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Xolair is and what it is used for \n \n\nXolair contains the active substance omalizumab. Omalizumab is a man-made protein that is similar to \n\nnatural proteins produced by the body. It belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies. \n\n \n\nXolair is used for the treatment of: \n\n- allergic asthma \n- chronic rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the nose and sinuses) with nasal polyps \n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nThis medicine is used to prevent asthma from getting worse by controlling symptoms of severe \n\nallergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) who are already receiving \n\nasthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high-dose \n\nsteroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \n\nThis medicine is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adults (18 years of age and \n\nolder) who are already receiving intranasal corticosteroids (corticosteroid nasal spray), but whose \n\nsymptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. Nasal polyps are small growths on the lining of \n\nthe nose. Xolair helps to reduce the size of the polyps and improves symptoms including nasal \n\ncongestion, loss of sense of smell, mucus in the back of the throat and runny nose. \n\n \n\nXolair works by blocking a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is produced by the body. \n\nIgE contributes to a type of inflammation that plays a key role in causing allergic asthma and chronic \n\nrhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Xolair \n \n\nYou should not be given Xolair: \n\n- if you are allergic to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic to any of the ingredients, tell your doctor as you should not be given \n\nXolair. \n\n \n\n\n\n126 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before you are given Xolair: \n\n- if you have kidney or liver problems. \n- if you have a disorder where your own immune system attacks parts of your own body \n\n(autoimmune disease). \n\n- if you are travelling to a region where infections caused by parasites are common - Xolair may \nweaken your resistance to such infections. \n\n- if you have had a previous severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) for example resulting from a \nmedicine, an insect bite or food. \n\n \n\nXolair does not treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Therefore Xolair should \n\nnot be used to treat such symptoms. \n\n \n\nXolair is not meant to prevent or treat other allergy-type conditions, such as sudden allergic reactions, \n\nhyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (an inherited immune disorder), aspergillosis (a fungus-related \n\nlung disease), food allergy, eczema or hay fever because Xolair has not been studied in these \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\nLook out for signs of allergic reactions and other serious side effects \n\nXolair can potentially cause serious side effects. You must look out for signs of these conditions while \n\nyou use Xolair. Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs indicating a possible serious \n\nside effect. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in section 4. The majority of severe \n\nallergic reactions occur within the first 3 doses of Xolair. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nXolair is not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Its use in children under 6 years of age \n\nhas not been studied. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \n\nXolair is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Its use in patients \n\nunder 18 years of age has not been studied. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Xolair \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nThis is especially important if you are taking: \n\n- medicines to treat an infection caused by a parasite, as Xolair may reduce the effect of your \nmedicines, \n\n- inhaled corticosteroids and other medicines for allergic asthma. \n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \n\nadvice before using this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and potential risks of \n\nbeing given this medicine during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nIf you become pregnant while being treated with Xolair, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nXolair may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for \n\nadvice before using this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nIt is unlikely that Xolair will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n127 \n\n3. How Xolair is given \n \n\nInstructions on how to use Xolair are given in the section “Information for the healthcare \n\nprofessional”. \n\n \n\nXolair is given to you by a doctor or nurse as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). \n\n \n\nFollow carefully all instructions given by your doctor or nurse. \n\n \n\nHow much you will be given \n\nYour doctor will decide how much Xolair you need and how often you will be given it. This depends \n\non your body weight and the results of a blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to \n\nmeasure the amount of IgE in your blood. \n\n \n\nYou will be given 1 to 4 injections at a time, either every two weeks, or every four weeks. \n\n \n\nKeep taking your current asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine during Xolair treatment. Do not stop \n\ntaking any asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine without talking to your doctor. \n\n \n\nYou may not see an immediate improvement after beginning Xolair therapy. In patients with nasal \n\npolyps effects have been seen 4 weeks after the start of the treatment. In asthma patients it usually \n\ntakes between 12 and 16 weeks to have the full effect. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nXolair can be given to children and adolescents aged 6 years and older, who are already receiving \n\nasthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high dose \n\nsteroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. Your doctor will work out how much Xolair your child \n\nneeds and how often it needs to be given. This will depend on your child’s weight and the results of a \n\nblood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure the amount of IgE in his/her blood. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \n\nXolair should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n\n \n\nIf a dose of Xolair is missed \nContact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment. \n\n \n\nIf you stop treatment with Xolair \n\nDo not stop treatment with Xolair unless your doctor tells you to. Interrupting or stopping the \n\ntreatment with Xolair may cause your symptoms to come back. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n128 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The side \n\neffects caused by Xolair are usually mild to moderate but can occasionally be serious. \n\n \n\nSerious side effects: \n\n \n\nSeek medical attention immediately if you notice any signs of the following side effects: \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\n- Severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis).

The fully reconstituted medicinal product will appear clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to \n\npale brownish-yellow and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial. Because \n\nof the viscosity of the reconstituted medicinal product care must be taken to withdraw all of the \n\nmedicinal product from the vial before expelling any air or excess solution from the syringe in order to \n\nobtain the 0.6 ml. \n\n \n\nTo prepare Xolair 75 mg vials for subcutaneous administration, please adhere to the following \n\ninstructions: \n\n \n\n1. Draw 0.9 ml of water for injections from the ampoule into a syringe equipped with a large-bore \n\n18-gauge needle. \n\n \n\n2. With the vial placed upright on a flat surface, insert the needle and transfer the water for \n\ninjections into the vial containing the lyophilised powder using standard aseptic techniques, \n\ndirecting the water for injections directly onto the powder. \n\n \n\n3. Keeping the vial in an upright position, vigorously swirl it (do not shake) for approximately \n\n1 minute to evenly wet the powder. \n\n \n\n4. To aid in dissolution after completing step 3, gently swirl the vial for 5-10 seconds \n\napproximately every 5 minutes in order to dissolve any remaining solids. \n\n \n\nNote that in some cases it may take longer than 20 minutes for the powder to dissolve \n\ncompletely. If this is the case, repeat step 4 until there are no visible gel-like particles in the \n\nsolution. \n\n \n\nWhen the medicinal product is fully dissolved, there should be no visible gel-like particles in \n\nthe solution. Small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial are common. The reconstituted \n\nmedicinal product will appear clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale brownish-yellow. \n\nDo not use if solid particles are present. \n\n \n\n5. Invert the vial for at least 15 seconds in order to allow the solution to drain towards the stopper. \n\nUsing a new 3-ml syringe equipped with a large-bore, 18-gauge needle, insert the needle into \n\nthe inverted vial. Keeping the vial inverted position the needle tip at the very bottom of the \n\nsolution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe. Before removing the needle \n\nfrom the vial, pull the plunger all the way back to the end of the syringe barrel in order to \n\nremove all of the solution from the inverted vial. \n\n \n\n6. Replace the 18-gauge needle with a 25-gauge needle for subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\n7. Expel air, large bubbles, and any excess solution in order to obtain the required 0.6 ml dose. A \n\nthin layer of small bubbles may remain at the top of the solution in the syringe. Because the \n\nsolution is slightly viscous, it may take 5-10 seconds to administer the solution by subcutaneous \n\ninjection. \n\n \n\nThe vial delivers 0.6 ml (75 mg) of Xolair. \n\n \n\n8. The injections are administered subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm, the lower \n\nabdomen (but not the area 5 centimetres around the navel) or the thigh. \n\n\n\n133 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nXolair 150 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nomalizumab \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

What Xolair is and what it is used for \n \n\nXolair contains the active substance omalizumab. Omalizumab is a man-made protein that is similar to \n\nnatural proteins produced by the body. It belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies. \n\n \n\nXolair is used for the treatment of: \n\n- allergic asthma \n- chronic rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the nose and sinuses) with nasal polyps \n- chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nThis medicine is used to prevent asthma from getting worse by controlling symptoms of severe \n\nallergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) who are already receiving \n\nasthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high-dose \n\nsteroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \n\nThis medicine is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adults (18 years of age and \n\nolder) who are already receiving intranasal corticosteroids (corticosteroid nasal spray), but whose \n\nsymptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. Nasal polyps are small growths on the lining of \n\nthe nose. Xolair helps to reduce the size of the polyps and improves symptoms including nasal \n\ncongestion, loss of sense of smell, mucus in the back of the throat and runny nose. \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\nThis medicine is used to treat chronic spontaneous urticaria in adults and adolescents (12 years of age \n\nand older) who are already receiving antihistamines but whose CSU symptoms are not well controlled \n\nby these medicines. \n\n \n\nXolair works by blocking a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is produced by the body. \n\nIgE contributes to a type of inflammation that plays a key role in causing allergic asthma, chronic \n\nrhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and CSU. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n134 \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Xolair \n \n\nYou should not be given Xolair: \n\n- if you are allergic to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic to any of the ingredients, tell your doctor as you should not be given \n\nXolair. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before you are given Xolair: \n\n- if you have kidney or liver problems. \n- if you have a disorder where your own immune system attacks parts of your own body \n\n(autoimmune disease). \n\n- if you are travelling to a region where infections caused by parasites are common - Xolair may \nweaken your resistance to such infections. \n\n- if you have had a previous severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) for example resulting from a \nmedicine, an insect bite or food. \n\n \n\nXolair does not treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Therefore Xolair should \n\nnot be used to treat such symptoms. \n\n \n\nXolair is not meant to prevent or treat other allergy-type conditions, such as sudden allergic reactions, \n\nhyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (an inherited immune disorder), aspergillosis (a fungus-related \n\nlung disease), food allergy, eczema or hay fever because Xolair has not been studied in these \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\nLook out for signs of allergic reactions and other serious side effects \n\nXolair can potentially cause serious side effects. You must look out for signs of these conditions while \n\nyou use Xolair. Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs indicating a possible serious \n\nside effect. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in section 4. The majority of severe \n\nallergic reactions occur within the first 3 doses of Xolair. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nXolair is not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Its use in children under 6 years of age \n\nhas not been studied. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \n\nXolair is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Its use in patients \n\nunder 18 years of age has not been studied. \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\nXolair is not recommended for children under 12 years of age. Its use in children under 12 years of age \n\nhas not been studied. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Xolair \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nThis is especially important if you are taking: \n\n- medicines to treat an infection caused by a parasite, as Xolair may reduce the effect of your \nmedicines, \n\n- inhaled corticosteroids and other medicines for allergic asthma. \n \n\n\n\n135 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \n\nadvice before using this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and potential risks of \n\nbeing given this medicine during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nIf you become pregnant while being treated with Xolair, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nXolair may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for \n\nadvice before using this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nIt is unlikely that Xolair will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How Xolair is given \n \n\nInstructions on how to use Xolair are given in the section “Information for the healthcare \n\nprofessional”. \n\n \n\nXolair is given to you by a doctor or nurse as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). \n\n \n\nFollow carefully all instructions given by your doctor or nurse. \n\n \n\nHow much you will be given \n\nAllergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \n\nYour doctor will decide how much Xolair you need and how often you will be given it. This depends \n\non your body weight and the results of a blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to \n\nmeasure the amount of IgE in your blood. \n\n \n\nYou will be given 1 to 4 injections at a time, either every two weeks, or every four weeks. \n\n \n\nKeep taking your current asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine during Xolair treatment. Do not stop \n\ntaking any asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine without talking to your doctor. \n\n \n\nYou may not see an immediate improvement after beginning Xolair therapy. In patients with nasal \n\npolyps effects have been seen 4 weeks after the start of the treatment. In asthma patients it usually \n\ntakes between 12 and 16 weeks to have the full effect. \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\nYou will be given two 150 mg injections at a time every four weeks. \n\n \n\nKeep taking your current medicine for CSU during Xolair treatment. Do not stop taking any medicine \n\nwithout talking to your doctor. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nXolair can be given to children and adolescents aged 6 years and older, who are already receiving \n\nasthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high dose \n\nsteroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. Your doctor will work out how much Xolair your child \n\nneeds and how often it needs to be given. This will depend on your child’s weight and the results of a \n\nblood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure the amount of IgE in his/her blood. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \n\nXolair should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n\n \n\n\n\n136 \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\nXolair can be given to adolescents aged 12 years and older, who are already receiving antihistamines \n\nbut whose CSU symptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. The dose for adolescents aged \n\n12 years and above is the same as for adults. \n\n \n\nIf a dose of Xolair is missed \nContact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment. \n\n \n\nIf you stop treatment with Xolair \n\nDo not stop treatment with Xolair unless your doctor tells you to. Interrupting or stopping the \n\ntreatment with Xolair may cause your symptoms to come back. \n\n \n\nHowever, if you are being treated for CSU, your doctor may stop Xolair treatment from time to time \n\nso that your symptoms can be assessed. Follow your doctor’s instructions. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

The fully reconstituted medicinal product will appear clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to \n\npale brownish-yellow and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial. Because \n\nof the viscosity of the reconstituted medicinal product care must be taken to withdraw all of the \n\nmedicinal product from the vial before expelling any air or excess solution from the syringe in order to \n\nobtain the 1.2 ml. \n\n \n\nTo prepare Xolair 150 mg vials for subcutaneous administration, please adhere to the following \n\ninstructions: \n\n \n\n1. Draw 1.4 ml of water for injections from the ampoule into a syringe equipped with a large-bore \n\n18-gauge needle. \n\n \n\n2. With the vial placed upright on a flat surface, insert the needle and transfer the water for \n\ninjections into the vial containing the lyophilised powder using standard aseptic techniques, \n\ndirecting the water for injections directly onto the powder. \n\n \n\n3. Keeping the vial in an upright position, vigorously swirl it (do not shake) for approximately \n\n1 minute to evenly wet the powder. \n\n \n\n4. To aid in dissolution after completing step 3, gently swirl the vial for 5-10 seconds \n\napproximately every 5 minutes in order to dissolve any remaining solids. \n\n \n\nNote that in some cases it may take longer than 20 minutes for the powder to dissolve \n\ncompletely. If this is the case, repeat step 4 until there are no visible gel-like particles in the \n\nsolution. \n\n \n\nWhen the medicinal product is fully dissolved, there should be no visible gel-like particles in \n\nthe solution. Small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial are common. The reconstituted \n\nmedicinal product will appear clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale brownish-yellow. \n\nDo not use if solid particles are present. \n\n \n\n5. Invert the vial for at least 15 seconds in order to allow the solution to drain towards the stopper. \n\nUsing a new 3-ml syringe equipped with a large-bore, 18-gauge needle, insert the needle into \n\nthe inverted vial. Keeping the vial inverted position the needle tip at the very bottom of the \n\nsolution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe. Before removing the needle \n\nfrom the vial, pull the plunger all the way back to the end of the syringe barrel in order to \n\nremove all of the solution from the inverted vial. \n\n \n\n6. Replace the 18-gauge needle with a 25-gauge needle for subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\n7. Expel air, large bubbles, and any excess solution in order to obtain the required 1.2 ml dose. A \n\nthin layer of small bubbles may remain at the top of the solution in the syringe. Because the \n\nsolution is slightly viscous, it may take 5-10 seconds to administer the solution by subcutaneous \n\ninjection. \n\n \n\nThe vial delivers 1.2 ml (150 mg) of Xolair. For a 75 mg dose, draw up 0.6 ml into the syringe \n\nand discard the remaining solution. \n\n \n\n8. The injections are administered subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm, the lower \n\nabdomen (but not the area 5 centimetres around the navel) or the thigh. \n\n\n\n141 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nXolair 75 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n\nomalizumab \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Xolair is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Xolair \n\n3. How to use Xolair \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Xolair \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Xolair is and what it is used for \n \n\nXolair contains the active substance omalizumab. Omalizumab is a man-made protein that is similar to \n\nnatural proteins produced by the body. It belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies. \n\n \n\nXolair is used for the treatment of: \n\n- allergic asthma \n- chronic rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the nose and sinuses) with nasal polyps \n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nThis medicine is used to prevent asthma from getting worse by controlling symptoms of severe \n\nallergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) who are already receiving \n\nasthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high-dose \n\nsteroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \n\nThis medicine is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adults (18 years of age and \n\nolder) who are already receiving intranasal corticosteroids (corticosteroid nasal spray), but whose \n\nsymptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. Nasal polyps are small growths on the lining of \n\nthe nose. Xolair helps to reduce the size of the polyps and improves symptoms including nasal \n\ncongestion, loss of sense of smell, mucus in the back of the throat and runny nose. \n\n \n\nXolair works by blocking a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is produced by the body. \n\nIgE contributes to a type of inflammation that plays a key role in causing allergic asthma and chronic \n\nrhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n142 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Xolair \n \n\nDo not use Xolair: \n\n- if you are allergic to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic to any of the ingredients, tell your doctor as you should not use \n\nXolair. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before using Xolair: \n\n- if you have kidney or liver problems. \n- if you have a disorder where your own immune system attacks parts of your own body \n\n(autoimmune disease). \n\n- if you are travelling to region where infections caused by parasites are common - Xolair may \nweaken your resistance to such infections. \n\n- if you have had a previous severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), for example resulting from a \nmedicine, an insect bite or food. \n\n- if you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. The needle cap of the syringe may contain dry \nrubber (latex). \n\n \n\nXolair does not treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Therefore Xolair should \n\nnot be used to treat such symptoms. \n\n \n\nXolair is not meant to prevent or treat other allergy-type conditions, such as sudden allergic reactions, \n\nhyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (an inherited immune disorder), aspergillosis (a fungus-related \n\nlung disease), food allergy, eczema or hay fever because Xolair has not been studied in these \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\nLook out for signs of allergic reactions and other serious side effects \n\nXolair can potentially cause serious side effects. You must look out for signs of these conditions while \n\nyou use Xolair. Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs indicating a severe allergic \n\nreaction or other serious side effects. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in section 4. \n\n \n\nIt is important that you receive training from your doctor in how to recognise early symptoms of \n\nsevere allergic reactions, and how to manage these reactions if they occur, before you inject Xolair \n\nyourself or before a non-healthcare professional gives you a Xolair injection (see section 3, “How to \n\nuse Xolair”). The majority of severe allergic reactions occur within the first 3 doses of Xolair. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nXolair is not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Its use in children under 6 years of age \n\nhas not been studied. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \n\nXolair is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Its use in patients \n\nunder 18 years of age has not been studied. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Xolair \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nThis is especially important if you are taking: \n\n- medicines to treat an infection caused by a parasite, as Xolair may reduce the effect of your \n\nmedicines, \n\n- inhaled corticosteroids and other medicines for allergic asthma. \n\n \n\n\n\n143 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \n\nadvice before using this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and potential risks of \n\nusing this medicine during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nIf you become pregnant while being treated with Xolair, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nXolair may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for \n\nadvice before using this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nIt is unlikely that Xolair will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Xolair \n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow Xolair is used \n\nXolair is used as an injection under your skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). \n\n \n\nInjecting Xolair \n\n- You and your doctor will decide if you should inject Xolair yourself. The first 3 doses are \nalways given by or under the supervision of a healthcare professional (see section 2). \n\n- It is important to be properly trained on how to inject the medicine before injecting yourself. \n- A caregiver (for example a parent) may also give you your Xolair injection after he or she has \n\nreceived proper training. \n\n \n\nFor detailed instructions on how to inject Xolair, see “Instructions for use of Xolair pre-filled syringe” \n\nat the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nTraining to recognise serious allergic reactions \n\nIt is also important that you do not inject Xolair yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or \n\nnurse on: \n\n- how to recognise the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions. \n- what to do if the symptoms occur. \nFor more information about the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions, see section 4. \n\n \n\nHow much to use \n\nYour doctor will decide how much Xolair you need and how often you will need it. This depends on \n\nyour body weight and the results of a blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure \n\nthe amount of IgE in your blood. \n\n \n\nYou will need 1 to 4 injections at a time. You will need the injections either every two weeks, or every \n\nfour weeks. \n\n \n\nKeep taking your current asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine during Xolair treatment. Do not stop \n\ntaking any asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine without talking to your doctor. \n\n \n\nYou may not see an immediate improvement after beginning Xolair treatment. In patients with nasal \n\npolyps effects have been seen 4 weeks after the start of the treatment. In asthma patients it usually \n\ntakes between 12 and 16 weeks to have the full effect. \n\n \n\n\n\n144 \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nXolair can be used in children and adolescents aged 6 years and older, who are already receiving \n\nasthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high dose \n\nsteroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. Your doctor will work out how much Xolair your child \n\nneeds and how often it needs to be given. This will depend on your child’s weight and the results of a \n\nblood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure the amount of IgE in his/her blood. \n\n \n\nChildren (6 to 11 years of age) are not expected to self-administer Xolair. However, if considered \n\nappropriate by their doctor, a caregiver may give them their Xolair injection after proper training. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \n\nXolair should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n\n \n\nIf a dose of Xolair is missed \n\nIf you have missed an appointment, contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule \n\nit. \n\n \n\nIf you have forgotten to give yourself a dose of Xolair, inject the dose as soon as you remember. Then \n\ntalk to your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop treatment with Xolair \n\nDo not stop treatment with Xolair unless your doctor tells you to. Interrupting or stopping the \n\ntreatment with Xolair may cause your symptoms to come back. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The side \n\neffects caused by Xolair are usually mild to moderate but can occasionally be serious. \n\n \n\nSerious side effects: \n\n \n\nSeek medical attention immediately if you notice any signs of the following side effects: \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\n- Severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis).

If your doctor decides that you or a \n\ncaregiver may be able to give your injections of Xolair at home, you need to be trained by your doctor, \n\nnurse or pharmacist before you inject yourself or others. Children (6 to less than 12 years of age) are not \n\nexpected to inject Xolair themselves, however, if deemed appropriate by their doctor, a caregiver may give \n\nthem their Xolair injection after proper training. The box contains Xolair pre-filled syringe(s) individually \n\nsealed in a plastic tray. \n\n \n\nYour Xolair 75 mg pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAfter the medicine has been injected, the syringe guard will be activated to cover the needle. This is \n\nintended to protect against accidental needlestick injuries. \n\n \n\nOther items you need for your injection: \n\n \n\n Alcohol swab. \n\n Cotton ball or gauze. \n\n Sharps disposal container. \n\n \n \n\nImportant safety information \n\nCaution: Keep the syringe out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n The needle cap of the syringe may contain dry rubber (latex), which should not be handled by \nanyone who is sensitive to this substance. \n\n Do not open the sealed outer box until you are ready to use this medicine. \n\n Do not use this medicine if either the seal on the outer box or the seal of the plastic tray is \nbroken, as it may not be safe for you to use. \n\n Never leave the syringe where others might tamper with it. \n\n Do not shake the syringe. \n\n Be careful not to touch the syringe guard wings before use. If the wings are touched, the syringe \nguard may be activated too early. \n\n Do not remove the needle cap until just before you give the injection. \n\n The syringe cannot be re-used. Dispose of the used syringe immediately after use in a sharps \ncontainer. \n\n \n\n  \n\nNeedle \ncap \n\nSyringe guard \n\nViewing window \nLabel & expiry date \n\nFinger grips Syringe \nguard wings \n\n \nPlunger \n\nPlunger head \n\n\n\n149 \n\nStorage of the Xolair pre-filled syringe \n\n Store this medicine sealed in its outer box to protect it from light. Store in the refrigerator \nbetween 2°C and 8°C. DO NOT FREEZE. \n\n Remember to take the syringe out of the refrigerator and allow it to reach room temperature \n(25°C) before preparing it for injection (it will take about 20 minutes). Leave the syringe in the \n\nbox to protect it from light. The time that the syringe is kept at room temperature (25°C) before \n\nuse must not exceed 4 hours. \n\n Do not use the syringe after the expiry date which is stated on the outer box and syringe label. If \nit has expired, return the entire pack to the pharmacy. \n\n \n\nThe injection site \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nThe injection site is the place on the body where you are going to use \n\nthe syringe. \n\n The recommended site is the front of the thighs. You may also \nuse the lower abdomen, but not the area 5 centimetres around \n\nthe navel (belly button). \n\n If you need to give more than one injection for the full dose, \nchoose a different injection site each time you inject. \n\n Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, \nor hard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. \n\nIf a caregiver is giving the injection, the outer upper arms may also \n\nbe used. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 \n\nPreparing the Xolair pre-filled syringe for use \n\n \n\nNote: Depending on the dose prescribed to you by your doctor, you may need to prepare one or more \n\npre-filled syringes, and inject the contents of them all. The following table gives examples of how \n\nmany injections of each dose strength you need for a given dose: \n\n \n \n\n1. Take the box containing the syringe out of the refrigerator and leave it unopened for about \n\n20 minutes so that it reaches room temperature (leave the syringe in the box to protect it from \n\nlight). \n\n2. When you are ready to use the syringe, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\n3. Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab. \n\n4. Remove the plastic tray from the box, peel back the paper cover. Gripping the middle of the \n\nblue syringe guard, lift the syringe out of the tray. \n\n5. Inspect the syringe. The liquid should be clear to slightly cloudy. Its colour may vary from \n\ncolourless to pale brownish-yellow. You may see an air bubble, which is normal. DO NOT USE \n\nif the syringe is broken or if the liquid looks distinctly cloudy or distinctly brown, or contains \n\nparticles. In all these cases, return the entire pack to the pharmacy. \n\n6. Holding the syringe horizontally look into the viewing window to check the expiry date printed \n\non the label. Note: It is possible to rotate the inner part of the syringe assembly so that the label \n\ncan be read in the viewing window. DO NOT USE if the product has expired. If expired, return \n\nthe entire pack to the pharmacy. \n\n \n\nDose Syringes needed for the dose \n\n75 mg 1 blue (75 mg) \n\n150 mg 1 purple (150 mg) \n\n225 mg 1 blue (75 mg) 1 purple (150 mg) \n\n300 mg 2 purple (150 mg) \n\n375 mg 1 blue (75 mg) 2 purple (150 mg) \n\n450 mg 3 purple (150 mg) \n\n525 mg 1 blue (75 mg) 3 purple (150 mg) \n\n600 mg 4 purple (150 mg) \n\n\n\n151 \n\nHow to use the Xolair pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nCarefully remove the needle cap from the syringe. \n\nDiscard the needle cap. You may see a drop of \n\nliquid at the end of the needle. This is normal. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nGently pinch the skin at the injection site and \n\ninsert the needle as shown. Push the needle all the \n\nway in to ensure that the medicine can be fully \n\nadministered. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nHold the syringe as shown. Slowly depress the \n\nplunger as far as it will go so that the plunger \n\nhead is completely between the syringe guard \n\nwings. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n\n\n152 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nKeep the plunger fully depressed while you \n\ncarefully lift the needle straight out from the \n\ninjection site. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nSlowly release the plunger and allow the syringe \n\nguard to automatically cover the exposed needle. \n\n \n\nThere may be a small amount of blood at the \n\ninjection site. You can press a cotton ball or \n\ngauze over the injection site and hold it for \n\n30 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You \n\nmay cover the injection site with a small adhesive \n\nbandage, if needed. \n\n \n\nDisposal instructions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDispose of the used syringe immediately in a \n\nsharps container (closable, puncture resistant \n\ncontainer). For the safety and health of you and \n\nothers, needles and used syringes must never be \n\nre-used. Any unused medicinal product or waste \n\nmaterial should be disposed of in accordance with \n\nlocal requirements. Do not throw away any \n\nmedicines via wastewater or household waste. \n\nAsk your pharmacist how to throw away \n\nmedicines you no longer use. These measures will \n\nhelp protect the environment. \n\n \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n\n\n153 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nXolair 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n\nomalizumab \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Xolair is and what it is used for \n\n2.

What Xolair is and what it is used for \n \n\nXolair contains the active substance omalizumab. Omalizumab is a man-made protein that is similar to \n\nnatural proteins produced by the body. It belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies. \n\n \n\nXolair is used for the treatment of: \n\n- allergic asthma \n- chronic rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the nose and sinuses) with nasal polyps \n- chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nThis medicine is used to prevent asthma from getting worse by controlling symptoms of severe \n\nallergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) who are already receiving \n\nasthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high-dose \n\nsteroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \n\nThis medicine is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adults (18 years of age and \n\nolder) who are already receiving intranasal corticosteroids (corticosteroid nasal spray), but whose \n\nsymptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. Nasal polyps are small growths on the lining of \n\nthe nose. Xolair helps to reduce the size of the polyps and improves symptoms including nasal \n\ncongestion, loss of sense of smell, mucus in the back of the throat and runny nose. \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\nThis medicine is used to treat chronic spontaneous urticaria in adults and adolescents (12 years of age \n\nand older) who are already receiving antihistamines but whose CSU symptoms are not well controlled \n\nby these medicines. \n\n \n\nXolair works by blocking a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is produced by the body. \n\nIgE contributes to a type of inflammation that plays a key role in causing allergic asthma, chronic \n\nrhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and CSU. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n154 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Xolair \n \n\nDo not use Xolair: \n\n- if you are allergic to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic to any of the ingredients, tell your doctor as you should not use \n\nXolair. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before using Xolair: \n\n- if you have kidney or liver problems. \n- if you have a disorder where your own immune system attacks parts of your own body \n\n(autoimmune disease). \n\n- if you are travelling to region where infections caused by parasites are common - Xolair may \nweaken your resistance to such infections. \n\n- if you have had a previous severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), for example resulting from a \nmedicine, an insect bite or food. \n\n- if you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. The needle cap of the syringe may contain dry \nrubber (latex). \n\n \n\nXolair does not treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Therefore Xolair should \n\nnot be used to treat such symptoms. \n\n \n\nXolair is not meant to prevent or treat other allergy-type conditions, such as sudden allergic reactions, \n\nhyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (an inherited immune disorder), aspergillosis (a fungus-related \n\nlung disease), food allergy, eczema or hay fever because Xolair has not been studied in these \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\nLook out for signs of allergic reactions and other serious side effects \n\nXolair can potentially cause serious side effects. You must look out for signs of these conditions while \n\nyou use Xolair. Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs indicating a severe allergic \n\nreaction or other serious side effects. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in section 4. \n\n \n\nIt is important that you receive training from your doctor in how to recognise early symptoms of \n\nsevere allergic reactions, and how to manage these reactions if they occur, before you inject Xolair \n\nyourself or before a non-healthcare professional gives you a Xolair injection (see section 3, “How to \n\nuse Xolair”). The majority of severe allergic reactions occur within the first 3 doses of Xolair. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nXolair is not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Its use in children under 6 years of age \n\nhas not been studied. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \n\nXolair is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Its use in patients \n\nunder 18 years of age has not been studied. \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\nXolair is not recommended for children under 12 years of age. Its use in children under 12 years of age \n\nhas not been studied. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n155 \n\nOther medicines and Xolair \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nThis is especially important if you are taking: \n\n- medicines to treat an infection caused by a parasite, as Xolair may reduce the effect of your \n\nmedicines, \n\n- inhaled corticosteroids and other medicines for allergic asthma. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \n\nadvice before using this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and potential risks of \n\nusing this medicine during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nIf you become pregnant while being treated with Xolair, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nXolair may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for \n\nadvice before using this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nIt is unlikely that Xolair will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Xolair \n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure \n\n \n\nHow Xolair is used \n\nXolair is used as an injection under your skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). \n\n \n\nInjecting Xolair \n\n- You and your doctor will decide if you should inject Xolair yourself. The first 3 doses are \nalways given by or under the supervision of a healthcare professional (see section 2). \n\n- It is important to be properly trained on how to inject the medicine before injecting yourself. \n- A caregiver (for example a parent) may also give you your Xolair injection after he or she has \n\nreceived proper training. \n\n \n\nFor detailed instructions on how to inject Xolair, see “Instructions for use of Xolair pre-filled syringe” \n\nat the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nTraining to recognise serious allergic reactions \n\nIt is also important that you do not inject Xolair yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or \n\nnurse on: \n\n- how to recognise the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions \n- what to do if the symptoms occur. \nFor more information about the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions, see section 4. \n\n \n\nHow much to use \n\nAllergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \n\nYour doctor will decide how much Xolair you need and how often you will need it. This depends on \n\nyour body weight and the results of a blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure \n\nthe amount of IgE in your blood. \n\n \n\nYou will need 1 to 4 injections at a time. You will need the injections either every two weeks, or every \n\nfour weeks. \n\n \n\n\n\n156 \n\nKeep taking your current asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine during Xolair treatment. Do not stop \n\ntaking any asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine without talking to your doctor. \n\n \n\nYou may not see an immediate improvement after beginning Xolair treatment. In patients with nasal \n\npolyps effects have been seen 4 weeks after the start of the treatment. In asthma patients it usually \n\ntakes between 12 and 16 weeks to have the full effect. \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\nYou will need two 150 mg injections at a time every four weeks. \n\n \n\nKeep taking your current medicine for CSU during Xolair treatment. Do not stop taking any medicine \n\nwithout talking to your doctor. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\nAllergic asthma \n\nXolair can be used in children and adolescents aged 6 years and older, who are already receiving \n\nasthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high dose \n\nsteroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. Your doctor will work out how much Xolair your child \n\nneeds and how often it needs to be given. This will depend on your child’s weight and the results of a \n\nblood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure the amount of IgE in his/her blood. \n\n \n\nChildren (6 to 11 years of age) are not expected to self-administer Xolair. However, if considered \n\nappropriate by their doctor, a caregiver may give them their Xolair injection after proper training. \n\n \n\nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \n\nXolair should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n\n \n\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) \n\nXolair can be used in adolescents aged 12 years of age and older, who are already receiving \n\nantihistamines but whose CSU symptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. The dose for \n\nadolescents aged 12 years and above is the same as for adults. \n\n \n\nIf a dose of Xolair is missed \nIf you have missed an appointment, contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule \n\nit. \n\n \n\nIf you have forgotten to give yourself a dose of Xolair, inject the dose as soon as you remember. Then \n\ntalk to your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop treatment with Xolair \n\nDo not stop treatment with Xolair unless your doctor tells you to. Interrupting or stopping the \n\ntreatment with Xolair may cause your symptoms to come back. \n\n \n\nHowever, if you are being treated for CSU, your doctor may stop Xolair treatment from time to time \n\nso that your symptoms can be assessed. Follow your doctor’s instructions. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n157 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The side \n\neffects caused by Xolair are usually mild to moderate but can occasionally be serious. \n\n \n\nSerious side effects: \n\n \n\nSeek medical attention immediately if you notice any signs of the following side effects: \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\n- Severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis).

If your doctor decides that you or a \n\ncaregiver may be able to give your injections of Xolair at home, you need to be trained by your doctor, \n\nnurse or pharmacist before you inject yourself or others. Children (6 to less than 12 years of age) are not \n\nexpected to inject Xolair themselves, however, if deemed appropriate by their doctor, a caregiver may give \n\nthem their Xolair injection after proper training. The box contains Xolair pre-filled syringe(s) individually \n\nsealed in a plastic tray. \n\n \n\nYour Xolair 150 mg pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAfter the medicine has been injected, the syringe guard will be activated to cover the needle. This is \n\nintended to protect against accidental needlestick injuries. \n\n \n\nOther items you need for your injection: \n\n \n\n Alcohol swab. \n\n Cotton ball or gauze. \n\n Sharps disposal container. \n\n \n \n\nImportant safety information \n\nCaution: Keep the syringe out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n The needle cap of the syringe may contain dry rubber (latex), which should not be handled by \nanyone who is sensitive to this substance. \n\n Do not open the sealed outer box until you are ready to use this medicine. \n\n Do not use this medicine if either the seal on the outer box or the seal of the plastic tray is \nbroken, as it may not be safe for you to use. \n\n Never leave the syringe where others might tamper with it. \n\n Do not shake the syringe. \n\n Be careful not to touch the syringe guard wings before use. If the wings are touched, the syringe \nguard may be activated too early. \n\n Do not remove the needle cap until just before you give the injection. \n\n The syringe cannot be re-used. Dispose of the used syringe immediately after use in a sharps \ncontainer. \n\n \n\n  \n\nNeedle \ncap \n\nSyringe guard \n\nViewing window \nLabel & expiry date \n\nSyringe \nguard wings \n\n \n\nFinger Grips \n\nPlunger \n\nPlunger \nhead \n\n\n\n162 \n\nStorage of the Xolair pre-filled syringe \n\n Store this medicine sealed in its outer box to protect it from light. Store in the refrigerator \nbetween 2°C and 8°C. DO NOT FREEZE. \n\n Remember to take the syringe out of the refrigerator and allow it to reach room temperature \n(25°C) before preparing it for injection (it will take about 20 minutes). Leave the syringe in the \n\nbox to protect it from light. The time that the syringe is kept at room temperature (25°C) before \n\nuse must not exceed 4 hours. \n\n Do not use the syringe after the expiry date which is stated on the outer box and syringe label. If \nit has expired, return the entire pack to the pharmacy. \n\n \n\nThe injection site \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nThe injection site is the place on the body where you are going to \n\nuse the syringe. \n\n The recommended site is the front of the thighs. You may \nalso use the lower abdomen, but not the area 5 centimetres \n\naround the navel (belly button). \n\n If you need to give more than one injection for the full \ndose, choose a different injection site each time you inject. \n\n Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, \nred, or hard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. \n\nIf a caregiver is giving the injection, the outer upper arms may \n\nalso be used. \n\n \n\n\n\n163 \n\nPreparing the Xolair pre-filled syringe for use \n\n \n\nNote: Depending on the dose prescribed to you by your doctor, you may need to prepare one or more \n\npre-filled syringes, and inject the contents of them all. The following table gives examples of how \n\nmany injections of each dose strength you need for a given dose: \n\n \n \n\n1. Take the box containing the syringe out of the refrigerator and leave it unopened for about \n20 minutes so that it reaches room temperature (leave the syringe in the box to protect it from \n\nlight). \n\n2. When you are ready to use the syringe, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\n3. Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab. \n\n4. Remove the plastic tray from the box and peel back the paper cover. Gripping the middle of the \n\npurple syringe guard, lift the syringe out of the tray. \n\n5. Inspect the syringe. The liquid should be clear to slightly cloudy. Its colour may vary from \n\ncolourless to pale brownish-yellow. You may see an air bubble, which is normal. DO NOT USE \n\nif the syringe is broken or if the liquid looks distinctly cloudy or distinctly brown, or contains \n\nparticles. In all these cases, return the entire pack to the pharmacy. \n\n6. Holding the syringe horizontally, look into the viewing window to check the expiry date printed \n\non the label. Note: It is possible to rotate the inner part of the syringe assembly so that the label \n\ncan be read in the viewing window. DO NOT USE if the product has expired. If expired, return \n\nthe entire pack to the pharmacy. \n\n \n\nDose Syringes needed for the dose \n\n75 mg 1 blue (75 mg) \n\n150 mg 1 purple (150 mg) \n\n225 mg 1 blue (75 mg) 1 purple (150 mg) \n\n300 mg 2 purple (150 mg) \n\n375 mg 1 blue (75 mg) 2 purple (150 mg) \n\n450 mg 3 purple (150 mg) \n\n525 mg 1 blue (75 mg) 3 purple (150 mg) \n\n600 mg 4 purple (150 mg) \n\n\n\n164 \n\nHow to use the Xolair pre-filled syringe \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nCarefully remove the needle cap from the syringe. \n\nDiscard the needle cap. You may see a drop of \n\nliquid at the end of the needle. This is normal. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nGently pinch the skin at the injection site and \n\ninsert the needle as shown. Push the needle all the \n\nway in to ensure that the medicine can be fully \n\nadministered. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nHold the syringe as shown. Slowly depress the \n\nplunger as far as it will go so that the plunger \n\nhead is completely between the syringe guard \n\nwings. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n\n\n165 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nKeep the plunger fully depressed while you \n\ncarefully lift the needle straight out from the \n\ninjection site. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nSlowly release the plunger and allow the syringe \n\nguard to automatically cover the exposed needle. \n\n \n\nThere may be a small amount of blood at the \n\ninjection site. You can press a cotton ball or \n\ngauze over the injection site and hold it for \n\n30 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You \n\nmay cover the injection site with a small adhesive \n\nbandage, if needed. \n\n \n\nDisposal instructions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nDispose of the used syringe immediately in a \n\nsharps container (closable, puncture resistant \n\ncontainer). For the safety and health of you and \n\nothers, needles and used syringes must never be \n\nre-used. Any unused medicinal product or waste \n\nmaterial should be disposed of in accordance with \n\nlocal requirements. Do not throw away any \n\nmedicines via wastewater or household waste. \n\nAsk your pharmacist how to throw away \n\nmedicines you no longer use. These measures will \n\nhelp protect the environment. \n\n \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
