CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSildenafil Actavis is indicated in adult men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve \nor maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. \n \nIn order for Sildenafil Actavis to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nUse in adults \nThe recommended dose is 50 mg taken as needed approximately one hour before sexual activity. \nBased on efficacy and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The \nmaximum recommended dose is 100 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per \nday. If Sildenafil Actavis is taken with food, the onset of activity may be delayed compared to the \nfasted state (see section 5.2). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nDosage adjustments are not required in elderly patients (\u2265 65 years old). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe dosing recommendations described in \u2018Use in adults\u2019 apply to patients with mild to moderate \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance=30-80 mL/min). \n \nSince sildenafil clearance is reduced in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n<30 mL/min) a 25 mg dose should be considered. Based on efficacy and tolerability, the dose may be \nincreased step-wise to 50 mg up to 100 mg as necessary. \n \nHepatic impairment \nSince sildenafil clearance is reduced in patients with hepatic impairment (e.g. cirrhosis) a 25 mg dose \nshould be considered. Based on efficacy and tolerability, the dose may be increased step-wise to \n50 mg up to100 mg as necessary. \n \nPaediatric population \nSildenafil Actavis is not indicated for individuals below 18 years of age.  \n \nUse in patients taking other medicinal products \nWith the exception of ritonavir for which co-administration with sildenafil is not advised (see \nsection 4.4) a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in patients receiving concomitant treatment \nwith CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.5). \n \nIn order to minimise the potential of developing postural hypotension in patients receiving \nalpha-blocker treatment, patients should be stabilised on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating \nsildenafil treatment. In addition, initiation of sildenafil at a dose of 25 mg should be considered (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nConsistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) \npathway (see section 5.1), sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its \nco-administration with nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) or nitrates in any form is therefore \ncontraindicated. \n \nThe co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, \nsuch as riociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section \n4.5). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nAgents for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, including sildenafil, should not be used in men for \nwhom sexual activity is inadvisable (e.g. patients with severe cardiovascular disorders such as \nunstable angina or severe cardiac failure). \n \nSildenafil Actavis is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of \nnon-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in \nconnection or not with previous PDE5 inhibitor exposure (see section 4.4). \n \nThe safety of sildenafil has not been studied in the following sub-groups of patients and its use is \ntherefore contraindicated: severe hepatic impairment, hypotension (blood pressure <90/50 mmHg), \nrecent history of stroke or myocardial infarction and known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders \nsuch as retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal \nphosphodiesterases). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nA medical history and physical examination should be undertaken to diagnose erectile dysfunction and \ndetermine potential underlying causes, before pharmacological treatment is considered. \n \nCardiovascular risk factors \n \nPrior to initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction, physicians should consider the cardiovascular \nstatus of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Sildenafil \nhas vasodilator properties, resulting in mild and transient decreases in blood pressure (see section 5.1). \nPrior to prescribing sildenafil, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with certain \nunderlying conditions could be adversely affected by such vasodilatory effects, especially in \ncombination with sexual activity. Patients with increased susceptibility to vasodilators include those \nwith left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g., aortic stenosis, hypertrophic obstructive \ncardiomyopathy), or those with the rare syndrome of multiple system atrophy manifesting as severely \nimpaired autonomic control of blood pressure. \n \nSildenafil Actavis potentiates the hypotensive effect of nitrates (see section 4.3). \n \nSerious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, sudden cardiac death, \nventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular haemorrhage, transient ischaemic attack, hypertension and \nhypotension have been reported post-marketing in temporal association with the use of sildenafil. \nMost, but not all, of these patients had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. Many events were \nreported to occur during or shortly after sexual intercourse and a few were reported to occur shortly \nafter the use of sildenafil without sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events \nare related directly to these factors or to other factors. \n \nPriapism \n \nAgents for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, including sildenafil, should be used with caution in \npatients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or \nPeyronie\u2019s disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such \nas sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia). \n \nProlonged erections and priapism have been reported with sildenafil in post-marketing experience. In \nthe event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical \nassistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency \ncould result. \n \nConcomitant use with other PDE5 inhibitors or other treatments for erectile dysfunction \n \nThe safety and efficacy of combinations of sildenafil with other PDE5 inhibitors, or other pulmonary \narterial hypertension (PAH) treatments containing sildenafil (REVATIO), or other treatments for \n\n\n\n5 \n\nerectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore the use of such combinations is not \nrecommended. \n \nEffects on vision \n \nCases of visual defects have been reported spontaneously in connection with the intake of sildenafil \nand other PDE5 inhibitors (see section 4.8). Cases of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, \na rare condition have been reported spontaneously and in an observational study in connection with \nthe intake of sildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised that in \nthe event of any sudden visual defect, they should stop taking Sildenafil Actavis and consult a \nphysician immediately (see section 4.3). \n \nConcomitant use with ritonavir \n \nCo-administration of sildenafil with ritonavir is not advised (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use with alpha-blockers \n \nCaution is advised when sildenafil is administered to patients taking an alpha-blocker, as the \nco-administration may lead to symptomatic hypotension in a few susceptible individuals (see \nsection 4.5). This is most likely to occur within 4 hours post sildenafil dosing. In order to minimise the \npotential for developing postural hypotension, patients should be hemodynamically stable on \nalpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating sildenafil treatment. Initiation of sildenafil at a dose of 25 mg \nshould be considered (see section 4.2). In addition, physicians should advise patients what to do in the \nevent of postural hypotensive symptoms. \n \nEffect on bleeding \n \nStudies with human platelets indicate that sildenafil potentiates the antiaggregatory effect of sodium \nnitroprusside in vitro. There is no safety information on the administration of sildenafil to patients with \nbleeding disorders or active peptic ulceration. Therefore sildenafil should be administered to these \npatients only after careful benefit-risk assessment. \n \nThe Sildenafil Actavis tablet contains lactose monohydrate. Sildenafil Actavis should not be \nadministered to men with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption. \n \nWomen \n \nSildenafil Actavis is not indicated for use by women. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on sildenafil \n \nIn vitro studies \nSildenafil metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major \nroute) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes may reduce sildenafil \nclearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase sildenafil clearance. \n \nIn vivo studies \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of clinical trial data indicated a reduction in sildenafil clearance \nwhen co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, cimetidine). \nAlthough no increased incidence of adverse events was observed in these patients, when sildenafil is \nadministered concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nCo-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at \nsteady state (500 mg twice daily) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) \nincrease in sildenafil Cmax and a 1,000% (11-fold) increase in sildenafil plasma AUC. At 24 hours, the \nplasma levels of sildenafil were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL \nwhen sildenafil was administered alone. This is consistent with ritonavir\u2019s marked effects on a broad \nrange of P450 substrates. Sildenafil had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Based on these \npharmacokinetic results co-administration of sildenafil with ritonavir is not advised (see section 4.4) \nand in any event the maximum dose of sildenafil should under no circumstances exceed 25 mg within \n48 hours. \n \nCo-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state \n(1200 mg three times a day) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in \nsildenafil Cmax and a 210% increase in sildenafil AUC. Sildenafil had no effect on saquinavir \npharmacokinetics (see section 4.2). Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole and \nitraconazole would be expected to have greater effects. \n \nWhen a single 100 mg dose of sildenafil was administered with erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 \ninhibitor, at steady state (500 mg twice daily for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in sildenafil \nsystemic exposure (AUC). In normal healthy male volunteers, there was no evidence of an effect of \nazithromycin (500 mg daily for 3 days) on the AUC, Cmax, tmax, elimination rate constant, or \nsubsequent half-life of sildenafil or its principal circulating metabolite. Cimetidine (800 mg), a \ncytochrome P450 inhibitor and non-specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma \nsildenafil concentrations when co-administered with sildenafil (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. \n \nGrapefruit juice is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 gut wall metabolism and may give rise to modest \nincreases in plasma levels of sildenafil. \n \nSingle doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminium hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability \nof sildenafil. \n \nAlthough specific interaction studies were not conducted for all medicinal products, population \npharmacokinetic analysis showed no effect of concomitant treatment on sildenafil pharmacokinetics \nwhen grouped as CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin, phenytoin), CYP2D6 inhibitors \n(such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related \ndiuretics, loop and potassium sparing diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium \nchannel blockers, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists or inducers of CYP450 metabolism (such as \nrifampicin, barbiturates). In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the endothelin \nantagonist, bosentan, (an inducer of CYP3A4 [moderate], CYP2C9 and possibly of CYP2C19) at \nsteady state (125 mg twice a day) with sildenafil at steady state (80 mg three times a day) resulted in \n62.6% and 55.4% decrease in sildenafil AUC and Cmax, respectively. Therefore, concomitant \nadministration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in \nplasma concentrations of sildenafil. \n \nNicorandil is a hybrid of potassium channel activator and nitrate. Due to the nitrate component it has \nthe potential to result in a serious interaction with sildenafil. \n \nEffects of sildenafil on other medicinal products \n \nIn vitro studies \nSildenafil is a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoforms 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 \n(IC50>150 \u00b5M). Given sildenafil peak plasma concentrations of approximately 1 \u00b5M after \nrecommended doses, it is unlikely that Sildenafil Actavis will alter the clearance of substrates of these \nisoenzymes. \n \nThere are no data on the interaction of sildenafil and non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as \ntheophylline or dipyridamole. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nIn vivo studies \nConsistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway (see section 5.1), sildenafil was \nshown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its co-administration with nitric oxide \ndonors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nRiociguat: Preclinical studies showed additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 \ninhibitors were combined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the \nhypotensive effects of PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the \ncombination in the population studied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including \nsildenafil, is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nConcomitant administration of sildenafil to patients taking alpha-blocker therapy may lead to \nsymptomatic hypotension in a few susceptible individuals. This is most likely to occur within 4 hours \npost sildenafil dosing (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). In three specific drug-drug interaction studies, the \nalpha-blocker doxazosin (4 mg and 8 mg) and sildenafil (25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg) were administered \nsimultaneously to patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) stabilized on doxazosin therapy. \nIn these study populations, mean additional reductions of supine blood pressure of 7/7 mmHg, \n9/5 mmHg, and 8/4 mmHg, and mean additional reductions of standing blood pressure of 6/6 mmHg, \n11/4 mmHg, and 4/5 mmHg, respectively, were observed. When sildenafil and doxazosin were \nadministered simultaneously to patients stabilized on doxazosin therapy, there were infrequent reports \nof patients who experienced symptomatic postural hypotension. These reports included dizziness and \nlight-headedness, but not syncope. \n \nNo significant interactions were shown when sildenafil (50 mg) was co-administered with tolbutamide \n(250 mg) or warfarin (40 mg), both of which are metabolised by CYP2C9. \n \nSildenafil (50 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl salicylic acid \n(150 mg). \n \nSildenafil (50 mg) did not potentiate the hypotensive effects of alcohol in healthy volunteers with \nmean maximum blood alcohol levels of 80 mg/dl. \n \nPooling of the following classes of antihypertensive medication: diuretics, beta-blockers, \nACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, antihypertensive medicinal products (vasodilator and \ncentrally-acting), adrenergic neurone blockers, calcium channel blockers and alpha-adrenoceptor \nblockers, showed no difference in the side effect profile in patients taking sildenafil compared to \nplacebo treatment. In a specific interaction study, where sildenafil (100 mg) was co-administered with \namlodipine in hypertensive patients, there was an additional reduction on supine systolic blood \npressure of 8 mmHg. The corresponding additional reduction in supine diastolic blood pressure was \n7 mmHg. These additional blood pressure reductions were of a similar magnitude to those seen when \nsildenafil was administered alone to healthy volunteers (see section 5.1). \n \nSildenafil (100 mg) did not affect the steady state pharmacokinetics of the HIV protease inhibitors, \nsaquinavir and ritonavir, both of which are CYP3A4 substrates. \n \nIn healthy male volunteers, sildenafil at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) resulted in a 49.8% increase in \nbosentan AUC and a 42% increase in bosentan Cmax (125 mg b.i.d.). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nSildenafil Actavis is not indicated for use by women. \n \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant or breast-feeding women. \n \nNo relevant adverse effects were found in reproduction studies in rats and rabbits following oral \nadministration of sildenafil. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThere was no effect on sperm motility or morphology after single 100 mg oral doses of sildenafil in \nhealthy volunteers (see section 5.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \nAs dizziness and altered vision were reported in clinical trials with sildenafil, patients should be aware \nof how they react to Sildenafil Actavis, before driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety profile of sildenafil is based on 9,570 patients in 74 double-blind placebo-controlled \nclinical studies. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies among sildenafil \ntreated patients were headache, flushing, dyspepsia, nasal congestion, dizziness, nausea, hot flush, \nvisual disturbance, cyanopsia and vision blurred. \n \nAdverse reactions from post-marketing surveillance has been gathered covering an estimated period \n>10 years. Because not all adverse reactions are reported the frequencies of these reactions cannot be \nreliably determined. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the table below all medically important adverse reactions, which occurred in clinical trials at an \nincidence greater than placebo are listed by system organ class and frequency (very common (\u22651/10), \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000)).  \n \nIn addition, the frequency of medically important adverse reactions reported from post-marketing \nexperience is included as not known.  \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 1: Medically important adverse reactions reported at an incidence greater than placebo in \ncontrolled clinical studies and medically important adverse reactions reported through \npost-marketing surveillance \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \ncommon \n(\u2265 1/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u2265 1/100 and \n<1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(\u2265 1/1000 and \n<1/100) \n\nRare \n(\u2265 1/10000 and \n<1/1000 \n \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n  Rhinitis  \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Dizziness Somnolence, \nHypoaesthesia \n\nCerebrovascular \naccident, \nTransient \nischaemic attack, \nSeizure,* \nSeizure \nrecurrence,* \nSyncope \n\nEye disorders  Visual colour \ndistortions**, \nVisual \ndisturbance, \nVision \nblurred \n \n\nLacrimation \ndisorders***, \nEye pain, \nPhotophobia, \nPhotopsia,  \nOcular \nhyperaemia, \nVisual \nbrightness,  \nConjunctivitis  \n \n\nNon-arteritic \nanterior ischaemic \noptic neuropathy \n(NAION), * \nRetinal vascular \nocclusion,* \nRetinal \nhaemorrhage, \nArteriosclerotic \nretinopathy, \nRetinal disorder, \nGlaucoma, \nVisual field \ndefect, \nDiplopia, \nVisual acuity \nreduced, \nMyopia, \nAsthenopia, \nVitreous floaters, \nIris disorder,  \nMydriasis, \nHalo vision,  \nEye oedema, \nEye swelling, \nEye disorder, \nConjunctival \nhyperaemia, \nEye irritation, \nAbnormal \nsensation in eye, \nEyelid oedema, \nScleral \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \ncommon \n(\u2265 1/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u2265 1/100 and \n<1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(\u2265 1/1000 and \n<1/100) \n\nRare \n(\u2265 1/10000 and \n<1/1000 \n \ndiscoloration \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders  \n\n  Vertigo, \nTinnitus \n\nDeafness \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Tachycardia, \nPalpitations \n\nSudden cardiac \ndeath,* \nMyocardial \ninfarction, \nVentricular \narrhythmia,* \n\nAtrial fibrillation, \nUnstable angina \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Flushing, \nHot flush \n\nHypertension, \nHypotension \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Nasal \ncongestion \n\nEpistaxis, \nSinus congestion \n\nThroat tightness, \nNasal oedema, \nNasal dryness \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea, \nDyspepsia \n\nGastro \noesophagael \nreflux disease, \nVomiting, \nAbdominal pain \nupper, \nDry mouth \n\nHypoaesthesia \noral \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Rash Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome (SJS),* \nToxic Epidermal \nNecrolysis \n(TEN)*  \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n  Myalgia, \nPain in extremity \n\n \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n  Haematuria  \n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders \n\n   Penile \nhaemorrhage, \nPriapism,* \nHaematospermia, \nErection \nincreased \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \ncommon \n(\u2265 1/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u2265 1/100 and \n<1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(\u2265 1/1000 and \n<1/100) \n\nRare \n(\u2265 1/10000 and \n<1/1000 \n \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n  Chest pain, \nFatigue, \nFeeling hot \n\nIrritability \n\nInvestigations   Heart rate \nincreased \n\n \n\n*Reported during post-marketing surveillance only \n**Visual colour distortions: Chloropsia, Chromatopsia, Cyanopsia, Erythropsia and Xanthopsia \n***Lacrimation disorders: Dry eye, Lacrimal disorder and Lacrimation increased \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn single dose volunteer studies of doses up to 800 mg, adverse reactions were similar to those seen at \nlower doses, but the incidence rates and severities were increased. Doses of 200 mg did not result in \nincreased efficacy but the incidence of adverse reactions (headache, flushing, dizziness, dyspepsia, \nnasal congestion, altered vision) was increased. \n \nIn cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is \nnot expected to accelerate clearance as sildenafil is highly bound to plasma proteins and not eliminated \nin the urine. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals; Drugs used in erectile dysfunction, ATC Code: G04BE03. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nSildenafil is an oral therapy for erectile dysfunction. In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, \nit restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis. \n \nThe physiological mechanism responsible for erection of the penis involves the release of nitric oxide \n(NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme \nguanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), \nproducing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. \n \nSildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the \ncorpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP. Sildenafil has a peripheral \nsite of action on erections. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus \ncavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue. When the NO/cGMP \npathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in \nincreased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for \nsildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nStudies in vitro have shown that sildenafil is selective for PDE5, which is involved in the erection \nprocess. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases. There is a 10-fold \nselectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina. At maximum \nrecommended doses, there is an 80-fold selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-fold over PDE2, 3, 4, 7, \n8, 9, 10 and 11. In particular, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-fold selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, \nthe cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nTwo clinical studies were specifically designed to assess the time window after dosing during which \nsildenafil could produce an erection in response to sexual stimulation. In a penile plethysmography \n(RigiScan) study of fasted patients, the median time to onset for those who obtained erections of 60% \nrigidity (sufficient for sexual intercourse) was 25 minutes (range 12-37 minutes) on sildenafil. In a \nseparate RigiScan study, sildenafil was still able to produce an erection in response to sexual \nstimulation 4-5 hours post-dose. \n \nSildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in blood pressure which, in the majority of cases, do not \ntranslate into clinical effects. The mean maximum decreases in supine systolic blood pressure \nfollowing 100 mg oral dosing of sildenafil was 8.4 mmHg. The corresponding change in supine \ndiastolic blood pressure was 5.5 mmHg. These decreases in blood pressure are consistent with the \nvasodilatory effects of sildenafil, probably due to increased cGMP levels in vascular smooth muscle. \nSingle oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant \neffects on ECG. \n \nIn a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with \nsevere coronary artery disease (CAD) (>70% stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting \nsystolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7% and 6% respectively compared to baseline. \nMean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9%. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac \noutput, and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries. \n \nA double-blind, placebo-controlled exercise stress trial evaluated 144 patients with erectile \ndysfunction and chronic stable angina who regularly received anti-anginal medicinal products (except \nnitrates). The results demonstrated no clinically relevant differences between sildenafil and placebo in \ntime to limiting angina. \n \nMild and transient differences in colour discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects \nusing the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident \nafter 2 hours post-dose. The postulated mechanism for this change in colour discrimination is related \nto inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina. Sildenafil has \nno effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients \nwith documented early age-related macular degeneration (n=9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) \ndemonstrated no significant changes in the visual tests conducted (visual acuity, Amsler grid, colour \ndiscrimination simulated traffic light, Humphrey perimeter and photostress). \n \nThere was no effect on sperm motility or morphology after single 100 mg oral doses of sildenafil in \nhealthy volunteers (see section 4.6). \n \nFurther information on clinical trials \nIn clinical trials sildenafil was administered to more than 8000 patients aged 19-87. The following \npatient groups were represented: elderly (19.9%), patients with hypertension (30.9%), diabetes \nmellitus (20.3%), ischaemic heart disease (5.8%), hyperlipidaemia (19.8%), spinal cord injury (0.6%), \ndepression (5.2%), transurethral resection of the prostate (3.7%), radical prostatectomy (3.3%). The \nfollowing groups were not well represented or excluded from clinical trials: patients with pelvic \n\n\n\n13 \n\nsurgery, patients post-radiotherapy, patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment and patients with \ncertain cardiovascular conditions (see section 4.3). \n \nIn fixed dose studies, the proportions of patients reporting that treatment improved their erections were \n62% (25 mg), 74% (50 mg) and 82% (100 mg) compared to 25% on placebo. In controlled clinical \ntrials, the discontinuation rate due to sildenafil was low and similar to placebo. \nAcross all trials, the proportion of patients reporting improvement on sildenafil were as follows: \npsychogenic erectile dysfunction (84%), mixed erectile dysfunction (77%), organic erectile \ndysfunction (68%), elderly (67%), diabetes mellitus (59%), ischaemic heart disease (69%), \nhypertension (68%), TURP (61%), radical prostatectomy (43%), spinal cord injury (83%), depression \n(75%). The safety and efficacy of sildenafil was maintained in long-term studies. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing sildenafil in all subsets of the paediatric population for the \ntreatment of erectile dysfunction. See 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nSildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to \n120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. The mean absolute oral \nbioavailability is 41% (range 25-63%). After oral dosing of sildenafil AUC and Cmax increase in \nproportion with dose over the recommended dose range (25-100 mg). \n \nWhen sildenafil is taken with food, the rate of absorption is reduced with a mean delay in tmax of \n60 minutes and a mean reduction in Cmax of 29%. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe mean steady state volume of distribution (Vd) for sildenafil is 105 l, indicating distribution into the \ntissues. After a single oral dose of 100 mg, the mean maximum total plasma concentration of sildenafil \nis approximately 440 ng/mL (CV 40%). Since sildenafil (and its major circulating N-desmethyl \nmetabolite) is 96% bound to plasma proteins, this results in the mean maximum free plasma \nconcentration for sildenafil of 18 ng/mL (38 nM). Protein binding is independent of total drug \nconcentrations. \n \nIn healthy volunteers receiving sildenafil (100 mg single dose), less than 0.0002% (average 188 ng) of \nthe administered dose was present in ejaculate 90 minutes after dosing. \n \nBiotransformation  \n \nSildenafil is cleared predominantly by the CYP3A4 (major route) and CYP2C9 (minor route) hepatic \nmicrosomal isoenzymes. The major circulating metabolite results from N-demethylation of sildenafil. \nThis metabolite has a phosphodiesterase selectivity profile similar to sildenafil and an in vitro potency \nfor PDE5 approximately 50% that of the parent drug. Plasma concentrations of this metabolite are \napproximately 40% of those seen for sildenafil. The N-desmethyl metabolite is further metabolised, \nwith a terminal half-life of approximately 4 h. \n \nElimination \n \nThe total body clearance of sildenafil is 41 L/h with a resultant terminal phase half-life of 3-5 h. After \neither oral or intravenous administration, sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the \nfaeces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine \n(approximately 13% of administered oral dose). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nElderly \nHealthy, elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of sildenafil, resulting in \napproximately 90% higher plasma concentrations of sildenafil and the active N-desmethyl metabolite \ncompared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers (18-45 years). Due to age-differences in plasma \nprotein binding, the corresponding increase in free sildenafil plasma concentration was approximately \n40%. \n \nRenal insufficiency \nIn volunteers with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance=30-80 mL/min), the \npharmacokinetics of sildenafil were not altered after receiving a 50 mg single oral dose. The mean \nAUC and Cmax of the N-desmethyl metabolite increased 126% and 73% respectively, compared to \nage-matched volunteers with no renal impairment. However, due to high inter-subject variability, \nthese differences were not statistically significant. In volunteers with severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in mean increases in \nAUC and Cmax of 100% and 88% respectively compared to age-matched volunteers with no renal \nimpairment. In addition, N-desmethyl metabolite AUC and Cmax values were significantly increased \n79% and 200% respectively. \n \nHepatic insufficiency \nIn volunteers with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A and B) sildenafil clearance was \nreduced, resulting in increases in AUC (84%) and Cmax (47%) compared to age-matched volunteers \nwith no hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in patients with severely impaired \nhepatic function have not been studied. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to \nreproduction and development. \n \n \n6.

How to take Sildenafil Actavis \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Sildenafil Actavis \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Sildenafil Actavis is and what it is used for \n \nSildenafil Actavis contains the active substance sildenafil which belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. It works by helping to relax the blood vessels in \nyour penis, allowing blood to flow into your penis when you get sexually excited. Sildenafil Actavis \nwill only help you to get an erection if you are sexually stimulated.  \nSildenafil Actavis is a treatment for adult men with erectile dysfunction, sometimes known as \nimpotence. This is when a man cannot get, or keep a hard, erect penis suitable for sexual activity. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Sildenafil Actavis \n \nDo not take Sildenafil Actavis \n \n- If you are allergic to sildenafil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \n \n- If you are taking medicines called nitrates, as the combination may lead to a dangerous fall in \n\nyour blood pressure. Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines which are often \ngiven for relief of angina pectoris (or \u201cchest pain\u201d). If you are not certain, ask your doctor or \npharmacist. \n\n \n- If you are using any of the medicines known as nitric oxide donors such as amyl nitrite \n\n(\u201cpoppers\u201d), as the combination may also lead to a dangerous fall in your blood pressure. \n \n- If you are taking riociguat. This drug is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., high \n\nblood pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high \nblood pressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots). PDE5 inhibitors, such as Sildenafil \nActavis have been shown to increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If you are taking \nriociguat or are unsure tell your doctor. \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n- If you have a severe heart or liver problem. \n \n- If you have recently had a stroke or a heart attack, or if you have low blood pressure. \n \n- If you have certain rare inherited eye diseases (such as retinitis pigmentosa). \n \n- If you have ever had loss of vision due to non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy \n\n(NAION). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Sildenafil Actavis \n \n- If you have sickle cell anaemia (an abnormality of red blood cells), leukaemia (cancer of blood \n\ncells), multiple myeloma (cancer of bone marrow). \n \n\n- If you have a deformity of your penis or Peyronie\u2019s Disease. \n \n- If you have problems with your heart. Your doctor should carefully check whether your heart \n\ncan take the additional strain of having sex. \n \n- If you currently have a stomach ulcer, or a bleeding problems (such as haemophilia). \n \n- If you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision, stop taking Sildenafil Actavis and contact \n\nyour doctor immediately. \n \nYou should not use Sildenafil Actavis with any other oral or local treatments for erectile dysfunction. \n \nYou should not use Sildenafil Actavis with treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) \ncontaining sildenafil or any other PDE5 inhibitors. \n \nYou should not take Sildenafil Actavis if you do not have erectile dysfunction. \n \nYou should not take Sildenafil Actavis if you are a woman. \n \nSpecial considerations for patients with kidney or liver problems \nYou should tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver problems.
