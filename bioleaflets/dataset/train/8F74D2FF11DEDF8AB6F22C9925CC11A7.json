NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nCRESEMBA 200 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach vial contains 200 mg isavuconazole (as 372.6 mg isavuconazonium sulfate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion\nWhite to yellow powder\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nCRESEMBA is indicated in adults for the treatment of\n\u2022 invasive aspergillosis\n\u2022 mucormycosis in patients for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate (see sections 4.4 and 5.1)\n\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antifungal agents.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nLoading dose\nThe recommended loading dose is one vial after reconstitution and dilution (equivalent to 200 mg of \nisavuconazole) every 8 hours for the first 48 hours (6 administrations in total).\n\nMaintenance dose\nThe recommended maintenance dose is one vial after reconstitution and dilution (equivalent to 200 mg \nof isavuconazole) once daily, starting 12 to 24 hours after the last loading dose.\n\nDuration of therapy should be determined by the clinical response (see section 5.1). \n\nFor long-term treatment beyond 6 months, the benefit-risk balance should be carefully considered (see \nsections 5.1 and 5.3).\n\nSwitch to oral isavuconazole\nCRESEMBA is also available as hard capsules containing 100 mg isavuconazole. \n\nOn the basis of the high oral bioavailability (98%, see section 5.2), switching between intravenous and \noral administration is appropriate when clinically indicated.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients; however the clinical experience in elderly \npatients is limited.\n\n\n\n3\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment, including patients with end-stage \nrenal disease (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nClasses A and B) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nIsavuconazole has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). \nUse in these patients is not recommended unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the \nrisks (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of CRESEMBA in children aged below 18 years has not yet been established. \nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nIntravenous use.\n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product\nCRESEMBA must be reconstituted and then further diluted to a concentration corresponding to \napproximately 0.8 mg/mL isavuconazole prior to administration by intravenous infusion over a \nminimum of 1 hour to reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions. The infusion must be administered \nvia an infusion set with an in-line filter with a microporous membrane made of polyethersulfone (PES) \nand with a pore size of 0.2 \u03bcm to 1.2 \u03bcm. CRESEMBA must only be given as an intravenous infusion.\n\nFor detailed instructions on the reconstitution and dilution of CRESEMBA before administration, see \nsection 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nCo-administration with ketoconazole (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with high-dose ritonavir (>200 mg every 12 hours) (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with strong CYP3A4/5 inducers such as rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, long-\nacting barbiturates (e.g. phenobarbital), phenytoin and St. John\u2019s wort or with moderate CYP3A4/5\ninducers such as efavirenz, nafcillin and etravirine (see section 4.5).\n\nPatients with familial short QT syndrome (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypersensitivity\n\nCaution should be used in prescribing isavuconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azole \nantifungal agents. Hypersensitivity to isavuconazole may result in adverse reactions that include: \nhypotension, respiratory failure, dyspnoea, drug eruption, pruritus, and rash.\n\nInfusion-related reactions\n\n\n\n4\n\nDuring intravenous administration of isavuconazole, infusion-related reactions including hypotension, \ndyspnoea, dizziness, paraesthesia, nausea, and headache were reported (see section 4.8). The infusion \nshould be stopped if these reactions occur. \n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions\n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during \ntreatment with azole antifungal agents. If a patient develops a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, \nCRESEMBA should be discontinued.\n\nCardiovascular\n\nQT shortening\nIsavuconazole is contraindicated in patients with familial short QT syndrome (see section 4.3).\nIn a QT study in healthy human subjects, isavuconazole shortened the QTc interval in a\nconcentration-related manner. For the 200 mg dosing regimen, the least squares mean (LSM) \ndifference from placebo was 13.1 ms at 2 hours post dose [90% CI: 17.1, 9.1 ms]. Increasing the dose \nto 600 mg resulted in an LSM difference from placebo of 24.6 ms at 2 hours post dose [90% CI: 28.7, \n20.4 ms].\n\nCaution is warranted when prescribing isavuconazole to patients taking other medicinal products\nknown to decrease the QT interval, such as rufinamide.\n\nElevated liver transaminases or hepatitis\n\nElevated liver transaminases have been reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8). The elevations in \nliver transaminases rarely required discontinuation of isavuconazole. Monitoring of hepatic enzymes \nshould be considered, as clinically indicated. Hepatitis has been reported with azole antifungal agents \nincluding isavuconazole.\n\nSevere hepatic impairment\n\nIsavuconazole has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).\nUse in these patients is not recommended unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the \nrisks. These patients should be carefully monitored for potential drug toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.8 \nand 5.2).\n\nConcomitant use with other medicinal products\n\nCYP3A4/5 inhibitors\nKetoconazole is contraindicated (see section 4.3). For the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, \na two-fold increase in isavuconazole exposure was observed. For other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, a \nless pronounced effect can be expected. No dose adjustment of isavuconazole is necessary when co-\nadministered with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, however caution is advised as adverse drug reactions\nmay increase (see section 4.5).\n\nCYP3A4/5 inducers\nCo-administration with mild CYP3A4/5 inducers such as aprepitant, prednisone, and pioglitazone, \nmay result in mild to moderate decreases of isavuconazole plasma levels; co-administration with mild \nCYP3A4/5 inducers should be avoided unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the risk \n(see section 4.5).\n\nCYP3A4/5 substrates including immunosuppressants\nIsavuconazole can be considered a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, and systemic exposure to\nmedicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4 may be increased when co-administered with \nisavuconazole.  Concomitant use of isavuconazole with CYP3A4 substrates such as the \n\n\n\n5\n\nimmunosuppressants tacrolimus, sirolimus or ciclosporin may increase the systemic exposure to these \nmedicinal products. Appropriate therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary \nduring co-administration (see section 4.5).\n\nCYP2B6 substrates\nIsavuconazole is an inducer of CYP2B6. Systemic exposure to medicinal products metabolised by \nCYP2B6 may be decreased when co-administered with isavuconazole. Therefore, caution is advised \nwhen CYP2B6 substrates, especially medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index such as \ncyclophosphamide, are co-administered with isavuconazole. The use of the CYP2B6 substrate \nefavirenz with isavuconazole is contraindicated because efavirenz is a moderate inducer of CYP3A4/5 \n(see section 4.3). \n\nP-gp substrates\nIsavuconazole may increase the exposure of medicinal products that are P-gp substrates. Dose \nadjustment of medicinal products that are P-gp substrates, especially medicinal products with a narrow \ntherapeutic index such as digoxin, colchicine and dabigatran etexilate, may be needed when \nconcomitantly administered with isavuconazole (see section 4.5).\n\nLimitations of the clinical data\n\nThe clinical data for isavuconazole in the treatment of mucormycosis are limited to one prospective \nnon-controlled clinical study in 37 patients with proven or probable mucormycosis who received \nisavuconazole for primary treatment, or because other antifungal treatments (predominantly \namphotericin B) were inappropriate. \nFor individual Mucorales species, the clinical efficacy data are very limited, often to one or two \npatients (see section 5.1). Susceptibility data were available in only a small subset of cases. These \ndata indicate that concentrations of isavuconazole required for inhibition in vitro are very variable \nbetween genera/species within the order of Mucorales, and generally higher than concentrations \nrequired to inhibit Aspergillus species. It should be noted that there was no dose-finding study in \nmucormycosis, and patients were administered the same dose of isavuconazole as was used for the \ntreatment of invasive aspergillosis.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPotential of medicinal products to affect the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole\n\nIsavuconazole is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (see section 5.2). Co-administration of \nmedicinal products which are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or CYP3A5 may increase the plasma \nconcentrations of isavuconazole. Co-administration of medicinal products which are inducers of \nCYP3A4 and/or CYP3A5 may decrease the plasma concentrations of isavuconazole.\n\nMedicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4/5\n\nCo-administration of isavuconazole with the strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor ketoconazole is \ncontraindicated, since this medicinal product can significantly increase plasma concentrations of \nisavuconazole (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nFor the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, a two-fold increase in isavuconazole exposure \nwas observed. For other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as clarithromycin, indinavir and saquinavir, a \nless pronounced effect can be expected, based on their relative potency. No dose adjustment of \nisavuconazole is necessary when co-administered with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, however caution \nis advised as adverse drug reactions may increase (see section 4.4).\n\nNo dose adjustment is warranted for moderate to mild CYP3A4/5 inhibitors.\n\nMedicinal products that induce CYP3A4/5\n\n\n\n6\n\nCo-administration of isavuconazole with potent CYP3A4/5 inducers such as rifampicin, rifabutin,\ncarbamazepine, long-acting barbiturates (e.g., phenobarbital), phenytoin and St. John\u2019s wort, or with \nmoderate CYP3A4/5 inducers such as efavirenz, nafcillin and etravirine, is contraindicated, since \nthese medicinal products can significantly decrease plasma concentrations of isavuconazole (see \nsection 4.3).\n\nCo-administration with mild CYP3A4/5 inducers such as aprepitant, prednisone and pioglitazone, may \nresult in mild to moderate decreases of isavuconazole plasma levels; co-administration with mild \nCYP3A4/5 inducers should be avoided unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the risk \n(see section 4.4).\n\nCo-administration with high-dose ritonavir (>200 mg twice daily) is contraindicated, as at high doses\nritonavir may induce CYP3A4/5 and decrease isavuconazole plasma concentrations (see section 4.3).\n\nPotential for isavuconazole to affect exposures of other medicines\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4/5\n\nIsavuconazole is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4/5; co-administration of isavuconazole with \nmedicinal products which are substrates of CYP3A4/5 may result in increased plasma concentrations \nof these medicinal products. \n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6\n\nIsavuconazole is a mild CYP2B6 inducer; co-administration of isavuconazole may result in decreased \nplasma concentrations of CYP2B6 substrates. \n\nMedicinal products transported by P-gp in the intestine\n\nIsavuconazole is a mild inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp); co-administration with isavuconazole may \nresult in increased plasma concentrations of P-gp substrates.\n\nMedicinal products transported by BCRP\n\nIsavuconazole is an inhibitor in vitro of BCRP, and plasma concentrations of substrates of BCRP may \ntherefore be increased. Caution is advised when isavuconazole is given concomitantly with substrates \nof BCRP.  \n\nMedicinal products renally excreted via transport proteins\n\nIsavuconazole is a mild inhibitor of the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2). Co-administration of \nisavuconazole with medicinal products which are substrates of OCT2 may result in increased plasma \nconcentrations of these medicinal products.\n\nUridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) substrates\n\nIsavuconazole is a mild inhibitor of UGT. Co-administration of isavuconazole with medicinal products \nwhich are substrates of UGT may result in mildly increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal \nproducts.\n\nInteraction table \n\nInteractions between isavuconazole and co-administered medicinal products are listed in Table 1 \n(increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d), ordered by therapeutic class. Unless otherwise stated, \nstudies detailed in Table 1 have been performed with the recommended dose of isavuconazole. \n\n\n\n7\n\nTable 1 Interactions\n\nCo-administered medicinal \n\nproduct by

Studies in animals did not show \nimpairment of fertility in male or female rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nIsavuconazole has a moderate potential to influence the ability to drive and use machines. Patients \nshould avoid driving or operating machinery if symptoms of confusional state, somnolence, syncope,\nand/or dizziness are experienced. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most common treatment-related adverse reactions were elevated liver chemistry tests (7.9%), \nnausea (7.4%), vomiting (5.5%), dyspnoea (3.2%), abdominal pain (2.7%), diarrhoea (2.7%), injection \nsite reaction (2.2%), headache (2.0%), hypokalaemia (1.7%) and rash (1.7%). \n\n\n\n13\n\nThe adverse reactions which most often led to permanent discontinuation of isavuconazole treatment \nwere confusional state (0.7%), acute renal failure (0.7%), increased blood bilirubin (0.5%), convulsion \n(0.5%), dyspnoea (0.5%), epilepsy (0.5%), respiratory failure (0.5%) and vomiting (0.5%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nTable 2 presents adverse reactions with isavuconazole in the treatment of invasive fungal infections, \nby System Organ Class and frequency.\n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to \n<1/10); and uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 2 Summary of adverse reactions by MedDRA System Organ Class and frequency \n\nSystem Organ \nClass Adverse Drug Reactions\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\n\nUncommon Neutropenia; Thrombocytopenia^; Pancytopenia; Leukopenia^; Anaemia^\nImmune system disorders\n\nUncommon Hypersensitivity^\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n\nCommon Hypokalaemia; Decreased appetite\nUncommon Hypomagnesaemia; Hypoglycaemia; Hypoalbuminaemia; Malnutrition^\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nCommon Delirium^#\n\nUncommon Depression; Insomnia^\nNervous system disorders\n\nCommon Headache; Somnolence\nUncommon Convulsion^; Syncope; Dizziness ; Paraesthesia^; \n\nEncephalopathy; Presyncope; Neuropathy peripheral; Dysgeusia; \nEar and labyrinth disorders\n\nUncommon Vertigo\nCardiac disorders\n\nUncommon Atrial fibrillation; Tachycardia; Bradycardia^; Palpitations\nAtrial flutter; Electrocardiogram QT shortened; Supraventricular tachycardia; \nVentricular extrasystoles ; Supraventricular extrasystoles\n\nVascular disorders\nCommon Thrombophlebitis^\nUncommon Circulatory collapse; Hypotension\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nCommon Dyspnoea;^ Acute respiratory failure^\nUncommon Bronchospasm; Tachypnoea; Haemoptysis; Epistaxis\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon Vomiting; Diarrhoea; Nausea; Abdominal pain^\nUncommon Dyspepsia; Constipation; Abdominal distension\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nCommon Elevated liver chemistry tests^#\n\nUncommon Hepatomegaly; Hepatitis\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nCommon Rash^; Pruritus\nUncommon Petechiae; Alopecia; Drug eruption; Dermatitis^\n\n\n\n14\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nUncommon Back pain\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nCommon Renal failure\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon Chest pain^; Fatigue; Injection site reaction^\nUncommon Oedema peripheral;^ Malaise; Asthenia\n\n^ Indicates that grouping of appropriate preferred terms into a single medical concept occurred.\n\n# See section Description of selected adverse reactions below \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nDelirium includes reactions of confusional state. \nElevated liver chemistry tests includes events of alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate \naminotransferase increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood bilirubin increased, blood \nlactate dehydrogenase increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, hepatic enzyme increased, \nhepatic function abnormal, hyperbilirubinemia, liver function test abnormal, and transaminases \nincreased.\n\nLaboratory effects\n\nIn a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled clinical study of 516 patients with invasive fungal \ndisease caused by Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi, elevated liver transaminases (alanine \naminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase) > 3 \u00d7 Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) were reported at \nthe end of study treatment in 4.4% of patients who received isavuconazole. Marked elevations of liver \ntransaminases > 10 \u00d7 ULN developed in 1.2% of patients on isavuconazole.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nSymptoms reported more frequently at supratherapeutic doses of isavuconazole (equivalent to \nisavuconazole 600 mg/day) evaluated in a QT study than in the therapeutic dose group (equivalent to \nisavuconazole 200 mg/day dose) included: headache, dizziness, paraesthesia, somnolence, disturbance \nin attention, dysgeusia, dry mouth, diarrhoea, oral hypoaesthesia, vomiting, hot flush, anxiety, \nrestlessness, palpitations, tachycardia, photophobia and arthralgia.\n\nManagement of overdose\n\nIsavuconazole is not removed by haemodialysis. There is no specific antidote for isavuconazole. In the \nevent of an overdose, supportive treatment should be instituted.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole derivatives, ATC code: J02AC05\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15\n\nMechanism of action\n\nIsavuconazole is the active moiety formed after oral or intravenous administration of isavuconazonium \nsulfate (see section 5.2).\n\nIsavuconazole demonstrates a fungicidal effect by blocking the synthesis of ergosterol, a key \ncomponent of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450-dependent \nenzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. \nThis results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the \ncell membrane, thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. \n\nMicrobiology\n\nIn animal models of disseminated and pulmonary aspergillosis, the pharmacodynamic (PD) index \nimportant in efficacy is exposure divided by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (AUC/MIC). \nNo clear correlation between in vitro MIC and clinical response for the different species (Aspergillus\nand Mucorales) could be established.\n\nConcentrations of isavuconazole required to inhibit Aspergillus species and genera/species of the order \nMucorales in vitro have been very variable. Generally, concentrations of isavuconazole required to \ninhibit Mucorales are higher than those required to inhibit the majority of Aspergillus species.\n\nClinical efficacy has been demonstrated for the following Aspergillus species: Aspergillus fumigatus, \nA. flavus, A. niger, and A. terreus(see further below).\n\nMechanism(s) of resistance\n\nReduced susceptibility to triazole antifungal agents has been associated with mutations in the fungal \ncyp51A and cyp51B genes coding for the target protein lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase involved in \nergosterol biosynthesis. Fungal strains with reduced in vitro susceptibility to isavuconazole have been \nreported, and cross-resistance with voriconazole and other triazole antifungal agents cannot be \nexcluded.\n\nBreakpoints\n\nEUCAST MIC breakpoints are defined for the following species (susceptible S; resistant R): \n\uf0b7 Aspergillus fumigatus: S \u2264 1 mg/L, R > 1 mg/L \n\uf0b7 Aspergillus nidulans: S \u2264 0.25 mg/L, R > 0.25 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus terreus: S \u2264 1 mg/L, R > 1 mg/L\n\nThere are currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for other Aspergillus species.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nTreatment of invasive aspergillosis\nThe safety and efficacy of isavuconazole for the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis was \nevaluated in a double-blind, active-controlled clinical study in 516 patients with invasive fungal \ndisease caused by Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) \npopulation, 258 patients received isavuconazole and 258 patients received voriconazole. \nIsavuconazole was administered intravenously (equivalent to 200 mg isavuconazole) every 8 hours for \nthe first 48 hours, followed by once-daily intravenous or oral treatment (equivalent to 200 mg \nisavuconazole). The protocol-defined maximum treatment duration was 84 days. Median treatment \nduration was 45 days.\n\n\n\n16\n\nThe overall response at end-of-treatment (EOT) in the myITT population (patients with proven and \nprobable invasive aspergillosis based on cytology, histology, culture or galactomannan testing) was \nassessed by an independent blinded Data Review Committee. The myITT population comprised 123\npatients receiving isavuconazole and 108 patients receiving voriconazole. The overall response in this \npopulation was n = 43 (35%) for isavuconazole and n = 42 (38.9%) for voriconazole. The adjusted \ntreatment difference (voriconazole\u2212isavuconazole) was 4.0% (95% confidence interval: \u22127.9; 15.9).\n\nThe all-cause mortality at Day 42 in this population was 18.7% for isavuconazole and 22.2% for \nvoriconazole. The adjusted treatment difference (isavuconazole\u2212voriconazole) was \u22122.7% (95 % \nconfidence interval: \u221212.9; 7.5).\n\nTreatment of mucormycosis\nIn an open-label non-controlled study, 37 patients with proven or probable mucormycosis received \nisavuconazole at the same dose regimen as that used to treat invasive aspergillosis. Median treatment \nduration was 84 days for the overall mucormycosis patient population, and 102 days for the 21 \npatients not previously treated for mucormycosis. For patients with probable or proven mucormycosis \nas defined by the independent Data Review Committee (DRC), all-cause mortality at Day 84 was \n43.2% (16/37) for the overall patient population, 42.9% (9/21) for mucormycosis patients receiving \nisavuconazole as primary treatment, and 43.8% (7/16) for mucormycosis patients receiving \nisavuconazole who were refractory to, or intolerant of, prior antifungal therapy (mainly amphotericin \nB-based treatments). The DRC-assessed overall success rate at EOT was 11/35 (31.4%), with 5 \npatients considered completely cured and 6 patients partially cured. A stable response was observed in \nan additional 10/35 patients (28.6%). In 9 patients with mucormycosis due to Rhizopus spp., 4 patients \nshowed a favourable response to isavuconazole. In 5 patients with mucormycosis due to Rhizomucor\nspp., no favourable responses were observed. The clinical experience in other species is very limited \n(Lichtheimia spp. n=2, Cunninghamella spp. n=1, Actinomucor elegans n=1).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nCRESEMBA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of invasive \naspergillosis and the treatment of mucormycosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nIsavuconazonium sulfate is a water-soluble prodrug that can be administered as an intravenous \ninfusion or orally as hard capsules. Following administration, isavuconazonium sulfate is rapidly \nhydrolysed by plasma esterases to the active moiety isavuconazole; plasma concentrations of the \nprodrug are very low, and detectable only for a short time after intravenous dosing.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing oral administration of CRESEMBA in healthy subjects, the active moiety isavuconazole is \nabsorbed and reaches maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) approximately 2\u20133 hours after single \nand multiple dosing (see Table 3). \n\nTable 3Steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of isavuconazole following oral administration \nof CRESEMBA\n\nParameter\nStatistic\n\nIsavuconazole 200 mg\n(n = 37)\n\nIsavuconazole 600 mg\n(n = 32)\n\nCmax (ng/mL)\n\nMean\nSD\nCV %\n\n7499\n1893.3\n25.2\n\n20028\n3584.3\n17.9\n\ntmax (h)\n\n\n\n17\n\nMedian\nRange\n\n3.0\n2.0 \u2013 4.0\n\n4.0\n2.0 \u2013 4.0\n\nAUC (h\u2022ng/mL)\n\nMean\nSD\nCV %\n\n121402\n35768.8\n\n29.5\n\n352805\n72018.5\n\n20.4\n\nAs shown in table 4 below, the absolute bioavailability of isavuconazole following oral administration \nof a single dose of CRESEMBA is 98%. Based on these findings, intravenous and oral dosing can be \nused interchangeably.\n\nTable 4Pharmacokinetic comparison for oral and intravenous dose (Mean)\n\nISA 400 mg oral ISA 400 mg i.v.\n\nAUC (h\u2022ng/mL) 189462.8 193906.8\n\nCV % 36.5 37.2\n\nHalf-life (h) 110 115\n\nEffect of food on absorption\nOral administration of CRESEMBA equivalent to 400 mg isavuconazole with a high-fat meal reduced \nisavuconazole Cmax by 9% and increased AUC by 9%. CRESEMBA can be taken with or without \nfood.\n\nDistribution\n\nIsavuconazole is extensively distributed, with a mean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) of \napproximately 450 L. Isavuconazole is highly bound (> 99%) to human plasma proteins, \npredominantly to albumin.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nIn vitro / in vivo studies indicate that CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and subsequently uridine diphosphate-\nglucuronosyltransferases (UGT), are involved in the metabolism of isavuconazole. \n\nFollowing single doses of [cyano-14C] isavuconazonium and [pyridinylmethyl-14C] isavuconazonium \nsulfate in humans, in addition to the active moiety (isavuconazole) and the inactive cleavage product, a \nnumber of minor metabolites were identified. Except for the active moiety isavuconazole, no \nindividual metabolite was observed with an AUC > 10% of total radio-labelled material.\n\nElimination\n\nFollowing oral administration of radio-labelled isavuconazonium sulfate to healthy subjects, a mean of \n46.1% of the radioactive dose was recovered in faeces, and 45.5% was recovered in urine. \n\nRenal excretion of intact isavuconazole was less than 1% of the dose administered.  \n\nThe inactive cleavage product is primarily eliminated by metabolism and subsequent renal excretion \nof the metabolites. \n\nLinearity/non-linearity\n\nStudies in healthy subjects have demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole are \nproportional up to 600 mg per day. \n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\n\n\n\n18\n\nPaediatric patients\nThe pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients (< 18 years) have not yet been evaluated. No data are \navailable.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo clinically relevant changes were observed in the total Cmax and AUC of isavuconazole in subjects \nwith mild, moderate or severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. Of \nthe 403 patients who received isavuconazole in the Phase 3 studies, 79 (20%) of patients had an \nestimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. No dose adjustment is \nrequired in patients with renal impairment, including those patients with end-stage renal disease. \nIsavuconazole is not readily dialysable (see section 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nAfter a single 100 mg dose of isavuconazole was administered to 32 patients with mild (Child-Pugh \nClass A) hepatic insufficiency and 32 patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic \ninsufficiency (16 intravenous and 16 oral patients per Child-Pugh class), the least square mean \nsystemic exposure (AUC) increased 64% in the Child-Pugh Class A group, and 84% in the Child-Pugh \nClass B group, relative to 32 age- and weight-matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. \nMean plasma concentrations (Cmax) were 2% lower in the Child-Pugh Class A group and 30% lower in \nthe Child-Pugh Class B group. The population pharmacokinetic evaluation of isavuconazole in healthy \nsubjects and patients with mild or moderate hepatic dysfunction demonstrated that the mild and \nmoderate hepatic impairment populations had 40% and 48% lower isavuconazole clearance (CL) \nvalues, respectively, than the healthy population. \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. \n\nIsavuconazole has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). \nUse in these patients is not recommended unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the \nrisks (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn rats and rabbits, isavuconazole at systemic exposures below the therapeutic level were associated \nwith dose-related increases in the incidence of skeletal anomalies (rudimentary supernumerary ribs) in \noffspring. In rats, a dose-related increase in the incidence of zygomatic arch fusion was also noted in \noffspring (see section 4.6).\n\nAdministration of isavuconazonium sulfate to rats at a dose of 90 mg/kg/day (2.3-fold the human \nmaintenance dose [200 mg] based on mg/m2/day) during pregnancy through the weaning period \nshowed an increased perinatal mortality of the pups. In utero exposure to the active moiety \nisavuconazole had no effect on the fertility of the surviving pups.\n\nIntravenous administration of 14C-labelled isavuconazonium sulfate to lactating rats resulted in the \nrecovery of radiolabel in the milk. \n\nIsavuconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated with oral doses up to \n90 mg/kg/day (2.3-fold the clinical maintenance dose based on mg/m2/day comparisons).\n\nIsavuconazole has no discernible mutagenic or genotoxic potential. Isavuconazole was negative in a \nbacterial reverse mutation assay, was weakly clastogenic at cytotoxic concentrations in the \nL5178Y tk+/- mouse lymphoma chromosome aberration assay, and showed no biologically relevant or \nstatistically significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei in an in vivo rat micronucleus test. \n\nNo carcinogenicity studies have been performed.  \n\n\n\n19\n\nIsavuconazole inhibited the hERG potassium channel and the L-type calcium channel with an IC50 of \n5.82 \u00b5M and 6.57 \u00b5M respectively (34- and 38-fold the human non-protein bound Cmax at maximum \nrecommended human dose [MRHD], respectively).The in vivo 39-week repeated-dose toxicology \nstudies in monkeys did not show QTcF prolongation at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (2.1-fold the \nrecommended clinical maintenance dose, based on mg/m2/day comparisons). \n\nEnvironmental risk assessment has shown that CRESEMBA may pose a risk for the aquatic \nenvironment.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nCRESEMBA is indicated in adults for the treatment of\n\u2022 invasive aspergillosis\n\u2022 mucormycosis in patients for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate (see sections 4.4 and 5.1)\n\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antifungal agents.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nLoading dose\nThe recommended loading dose is two capsules (equivalent to 200 mg of isavuconazole) every 8 hours \nfor the first 48 hours (6 administrations in total).\n\nMaintenance dose\nThe recommended maintenance dose is two capsules (equivalent to 200 mg of isavuconazole) once \ndaily, starting 12 to 24 hours after the last loading dose.\n\nDuration of therapy should be determined by the clinical response (see section 5.1). \n\nFor long-term treatment beyond 6 months, the benefit-risk balance should be carefully considered (see \nsections 5.1 and 5.3).\n\nSwitch to intravenous infusion\nCRESEMBA is also available as powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 200 mg \nisavuconazole.\n\nOn the basis of the high oral bioavailability (98%, see section 5.2), switching between intravenous and \noral administration is appropriate when clinically indicated.\n\nElderly\n\n\n\n22\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients; however the clinical experience in elderly \npatients is limited.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment, including patients with end-stage \nrenal disease (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nClasses A and B) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nIsavuconazole has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). \nUse in these patients is not recommended unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the \nrisks (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of CRESEMBA in children aged below 18 years has not yet been established. \nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nCRESEMBA capsules can be taken with or without food.\nCRESEMBA capsules should be swallowed whole. Do not chew, crush, dissolve or open the capsules.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nCo-administration with ketoconazole (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with high-dose ritonavir (>200 mg every 12 hours) (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with strong CYP3A4/5 inducers such as rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, long-\nacting barbiturates (e.g. phenobarbital), phenytoin and St. John\u2019s wort or with moderate CYP3A4/5\ninducers such as efavirenz, nafcillin and etravirine (see section 4.5).\n\nPatients with familial short QT syndrome (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypersensitivity\n\nCaution should be used in prescribing isavuconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azole \nantifungal agents. Hypersensitivity to isavuconazole may result in adverse reactions that include: \nhypotension, respiratory failure, dyspnoea, drug eruption, pruritus, and rash.\n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions\n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during \ntreatment with azole antifungal agents. If a patient develops a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, \nCRESEMBA should be discontinued.\n\nCardiovascular\n\nQT shortening\nIsacuvonazole is contraindicated in patients with familial short QT syndrome (see section 4.3).\n\n\n\n23\n\nIn a QT study in healthy human subjects, isavuconazole shortened the QTc interval in a\nconcentration-related manner. For the 200 mg dosing regimen, the least squares mean (LSM) \ndifference from placebo was 13.1 ms at 2 hours post dose [90% CI: 17.1, 9.1 ms]. Increasing the dose \nto 600 mg resulted in an LSM difference from placebo of 24.6 ms at 2 hours post dose [90% CI: 28.7, \n20.4 ms].\n\nCaution is warranted when prescribing isavuconazole to patients taking other medicinal products\nknown to decrease the QT interval, such as rufinamide.\n\nElevated liver transaminases or hepatitis\n\nElevated liver transaminases have been reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8). The elevations in \nliver transaminases rarely required discontinuation of isavuconazole. Monitoring of hepatic enzymes \nshould be considered, as clinically indicated. Hepatitis has been reported with azole antifungal agents \nincluding isavuconazole.\n\nSevere hepatic impairment\n\nIsavuconazole has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).\nUse in these patients is not recommended unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the \nrisks. These patients should be carefully monitored for potential drug toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.8 \nand 5.2).\n\nConcomitant use with other medicinal products\n\nCYP3A4/5 inhibitors\nKetoconazole is contraindicated (see section 4.3). For the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, \na two-fold increase in isavuconazole exposure was observed. For other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, a \nless pronounced effect can be expected. No dose adjustment of isavuconazole is necessary when co-\nadministered with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, however caution is advised as adverse drug reactions\nmay increase (see section 4.5).\n\nCYP3A4/5 inducers\nCo-administration with mild CYP3A4/5 inducers such as aprepitant, prednisone, and pioglitazone, \nmay result in mild to moderate decreases of isavuconazole plasma levels; co-administration with mild \nCYP3A4/5 inducers should be avoided unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the risk \n(see section 4.5).\n\nCYP3A4/5 substrates including immunosuppressants\nIsavuconazole can be considered a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, and systemic exposure to\nmedicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4 may be increased when co-administered with \nisavuconazole.  Concomitant use of isavuconazole with CYP3A4 substrates such as the \nimmunosuppressants tacrolimus, sirolimus or ciclosporin may increase the systemic exposure to these \nmedicinal products. Appropriate therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary \nduring co-administration (see section 4.5).\n\nCYP2B6 substrates\nIsavuconazole is an inducer of CYP2B6. Systemic exposure to medicinal products metabolised by \nCYP2B6 may be decreased when co-administered with isavuconazole. Therefore, caution is advised \nwhen CYP2B6 substrates, especially medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index such as \ncyclophosphamide, are co-administered with isavuconazole. The use of the CYP2B6 substrate \nefavirenz with isavuconazole is contraindicated because efavirenz is a moderate inducer of CYP3A4/5 \n(see section 4.3). \n\n\n\n24\n\nP-gp substrates\nIsavuconazole may increase the exposure of medicinal products that are P-gp substrates. Dose \nadjustment of medicinal products that are P-gp substrates, especially medicinal products with a narrow \ntherapeutic index such as digoxin, colchicine and dabigatran etexilate, may be needed when \nconcomitantly administered with isavuconazole (see section 4.5).\n\nLimitations of the clinical data\n\nThe clinical data for isavuconazole in the treatment of mucormycosis are limited to one prospective \nnon-controlled clinical study in 37 patients with proven or probable mucormycosis who received \nisavuconazole for primary treatment, or because other antifungal treatments (predominantly \namphotericin B) were inappropriate. \nFor individual Mucorales species, the clinical efficacy data are very limited, often to one or two \npatients (see section 5.1). Susceptibility data were available in only a small subset of cases. These \ndata indicate that concentrations of isavuconazole required for inhibition in vitro are very variable \nbetween genera/species within the order of Mucorales, and generally higher than concentrations \nrequired to inhibit Aspergillus species. It should be noted that there was no dose-finding study in \nmucormycosis, and patients were administered the same dose of isavuconazole as was used for the \ntreatment of invasive aspergillosis.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPotential of medicinal products to affect the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole\n\nIsavuconazole is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (see section 5.2). Co-administration of \nmedicinal products which are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or CYP3A5 may increase the plasma \nconcentrations of isavuconazole. Co-administration of medicinal products which are inducers of \nCYP3A4 and/or CYP3A5 may decrease the plasma concentrations of isavuconazole.\n\nMedicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4/5\n\nCo-administration of isavuconazole with the strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor ketoconazole is \ncontraindicated, since this medicinal product can significantly increase plasma concentrations of \nisavuconazole (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nFor the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, a two-fold increase in isavuconazole exposure \nwas observed. For other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as clarithromycin, indinavir and saquinavir, a \nless pronounced effect can be expected, based on their relative potency. No dose adjustment of \nisavuconazole is necessary when co-administered with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, however caution \nis advised as adverse drug reactions may increase (see section 4.4).\n\nNo dose adjustment is warranted for moderate to mild CYP3A4/5 inhibitors.\n\nMedicinal products that induce CYP3A4/5\n\nCo-administration of isavuconazole with potent CYP3A4/5 inducers such as rifampicin, rifabutin,\ncarbamazepine, long-acting barbiturates (e.g., phenobarbital), phenytoin and St. John\u2019s wort, or with \nmoderate CYP3A4/5 inducers such as efavirenz, nafcillin and etravirine, is contraindicated, since \nthese medicinal products can significantly decrease plasma concentrations of isavuconazole (see \nsection 4.3).\n\nCo-administration with mild CYP3A4/5 inducers such as aprepitant, prednisone and pioglitazone, may \nresult in mild to moderate decreases of isavuconazole plasma levels; co-administration with mild \nCYP3A4/5 inducers should be avoided unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the risk \n(see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n25\n\nCo-administration with high-dose ritonavir (>200 mg twice daily) is contraindicated, as at high doses\nritonavir may induce CYP3A4/5 and decrease isavuconazole plasma concentrations (see section 4.3).\n\nPotential for isavuconazole to affect exposures of other medicines\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4/5\n\nIsavuconazole is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4/5; co-administration of isavuconazole with \nmedicinal products which are substrates of CYP3A4/5 may result in increased plasma concentrations \nof these medicinal products. \n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6\n\nIsavuconazole is a mild CYP2B6 inducer; co-administration of isavuconazole may result in decreased \nplasma concentrations of CYP2B6 substrates. \n\nMedicinal products transported by P-gp in the intestine\n\nIsavuconazole is a mild inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp); co-administration with isavuconazole may \nresult in increased plasma concentrations of P-gp substrates.\n\nMedicinal products transported by BCRP\n\nIsavuconazole is an inhibitor in vitro of BCRP, and plasma concentrations of substrates of BCRP may \ntherefore be increased. Caution is advised when isavuconazole is given concomitantly with substrates \nof BCRP.  \n\nMedicinal products renally excreted via transport proteins\n\nIsavuconazole is a mild inhibitor of the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2). Co-administration of \nisavuconazole with medicinal products which are substrates of OCT2 may result in increased plasma \nconcentrations of these medicinal products.\n\nUridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) substrates\n\nIsavuconazole is a mild inhibitor of UGT. Co-administration of isavuconazole with medicinal products \nwhich are substrates of UGT may result in mildly increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal \nproducts.\n\nInteraction table \n\nInteractions between isavuconazole and co-administered medicinal products are listed in Table 1 \n(increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d), ordered by therapeutic class. Unless otherwise stated, \nstudies detailed in Table 1 have been performed with the recommended dose of isavuconazole. \n\nTable 1 Interactions\n\nCo-administered medicinal \n\nproduct by therapeutic

Studies in animals did not show \nimpairment of fertility in male or female rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nIsavuconazole has a moderate potential to influence the ability to drive and use machines. Patients \nshould avoid driving or operating machinery if symptoms of confusional state, somnolence, syncope,\nand/or dizziness are experienced. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most common treatment-related adverse reactions were elevated liver chemistry tests (7.9%), \nnausea (7.4%), vomiting (5.5%), dyspnoea (3.2%), abdominal pain (2.7%), diarrhoea (2.7%), injection \nsite reaction (2.2%), headache (2.0%), hypokalaemia (1.7%) and rash (1.7%). \n\nThe adverse reactions which most often led to permanent discontinuation of isavuconazole treatment \nwere confusional state (0.7%), acute renal failure (0.7%), increased blood bilirubin (0.5%), convulsion \n(0.5%), dyspnoea (0.5%), epilepsy (0.5%), respiratory failure (0.5%) and vomiting (0.5%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nTable 2 presents adverse reactions with isavuconazole in the treatment of invasive fungal infections, \nby System Organ Class and frequency.\n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to \n<1/10); and uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100). \n\n\n\n32\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 2 Summary of adverse reactions by MedDRA System Organ Class and frequency \n\nSystem Organ \nClass Adverse Drug Reactions\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\n\nUncommon Neutropenia; Thrombocytopenia^; Pancytopenia; Leukopenia^; Anaemia^\nImmune system disorders\n\nUncommon Hypersensitivity^\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n\nCommon Hypokalaemia; Decreased appetite\nUncommon Hypomagnesaemia; Hypoglycaemia; Hypoalbuminaemia; Malnutrition^\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nCommon Delirium^#\n\nUncommon Depression; Insomnia^\nNervous system disorders\n\nCommon Headache; Somnolence\nUncommon Convulsion^; Syncope; Dizziness ; Paraesthesia^; \n\nEncephalopathy; Presyncope; Neuropathy peripheral; Dysgeusia; \nEar and labyrinth disorders\n\nUncommon Vertigo\nCardiac disorders\n\nUncommon Atrial fibrillation; Tachycardia; Bradycardia^; Palpitations\nAtrial flutter; Electrocardiogram QT shortened; Supraventricular tachycardia; \nVentricular extrasystoles ; Supraventricular extrasystoles\n\nVascular disorders\nCommon Thrombophlebitis^\nUncommon Circulatory collapse; Hypotension\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nCommon Dyspnoea;^ Acute respiratory failure^\nUncommon Bronchospasm; Tachypnoea; Haemoptysis; Epistaxis\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon Vomiting; Diarrhoea; Nausea; Abdominal pain^\nUncommon Dyspepsia; Constipation; Abdominal distension\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nCommon Elevated liver chemistry tests^#\n\nUncommon Hepatomegaly; Hepatitis\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n\nCommon Rash^; Pruritus\nUncommon Petechiae; Alopecia; Drug eruption; Dermatitis^\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nUncommon Back pain\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nCommon Renal failure\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon Chest pain^; Fatigue\nUncommon Malaise; Asthenia\n\n^ Indicates that grouping of appropriate preferred terms into a single medical concept occurred.\n\n# See section Description of selected adverse reactions below \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nDelirium includes reactions of confusional state. \n\n\n\n33\n\nElevated liver chemistry tests includes events of alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate \naminotransferase increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood bilirubin increased, blood \nlactate dehydrogenase increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, hepatic enzyme increased, \nhepatic function abnormal, hyperbilirubinemia, liver function test abnormal, and transaminases \nincreased.\n\nLaboratory effects\n\nIn a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled clinical study of 516 patients with invasive fungal \ndisease caused by Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi, elevated liver transaminases (alanine \naminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase) > 3 \u00d7 Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) were reported at \nthe end of study treatment in 4.4% of patients who received isavuconazole. Marked elevations of liver \ntransaminases > 10 \u00d7 ULN developed in 1.2% of patients on isavuconazole.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nSymptoms reported more frequently at supratherapeutic doses of isavuconazole (equivalent to \nisavuconazole 600 mg/day) evaluated in a QT study than in the therapeutic dose group (equivalent to \nisavuconazole 200 mg/day dose) included: headache, dizziness, paraesthesia, somnolence, disturbance \nin attention, dysgeusia, dry mouth, diarrhoea, oral hypoaesthesia, vomiting, hot flush, anxiety, \nrestlessness, palpitations, tachycardia, photophobia and arthralgia.\n\nManagement of overdose\n\nIsavuconazole is not removed by haemodialysis. There is no specific antidote for isavuconazole. In the \nevent of an overdose, supportive treatment should be instituted.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole derivatives, ATC code: J02AC05\n\nMechanism of action\n\nIsavuconazole is the active moiety formed after oral or intravenous administration of isavuconazonium \nsulfate (see section 5.2).\n\nIsavuconazole demonstrates a fungicidal effect by blocking the synthesis of ergosterol, a key \ncomponent of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450-dependent \nenzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. \nThis results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the \ncell membrane, thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. \n\nMicrobiology\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n34\n\nIn animal models of disseminated and pulmonary aspergillosis, the pharmacodynamic (PD) index \nimportant in efficacy is exposure divided by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (AUC/MIC). \nNo clear correlation between in vitro MIC and clinical response for the different species (Aspergillus\nand Mucorales) could be established.\n\nConcentrations of isavuconazole required to inhibit Aspergillus species and genera/species of the order \nMucorales in vitro have been very variable. Generally, concentrations of isavuconazole required to \ninhibit Mucorales are higher than those required to inhibit the majority of Aspergillus species.\n\nClinical efficacy has been demonstrated for the following Aspergillus species: Aspergillus fumigatus, \nA. flavus, A. niger, and A. terreus (see further below).\n\nMechanism(s) of resistance\n\nReduced susceptibility to triazole antifungal agents has been associated with mutations in the fungal \ncyp51A and cyp51B genes coding for the target protein lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase involved in \nergosterol biosynthesis. Fungal strains with reduced in vitro susceptibility to isavuconazole have been \nreported, and cross-resistance with voriconazole and other triazole antifungal agents cannot be \nexcluded.\n\nBreakpoints\n\nEUCAST MIC breakpoints are defined for the following species (susceptible S; resistant R): \n\uf0b7 Aspergillus fumigatus: S \u2264 1 mg/L, R > 1 mg/L \n\uf0b7 Aspergillus nidulans: S \u2264 0.25 mg/L, R > 0.25 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Aspergillus terreus: S \u2264 1 mg/L, R > 1 mg/L\n\nThere are currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for other Aspergillus species.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nTreatment of invasive aspergillosis\nThe safety and efficacy of isavuconazole for the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis was \nevaluated in a double-blind, active-controlled clinical study in 516 patients with invasive fungal \ndisease caused by Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) \npopulation, 258 patients received isavuconazole and 258 patients received voriconazole. \nIsavuconazole was administered intravenously (equivalent to 200 mg isavuconazole) every 8 hours for \nthe first 48 hours, followed by once-daily intravenous or oral treatment (equivalent to 200 mg \nisavuconazole). The protocol-defined maximum treatment duration was 84 days. Median treatment \nduration was 45 days.\n\nThe overall response at end-of-treatment (EOT) in the myITT population (patients with proven and \nprobable invasive aspergillosis based on cytology, histology, culture or galactomannan testing) was \nassessed by an independent blinded Data Review Committee. The myITT population comprised 123\npatients receiving isavuconazole and 108 patients receiving voriconazole. The overall response in this \npopulation was n = 43 (35%) for isavuconazole and n = 42 (38.9%) for voriconazole. The adjusted \ntreatment difference (voriconazole\u2212isavuconazole) was 4.0% (95% confidence interval: \u22127.9; 15.9).\n\nThe all-cause mortality at Day 42 in this population was 18.7% for isavuconazole and 22.2% for \nvoriconazole. The adjusted treatment difference (isavuconazole\u2212voriconazole) was \u22122.7% (95 % \nconfidence interval: \u221212.9; 7.5).\n\nTreatment of mucormycosis\nIn an open-label non-controlled study, 37 patients with proven or probable mucormycosis received \nisavuconazole at the same dose regimen as that used to treat invasive aspergillosis. Median treatment \nduration was 84 days for the overall mucormycosis patient population, and 102 days for the 21 \n\n\n\n35\n\npatients not previously treated for mucormycosis. For patients with probable or proven mucormycosis \nas defined by the independent Data Review Committee (DRC), all-cause mortality at Day 84 was \n43.2% (16/37) for the overall patient population, 42.9% (9/21) for mucormycosis patients receiving \nisavuconazole as primary treatment, and 43.8% (7/16) for mucormycosis patients receiving \nisavuconazole who were refractory to, or intolerant of, prior antifungal therapy (mainly amphotericin \nB-based treatments). The DRC-assessed overall success rate at EOT was 11/35 (31.4%), with 5 \npatients considered completely cured and 6 patients partially cured. A stable response was observed in \nan additional 10/35 patients (28.6%). In 9 patients with mucormycosis due to Rhizopus spp., 4 patients \nshowed a favourable response to isavuconazole. In 5 patients with mucormycosis due to Rhizomucor\nspp., no favourable responses were observed. The clinical experience in other species is very limited \n(Lichtheimia spp. n=2, Cunninghamella spp. n=1, Actinomucor elegans n=1).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nCRESEMBA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of invasive \naspergillosis and the treatment of mucormycosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nIsavuconazonium sulfate is a water-soluble prodrug that can be administered as an intravenous \ninfusion or orally as hard capsules. Following administration, isavuconazonium sulfate is rapidly \nhydrolysed by plasma esterases to the active moiety isavuconazole; plasma concentrations of the \nprodrug are very low, and detectable only for a short time after intravenous dosing.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing oral administration of CRESEMBA in healthy subjects, the active moiety isavuconazole is \nabsorbed and reaches maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) approximately 2\u20133 hours after single \nand multiple dosing (see Table 3). \n\nTable 3Steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of isavuconazole following oral administration \nof CRESEMBA\n\nParameter\nStatistic\n\nIsavuconazole 200 mg\n(n = 37)\n\nIsavuconazole 600 mg\n(n = 32)\n\nCmax (ng/mL)\n\nMean\nSD\nCV %\n\n7499\n1893.3\n25.2\n\n20028\n3584.3\n17.9\n\ntmax (h)\n\nMedian\nRange\n\n3.0\n2.0 \u2013 4.0\n\n4.0\n2.0 \u2013 4.0\n\nAUC (h\u2022ng/mL)\n\nMean\nSD\nCV %\n\n121402\n35768.8\n\n29.5\n\n352805\n72018.5\n\n20.4\n\nAs shown in table 4 below, the absolute bioavailability of isavuconazole following oral administration \nof a single dose of CRESEMBA is 98%. Based on these findings, intravenous and oral dosing can be \nused interchangeably.\n\nTable 4Pharmacokinetic comparison for oral and intravenous dose (Mean)\n\nISA 400 mg oral ISA 400 mg i.v.\n\nAUC (h\u2022ng/mL) 189462.8 193906.8\n\nCV % 36.5 37.2\n\n\n\n36\n\nHalf-life (h) 110 115\n\nEffect of food on absorption\nOral administration of CRESEMBA equivalent to 400 mg isavuconazole with a high-fat meal reduced \nisavuconazole Cmax by 9% and increased AUC by 9%. CRESEMBA can be taken with or without \nfood.\n\nDistribution\n\nIsavuconazole is extensively distributed, with a mean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) of \napproximately 450 L. Isavuconazole is highly bound (> 99%) to human plasma proteins, \npredominantly to albumin.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nIn vitro / in vivo studies indicate that CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and subsequently uridine diphosphate-\nglucuronosyltransferases (UGT), are involved in the metabolism of isavuconazole. \n\nFollowing single doses of [cyano-14C] isavuconazonium and [pyridinylmethyl-14C] isavuconazonium \nsulfate in humans, in addition to the active moiety (isavuconazole) and the inactive cleavage product, a \nnumber of minor metabolites were identified. Except for the active moiety isavuconazole, no \nindividual metabolite was observed with an AUC > 10% of total radio-labelled material.\n\nElimination\n\nFollowing oral administration of radio-labelled isavuconazonium sulfate to healthy subjects, a mean of \n46.1% of the radioactive dose was recovered in faeces, and 45.5% was recovered in urine. \n\nRenal excretion of intact isavuconazole was less than 1% of the dose administered.  \n\nThe inactive cleavage product is primarily eliminated by metabolism and subsequent renal excretion \nof the metabolites. \n\nLinearity/non-linearity\n\nStudies in healthy subjects have demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole are \nproportional up to 600 mg per day. \n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\n\nPaediatric patients\nThe pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients (< 18 years) have not yet been evaluated. No data are \navailable.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo clinically relevant changes were observed in the total Cmax and AUC of isavuconazole in subjects \nwith mild, moderate or severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. Of \nthe 403 patients who received isavuconazole in the Phase 3 studies, 79 (20%) of patients had an \nestimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. No dose adjustment is \nrequired in patients with renal impairment, including those patients with end-stage renal disease. \nIsavuconazole is not readily dialysable (see section 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nAfter a single 100 mg dose of isavuconazole was administered to 32 patients with mild (Child-Pugh \nClass A) hepatic insufficiency and 32 patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic \n\n\n\n37\n\ninsufficiency (16 intravenous and 16 oral patients per Child-Pugh class), the least square mean \nsystemic exposure (AUC) increased 64% in the Child-Pugh Class A group, and 84% in the Child-Pugh \nClass B group, relative to 32 age- and weight-matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. \nMean plasma concentrations (Cmax) were 2% lower in the Child-Pugh Class A group and 30% lower in \nthe Child-Pugh Class B group. The population pharmacokinetic evaluation of isavuconazole in healthy \nsubjects and patients with mild or moderate hepatic dysfunction demonstrated that the mild and \nmoderate hepatic impairment populations had 40% and 48% lower isavuconazole clearance (CL) \nvalues, respectively, than the healthy population. \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. \n\nIsavuconazole has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). \nUse in these patients is not recommended unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the \nrisks (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn rats and rabbits, isavuconazole at systemic exposures below the therapeutic level were associated \nwith dose-related increases in the incidence of skeletal anomalies (rudimentary supernumerary ribs) in \noffspring. In rats, a dose-related increase in the incidence of zygomatic arch fusion was also noted in \noffspring (see section 4.6).\n\nAdministration of isavuconazonium sulfate to rats at a dose of 90 mg/kg/day (2.3-fold the human \nmaintenance dose [200 mg] based on mg/m2/day) during pregnancy through the weaning period \nshowed an increased perinatal mortality of the pups. In utero exposure to the active moiety \nisavuconazole had no effect on the fertility of the surviving pups.\n\nIntravenous administration of 14C-labelled isavuconazonium sulfate to lactating rats resulted in the \nrecovery of radiolabel in the milk. \n\nIsavuconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated with oral doses up to \n90 mg/kg/day (2.3-fold the clinical maintenance dose based on mg/m2/day comparisons).\n\nIsavuconazole has no discernible mutagenic or genotoxic potential. Isavuconazole was negative in a \nbacterial reverse mutation assay, was weakly clastogenic at cytotoxic concentrations in the \nL5178Y tk+/- mouse lymphoma chromosome aberration assay, and showed no biologically relevant or \nstatistically significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei in an in vivo rat micronucleus test. \n\nNo carcinogenicity studies have been performed.  \n\nIsavuconazole inhibited the hERG potassium channel and the L-type calcium channel with an IC50 of \n5.82 \u00b5M and 6.57 \u00b5M respectively (34- and 38-fold the human non-protein bound Cmax at maximum \nrecommended human dose [MRHD], respectively).The in vivo 39-week repeated-dose toxicology \nstudies in monkeys did not show QTcF prolongation at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (2.1-fold the \nrecommended clinical maintenance dose, based on mg/m2/day comparisons). \n\nEnvironmental risk assessment has shown that CRESEMBA may pose a risk for the aquatic \nenvironment.\n\n6.

The vial should be shaken to dissolve the powder completely. The \nreconstituted solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration. \nReconstituted concentrate should be clear and free of visible particulate. It must be further diluted \nprior to administration. \n\nDilution and administration\n\nAfter reconstitution, the entire content of the reconstituted concentrate should be removed from the\nvial and added to an infusion bag containing at least 250 mL of either sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n(0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose solution. The infusion solution contains \napproximately 1.5 mg/mL isavuconazonium sulfate (corresponding to approximately 0.8 mg \nisavuconazole per mL). After the reconstituted concentrate is further diluted, the diluted solution may \nshow fine white-to-translucent particulates of isavuconazole that do not sediment (but will be removed \nby in-line filtration). The diluted solution should be mixed gently, or the bag should be rolled to \nminimise the formation of particulates. Unnecessary vibration or vigorous shaking of the solution \nshould be avoided. The solution for infusion must be administered via an infusion set with an in-line \nfilter (pore size 0.2 \u03bcm to 1.2 \u03bcm) made of polyether sulfone (PES). \n\nIsavuconazole should not be infused into the same line or cannula concomitantly with other \nintravenous products. \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability after reconstitution and dilution has been demonstrated for 24 \nhours at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C, or 6 hours at room temperature.\n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \nwould normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C, unless reconstitution and dilution has \ntaken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\nIf possible, the intravenous administration of isavuconazole should be completed within 6 hours after \nreconstitution and dilution at room temperature. If this is not possible, the infusion solution should be \nimmediately refrigerated after dilution, and infusion should be completed within 24 hours. \n\nAn existing intravenous line should be flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \ninjection or 50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose solution.\n\nThis medicinal product is for single use only. Discard partially-used vials.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n58\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient\n\nCresemba 100 mg hard capsules\nisavuconazole\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n\n- Keep this leaflet.

treatment with cresemba may be longer than 6 months if your doctor considers this necessary. the vial will be given as a drip into a vein by your doctor or nurse. if you use more cresemba than you should if you think you have been given too much cresemba, talk to your doctor or nurse straight away. you may have more side effects such as: - headache, feeling dizzy, restless or sleepy, - tingling, reduced sense of touch or sensation in the mouth, - problems being aware of things, hot flushes, anxiety, joint pain, - changes in the way things taste, dry mouth, diarrhoea, vomiting, - feeling your heart beat, faster heart rate, being more sensitive to light. if you forget to use cresemba as you will be given this medicine under close medical supervision, it is unlikely that a dose would be missed. however, tell your doctor or nurse if you think that a dose has been forgotten. if you stop using cresemba 54 cresemba treatment will continue for as long as your doctor tells you.
