NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nIZBA 30 micrograms/mL eye drops, solution \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nOne mL of solution contains 30 micrograms of travoprost. \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect \n\n \n\nOne mL of solution contains 7.5 mg propylene glycol and 2 mg polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor \n\noil 40 (HCO-40) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nEye drops, solution (eye drops). \n\n \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nDecrease of elevated intraocular pressure in adult patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle \n\nglaucoma (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nDecrease of elevated intraocular pressure in paediatric patients aged 3 years to <18 years with ocular \n\nhypertension or paediatric glaucoma (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nUse in adults, including elderly patients \n\nThe dose is one drop of travoprost in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) once daily. Optimal \n\neffect is obtained if the dose is administered in the evening. \n\n \n\nNasolacrimal occlusion or gently closing the eyelid after administration is recommended. This may \n\nreduce the systemic absorption of medicinal products administered via the ocular route and result in a \n\ndecrease in systemic adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nIf more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the medicinal products must be \n\nadministered at least 5 minutes apart. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, treatment should be continued with the next dose as planned. The dose should not \n\nexceed one drop in the affected eye(s) daily. \n\n \n\nWhen substituting another ophthalmic antiglaucoma medicinal product with IZBA, the other \n\nmedicinal product should be discontinued and IZBA should be started the following day. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nHepatic and renal impairment \n\nTravoprost 30 µg/mL has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, \n\ntravoprost 40 µg/mL has been studied in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment and in \n\npatients with mild to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance as low as 14 mL/min). No dosage \n\nadjustment is necessary in these patients (see section 5.2). Therefore, no need for dose adjustment at \n\nthe lower concentration of active ingredient is anticipated. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIZBA can be used in paediatric patients from 3 years to <18 years at the same posology as in adults \n\n(see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of IZBA in children below the age of 3 years have not been established. \n\nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology below the \n\nage of 3 years can be made. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor ocular use. \n\n \n\nFor patients who wear contact lenses, please refer to section 4.4. \n\n \n\nThe patient should remove the protective overwrap immediately prior to initial use. To prevent \n\ncontamination of the dropper tip and solution, care must be taken not to touch the eyelids, surrounding \n\nareas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nEye colour change \n\n \n\nIZBA may gradually change the eye colour by increasing the number of melanosomes (pigment \n\ngranules) in melanocytes. Before treatment is instituted, patients must be informed of the possibility of \n\na permanent change in eye colour. Unilateral treatment can result in permanent heterochromia. The \n\nlong-term effects on the melanocytes and any consequences thereof are currently unknown. The \n\nchange in iris colour occurs slowly and may not be noticeable for months to years. The change in eye \n\ncolour has predominantly been seen in patients with mixed coloured irides, i.e., blue-brown, \n\ngrey-brown, yellow-brown and green-brown; however, it has also been observed in patients with \n\nbrown eyes. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the \n\nperiphery in affected eyes, but the entire iris or parts of it may become more brownish. After \n\ndiscontinuation of therapy, no further increase in brown iris pigment has been observed. \n\n \n\nPeriorbital and eye lid changes \n\n \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, periorbital and/or eyelid skin darkening in association with the use of \n\nIZBA has been reported in 0.2% of patients. \n\n \n\nPeriorbital and lid changes including deepening of the eyelid sulcus have been observed with \n\nprostaglandin analogues. \n\n \n\nIZBA may gradually change eyelashes in the treated eye(s); these changes were observed in about half \n\nof the patients in clinical trials and include: increased length, thickness, pigmentation, and/or number \n\nof lashes. The mechanism of eyelash changes and their long-term consequences are currently \n\nunknown. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThere is no experience of IZBA in inflammatory ocular conditions; nor in neovascular, angle-closure, \n\nnarrow-angle or congenital glaucoma and only limited experience in thyroid eye disease, in \n\nopen-angle glaucoma of pseudophakic patients and in pigmentary or pseudoexfoliative glaucoma. \n\nIZBA should therefore be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation. \n\n \n\nAphakic patients \n\n \n\nMacular oedema has been reported during treatment with prostaglandin F2a analogues. Caution is \n\nrecommended when using IZBA in aphakic patients, pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens \n\ncapsule or anterior chamber lenses, or in patients with known risk factors for cystoid macular oedema. \n\n \n\nIritis/uveitis \n\n \n\nIn patients with known predisposing risk factors for iritis/uveitis, IZBA should be used with caution. \n\n \n\nContact with the skin \n\n \n\nSkin contact with IZBA must be avoided as transdermal absorption of travoprost has been \n\ndemonstrated in rabbits. \n\n \n\nProstaglandins and prostaglandin analogues are biologically active materials that may be absorbed \n\nthrough the skin. Women who are pregnant or attempting to become pregnant should exercise \n\nappropriate precautions to avoid direct exposure to the contents of the bottle. In the unlikely event of \n\ncoming in contact with a substantial portion of the contents of the bottle, thoroughly cleanse the \n\nexposed area immediately. \n\n \n\nContact lenses \n\n \n\nPatients must be instructed to remove contact lenses prior to application of IZBA and wait 15 minutes \n\nafter instillation of the dose before reinsertion. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nIZBA contains propylene glycol which may cause skin irritation. \n\nIZBA contains polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 which may cause skin reactions. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nNo long-term safety data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception \n\n \n\nTravoprost must not be used in women of childbearing age/potential unless adequate contraceptive \n\nmeasures are in place (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nTravoprost has harmful pharmacological effects on pregnancy and/or the foetus/new-born child. \n\nTravoprost should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether travoprost from eye drops is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies \n\nhave shown excretion of travoprost and metabolites in breast milk. The use of travoprost by \n\nbreast-feeding mothers is not recommended. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no data on the effects of travoprost on human fertility. Animal studies showed no effect of \n\ntravoprost on fertility at doses more than 250 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nIZBA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\nTemporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n\nIf blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the vision clears before driving or \n\nusing machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nIn a clinical trial of 3 months duration (N=442) involving IZBA as monotherapy, the most common \n\nadverse reaction observed was hyperaemia of the eye (ocular or conjunctival) reported in \n\napproximately 12% of the patients. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions were assessed to be related with IZBA monotherapy and are \n\nclassified according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to \n\n<1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare \n\n(<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping in Table 1, adverse reactions are presented in \n\ndecreasing order of seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Travoprost 30 µg/mL eye drops, solution \n\n \n\nSystem Organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nEye disorders Very common ocular hyperaemia  \n\nCommon dry eye, eye pruritus, ocular discomfort \n\nUncommon punctate keratitis, anterior chamber \n\ninflammation, blepharitis, eye pain, \n\nphotophobia, visual impairment, vision blurred, \n\nconjunctivitis, eyelid oedema, eyelid margin \n\ncrusting, eye discharge, dark circles under \n\neyes, growth of eyelashes, eyelash thickening \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon pruritus, rash \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions were assessed to be related with travoprost 40 µg/mL eye drops, \n\nsolution (either benzalkonium chloride [BAK] or Polyquad-preserved) and are classified according to \n\nthe following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n\n<1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from \n\nthe available data).

The short-term safety \n\nprofiles in the different paediatric subsets were also similar (see section 5.1). The most frequent \n\nadverse reactions reported in the paediatric population were ocular hyperaemia (16.9%) and growth of \n\neyelashes (6.5%). In a similar 3-month study in adult patients, these events occurred at an incidence of \n\n11.4% and 0%, respectively. \n\n \n\nAdditional adverse reactions reported in paediatric patients in the 3-month paediatric study (n=77) \n\ncompared to a similar trial in adults (n=185) included erythema of eyelid, keratitis, lacrimation \n\nincreased, and photophobia, all reported as single events with an incidence of 1.3% versus 0.0% seen \n\nin adults. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nA topical overdose is not likely to occur or to be associated with toxicity. A topical overdose of \n\ntravoprost may be flushed from the eye(s) with lukewarm water. Treatment of a suspected oral \n\ningestion is symptomatic and supportive. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, antiglaucoma preparations and miotics, ATC code: \n\nS01EE04 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nTravoprost, a prostaglandin F2 analogue, is a highly selective full agonist which has a high affinity for \n\nthe prostaglandin FP receptor, and reduces the intraocular pressure by increasing the outflow of \n\naqueous humour via trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral pathways. Reduction of the intraocular \n\npressure in man starts about 2 hours after administration and maximum effect is reached after \n\n12 hours. Significant lowering of intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods exceeding \n\n24 hours with a single dose. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nIn a clinical trial, patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension treated with IZBA dosed \n\nonce-daily in the evening, demonstrated intraocular pressure lowering equivalent to travoprost \n\n40 µg/mL eye drops, solution at all on-therapy visits and time points (95% CI within ±1.0 mmHg). \n\nThe mean reduction from baseline in IOP ranged from 7.1 to 8.2 mmHg as summarised in Table 3. \n\nThe mean percent reductions in IOP from baseline to each study visit and assessment time point \n\nranged from 28.4% to 30.7%. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nTable 3 IOP change from baseline (mmHg) for IZBA \n\n \n\nVisit   8 AM 10 AM 4 PM \n\nWeek 2 Mean -8.0 -7.3 -7.1 \n\n(N=442) 95% CI (-8.3, -7.7) (-7.6, -7.0) (-7.4, -6.8) \n\nWeek 6 Mean -8.1 -7.4 -7.2 \n\n(N=440*) 95% CI (-8.4, -7.9) (-7.6, -7.1) (-7.5, -6.9) \n\nMonth 3 Mean -8.2 -7.5 -7.1 \n\n(N=432*) 95% CI (-8.6, -7.9) (-7.9, -7.2) (-7.4, -6.8) \n\n*One subject had missing data at 8 AM at Week 6; one had missing data at 4 PM at Month 3. \n\n \n\nAn improved safety profile has been observed for IZBA when compared to the marketed travoprost \n\n40 µg/mL eye drops, solution (benzalkonium chloride preserved or polyquaternium-1 perserved). The \n\nmost common adverse reaction associated with both IZBA and travoprost 40 µg/mL eye drops, \n\nsolution is hyperaemia. Hyperaemia (ocular or conjunctival) was observed in 11.8% of patients \n\n(N=442) exposed to IZBA compared with 14.5% observed for patients exposed to travoprost \n\n40 µg/mL eye drops, solution, benzalkonium chloride preserved. \n\n \n\nSecondary pharmacology \n\n \n\nTravoprost significantly increased optic nerve head blood flow in rabbits following 7 days of topical \n\nocular administration (1.4 micrograms, once-daily). \n\n \n\nTravoprost 40 µg/mL eye drops, solution preserved with polyquaternium-1 induced minimal ocular \n\nsurface toxicity, compared to eye drops preserved with benzalkonium chloride, on cultured human \n\ncorneal cells and following topical ocular administration in rabbits. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nIZBA has not been specifically studied in a clinical trial involving paediatric subjects. However, a \n\nmodelling approach demonstrated that IOP lowering would be expected to be equivalent in paediatric \n\npatients aged 3 years and above using both IZBA and TRAVATAN (travoprost 40 micrograms/mL \n\neye drops, solution). The studies used in the model were two dose response trials, one Phase III study \n\nusing IZBA and a paediatric study using TRAVATAN (travoprost 40 micrograms/mL eye drops, \n\nsolution). \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of TRAVATAN (travoprost 40 micrograms/mL eye drops, solution) in paediatric patients \n\nfrom 2 months to less than 18 years of age was demonstrated in a 12-week, double-masked clinical \n\nstudy of travoprost compared with timolol in 152 patients diagnosed with ocular hypertension or \n\npaediatric glaucoma. Patients received either travoprost 0.004% once daily or timolol 0.5% (or 0.25% \n\nfor subjects younger than 3 years old) twice daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the intraocular \n\npressure (IOP) change from baseline at Week 12 of the study. Mean IOP reductions in the travoprost \n\nand timolol groups were similar (see Table 4). \n\n \n\nIn the age groups 3 to <12 years (n=36) and 12 to <18 years (n=26), mean IOP reduction at Week 12 \n\nin the travoprost group was similar to that in the timolol group. Mean IOP reduction at Week 12 in the \n\n2 months to <3 years of age group was 1.8 mmHg in the travoprost group and 7.3 mmHg in the \n\ntimolol group. IOP reductions for this group were based on only 6 patients in the timolol group and \n\n9 patients in the travoprost group where 4 patients in the travoprost group versus 0 patients in the \n\ntimolol group had no relevant mean IOP reduction at Week 12. No data are available for children less \n\nthan 2 months old. \n\n \n\nThe effect on IOP was seen after the second week of treatment and was consistently maintained \n\nthroughout the 12 week period of study for all age groups. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nTable 4 Comparison of Mean IOP Change from Baseline (mmHg) at Week 12 \n\n \n\n Travoprost Timolol   \n\n N \n\nMean \n\n(SE) N \n\nMean  \n\n(SE) \n\nMean \n\nDifferencea (95% CI) \n\n 53 -6.4  \n\n(1.05) \n\n60 -5.8  \n\n(0.96) \n\n-0.5 (-2.1, 1.0) \n\nSE = Standard Error; CI = Confidence Interval; \naMean difference is travoprost – timolol. Estimates based on least squares means derived from a \n\nstatistical model that accounts for correlated IOP measurements within patient where primary \n\ndiagnosis and baseline IOP stratum are in the model. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nTravoprost is an ester prodrug. It is absorbed through the cornea where the isopropyl ester is \n\nhydrolysed to the active free acid. Studies in rabbits have shown peak concentrations of 20 ng/g of the \n\nfree acid in aqueous humour one to two hours after topical dosing of travoprost 40 µg/mL eye drops, \n\nsolution. Aqueous humour concentrations declined with a half-life of approximately 1.5 hours. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nFollowing topical ocular administration of travoprost 40 µg/mL eye drops, solution to healthy \n\nvolunteers, low systemic exposure to active free acid was demonstrated. Peak active free acid plasma \n\nconcentrations of 25 pg/mL or less were observed between 10 and 30 minutes post-dose. Thereafter, \n\nplasma levels declined rapidly to below the 10 pg/mL assay quantitation limit before 1 hour \n\npost-administration. Due to the low plasma concentrations and rapid elimination following topical \n\ndosing, the elimination half-life of active free acid in man could not be determined. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nMetabolism is the major route of elimination of both travoprost and the active free acid. The systemic \n\nmetabolic pathways parallel those of endogenous prostaglandin F2 which are characterised by \n\nreduction of the double bond in position C13-C14, oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl and -oxidative \n\ncleavages of the upper side chain. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nTravoprost free acid and its metabolites are mainly excreted by the kidneys. Travoprost 40 µg/mL eye \n\ndrops, solution has been studied in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment and in patients \n\nwith mild to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance as low as 14 mL/min). No dosage \n\nadjustment is necessary in these patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nA pharmacokinetic study of TRAVATAN (travoprost 40 micrograms/mL eye drops, solution) in \n\npaediatric patients aged 2 months to <18 years demonstrated low plasma exposure to travoprost free \n\nacid, with concentrations ranging from below the 10 pg/mL assay limit of quantitation (BLQ) to \n\n54.5 pg/mL. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nIn ocular toxicity studies in monkeys, administration of travoprost at a dose of 0.45 microgram, twice \n\na day, was shown to induce increased palpebral fissure. Topical ocular administration of travoprost to \n\nmonkeys at concentrations of up to 0.012% to the right eye, twice daily for one year resulted in no \n\nsystemic toxicity. \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nIncreased palpebral fissure observed in monkeys were not seen in rabbits or in the clinical trials with \n\ntravoprost products and is considered to be species specific. \n\n \n\nReproduction toxicity studies have been undertaken in rat, mice and rabbit by systemic route. Findings \n\nare related to FP receptor agonist activity in uterus with early embryolethality, post-implantation loss, \n\nfoetotoxicity. In pregnant rat, systemic administration of travoprost at doses more than 200 times the \n\nclinical dose during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of malformations. \n\nLow levels of radioactivity were measured in amniotic fluid and foetal tissues of pregnant rats \n\nadministered 3H-travoprost. Reproduction and development studies have demonstrated a potent effect \n\non foetal loss with a high rate observed in rats and mice (180 pg/mL and 30 pg/mL plasma, \n\nrespectively) at exposures 1.2 to 6 times the clinical exposure (up to 25 pg/mL). \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA) \n\n \n\nTravoprost is considered a persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substance. Hence, despite the \n\nvery small amounts of travoprost used by patients in eye drops, a risk to the environment cannot be \n\nexcluded. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nPackage leaflet : Information for the user \n\n \n\nIZBA 30 micrograms/mL eye drops, solution \n\ntravoprost \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\ninformation important for you \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What IZBA is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you use IZBA \n\n3. How to use IZBA \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store IZBA \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What IZBA is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nIZBA contains travoprost, one of a group of medicines called prostaglandin analogues. \n\nIZBA is used to reduce high pressure in the eye in adults, adolescents and children from 3 years \n\nold onward. This pressure can lead to an illness called glaucoma. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use IZBA \n\n \n\nDo not use IZBA: \n\n if you are allergic to travoprost or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor for advice if this applies to you. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\n IZBA may increase the length, thickness, colour and/or number of your eyelashes. Changes in \n\nthe eyelids including unusual hair growth or in the tissues around the eye have also been \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\n IZBA may gradually change the colour of your iris (the coloured part of your eye). This \n\nchange may be permanent. \n\n \n\n If you have had cataract surgery talk to your doctor before you use IZBA. IZBA may increase \n\nthe risk of inflammation of the back of the eye. \n\n \n\n If you have current or previous history of an eye inflammation (iritis and uveitis) talk to your \n\ndoctor before you use IZBA. Eye inflammation is a possible side effect which may be \n\nassociated with the use of prostaglandin analogues such as IZBA. \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n Travoprost may be absorbed through the skin. If any of the medicinal product comes into \n\ncontact with the skin, it should be washed off straight away. This is especially important in \n\nwomen who are pregnant or are attempting to become pregnant. \n\n \n\n If you wear soft contact lenses, do not use the drops with your lenses in. After using the drops \n\nwait 15 minutes before putting your lenses back in. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using IZBA. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n\nUse of IZBA is not recommended to those children under 3 years of age. The safety and efficacy of \n\ntravoprost have not been established in this age group. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and IZBA \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nDo not use IZBA if you are pregnant. The effects of this medicine in pregnant women are not \n\nknown. If you think that you may be pregnant speak with your doctor right away. If you could become \n\npregnant you must use adequate contraception whilst you use IZBA. \n\n \n\nDo not use IZBA if you are breast-feeding. IZBA may get into your milk. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYou may find that your vision is blurred for a time just after you use IZBA. Do not drive or use \n\nmachines until this has worn off. \n\n \n\nIZBA contains hydrogenated castor oil and propylene glycol which may cause skin reactions and \n\nirritation. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use IZBA \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or the doctor treating your child has told you. You \n\nshould check with your doctor, the doctor treating your child or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is \n\n \n\nOne drop in the affected eye or eyes, once a day in the evening. \n\nOnly use IZBA in both eyes if your doctor told you to. Use it for as long as your doctor or the doctor \n\ntreating your child told you to. \n\nIZBA can be used in children from 3 years to <18 years at the same dose as for adults. \n\n \n\nIZBA should only be used as an eye drop. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 1 2 3 4 \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n Immediately before using a bottle for the first time, tear open the overwrap pouch, take the \n\nbottle out (picture 1) and write the date of opening on the carton in the space provided. \n\n Wash your hands. \n\n Twist off the cap. \n\n Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers. \n\n Tilt your head or your child’s head gently back. Pull down the eyelid with a clean finger, until \n\nthere is a ‘pocket’ between the eyelid and the eye. The drop will go in here (picture 2). \n\n Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Use a mirror if it helps. \n\n Do not touch the eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It \n\ncould infect the drops. \n\n Gently squeeze the bottle to release one drop of IZBA at a time. (picture 3). \n\n After using IZBA, keep the eyelid closed, apply gentle pressure by pressing a finger into the \n\ncorner of the eye, by the nose (picture 4) for at least 1 minute. This helps to stop IZBA getting \n\ninto the rest of the body. \n\n If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for the other eye. \n\n Close the bottle cap firmly immediately after use. \n\n Only use one bottle at a time. Do not open the pouch until you need to use the bottle. \n\n \n\nIf a drop misses your eye, try again. \n\n \n\nIf you or your child are using other eye preparations such as eye drop or eye ointment, wait for at \n\nleast 5 minutes between putting in IZBA and the other eye preparations. \n\n \n\nIf you or your child use more IZBA than you should \n\nRinse all the medicine out with warm water. Don’t put in any more drops until it’s time for your next \n\nregular dose. If IZBA is swallowed, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use IZBA \n\nContinue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\nNever use more than one drop in the affected eye(s) in a single day. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using IZBA \n\nDo not stop using IZBA without first speaking to your doctor or the doctor treating your child, the \n\npressure in your eye or your child’s eye will not be controlled which could lead to loss of sight. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, the doctor treating your \n\nchild or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.
