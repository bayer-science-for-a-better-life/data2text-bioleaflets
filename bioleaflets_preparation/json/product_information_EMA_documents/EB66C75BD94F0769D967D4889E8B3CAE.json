CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCELSENTRI, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, is indicated for \ntreatment-experienced adults, adolescents and children of 2 years of age, and older and weighing at \nleast 10 kg infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nBefore taking CELSENTRI it has to be confirmed that only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 is detectable (i.e. \nCXCR4 or dual/mixed tropic virus not detected) using an adequately validated and sensitive \ndetection method on a newly drawn blood sample. The Monogram Trofile assay was used in the \nclinical studies of CELSENTRI (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The viral tropism cannot be safely \npredicted by treatment history and assessment of stored samples. \n \nThere are currently no data regarding the reuse of CELSENTRI in patients that currently have only \nCCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable, but have a history of failure on CELSENTRI (or other CCR5 \nantagonists) with a CXCR4 or dual/mixed tropic virus. There are no data regarding the switch from \na medicinal product of a different antiretroviral class to CELSENTRI in virologically suppressed \npatients. Alternative treatment options should be considered.   \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose of CELSENTRI is 150 mg (with potent CYP3A inhibitor with or without a \npotent CYP3A inducer), 300 mg (without potent CYP3A inhibitors or inducers) or 600 mg twice \ndaily (with potent CYP3A inducer without a potent CYP3A inhibitor) depending on interactions \nwith concomitant antiretroviral therapy and other medicinal products (see section 4.5).  \n \nChildren from 2 years of age and weighing at least 10kg \nThe recommended dose of CELSENTRI should be based on body weight (kg) and should not \nexceed the recommended adult dose. If a child is unable to reliably swallow CELSENTRI tablets, \nthe oral solution (20 mg per mL) should be prescribed (refer to Summary of Product Characteristics \nfor CELSENTRI oral solution). \n \nThe recommended dose of CELSENTRI differs depending on interactions with concomitant \nantiretroviral therapy and other medicinal products. Refer to section 4.5 for corresponding adult \ndosage.  \n \nMany medicines have profound effects on maraviroc exposure due to drug-drug interactions. Prior \nto deciding the dose of CELSENTRI by weight, please refer to Table 2 in section 4.5 to carefully \ndetermine the corresponding adult dose. The corresponding paediatric dose can then be obtained \nfrom Table 1 below. If uncertainty still exists, contact a pharmacist for advice. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n\nTable 1 Recommended dosing regimen in children aged 2 years and above and weighing at \nleast 10 kg \n \n\nAdult \ndosage* \n\nConcomitant \nMedications \n\nDose of CELSENTRI in children based on weight \n\n10 to \nless than 20 kg \n\n20 to \nless than \n\n30 kg \n\n30 to \nless than  \n\n40 kg \n\nat least \n40 kg \n\n150 mg twice \ndaily \n\nCELSENTRI \nwith products \nthat are potent \nCYP3A \ninhibitors (with \nor without a \nCYP3A inducer) \n\n50 mg \ntwice daily \n\n75 mg \ntwice daily \n\n100 mg \ntwice daily \n\n150 mg \ntwice daily \n\n300 mg twice \ndaily \n\nCELSENTRI \nwith products \nthat are not \npotent CYP3A \ninhibitors or \npotent CYP3A \ninducers \n\n \n Data to support these doses are \n\nlacking. \n\n300 mg \ntwice daily \n\n300 mg \ntwice daily \n\n600 mg twice \ndaily \n\nCELSENTRI \nwith products \nthat are CYP3A \ninducers (without \na potent CYP3A \ninhibitor) \n\nData to support these doses are lacking and CELSENTRI is not \nrecommended in children taking concomitant interacting \nmedicinal products that in adults would require a 600 mg twice \ndaily dose. \n\n \n\n* Based on drug-drug Interactions (refer to section 4.5) \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \nThere is limited experience in patients >65 years of age (see section 5.2), therefore CELSENTRI \nshould be used with caution in this population. \n \nRenal impairment  \nIn adult patients with a creatinine clearance of <80 mL/min, who are also receiving potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitors, the dose interval of maraviroc should be adjusted to 150 mg once daily (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.5).   \n \nExamples of agents/regimens with such potent CYP3A4-inhibiting activity are: \n \n\n• ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (with the exception of tipranavir/ritonavir),  \n• cobicistat,  \n• itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin and telithromycin, \n• telaprevir and boceprevir. \n\n \nCELSENTRI should be used with caution in adult patients with severe renal impairment  \n(CLcr <30 mL/min) who are receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nThere are no data available to recommend a specific dose in paediatric patients with renal \nimpairment. Therefore, CELSENTRI should be used with caution in this population. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n5 \n \n\nHepatic impairment  \nLimited data are available in adult patients with hepatic impairment and no data are available to \nrecommend a specific dose for paediatric patients.  Therefore, CELSENTRI should be used with \ncaution in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric patients (children younger than 2 years of age or weighing less than 10 kg) \nThe safety and efficacy of CELSENTRI in children younger than 2 years of age or weighing less \nthan 10 kg has not been established (see section 5.2). No data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nCELSENTRI can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to peanut or soya or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially \nreduce the risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nHepatic disease  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of maraviroc have not been specifically studied in patients with significant \nunderlying liver disorders.  \n \nCases of hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure with allergic features have been reported in association \nwith maraviroc. In addition, an increase in hepatic adverse reactions with maraviroc was observed \nduring studies of treatment-experienced subjects with HIV infection, although there was no overall \nincrease in ACTG Grade 3/4 liver function test abnormalities (see section 4.8). Hepatobiliary \ndisorders reported in treatment-naïve patients were uncommon and balanced between treatment \ngroups (see section 4.8). Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active \nhepatitis, can have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination \nantiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice. \n \nDiscontinuation of maraviroc should be strongly considered in any patient with signs or symptoms \nof acute hepatitis, in particular if drug-related hypersensitivity is suspected or with increased liver \ntransaminases combined with rash or other systemic symptoms of potential hypersensitivity (e.g. \npruritic rash, eosinophilia or elevated IgE). \n \nThere are limited data in patients with hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection (see section 5.1). \nCaution should be exercised when treating these patients. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy \nfor hepatitis B and/or C, please refer to the relevant product information for these medicinal \nproducts. \n \nThere is limited experience in patients with reduced hepatic function, therefore maraviroc should \nbe used with caution in this population (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n6 \n \n\nSevere skin and hypersensitivity reactions \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including severe and potentially life threatening events have been \nreported in patients taking maraviroc, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products \nassociated with these reactions. These reactions included rash, fever, and sometimes organ \ndysfunction and hepatic failure. Discontinue maraviroc and other suspect agents immediately if \nsigns or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop. Clinical status and relevant \nblood chemistry should be monitored and appropriate symptomatic therapy initiated. \n \nCardiovascular safety \n \nLimited data exist with the use of maraviroc in patients with severe cardiovascular disease, \ntherefore special caution should be exercised when treating these patients with maraviroc. In the \npivotal studies of treatment-experienced patients coronary heart disease events were more common \nin patients treated with maraviroc than with placebo (11 during 609 PY vs 0 during 111 PY of \nfollow-up). In treatment-naïve patients such events occurred at a similarly low rate with maraviroc \nand control (efavirenz). \n \nPostural hypotension \n \nWhen maraviroc was administered in studies with healthy volunteers at doses higher than the \nrecommended dose, cases of symptomatic postural hypotension were seen at a greater frequency \nthan with placebo.   Caution should be used when administering maraviroc in patients on \nconcomitant medicinal products known to lower blood pressure.  Maraviroc should also be used \nwith caution in patients with severe renal insufficiency and in patients who have risk factors for, or \nhave a history of postural hypotension.  Patients with cardiovascular co-morbidities could be at \nincreased risk of cardiovascular adverse reactions triggered by postural hypotension. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nAn increased risk of postural hypotension may occur in patients with severe renal insufficiency \nwho are treated with potent CYP3A inhibitors or boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) and maraviroc. \nThis risk is due to potential increases in maraviroc maximum concentrations when maraviroc is \nco-administered with potent CYP3A inhibitors or boosted PIs in these patients.  \n \nImmune reconstitution syndrome \n \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any \ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment initiated when necessary. Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in \nthe setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these \nevents can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nTropism \n \n \nMaraviroc should only be used when only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 is detectable (i.e. CXCR4 or \ndual/mixed tropic virus not detected) as determined by an adequately validated and sensitive \ndetection method (see sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1). The Monogram Trofile assay was used in the \nclinical studies of maraviroc. The viral tropism cannot be predicted by treatment history or \nassessment of stored samples.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n7 \n \n\n \nChanges in viral tropism occur over time in HIV-1 infected patients. Therefore there is a need to \nstart therapy shortly after a tropism test. \n \nBackground resistance to other classes of antiretrovirals have been shown to be similar in previously \nundetected CXCR4-tropic virus of the minor viral population, as that found in CCR5-tropic virus. \n \nMaraviroc is not recommended to be used in treatment-naïve patients based on the results of a \nclinical study in this population (see section 5.1). \n \nDose adjustment \n \nPhysicians should ensure that appropriate dose adjustment of maraviroc is made when maraviroc is \nco-administered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or inducers since maraviroc concentrations \nand its therapeutic effects may be affected (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). Please also refer to the \nrespective Summary of Product Characteristics of the other antiretroviral medicinal products used \nin the combination.  \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have \nbeen reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to \ncombination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if \nthey experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nPotential effect on immunity \n \nCCR5 antagonists could potentially impair the immune response to certain infections. This should \nbe taken into consideration when treating infections such as active tuberculosis and invasive fungal \ninfections. The incidence of AIDS-defining infections was similar between maraviroc and placebo \narms in the pivotal studies.  \n \nSoya lecithin \n \nCELSENTRI contains soya lecithin.  \nIf a patient is hypersensitive to peanut or soya, CELSENTRI should not be used. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMaraviroc is metabolised by cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Co-administration of \nmaraviroc with medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 may decrease maraviroc concentrations \nand reduce its therapeutic effects. Co-administration of maraviroc with medicinal products that \ninhibit CYP3A4 may increase maraviroc plasma concentrations. Dose adjustment of maraviroc is \nrecommended when maraviroc is co-administered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or inducers. \nFurther details for concomitantly administered medicinal products are provided below (see Table \n2).  \n \nMaraviroc is a substrate for the transporters P-glycoprotein and OATP1B1, but the effect of these \ntransporters on the exposure to maraviroc is not known. \n \nBased on the in vitro and clinical data, the potential for maraviroc to affect the pharmacokinetics of \nco-administered medicinal products is low.  In vitro studies have shown that maraviroc does not \ninhibit OATP1B1, MRP2 or any of the major P450 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations \n(CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4). Maraviroc had no \nclinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, the oral contraceptives \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n8 \n \n\nethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, or urinary 6β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio, suggesting no \ninhibition or induction of CYP3A4 in vivo. At higher exposure of maraviroc a potential inhibition \nof CYP2D6 cannot be excluded.  \n \nRenal clearance accounts for approximately 23% of total clearance of maraviroc when maraviroc is \nadministered without CYP3A4 inhibitors. In vitro studies have shown that maraviroc does not \ninhibit any of the major renal uptake transporters at clinically relevant concentrations (OAT1, \nOAT3, OCT2, OCTN1, and OCTN2). Additionally, co-administration of maraviroc with tenofovir \n(substrate for renal elimination) and cotrimoxazole (contains trimethoprim, a renal cation transport \ninhibitor), showed no effect on the pharmacokinetics of maraviroc. In addition, co-administration \nof maraviroc with lamivudine/zidovudine showed no effect of maraviroc on lamivudine (primarily \nrenally cleared) or zidovudine (non-P450 metabolism and renal clearance) pharmacokinetics.  \nMaraviroc inhibits P-glycoprotein in vitro (IC50 is 183 μM). However, maraviroc does not \nsignificantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in vivo.  It may not be excluded that maraviroc \ncan increase the exposure to the P-glycoprotein substrate dabigatran etexilate. \n \nTable 2: Interactions and adulta dose recommendations with other medicinal products \n \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas \n(dose of CELSENTRI \nused in study) \n\nEffects on active substance levels \nGeometric mean change if not \nstated otherwise \n\nRecommendations \nconcerning co-\nadministration in adults \n\nANTI-INFECTIVES   \nAntiretrovirals   \nPharmacokinetic Enhancers \nCobicistat Interaction not studied. \n\n \nCobicistat is a potent CYP3A \ninhibitor. \n\nCELSENTRI dose should \nbe decreased to 150 mg \ntwice daily when co-\nadministered with \ncobicistat containing \nregimen. \n\nNucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) \nLamivudine 150 mg BID \n(maraviroc 300 mg BID) \n\nLamivudine AUC12: ↔ 1.13  \nLamivudine Cmax: ↔ 1.16  \nMaraviroc concentrations not \nmeasured, no effect is expected. \n\nNo significant interaction \nseen/expected. \nCELSENTRI 300 mg \ntwice daily and NRTIs can \nbe co-administered \nwithout dose adjustment. \n\nTenofovir 300 mg QD \n(maraviroc 300 mg BID) \n\nMaraviroc AUC12: ↔ 1.03  \nMaraviroc Cmax: ↔ 1.03  \nTenofovir concentrations not \nmeasured, no effect is expected. \n\nZidovudine 300 mg BID \n(maraviroc 300 mg BID) \n\nZidovudine AUC12: ↔ 0.98  \nZidovudine Cmax: ↔ 0.92  \nMaraviroc concentrations not \nmeasured, no effect is expected. \n\nIntegrase Inhibitors   \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n9 \n \n\nElvitegravir/ritonavir \n150/100mg QD \n(maraviroc 150 mg BID) \n\nMaraviroc AUC12: ↑ 2.86 (2.33-3.51) \nMaraviroc Cmax: ↑ 2.15 (1.71-2.69) \nMaraviroc C12: ↑ 4.23 (3.47-5.16) \n \nElvitegravir AUC24: ↔ 1.07 \n(0.96-1.18) \nElvitegravir Cmax: ↔ 1.01 \n(0.89-1.15) \nElvitegravir C24: ↔ 1.09 (0.95-1.26) \n \n\nElvitegravir as a single \nagent is indicated only in \ncombination with certain \nritonavir boosted PIs.  \n \nElvitegravir per se is not \nexpected to affect \nmaraviroc exposure to a \nclinically relevant degree \nand the observed effect is \nattributed to ritonavir.  \n \nThus, CELSENTRI dose \nshould be modified in line \nwith the recommendation \nfor co-administration with \nrespective PI/ritonavir \ncombination (see \n‘Protease Inhibitors’). \n\nRaltegravir 400 mg BID \n(maraviroc 300 mg BID) \n\nMaraviroc AUC12: ↓ 0.86 \nMaraviroc Cmax: ↓ 0.79 \n \nRaltegravir AUC12: ↓ 0.63  \nRaltegravir Cmax: ↓ 0.67  \nRaltegravir C12: ↓ 0.72 \n \n\nNo clinically significant \ninteraction seen. \nCELSENTRI 300 mg \ntwice daily and raltegravir \ncan be co-administered \nwithout dose adjustment. \n\nNon-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) \nEfavirenz 600 mg QD \n(maraviroc 100 mg BID) \n\nMaraviroc AUC12: ↓ 0.55  \nMaraviroc Cmax: ↓ 0.49 \nEfavirenz concentrations not \nmeasured, no effect is expected. \n\nCELSENTRI dose should \nbe increased to 600 mg \ntwice daily when \nco-administered with \nefavirenz in the absence of \na potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitor.

The effect of maraviroc on \nhuman pregnancy is unknown. Studies in animals showed reproductive toxicity at high exposures. \nPrimary pharmacological activity (CCR5 receptor affinity) was limited in the species studied (see \nsection 5.3). Maraviroc should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit justifies the \npotential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether maraviroc is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological data in \nanimals has shown extensive excretion of maraviroc in milk. Primary pharmacological activity \n(CCR5 receptor affinity) was limited in the species studied (see section 5.3). A risk to the \nnewborn/infants cannot be excluded. \n \nIt is recommended that mothers infected by HIV do not breast-feed their infants under any \ncircumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \nFertility \n \nThere is no data on the effects of maraviroc on human fertility. In rats, there were no adverse \neffects on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n15 \n \n\nMaraviroc may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \ninformed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with maraviroc. The clinical status of \nthe patient and the adverse reaction profile of maraviroc should be borne in mind when considering \nthe patient's ability to drive, cycle or operate machinery.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdults \nAssessment of treatment related adverse reactions is based on pooled data from two Phase 2b/3 \nstudies in treatment-experienced adult patients (MOTIVATE 1 and MOTIVATE 2) and one study \nin treatment-naïve adult patients (MERIT) infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1).  \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in the Phase 2b/3 studies were nausea, \ndiarrhoea, fatigue and headache. These adverse reactions were common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency. Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \nFrequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(≥1/1000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) , not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data).

The incidence of these selected endpoints for subjects on maraviroc in \nthis observational phase was consistent with the incidence seen at earlier timepoints in the studies. \n \nIn treatment-naïve patients, the incidence of grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities using ACTG \ncriteria was similar among the maraviroc and efavirenz treatment groups. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe adverse reaction profile in paediatric patients is based on 48 Week safety data from study \nA4001031 in which 103 HIV-1 infected, treatment-experienced patients aged 2 to <18 years \nreceived maraviroc twice-daily with optimised background therapy (OBT). Overall, the safety \nprofile in paediatric patients was similar to that observed in adult clinical studies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nThe highest dose administered in clinical studies was 1,200 mg. The dose limiting adverse reaction \nwas postural hypotension.  \n \nProlongation of the QT interval was seen in dogs and monkeys at plasma concentrations 6 and 12 \ntimes, respectively, those expected in humans at the maximum recommended dose of 300 mg twice \ndaily. However, no clinically significant QT prolongation compared to placebo + OBT was seen in \nthe Phase 3 clinical studies using the recommended dose of maraviroc or in a specific \npharmacokinetic study to evaluate the potential of maraviroc to prolong the QT interval.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n \n \n\n18 \n \n\nManagement \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with maraviroc. Treatment of overdose should consist of \ngeneral supportive measures including keeping the patient in a supine position, careful assessment \nof patient vital signs, blood pressure and ECG. \n \nIf indicated, elimination of unabsorbed active maraviroc should be achieved by emesis or gastric \nlavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal of unabsorbed \nactive substance. Since maraviroc is moderately protein bound, dialysis may be beneficial in \nremoval of this medicine. Further management should be as recommended by the national poisons \ncentre, where available. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, other antivirals, ATC code: J05AX09 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nMaraviroc is a member of a therapeutic class called CCR5 antagonists. Maraviroc selectively binds \nto the human chemokine receptor CCR5, preventing CCR5-tropic HIV-1 from entering cells. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nMaraviroc has no antiviral activity in vitro against viruses which can use CXCR4 as their entry co-\nreceptor (dual-tropic or CXCR4-tropic viruses, collectively termed ‘CXCR4-using’ virus below). \nThe serum adjusted EC90 value in 43 primary HIV-1 clinical isolates was 0.57 (0.06 – 10.7) ng/mL \nwithout significant changes between different subtypes tested. The antiviral activity of maraviroc \nagainst HIV-2 has not been evaluated. For details please refer to the pharmacology section of the \nCELSENTRI European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the European Medicines Agency \n(EMA) website.  \n \nWhen used with other antiretroviral medicinal products in cell culture, the combination of \nmaraviroc was not antagonistic with a range of NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs or the HIV fusion inhibitor \nenfuvirtide.  \n \nVirologic Escape \n \nVirologic escape from maraviroc can occur via 2 routes: the emergence of pre-existing virus which \ncan use CXCR4 as its entry co-receptor (CXCR4-using virus) or the selection of virus that \ncontinues to use exclusively drug-bound CCR5 (CCR5-tropic virus).  \n \nIn vitro \n \nHIV-1 variants with reduced susceptibility to maraviroc have been selected in vitro, following \nserial passage of two CCR5-tropic viruses (0 laboratory strains, 2 clinical isolates). The maraviroc-\nresistant viruses remained CCR5-tropic and there was no conversion from a CCR5-tropic virus to a \nCXCR4-using virus.  \n \nPhenotypic resistance \n \nConcentration response curves for the maraviroc-resistant viruses were characterized \nphenotypically by curves that did not reach 100% inhibition in assays using serial dilutions of \nmaraviroc (<100% maximal percentage inhibition (MPI)). Traditional IC50/IC90 fold-change was \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n19 \n \n\nnot a useful parameter to measure phenotypic resistance, as those values were sometimes \nunchanged despite significantly reduced sensitivity. \n \nGenotypic resistance  \n \nMutations were found to accumulate in the gp120 envelope glycoprotein (the viral protein that \nbinds to the CCR5 co-receptor). The position of these mutations was not consistent between \ndifferent isolates. Hence, the relevance of these mutations to maraviroc susceptibility in other \nviruses is not known. \n \nCross-resistance in vitro  \n \nHIV-1 clinical isolates resistant to NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs and enfuvirtide were all susceptible to \nmaraviroc in cell culture. Maraviroc-resistant viruses that emerged in vitro remained sensitive to \nthe fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide and the PI, saquinavir. \n \nIn vivo \nTreatment-Experienced Adult Patients \n \nIn the pivotal studies (MOTIVATE 1 and MOTIVATE 2), 7.6% of patients had a change in \ntropism result from CCR5-tropic to CXCR4-tropic or dual/mixed-tropic between screening and \nbaseline (a period of 4-6 weeks).  \n \nFailure with CXCR4-using virus \n \nCXCR4-using virus was detected at failure in approximately 60% of subjects who failed treatment \non maraviroc, as compared to 6% of subjects who experienced treatment failure in the placebo + \nOBT arm. To investigate the likely origin of the on-treatment CXCR4-using virus, a detailed clonal \nanalysis was conducted on virus from 20 representative subjects (16 subjects from the maraviroc \narms and 4 subjects from the placebo + OBT arm) in whom CXCR4-using virus was detected at \ntreatment failure. This analysis indicated that CXCR4-using virus emerged from a pre-existing \nCXCR4-using reservoir not detected at baseline, rather than from mutation of CCR5-tropic virus \npresent at baseline. An analysis of tropism following failure of maraviroc therapy with CXCR4-\nusing virus in patients with CCR5 virus at baseline, demonstrated that the virus population reverted \nback to CCR5 tropism in 33 of 36 patients with more than 35 days of follow-up.  \n \nAt the time of failure with CXCR4-using virus, the resistance pattern to other antiretrovirals \nappears similar to that of the CCR5-tropic population at baseline, based on available data. Hence, \nin the selection of a treatment regimen, it should be assumed that viruses forming part of the \npreviously undetected CXCR4 -using population (i.e. minor viral population) harbours the same \nresistance pattern as the CCR5-tropic population.  \n \nFailure with CCR5-tropic virus \n \nPhenotypic resistance  \n \nIn patients with CCR5-tropic virus at time of treatment failure with maraviroc, 22 out of 58 \npatients had virus with reduced sensitivity to maraviroc. In the remaining 36 patients, there was no \nevidence of virus with reduced sensitivity as identified by exploratory virology analyses on a \nrepresentative group. The latter group had markers correlating to low compliance (low and variable \ndrug levels and often a calculated high residual sensitivity score of the OBT). In patients failing \ntherapy with CCR5-tropic virus only, maraviroc might be considered still active if the MPI value is \n≥95% (PhenoSense Entry assay). Residual activity in vivo for viruses with MPI-values <95% has \nnot been determined. \n \nGenotypic resistance \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n20 \n \n\nA relatively small number of individuals receiving maraviroc-containing therapy have failed with \nphenotypic resistance (i.e. the ability to use drug-bound CCR5 with MPI <95%).   To date, no \nsignature mutation(s) have been identified.  The gp120 amino acid substitutions identified so far \nare context dependent and inherently unpredictable with regards to maraviroc susceptibility.   \nTreatment-Experienced Paediatric Patients  \n \nIn the Week 48 analysis (N=103), non-CCR5 tropic-virus was detected in 5/23 (22%) subjects at \nvirologic failure. One additional subject had CCR5 tropic-virus with reduced susceptibility to \nmaraviroc at virologic failure, although this was not retained at the end of treatment.  Subjects with \nvirologic failure generally appeared to have low compliance to both maraviroc and the background \nantiretroviral elements of their regimens. Overall, the mechanisms of resistance to maraviroc \nobserved in this treatment-experienced paediatric population were similar to those observed in \nadult populations. \n \nClinical results \n \nStudies in Treatment-Experienced Adult Patients Infected with CCR5-tropic Virus \n \nThe clinical efficacy of maraviroc (in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products) on \nplasma HIV RNA levels and CD4+ cell counts have been investigated in two pivotal randomized, \ndouble blind, multicentre studies (MOTIVATE 1 and MOTIVATE 2, n=1076) in patients infected \nwith CCR5 tropic HIV-1 as determined by the Monogram Trofile Assay. \n \nPatients who were eligible for these studies had prior exposure to at least 3 antiretroviral medicinal \nproduct classes [≥1 NRTIs, ≥1 NNRTIs, ≥2 PIs, and/or enfurvirtide] or documented resistance to at \nleast one member of each class. Patients were randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio to maraviroc 300 mg \n(dose equivalence) once daily, twice daily or placebo in combination with an optimized \nbackground consisting of 3 to 6 antiretroviral medicinal products (excluding low-dose ritonavir). \nThe OBT was selected on the basis of the subject’s prior treatment history and baseline genotypic \nand phenotypic viral resistance measurements.  \n \nTable 5: Demographic and baseline characteristics of patients (pooled studies MOTIVATE 1 \nand MOTIVATE 2) \n \n\n \nDemographic and Baseline Characteristics \n\nMaraviroc 300 mg \ntwice daily \n\n+ OBT \n \n\nN = 426 \n\nPlacebo + OBT  \n \n \n\nN = 209 \n\nAge (years) \n(Range, years) \n\n46.3 \n21-73 \n\n45.7 \n29-72 \n\nMale Sex 89.7% 88.5% \nRace (White/Black/Other) 85.2% / 12% / 2.8% 85.2% / 12.4% / 2.4% \nMean Baseline HIV-1 RNA (log10 copies/mL) 4.85 4.86 \nMedian Baseline CD4+ Cell Count (cells/mm3)  \n(range, cells/mm3) \n\n166.8 \n(2.0-820.0) \n\n171.3 \n(1.0-675.0) \n\nScreening Viral Load >100,000 copies/mL 179 (42.0%) 84 (40.2%) \nBaseline CD4+ Cell Count ≤200 cells/mm3 250 (58.7%) 118 (56.5%) \nNumber (Percentage) of patients with GSS score1: \n 0 \n 1 \n 2 \n ≥3 \n\n \n102 (23.9%) \n138 (32.4%) \n80 (18.8%) \n\n104 (24.4%) \n\n \n51 (24.4%) \n53 (25.4%) \n41 (19.6%) \n59 (28.2%) \n\n1Based on GeneSeq resistance assay.  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n21 \n \n\nLimited numbers of patients from ethnicities other than Caucasian were included in the pivotal \nclinical studies, therefore very limited data are available in these patient populations. \n \nThe mean increase in CD4+ cell count from baseline in patients who failed with a change in \ntropism result to dual/mixed tropic or CXCR4, in the maraviroc 300 mg twice daily + OBT \n(+56 cells/mm3) group was greater than that seen in patients failing placebo + OBT \n(+13.8 cells/mm3) regardless of tropism. \n \nTable 6: Efficacy Outcomes at week 48 (pooled studies MOTIVATE 1 and MOTIVATE 2) \n \n\nOutcomes Maraviroc 300 mg \ntwice daily \n\n+ OBT \n   N=426 \n\nPlacebo + \nOBT  \n\n \nN=209 \n\nDifference1 \n (Confidence \n\nInterval2) \n\nHIV-1 RNA \nMean change from baseline \n(log copies/mL) \n\n \n-1.837 \n\n \n\n \n-0.785 \n\n \n-1.055 \n\n(-1.327, -0.783) \nPercentage of patients with \nHIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL \n\n56.1% \n \n\n22.5% Odds ratio: 4.76 \n(3.24, 7.00) \n\nPercentage of patients with \nHIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL \n\n45.5% \n \n\n16.7% Odds ratio: 4.49 \n(2.96, 6.83) \n\nCD4+ cell count \nMean change from baseline \n(cells/µL) \n\n \n122.78 \n\n \n\n \n59.17 \n\n \n\n \n63.13 \n\n(44.28, 81.99)2 \n1 p-values < 0.0001 \n2 For all efficacy endpoints the confidence intervals were 95%, except for HIV-1 RNA Change \nfrom baseline, which was 97.5% \n \nIn a retrospective analysis of the MOTIVATE studies with a more sensitive assay for screening of \ntropism (Trofile ES), the response rates (<50 copies/mL at week 48) in patients with only CCR5-\ntropic virus detected at baseline was 48.2% in those treated with maraviroc + OBT (n=328), and \n16.3% in those treated with placebo + OBT (n=178). \n \nMaraviroc 300 mg twice daily + OBT was superior to placebo + OBT across all subgroups of \npatients analysed (see Table 7).

Use of maraviroc \nwas not associated with a significant decrease in HIV 1 RNA compared with placebo in these \nsubjects and no adverse effect on CD4+ cell count was noted.   \n \nStudies in Treatment-Naïve Adult Patients Infected with CCR5-tropic Virus \n \nA randomised, double-blinded study (MERIT), explored maraviroc versus efavirenz, both in \ncombination with zidovudine/lamivudine (n=721, 1:1). After 48 weeks of treatment, maraviroc did \nnot reach non-inferiority to efavirenz for the endpoint of HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (65.3 vs. \n69.3 % respectively, lower confidence bound -11.9%). More patients treated with maraviroc \ndiscontinued due to lack of efficacy (43 vs.15) and among patients with lack of efficacy, the \nproportion acquiring NRTI resistance (mainly lamivudine) was higher in the maraviroc arm. Fewer \npatients discontinued maraviroc due to adverse events (15 vs. 49). \n \nStudies in Adult Patients Co-infected with Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C virus  \n \nThe hepatic safety of maraviroc in combination with other antiretroviral agents in CCR5-tropic \nHIV-1-infected subjects with HIV RNA <50 copies/mL, co-infected with Hepatitis C and/or \nHepatitis B Virus was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled \nstudy. 70 subjects (Child-Pugh Class A, n=64; Child-Pugh Class B, n=6) were randomized to the \nmaraviroc group and 67 subjects (Child-Pugh Class A, n=59; Child-Pugh Class B, n=8) were \nrandomized to the placebo group.  \n \nThe primary objective assessed the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 ALT abnormalities (>5x upper limit \nof normal (ULN) if baseline ALT ≤ ULN; or >3.5x baseline if baseline ALT > ULN) at Week 48. \nOne subject in each treatment arm met the primary endpoint by Week 48 (at Week 8 for placebo \nand Week 36 for the maraviroc arm).   \n \nStudies in Treatment-Experienced Paediatric Patients Infected with CCR5-tropic Virus \n \nStudy A4001031 is an open-label, multicenter trial in paediatric patients (aged 2 years to less than \n18 years) infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1, determined by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay.  \nSubjects were required to have HIV-1 RNA greater than 1,000 copies per mL at Screening.  \n \nAll subjects (n = 103) received maraviroc twice daily and OBT.  Maraviroc dosing was based on \nbody surface area and doses were adjusted based on whether the subject was receiving potent \nCYP3A inhibitors and/or inducers.  \n \nIn paediatric patients with a successful tropism test, dual mixed/CXCR4-tropic virus was detected \nin around 40% of screening samples (8/27, 30% in 2-6 year-olds, 31/81, 38% in 6-12 year-olds and \n41/90, 46% in 12-18 year-olds), underscoring the importance of tropism testing also in the \npaediatric population. \n \n\nThe population was 52% female and 69% black, with mean age of 10 years (range: 2 years to \n17 years). At baseline, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.3 log10 copies/mL (range 2.4 to 6.2 log10 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n23 \n \n\ncopies per mL), mean CD4+ cell count was 551 cells/mm3 (range 1 to 1654 cells/mm3) and mean \nCD4+ % was 21% (range 0% to 42%).  \n \nAt 48 weeks, using a missing, switch or discontinuation equals failure analysis, 48% of subjects \ntreated with maraviroc and OBT achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 48 copies/mL and 65% of \nsubjects achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies per mL. The mean CD4+ cell count \n(percent) increase from baseline to Week 48 was 247 cells/mm3 (5%). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe absorption of maraviroc is variable with multiple peaks. Median peak maraviroc plasma \nconcentrations are attained at 2 hours (range 0.5-4 hours) following single oral doses of 300 mg \ncommercial tablet administered to healthy volunteers. The pharmacokinetics of oral maraviroc are \nnot dose proportional over the dose range. The absolute bioavailability of a 100 mg dose is 23% \nand is predicted to be 33% at 300 mg. Maraviroc is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-\nglycoprotein. \n\n \nCo-administration of a 300 mg tablet with a high fat breakfast reduced maraviroc Cmax and AUC by \n33% and co-administration of 75 mg of oral solution with a high fat breakfast reduced maraviroc \nAUC by 73% in adult healthy volunteers. Studies with the tablets demonstrated a reduced food-\neffect at higher doses.  \n \nThere were no food restrictions in the adult studies (using tablet formulations) or in the paediatric \nstudy (using both tablet and oral solution formulations). The results did not indicate any relevant \nefficacy or safety concern related to either fed or fasted dosing conditions. Therefore, maraviroc \ntablets and oral solution can be taken with or without food at the recommended doses in adults, \nadolescents and children aged 2 years and older and weighing at least 10 kg (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution  \n \nMaraviroc is bound (approximately 76%) to human plasma proteins, and shows moderate affinity \nfor albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution of maraviroc is \napproximately 194 L.  \n \nBiotransformation  \n \nStudies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes and expressed enzymes have \ndemonstrated that maraviroc is principally metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system to \nmetabolites that are essentially inactive against HIV-1. In vitro studies indicate that CYP3A4 is the \nmajor enzyme responsible for maraviroc metabolism. In vitro studies also indicate that \npolymorphic enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 do not contribute significantly to the \nmetabolism of maraviroc.  \n \nMaraviroc is the major circulating component (approximately 42% radioactivity) following a single \noral dose of 300 mg. The most significant circulating metabolite in humans is a secondary amine \n(approximately 22% radioactivity) formed by N-dealkylation. This polar metabolite has no \nsignificant pharmacological activity. Other metabolites are products of mono-oxidation and are \nonly minor components of plasma radioactivity. \n \nElimination \n \nA mass balance/excretion study was conducted using a single 300 mg dose of 14C-labeled \nmaraviroc. Approximately 20% of the radiolabel was recovered in the urine and 76% was \nrecovered in the faeces over 168 hours. Maraviroc was the major component present in urine (mean \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n24 \n \n\nof 8% dose) and faeces (mean of 25% dose). The remainder was excreted as metabolites. After \nintravenous administration (30 mg), the half-life of maraviroc was 13.2 h, 22% of the dose was \nexcreted unchanged in the urine and the values of total clearance and renal clearance were 44.0 L/h \nand 10.17 L/h respectively. \n \nSpecial patient populations: \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIntensive pharmacokinetics of maraviroc were evaluated in 50 treatment-experienced, CCR5-\ntropic, HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years (weight 10.0 to 57.6 kg) in the dose-\nfinding stage of clinical trial A4001031. Doses were given with food on intensive pharmacokinetic \nevaluation days and optimised to achieve an average concentration over the dosing interval (Cavg) \nof greater than 100 ng/mL; otherwise, maraviroc was given with or without food. The initial dose \nof maraviroc was scaled from adult doses using a body surface area (BSA) of 1.73 m2 to children \nand adolescent BSA (m2)-based bands. In addition, dosing was based on whether subjects were \nreceiving potent CYP3A inhibitors (38/50), potent CYP3A inducers (2/50) or other concomitant \nmedicinal products that are not potent CYP3A inhibitors or potent CYP3A inducers (10/50) as part \nof OBT. Sparse pharmacokinetics were evaluated in all subjects including the additional 47 \nsubjects receiving potent CYP3A inhibitors that did not take part in the dose-finding stage. The \nimpact of potent CYP3A inhibitors and/or inducers on maraviroc pharmacokinetic parameters in \npaediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults. \n \nBSA (m2)-based bands have been modified to weight (kg)-based bands to simplify dosing and \nreduce dosing errors (see section 4.2). Use of weight (kg)-based doses in treatment-experienced \nHIV-1-infected children and adolescents results in maraviroc exposures similar to those observed \nin treatment-experienced adults receiving recommended doses with concomitant medications. The \npharmacokinetics of maraviroc in paediatric patients below 2 years of age have not been \nestablished (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly  \n \nPopulation analysis of the Phase 1/2a and Phase 3 studies (16-65 years of age) has been conducted \nand no effect of age have been observed (see section 4.2). \n  \nRenal impairment \n \n A study compared the pharmacokinetics of a single 300 mg dose of maraviroc in subjects with \nsevere renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min, n=6) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) to healthy \nvolunteers (n=6). The geometric mean AUCinf (CV%) for maraviroc was as follows: healthy \nvolunteers (normal renal function) 1348.4 ng·h/mL (61%); severe renal impairment 4367.7 \nng·h/mL (52%); ESRD (dosing after dialysis) 2677.4 ng·h/mL (40%); and ESRD (dosing before \ndialysis) 2805.5 ng·h/mL (45%). The C max (CV%) was 335.6 ng/mL (87%) in healthy volunteers \n(normal renal function); 801.2 ng/mL (56%) in severe renal impairment; 576.7 ng/mL (51%) in \nESRD (dosing after dialysis) and 478.5 ng/mL (38%) in ESRD (dosing before dialysis). Dialysis \nhad a minimal effect on exposure in subjects with ESRD. Exposures observed in subjects with \nsevere renal impairment and ESRD were within the range observed in single maraviroc 300 mg \ndose studies in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Therefore, no dose adjustment is \nnecessary in patients with renal impairment receiving maraviroc without a potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitor (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5).  \n \nIn addition, the study compared the pharmacokinetics of multiple dose maraviroc in combination \nwith saquinavir/ritonavir 1000/100 mg BID (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) for 7 days in subjects with \nmild renal impairment (CLcr >50 and ≤80 mL/min, n=6) and moderate renal impairment (CLcr \n≥30 and ≤50 mL/min, n=6) to healthy volunteers (n=6). Subjects received 150 mg of maraviroc at \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n25 \n \n\ndifferent dose frequencies (healthy volunteers – every 12 hours; mild renal impairment – every 24 \nhours; moderate renal impairment – every 48 hours). The average concentration (Cavg) of \nmaraviroc over 24 hours was 445.1 ng/mL, 338.3 ng/mL, and 223.7 ng/mL for subjects with \nnormal renal function, mild renal impairment, and moderate renal impairment, respectively. The \nCavg of maraviroc from 24-48 hours for subjects with moderate renal impairment was low (Cavg: \n32.8 ng/mL). Therefore, dosing frequencies of longer than 24 hours in subjects with renal \nimpairment may result in inadequate exposures between 24-48 hours.  \n \nDose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment receiving maraviroc with potent \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nMaraviroc is primarily metabolized and eliminated by the liver. A study compared the \npharmacokinetics of a single 300 mg dose of maraviroc in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, \nn=8), and moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, n=8) hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects \n(n=8). Geometric mean ratios for Cmax and AUClast were 11% and 25% higher respectively for \nsubjects with mild hepatic impairment, and 32% and 46% higher respectively for subjects with \nmoderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. The effects of \nmoderate hepatic impairment may be underestimated due to limited data in patients with decreased \nmetabolic capacity and higher renal clearance in these subjects. The results should therefore be \ninterpreted with caution. The pharmacokinetics of maraviroc has not been studied in subjects with \nsevere hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  \n  \nRace  \n \nNo relevant difference between Caucasian, Asian and Black subjects has been observed. The \npharmacokinetics in other races has not been evaluated. \n \nGender  \n \nNo relevant differences in pharmacokinetics have been observed. \n \n \nPharmacogenomics \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of maraviroc is dependent on CYP3A5 activity and expression level, which \ncan be modulated by genetic variation. Subjects with a functional CYP3A5 (CYP3A5*1 allele) \nhave been shown to have a reduced exposure to maraviroc compared to subjects with defect \nCYP3A5 activity (e.g., CYP3A5*3, CYP3A5*6, and CYP3A5*7). The CYP3A5 allelic frequency \ndepends on ethnicity: the majority of Caucasians (~90%) are poor metabolisers of CYP3A5 \nsubstrates (i.e., subjects with no copy of functional CYP3A5 alleles) while approximately 40% of \nAfrican-Americans and 70% of Sub-Saharan Africans are extensive metabolisers (i.e., subjects \nwith two copies of functional CYP3A5 alleles). \n \nIn a Phase 1 study conducted in healthy subjects, Blacks with a CYP3A5 genotype conferring \nextensive maraviroc metabolism (2 CYP3A5*1 alleles; n=12) had a 37% and 26% lower AUC \nwhen dosed with maraviroc 300 mg twice daily compared with Black (n=11) and Caucasian (n=12) \nsubjects with CYP3A5 genotype conferring poor maraviroc metabolism (no CYP3A5*1 allele), \nrespectively. The difference in maraviroc exposure between CYP3A5 extensive and poor \nmetabolisers was reduced when maraviroc was administered together with a strong CYP3A \ninhibitor: extensive CYP3A5 metabolisers (n=12) had a 17% lower maraviroc AUC compared with \npoor CYP3A5 metabolisers (n=11) when dosed with maraviroc 150 mg once daily in the presence \nof darunavir/cobicistat (800/150 mg).  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n26 \n \n\nAll subjects in the Phase 1 study achieved the Cavg concentrations that have been shown to be \nassociated with near maximal virologic efficacy with maraviroc (75 ng/mL) in the Phase 3 study in \ntreatment-naïve adult patients (MERIT).  Therefore, despite differences in CYP3A5 genotype \nprevalence by race, the effect of CYP3A5 genotype on maraviroc exposure is not considered \nclinically significant and no maraviroc dose adjustment according to CYP3A5 genotype, race or \nethnicity is needed.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPrimary pharmacological activity (CCR5 receptor affinity) was present in the monkey (100% \nreceptor occupancy) and limited in the mouse, rat, rabbit and dog. In mice and human beings that \nlack CCR5 receptors through genetic deletion, no significant adverse consequences have been \nreported. \n \nIn vitro and in vivo studies showed that maraviroc has a potential to increase QTc interval at \nsupratherapeutic doses with no evidence of arrhythmia.  \n \nRepeated dose toxicity studies in rats identified the liver as the primary target organ for toxicity \n(increases in transaminases, bile duct hyperplasia, and necrosis). \n \nMaraviroc was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by a 6 month transgenic mouse study and a 24 \nmonth study in rats. In mice, no statistically significant increase in the incidence of tumours was \nreported at systemic exposures from 7 to 39-times the human exposure (unbound AUC 0-24h \nmeasurement) at a dose of 300 mg twice daily. In rats, administration of maraviroc at a systemic \nexposure 21-times the expected human exposure produced thyroid adenomas associated with \nadaptive liver changes. These findings are considered of low human relevance. In addition, \ncholangiocarcinomas (2/60 males at 900 mg/kg) and cholangioma (1/60 females at 500 mg/kg) \nwere reported in the rat study at a systemic exposure at least 15-times the expected free human \nexposure. \n \nMaraviroc was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including \nbacterial reverse mutation, chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes and mouse bone \nmarrow micronucleus.  \n \nMaraviroc did not impair mating or fertility of male or female rats, and did not affect sperm of \ntreated male rats up to 1000 mg/kg. The exposure at this dose level corresponded to 39-fold the \nestimated free clinical AUC for a 300 mg twice daily dose.  \n \nEmbryofoetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits at doses up to 39- and 34-\nfold the estimated free clinical AUC for a 300 mg twice daily dose. In rabbit, 7 foetuses had \nexternal anomalies at maternally toxic doses and 1 foetus at the mid dose of 75 mg/kg. \n \nPre- and post-natal developmental studies were performed in rats at doses up to 27-fold the \nestimated free clinical AUC for a 300 mg twice daily dose. A slight increase in motor activity in \nhigh-dose male rats at both weaning and as adults was noted, while no effects were seen in females. \nOther developmental parameters of these offspring, including fertility and reproductive \nperformance, were not affected by the maternal administration of maraviroc. \n \n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nTablet core \n  \nCellulose, microcrystalline  \nCalcium hydrogen phosphate, anhydrous  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n27 \n \n\nSodium starch glycolate  \nMagnesium stearate \n \nFilm-coat  \n \nPoly (vinyl alcohol) \nTitanium dioxide (E171) \nMacrogol 3350 \nTalc \nSoya lecithin  \nIndigo carmine aluminium lake (E132) \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nNot applicable. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n5 years. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage condition. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nCELSENTRI 25 mg film-coated tablets \n \nHigh density polyethylene bottles (HDPE) with polypropylene child resistant (CR) closures and an \naluminium foil/polyethylene heat induction seal containing 120 film-coated tablets. \n  \nCELSENTRI 75 mg film-coated tablets \n \nHigh density polyethylene bottles (HDPE) with polypropylene child resistant (CR) closures and an \naluminium foil/polyethylene heat induction seal containing 120 film-coated tablets. \n \nCELSENTRI 150 mg film-coated tablets \n \nHigh density polyethylene bottles (HDPE) with polypropylene child resistant (CR) closures and an \naluminium foil/polyethylene heat induction seal containing 180 film-coated tablets.  \n \nPolyvinyl chloride (PVC) blisters with child-resistant (CR)  aluminium/polyethylene terephthalate \n(PET) lidding foil  in a carton containing 30, 60, 90 film-coated tablets and multipacks containing \n180 (2 packs of 90) film-coated tablets.  \n \nCELSENTRI 300 mg film-coated tablets \n \nHigh density polyethylene bottles (HDPE) with polypropylene child resistant (CR) closures and an \naluminium foil/polyethylene heat induction seal containing 180 film-coated tablets. \n \nPolyvinyl chloride (PVC) blisters with child-resistant (CR)   aluminium/polyethylene terephthalate \n(PET) lidding foil in a carton containing 30, 60, 90 film-coated tablets and multipacks containing \n180 (2 packs of 90) film-coated tablets. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n28 \n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal  \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n \n7 MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER \n \nViiV Healthcare BV \nVan Asch van Wijckstraat 55H \n3811 LP Amersfoort \nNetherlands \n \n \n8.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCELSENTRI 20 mg/ml oral solution \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of oral solution contains 20 mg maraviroc. \n  \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral solution.  \n \nClear, colourless, oral solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCELSENTRI, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, is indicated for \ntreatment-experienced adults, adolescents and children of 2 years of age, and older and weighing at \nleast 10 kg infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nBefore taking CELSENTRI it has to be confirmed that only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 is detectable (i.e. \nCXCR4 or dual/mixed tropic virus not detected) using an adequately validated and sensitive \ndetection method on a newly drawn blood sample. The Monogram Trofile assay was used in the \nclinical studies of CELSENTRI (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The viral tropism cannot be safely \npredicted by treatment history and assessment of stored samples. \n \nThere are currently no data regarding the reuse of CELSENTRI in patients that currently have only \nCCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable, but have a history of failure on CELSENTRI (or other CCR5 \nantagonists) with a CXCR4 or dual/mixed tropic virus. There are no data regarding the switch from \na medicinal product of a different antiretroviral class to CELSENTRI in virologically suppressed \npatients. Alternative treatment options should be considered.  \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose of CELSENTRI is 150 mg (with potent CYP3A inhibitor with or without a \npotent CYP3A inducer), 300 mg (without potent CYP3A inhibitors or inducers) or 600 mg twice \ndaily (with potent CYP3A inducer without a potent CYP3A inhibitor) depending on interactions \nwith concomitant antiretroviral therapy and other medicinal products (see section 4.5).  \n \nChildren from 2 years of age and weighing at least 10kg \nThe recommended dose of CELSENTRI should be based on body weight (kg) and should not \nexceed the recommended adult dose. CELSENTRI oral solution (20 mg per mL) formulation \nshould be prescribed if a child is unable to reliably swallow CELSENTRI tablets. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n30 \n \n\nThe recommended dose of CELSENTRI differs depending on interactions with concomitant \nantiretroviral therapy and other medicinal products. Refer to section 4.5 for corresponding adult \ndosage. \n \nMany medicines have profound effects on maraviroc exposure due to drug-drug interactions. Prior \nto deciding the dose of CELSENTRI by weight, please refer to Table 2 in section 4.5 to carefully \ndetermine the corresponding adult dose.  The corresponding paediatric dose can then be obtained \nfrom Table 1 below. If uncertainty still exists, contact a pharmacist for advice. \n \nTable 1. Recommended dosing regimen in children aged 2 years and above and weighing at \nleast 10 kg \n \n\nAdult \ndosage* \n\nConcomitant \nMedications \n\nDose of CELSENTRI in children based on weight \n\n10 to \nless than 20 kg \n\n20 to \nless than \n\n30 kg \n\n30 to \nless than  \n\n40 kg \n\nat least \n40 kg \n\n150 mg twice \ndaily \n\nCELSENTRI \nwith products \nthat are potent \nCYP3A \ninhibitors (with \nor without a \nCYP3A inducer) \n\n50 mg \ntwice daily \n\n75 mg \ntwice daily \n\n100 mg \ntwice daily \n\n150 mg \ntwice daily \n\n300 mg twice \ndaily \n\nCELSENTRI \nwith products \nthat are not \npotent CYP3A \ninhibitors or \npotent CYP3A \ninducers \n\n  Data to support these doses are \nlacking. \n\n300 mg \ntwice daily \n\n300 mg \ntwice daily \n\n600 mg twice \ndaily \n\nCELSENTRI \nwith products \nthat are CYP3A \ninducers (without \na potent CYP3A \ninhibitor) \n\nData to support these doses are lacking and CELSENTRI is not \nrecommended in children taking concomitant interacting \nmedicinal products that in adults would require a 600 mg twice \ndaily dose. \n\n \n\n* Based on drug-drug interactions (refer to section 4.5) \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThere is limited experience in patients >65 years of age (see section 5.2), therefore CELSENTRI \nshould be used with caution in this population. \n \nRenal impairment  \nIn adult patients with a creatinine clearance of <80 mL/min, who are also receiving potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitors, the dose interval of maraviroc should be adjusted to 150 mg once daily (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.5).   \n \nExamples of agents/regimens with such potent CYP3A4-inhibiting activity are: \n \n\n• ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (with the exception of tipranavir/ritonavir),  \n• cobicistat,  \n• itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin and telithromycin, \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n31 \n \n\n• telaprevir and boceprevir. \n \nCELSENTRI should be used with caution in adult patients with severe renal impairment  \n(CLcr <30 mL/min) who are receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nThere are no data available to recommend a specific dose in paediatric patients with renal \nimpairment.  Therefore, CELSENTRI should be used with caution in this population. \n \nHepatic impairment  \nLimited data are available in adult patients with hepatic impairment and no data are available to \nrecommend a specific dose for paediatric patients.  Therefore, CELSENTRI should be used with \ncaution in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric patients (children younger than 2 years of age or weighing less than 10 kg) \nThe safety and efficacy of CELSENTRI in children younger than 2 years of age or weighing less \nthan 10 kg has not been established (see section 5.2). No data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nCELSENTRI can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially \nreduce the risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nHepatic disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of maraviroc have not been specifically studied in patients with significant \nunderlying liver disorders. \n \nCases of hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure with allergic features have been reported in association \nwith maraviroc. In addition, an increase in hepatic adverse reactions with maraviroc was observed \nduring studies of treatment-experienced subjects with HIV infection, although there was no overall \nincrease in ACTG Grade 3/4 liver function test abnormalities (see section 4.8). Hepatobiliary \ndisorders reported in treatment-naïve patients were uncommon and balanced between treatment \ngroups (see section 4.8). Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active \nhepatitis, can have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination \nantiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice. \n \nDiscontinuation of maraviroc should be strongly considered in any patient with signs or symptoms \nof acute hepatitis, in particular if drug-related hypersensitivity is suspected or with increased liver \ntransaminases combined with rash or other systemic symptoms of potential hypersensitivity (e.g. \npruritic rash, eosinophilia or elevated IgE). \n \nThere are limited data in patients with hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection (see section 5.1). \nCaution should be exercised when treating these patients. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n32 \n \n\nfor hepatitis B and/or C, please refer to the relevant product information for these medicinal \nproducts. \n \nThere is limited experience in patients with reduced hepatic function, therefore maraviroc should \nbe used with caution in this population (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nSevere skin and hypersensitivity reactions \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including severe and potentially life threatening events have been \nreported in patients taking maraviroc, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products \nassociated with these reactions. These reactions included rash, fever, and sometimes organ \ndysfunction and hepatic failure. Discontinue maraviroc and other suspect agents immediately if \nsigns or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop. Clinical status and relevant \nblood chemistry should be monitored and appropriate symptomatic therapy initiated. \n \nCardiovascular safety \n \nLimited data exist with the use of maraviroc in patients with severe cardiovascular disease, \ntherefore special caution should be exercised when treating these patients with maraviroc. In the \npivotal studies of treatment-experienced patients coronary heart disease events were more common \nin patients treated with maraviroc than with placebo (11 during 609 PY vs 0 during 111 PY of \nfollow-up). In treatment-naïve patients such events occurred at a similarly low rate with maraviroc \nand control (efavirenz). \n \nPostural hypotension \n \nWhen maraviroc was administered in studies with healthy volunteers at doses higher than the \nrecommended dose, cases of symptomatic postural hypotension were seen at a greater frequency \nthan with placebo. Caution should be used when administering maraviroc in patients on \nconcomitant medicinal products known to lower blood pressure.  Maraviroc should also be used \nwith caution in patients with severe renal insufficiency and in patients who have risk factors for, or \nhave a history of postural hypotension.  Patients with cardiovascular co-morbidities could be at \nincreased risk of cardiovascular adverse reactions triggered by postural hypotension. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nAn increased risk of postural hypotension may occur in patients with severe renal insufficiency \nwho are treated with potent CYP3A inhibitors or boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) and maraviroc. \nThis risk is due to potential increases in maraviroc maximum concentrations when maraviroc is \nco-administered with potent CYP3A inhibitors or boosted PIs in these patients.  \n \nImmune reconstitution syndrome \n \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any \ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment initiated when necessary. Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in \nthe setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these \nevents can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n33 \n \n\nTropism \n \nMaraviroc should only be used when only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 is detectable (i.e. CXCR4 or \ndual/mixed tropic virus not detected) as determined by an adequately validated and sensitive \ndetection method (see sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1). The Monogram Trofile assay was used in the \nclinical studies of maraviroc. The viral tropism cannot be predicted by treatment history or \nassessment of stored samples.  \n \nChanges in viral tropism occur over time in HIV-1 infected patients. Therefore there is a need to \nstart therapy shortly after a tropism test. \n \nBackground resistance to other classes of antiretrovirals have been shown to be similar in previously \nundetected CXCR4-tropic virus of the minor viral population, as that found in CCR5-tropic virus. \n \nMaraviroc is not recommended to be used in treatment-naïve patients based on the results of a \nclinical study in this population (see section 5.1). \n \nDose adjustment \n \nPhysicians should ensure that appropriate dose adjustment of maraviroc is made when maraviroc is \nco-administered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or inducers since maraviroc concentrations \nand its therapeutic effects may be affected (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). Please also refer to the \nrespective Summary of Product Characteristics of the other antiretroviral medicinal products used \nin the combination.  \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have \nbeen reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to \ncombination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if \nthey experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nPotential effect on immunity  \n \nCCR5 antagonists could potentially impair the immune response to certain infections. This should \nbe taken into consideration when treating infections such as active tuberculosis and invasive fungal \ninfections. The incidence of AIDS-defining infections was similar between maraviroc and placebo \narms in the pivotal studies.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMaraviroc is a metabolised by cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Co-administration of \nmaraviroc with medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 may decrease maraviroc concentrations \nand reduce its therapeutic effects. Co-administration of maraviroc with medicinal products that \ninhibit CYP3A4 may increase maraviroc plasma concentrations. Dose adjustment of maraviroc is \nrecommended when maraviroc is co-administered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or inducers. \nFurther details for concomitantly administered medicinal products are provided below (see Table \n2).  \n \nMaraviroc is a substrate for the transporters P-glycoprotein and OATP1B1, but the effect of these \ntransporters on the exposure to maraviroc is not known. \n   \nBased on the in vitro and clinical data, the potential for maraviroc to affect the pharmacokinetics of \nco-administered medicinal products is low.  In vitro studies have shown that maraviroc does not \ninhibit OATP1B1, MRP2 or any of the major P450 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n34 \n \n\n(CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4). Maraviroc had no \nclinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, the oral contraceptives \nethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, or urinary 6β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio, suggesting no \ninhibition or induction of CYP3A4 in vivo. At higher exposure of maraviroc a potential inhibition \nof CYP2D6 cannot be excluded.  \n \nRenal clearance accounts for approximately 23% of total clearance of maraviroc when maraviroc is \nadministered without CYP3A4 inhibitors. In vitro studies have shown that maraviroc does not \ninhibit any of the major renal uptake transporters at clinically relevant concentrations (OAT1, \nOAT3, OCT2, OCTN1, and OCTN2). Additionally, co-administration of maraviroc with tenofovir \n(substrate for renal elimination) and cotrimoxazole (contains trimethoprim, a renal cation transport \ninhibitor), showed no effect on the pharmacokinetics of maraviroc. In addition, co-administration \nof maraviroc with lamivudine/zidovudine showed no effect of maraviroc on lamivudine (primarily \nrenally cleared) or zidovudine (non-P450 metabolism and renal clearance) pharmacokinetics.  \nMaraviroc inhibits P-glycoprotein in vitro (IC50 is 183 μM). However, maraviroc does not \nsignificantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in vivo.  It may not be excluded that maraviroc \ncan increase the exposure to the P-glycoprotein substrate dabigatran etexilate. \n \nTable 2: Interactions and adulta dose recommendations with other medicinal products \n \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas \n(dose of CELSENTRI \nused in study) \n\nEffects on active substance levels \nGeometric mean change if not \nstated otherwise \n\nRecommendations \nconcerning co-\nadministration in adults \n\nANTI-INFECTIVES   \nAntiretrovirals   \nPharmacokinetic Enhancers \nCobicistat Interaction not studied. \n\n \nCobicistat is a potent CYP3A \ninhibitor. \n\nCELSENTRI dose should be \ndecreased to 150 mg twice \ndaily when co-administered \nwith cobicistat containing \nregimen. \n\nNucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) \nLamivudine 150 mg BID \n(maraviroc 300 mg BID) \n\nLamivudine AUC12: ↔ 1.13  \nLamivudine Cmax: ↔ 1.16  \nMaraviroc concentrations not \nmeasured, no effect is expected. \n\nNo significant interaction \nseen/expected.

The effect of maraviroc on \nhuman pregnancy is unknown. Studies in animals showed reproductive toxicity at high exposures. \nPrimary pharmacological activity (CCR5 receptor affinity) was limited in the species studied (see \nsection 5.3). Maraviroc should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit justifies the \npotential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n40 \n \n\n \nIt is unknown whether maraviroc is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological data in \nanimals has shown extensive excretion of maraviroc in milk. Primary pharmacological activity \n(CCR5 receptor affinity) was limited in the species studied (see section 5.3). A risk to the \nnewborn/infants cannot be excluded.  \n \nIt is recommended that mothers infected by HIV do not breast-feed their infants under any \ncircumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \nFertility \n \nThere is no data on the effects of maraviroc on human fertility. In rats, there were no adverse \neffects on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMaraviroc may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \ninformed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with maraviroc. The clinical status of \nthe patient and the adverse reaction profile of maraviroc should be borne in mind when considering \nthe patient's ability to drive, cycle or operate machinery.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdults \nAssessment of treatment related adverse reactions is based on pooled data from two Phase 2b/3 \nstudies in treatment-experienced adult patients (MOTIVATE 1 and MOTIVATE 2) and one study \nin treatment-naïve adult patients (MERIT) infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1).  \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in the Phase 2b/3 studies were nausea, \ndiarrhoea, fatigue and headache. These adverse reactions were common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency. Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \nFrequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(≥1/1000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000) , or not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data).  The adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities presented below are not \nexposure adjusted. \n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions observed in clinical trials or post-marketing  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n41 \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequency \nInfections and infestations Pneumonia, oesophageal candidiasis uncommon \nNeoplasm benign, malignant and \nunspecified (including cysts and \npolyps) \n\nBile duct cancer, diffuse large B-cell \nlymphoma, Hodgkin’s disease, \nmetastases to bone, metastases to \nliver, metastases to peritoneum, \nnasopharyngeal cancer, oesophageal \ncarcinoma \n\nrare \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nAnaemia common \nPancytopenia, granulocytopenia rare \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Anorexia common \nPsychiatric disorders Depression, insomnia common \nNervous system disorders Seizures and seizure disorders uncommon \nCardiac disorders Angina pectoris rare \nVascular disorders Postural hypotension (see section 4.4) uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea  common \nHepatobiliary disorders Alanine aminotransferase increased, \n\naspartate aminotransferase increased \ncommon \n\nHyperbilirubinaemia, gamma-\nglutamyltransferase increased \n\nuncommon \n\nHepatitis toxic, hepatic failure, \nhepatic cirrhosis, blood alkaline \nphosphatase increased \n\nrare \n\nHepatic failure with allergic features very rare \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRash common \nStevens-Johnson syndrome / Toxic \nepidermal necrolysis \n\nrare / not known \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n \n\nMyositis, blood creatine \nphosphokinase increased \n\nuncommon \n\nMuscle atrophy rare \nRenal and urinary disorders Renal failure, proteinuria uncommon \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nAsthenia common \n\n \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDelayed type hypersensitivity reactions, typically occurring within 2-6 weeks after start of therapy \nand including rash, fever, eosinophilia and liver reactions have been reported (see also section 4.4). \nSkin and liver reactions can occur as single events, or in combination. \n \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) \nhave also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can \noccur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged \nrisk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy \n(CART). The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nCases of syncope caused by postural hypotension have been reported. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n42 \n \n\n \nTable 4 shows the incidence ≥1% of Grade 3-4 Abnormalities (ACTG Criteria) based on the \nmaximum shift in laboratory test values without regard to baseline values. \n \nTable 4: Incidence ≥1% of grade 3-4 abnormalities (ACTG criteria) based on maximum shift \nin laboratory test values without regard to baseline studies MOTIVATE 1 and MOTIVATE 2 \n(pooled analysis, up to 48 weeks) \n \n\n \nLaboratory parameter \n\n \n \n\n \nLimit \n\nMaraviroc 300 mg \ntwice daily  \n\n+ OBT \nN =421* \n\n(%) \n\nPlacebo + OBT  \n \n\nN =207* \n(%) \n\nHepatobiliary disorders    \nAspartate aminotransferase >5.0x ULN 4.8 2.9 \nAlanine aminotransferase >5.0x ULN 2.6 3.4 \nTotal bilirubin >5.0x ULN 5.5 5.3 \nGastrointestinal disorders    \nAmylase >2.0x ULN 5.7 5.8 \nLipase >2.0x ULN 4.9 6.3 \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders   \nAbsolute neutrophil count <750/mm3 4.3 1.9 \n\nULN: Upper Limit of Normal \nOBT: Optimised Background Therapy \n* Percentages based on total patients evaluated for each laboratory parameter \n \nThe MOTIVATE studies were extended beyond 96 weeks, with an observational phase extended to \n5 years in order to assess the long term safety of maraviroc. The Long Term Safety/Selected \nEndpoints (LTS/SE) included death, AIDS-defining events, hepatic failure, Myocardial \ninfarction/cardiac ischaemia, malignancies, rhabdomyolysis and other serious infectious events \nwith maraviroc treatment.  The incidence of these selected endpoints for subjects on maraviroc in \nthis observational phase was consistent with the incidence seen at earlier timepoints in the studies. \n \nIn treatment-naïve patients, the incidence of grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities using ACTG \ncriteria was similar among the maraviroc and efavirenz treatment groups. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe adverse reaction profile in paediatric patients is based on 48 Week safety data from study \nA4001031 in which 103 HIV-1 infected, treatment-experienced patients aged 2 to <18 years \nreceived maraviroc twice-daily with optimised background therapy (OBT).  Overall, the safety \nprofile in paediatric patients was similar to that observed in adult clinical studies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n \n \n\n43 \n \n\nThe highest dose administered in clinical studies was 1,200 mg. The dose limiting adverse reaction \nwas postural hypotension.  \n \nProlongation of the QT interval was seen in dogs and monkeys at plasma concentrations 6 and 12 \ntimes, respectively, those expected in humans at the maximum recommended dose of 300 mg twice \ndaily. However, no clinically significant QT prolongation compared to placebo + OBT was seen in \nthe Phase 3 clinical studies using the recommended dose of maraviroc or in a specific \npharmacokinetic study to evaluate the potential of maraviroc to prolong the QT interval.  \n \nManagement \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with maraviroc. Treatment of overdose should consist of \ngeneral supportive measures including keeping the patient in a supine position, careful assessment \nof patient vital signs, blood pressure and ECG. \n \nIf indicated, elimination of unabsorbed active maraviroc should be achieved by emesis or gastric \nlavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal of unabsorbed \nactive substance. Since maraviroc is moderately protein bound, dialysis may be beneficial in \nremoval of this medicine. Further management should be as recommended by the national poisons \ncentre, where available. \n \n \n5.

Maraviroc selectively binds \nto the human chemokine receptor CCR5, preventing CCR5-tropic HIV-1 from entering cells. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nMaraviroc has no antiviral activity in vitro against viruses which can use CXCR4 as their entry co-\nreceptor (dual-tropic or CXCR4-tropic viruses, collectively termed ‘CXCR4-using’ virus below). \nThe serum adjusted EC90 value in 43 primary HIV-1 clinical isolates was 0.57 (0.06 – 10.7) ng/mL \nwithout significant changes between different subtypes tested. The antiviral activity of maraviroc \nagainst HIV-2 has not been evaluated. For details please refer to the pharmacology section of the \nCELSENTRI European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the European Medicines Agency \n(EMA) website. \n \nWhen used with other antiretroviral medicinal products in cell culture, the combination of \nmaraviroc was not antagonistic with a range of NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs or the HIV fusion inhibitor \nenfuvirtide.  \n \nVirologic Escape \n \nVirologic escape from maraviroc can occur via 2 routes: the emergence of pre-existing virus which \ncan use CXCR4 as its entry co-receptor (CXCR4-using virus) or the selection of virus that \ncontinues to use exclusively drug-bound CCR5 (CCR5-tropic virus).  \n \nIn vitro  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n44 \n \n\nHIV-1 variants with reduced susceptibility to maraviroc have been selected in vitro, following \nserial passage of two CCR5-tropic viruses (0 laboratory strains, 2 clinical isolates). The maraviroc-\nresistant viruses remained CCR5-tropic and there was no conversion from a CCR5-tropic virus to a \nCXCR4-using virus.  \n \nPhenotypic resistance \n \nConcentration response curves for the maraviroc-resistant viruses were characterized \nphenotypically by curves that did not reach 100% inhibition in assays using serial dilutions of \nmaraviroc (<100% maximal percentage inhibition (MPI)). Traditional IC50/IC90 fold-change was \nnot a useful parameter to measure phenotypic resistance, as those values were sometimes \nunchanged despite significantly reduced sensitivity. \n \nGenotypic resistance  \n \nMutations were found to accumulate in the gp120 envelope glycoprotein (the viral protein that \nbinds to the CCR5 co-receptor). The position of these mutations was not consistent between \ndifferent isolates. Hence, the relevance of these mutations to maraviroc susceptibility in other \nviruses is not known. \n \nCross-resistance in vitro  \n \nHIV-1 clinical isolates resistant to NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs and enfuvirtide were all susceptible to \nmaraviroc in cell culture. Maraviroc-resistant viruses that emerged in vitro remained sensitive to \nthe fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide and the PI, saquinavir. \n \nIn vivo \n \nTreatment-Experienced Adult Patients \n \nIn the pivotal studies (MOTIVATE 1 and MOTIVATE 2), 7.6% of patients had a change in \ntropism result from CCR5-tropic to CXCR4-tropic or dual/mixed-tropic between screening and \nbaseline (a period of 4-6 weeks).  \n \nFailure with CXCR4-using virus \n \nCXCR4-using virus was detected at failure in approximately 60% of subjects who failed treatment \non maraviroc, as compared to 6% of subjects who experienced treatment failure in the placebo + \nOBT arm. To investigate the likely origin of the on-treatment CXCR4-using virus, a detailed clonal \nanalysis was conducted on virus from 20 representative subjects (16 subjects from the maraviroc \narms and 4 subjects from the placebo + OBT arm) in whom CXCR4-using virus was detected at \ntreatment failure. This analysis indicated that CXCR4-using virus emerged from a pre-existing \nCXCR4-using reservoir not detected at baseline, rather than from mutation of CCR5-tropic virus \npresent at baseline. An analysis of tropism following failure of maraviroc therapy with CXCR4-\nusing virus in patients with CCR5 virus at baseline, demonstrated that the virus population reverted \nback to CCR5 tropism in 33 of 36 patients with more than 35 days of follow-up.  \n \nAt the time of failure with CXCR4-using virus, the resistance pattern to other antiretrovirals \nappears similar to that of the CCR5-tropic population at baseline, based on available data. Hence, \nin the selection of a treatment regimen, it should be assumed that viruses forming part of the \npreviously undetected CXCR4 -using population (i.e. minor viral population) harbours the same \nresistance pattern as the CCR5-tropic population.  \n \nFailure with CCR5-tropic virus \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n45 \n \n\nPhenotypic resistance  \n \nIn patients with CCR5-tropic virus at time of treatment failure with maraviroc, 22 out of 58 \npatients had virus with reduced sensitivity to maraviroc. In the remaining 36 patients, there was no \nevidence of virus with reduced sensitivity as identified by exploratory virology analyses on a \nrepresentative group. The latter group had markers correlating to low compliance (low and variable \ndrug levels and often a calculated high residual sensitivity score of the OBT). In patients failing \ntherapy with CCR5-tropic virus only, maraviroc might be considered still active if the MPI value is \n≥95% (PhenoSense Entry assay). Residual activity in vivo for viruses with MPI-values <95% has \nnot been determined. \n \nGenotypic resistance \n  \nA relatively small number of individuals receiving maraviroc-containing therapy have failed with \nphenotypic resistance (i.e. the ability to use drug-bound CCR5 with MPI <95%).   To date, no \nsignature mutation(s) have been identified.  The gp120 amino acid substitutions identified so far \nare context dependent and inherently unpredictable with regards to maraviroc susceptibility.   \nTreatment-Experienced Paediatric Patients \n \nIn the Week 48 analysis (N=103), non-CCR5 tropic-virus was detected in 5/23 (22%) subjects at \nvirologic failure. One additional subject had CCR5 tropic-virus with reduced susceptibility to \nmaraviroc at virologic failure, although this was not retained at the end of treatment.  Subjects with \nvirologic failure generally appeared to have low compliance to both maraviroc and the background \nantiretroviral elements of their regimens. Overall, the mechanisms of resistance to maraviroc \nobserved in this treatment-experienced paediatric population were similar to those observed in \nadult populations. \n \nClinical results \n \nStudies in Treatment-Experienced Adult Patients Infected with CCR5-tropic Virus \n \nThe clinical efficacy of maraviroc (in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products) on \nplasma HIV RNA levels and CD4+ cell counts have been investigated in two pivotal randomized, \ndouble blind, multicentre studies (MOTIVATE 1 and MOTIVATE 2, n=1076) in patients infected \nwith CCR5 tropic HIV-1 as determined by the Monogram Trofile Assay. \n \nPatients who were eligible for these studies had prior exposure to at least 3 antiretroviral medicinal \nproduct classes [≥1 NRTIs, ≥1 NNRTIs, ≥2 PIs, and/or enfurvirtide] or documented resistance to at \nleast one member of each class. Patients were randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio to maraviroc 300 mg \n(dose equivalence) once daily, twice daily or placebo in combination with an optimized \nbackground consisting of 3 to 6 antiretroviral medicinal products (excluding low-dose ritonavir). \nThe OBT was selected on the basis of the subject’s prior treatment history and baseline genotypic \nand phenotypic viral resistance measurements.  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n46 \n \n\nTable 5: Demographic and baseline characteristics of patients (pooled studies MOTIVATE 1 \nand MOTIVATE 2) \n \n\n \nDemographic and Baseline Characteristics \n\nMaraviroc 300 mg \ntwice daily \n\n+ OBT \n \n\nN = 426 \n\nPlacebo + OBT  \n \n \n\nN = 209 \n\nAge (years) \n(Range, years) \n\n46.3 \n21-73 \n\n45.7 \n29-72 \n\nMale Sex 89.7% 88.5% \nRace (White/Black/Other) 85.2% / 12% / 2.8% 85.2% / 12.4% / 2.4% \nMean Baseline HIV-1 RNA (log10 copies/mL) 4.85 4.86 \nMedian Baseline CD4+ Cell Count (cells/mm3)  \n(range, cells/mm3) \n\n166.8 \n(2.0-820.0) \n\n171.3 \n(1.0-675.0) \n\nScreening Viral Load >100,000 copies/mL 179 (42.0%) 84 (40.2%) \nBaseline CD4+ Cell Count ≤200 cells/mm3 250 (58.7%) 118 (56.5%) \nNumber (Percentage) of patients with GSS score1: \n 0 \n 1 \n 2 \n ≥3 \n\n \n102 (23.9%) \n138 (32.4%) \n80 (18.8%) \n\n104 (24.4%) \n\n \n51 (24.4%) \n53 (25.4%) \n41 (19.6%) \n59 (28.2%) \n\n1Based on GeneSeq resistance assay  \n \nLimited numbers of patients from ethnicities other than Caucasian were included in the pivotal \nclinical studies, therefore very limited data are available in these patient populations. \n \nThe mean increase in CD4+ cell count from baseline in patients who failed with a change in \ntropism result to dual/mixed tropic or CXCR4, in the maraviroc 300 mg twice daily + OBT \n(+56 cells/mm3) group was greater than that seen in patients failing placebo + OBT \n(+13.8 cells/mm3) regardless of tropism. \n \nTable 6: Efficacy Outcomes at week 48 (pooled studies MOTIVATE 1 and MOTIVATE 2) \n \n\nOutcomes Maraviroc 300 mg \ntwice daily \n\n+ OBT \nN=426 \n\nPlacebo + \nOBT  \n\n \nN=209 \n\nDifference1 \n (Confidence \n\nInterval2) \n\nHIV-1 RNA \nMean change from baseline \n(log copies/mL) \n\n \n-1.837 \n\n \n\n \n-0.785 \n\n \n-1.055 \n\n(-1.327, -0.783) \nPercentage of patients with \nHIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL \n\n56.1% \n \n\n22.5% Odds ratio: 4.76 \n(3.24, 7.00) \n\nPercentage of patients with \nHIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL \n\n45.5% \n \n\n16.7% Odds ratio: 4.49 \n(2.96, 6.83) \n\nCD4+ cell count \nMean change from baseline \n(cells/µL) \n\n \n122.78 \n\n \n\n59.17 \n \n\n \n63.13 \n\n(44.28, 81.99)2 \n1 p-values < 0.0001 \n2 For all efficacy endpoints the confidence intervals were 95%, except for HIV-1 RNA Change \nfrom baseline, which was 97.5% \n \nIn a retrospective analysis of the MOTIVATE studies with a more sensitive assay for screening of \ntropism (Trofile ES), the response rates (<50 copies/mL at week 48) in patients with only CCR5-\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n47 \n \n\ntropic virus detected at baseline was 48.2% in those treated with maraviroc + OBT (n=328), and \n16.3% in those treated with placebo + OBT (n=178). \n \nMaraviroc 300 mg twice daily + OBT was superior to placebo + OBT across all subgroups of \npatients analysed (see Table 7).

Use of maraviroc \nwas not associated with a significant decrease in HIV 1 RNA compared with placebo in these \nsubjects and no adverse effect on CD4+ cell count was noted.  \nStudies in Treatment-Naïve Adult Patients Infected with CCR5-tropic Virus  \n \nA randomised, double-blinded study (MERIT), explored maraviroc versus efavirenz, both in \ncombination with zidovudine/lamivudine (n=721, 1:1). After 48 weeks of treatment, maraviroc did \nnot reach non-inferiority to efavirenz for the endpoint of HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (65.3 vs. \n69.3 % respectively, lower confidence bound -11.9%). More patients treated with maraviroc \ndiscontinued due to lack of efficacy (43 vs.15) and among patients with lack of efficacy, the \nproportion acquiring NRTI resistance (mainly lamivudine) was higher in the maraviroc arm. Fewer \npatients discontinued maraviroc due to adverse events (15 vs. 49). \n \nStudies in Adult Patients Co-infected with Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C virus  \n \nThe hepatic safety of maraviroc in combination with other antiretroviral agents in CCR5-tropic \nHIV-1-infected subjects with HIV RNA <50 copies/mL, co-infected with Hepatitis C and/or \nHepatitis B Virus was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled \nstudy. 70 subjects (Child-Pugh Class A, n=64; Child-Pugh Class B, n=6) were randomized to the \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n48 \n \n\nmaraviroc group and 67 subjects (Child-Pugh Class A, n=59; Child-Pugh Class B, n=8) were \nrandomized to the placebo group.  \n \nThe primary objective assessed the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 ALT abnormalities (>5x upper limit \nof normal (ULN) if baseline ALT ≤ ULN; or >3.5x baseline if baseline ALT > ULN) at Week 48. \nOne subject in each treatment arm met the primary endpoint by Week 48 (at Week 8 for placebo \nand Week 36 for the maraviroc arm).  \n \nStudies in Treatment-Experienced Paediatric Patients Infected with CCR5-tropic Virus \n \nStudy A4001031 is an open-label, multicenter trial in paediatric patients (aged 2 years to less than \n18 years) infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1, determined by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay. \nSubjects were required to have HIV-1 RNA greater than 1,000 copies per mL at Screening.  \n \nAll subjects (n = 103) received maraviroc twice daily and OBT.  Maraviroc dosing was based on \nbody surface area and doses were adjusted based on whether the subject was receiving potent \nCYP3A inhibitors and/or inducers. \n \nIn paediatric patients with a successful tropism test, dual mixed/CXCR4-tropic virus was detected \nin around 40% of screening samples (8/27, 30% in 2-6 year-olds, 31/81, 38% in 6-12 year-olds and \n41/90, 46%  in 12-18 year-olds), underscoring the importance of tropism testing also in the \npaediatric population. \n\n \nThe population was 52% female and 69% black, with mean age of 10 years (range: 2 years to \n17 years). At baseline, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.3 log10 copies/mL (range 2.4 to 6.2 log10 \ncopies per mL), mean CD4+ cell count was 551 cells/mm3 (range 1 to 1654 cells/mm3) and mean \nCD4+ % was 21% (range 0% to 42%).  \n \nAt 48 weeks, using a missing, switch or discontinuation equals failure analysis, 48% of subjects \ntreated with maraviroc and OBT achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 48 copies/mL and 65% of \nsubjects achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies per mL. The mean CD4+ cell count \n(percent) increase from baseline to Week 48 was 247 cells/mm3 (5%). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \n \nThe absorption of maraviroc is variable with multiple peaks. Median peak maraviroc plasma \nconcentrations are attained at 2 hours (range 0.5-4 hours) following single oral doses of 300 mg \ncommercial tablet administered to healthy volunteers. The pharmacokinetics of oral maraviroc are \nnot dose proportional over the dose range. The absolute bioavailability of a 100 mg dose is 23% \nand is predicted to be 33% at 300 mg. Maraviroc is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-\nglycoprotein. \n \nCo-administration of a 300 mg tablet with a high fat breakfast reduced maraviroc Cmax and AUC by \n33% and co-administration of 75 mg of oral solution with a high fat breakfast reduced maraviroc \nAUC by 73% in adult healthy volunteers.  Studies with the tablets demonstrated a reduced food-\neffect at higher doses.  \n \nThere were no food restrictions in the adult studies (using tablet formulations) or in the paediatric \nstudy (using both tablet and oral solution formulations). The results did not indicate any relevant \nefficacy or safety concern related to either fed or fasted dosing conditions. Therefore, maraviroc \ntablets and oral solution can be taken with or without food at the recommended doses in adults, \nadolescents and children aged 2 years and older and weighing at least 10 kg (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n49 \n \n\nDistribution \n \nMaraviroc is bound (approximately 76%) to human plasma proteins, and shows moderate affinity \nfor albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution of maraviroc is \napproximately 194 L.  \n \nBiotransformation  \n \nStudies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes and expressed enzymes have \ndemonstrated that maraviroc is principally metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system to \nmetabolites that are essentially inactive against HIV-1. In vitro studies indicate that CYP3A4 is the \nmajor enzyme responsible for maraviroc metabolism. In vitro studies also indicate that \npolymorphic enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 do not contribute significantly to the \nmetabolism of maraviroc.  \n \nMaraviroc is the major circulating component (approximately 42% radioactivity) following a single \noral dose of 300 mg. The most significant circulating metabolite in humans is a secondary amine \n(approximately 22% radioactivity) formed by N-dealkylation. This polar metabolite has no \nsignificant pharmacological activity. Other metabolites are products of mono-oxidation and are \nonly minor components of plasma radioactivity. \n \nElimination  \n \nA mass balance/excretion study was conducted using a single 300 mg dose of 14C-labeled \nmaraviroc. Approximately 20% of the radiolabel was recovered in the urine and 76% was \nrecovered in the faeces over 168 hours. Maraviroc was the major component present in urine (mean \nof 8% dose) and faeces (mean of 25% dose). The remainder was excreted as metabolites. After \nintravenous administration (30 mg), the half-life of maraviroc was 13.2 h, 22% of the dose was \nexcreted unchanged in the urine and the values of total clearance and renal clearance were 44.0 L/h \nand 10.17 L/h respectively. \n \nSpecial patient populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIntensive pharmacokinetics of maraviroc were evaluated in 50 treatment-experienced, CCR5-\ntropic, HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years (weight 10.0 to 57.6 kg) in the dose-\nfinding stage of clinical trial A4001031. Doses were given with food on intensive pharmacokinetic \nevaluation days and optimised to achieve an average concentration over the dosing interval (Cavg) \nof greater than 100 ng/mL; otherwise, maraviroc was given with or without food. The initial dose \nof maraviroc was scaled from adult doses using a body surface area (BSA) of 1.73 m2 to children \nand adolescent BSA (m2)-based bands. In addition, dosing was based on whether subjects were \nreceiving potent CYP3A inhibitors (38/50), potent CYP3A inducers (2/50) or other concomitant \nmedicinal products that are not potent CYP3A inhibitors or potent CYP3A inducers (10/50) as part \nof OBT. Sparse pharmacokinetics were evaluated in all subjects including the additional 47 \nsubjects receiving potent CYP3A inhibitors that did not take part in the dose-finding stage. The \nimpact of potent CYP3A inhibitors and/or inducers on maraviroc pharmacokinetic parameters in \npaediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults. \n \nBSA (m2)-based bands have been modified to weight (kg)-based bands to simplify dosing and \nreduce dosing errors (see section 4.2).  Use of weight (kg)-based doses in treatment-experienced \nHIV-1-infected paediatrics results in maraviroc exposures similar to those observed in treatment-\nexperienced adults receiving recommended doses with concomitant medications.  The \npharmacokinetics of maraviroc in paediatric patients below 2 years of age have not been \nestablished (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n50 \n \n\nElderly \n \nPopulation analysis of the Phase 1/2a and Phase 3 studies (16-65 years of age) has been conducted \nand no effect of age has been observed (see section 4.2). \n  \nRenal impairment \n \nA study compared the pharmacokinetics of a single 300 mg dose of maraviroc in subjects with \nsevere renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min, n=6) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) to healthy \nvolunteers (n=6). The geometric mean AUCinf (CV%) for maraviroc was as follows: healthy \nvolunteers (normal renal function) 1348.4 ng·h/mL (61%); severe renal impairment 4367.7 \nng·h/mL (52%); ESRD (dosing after dialysis) 2677.4 ng·h/mL (40%); and ESRD (dosing before \ndialysis) 2805.5 ng·h/mL (45%). The C max (CV%) was 335.6 ng/mL (87%) in healthy volunteers \n(normal renal function); 801.2 ng/mL (56%) in severe renal impairment; 576.7 ng/mL (51%) in \nESRD (dosing after dialysis) and 478.5 ng/mL (38%) in ESRD (dosing before dialysis). Dialysis \nhad a minimal effect on exposure in subjects with ESRD. Exposures observed in subjects with \nsevere renal impairment and ESRD were within the range observed in single maraviroc 300 mg \ndose studies in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Therefore, no dose adjustment is \nnecessary in patients with renal impairment receiving maraviroc without a potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitor (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5).  \n \nIn addition, the study compared the pharmacokinetics of multiple dose maraviroc in combination \nwith saquinavir/ritonavir 1000/100 mg BID (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) for 7 days in subjects with \nmild renal impairment (CLcr >50 and ≤80 mL/min, n=6) and moderate renal impairment (CLcr \n≥30 and ≤50 mL/min, n=6) to healthy volunteers (n=6). Subjects received 150 mg of maraviroc at \ndifferent dose frequencies (healthy volunteers – every 12 hours; mild renal impairment – every 24 \nhours; moderate renal impairment – every 48 hours). The average concentration (Cavg) of \nmaraviroc over 24 hours was 445.1 ng/mL, 338.3 ng/mL, and 223.7 ng/mL for subjects with \nnormal renal function, mild renal impairment, and moderate renal impairment, respectively. The \nCavg of maraviroc from 24-48 hours for subjects with moderate renal impairment was low (Cavg: \n32.8 ng/mL). Therefore, dosing frequencies of longer than 24 hours in subjects with renal \nimpairment may result in inadequate exposures between 24-48 hours.  \n \nDose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment receiving maraviroc with potent \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nHepatic impairment  \n \nMaraviroc is primarily metabolized and eliminated by the liver. A study compared the \npharmacokinetics of a single 300 mg dose of maraviroc in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, \nn=8), and moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, n=8) hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects \n(n=8). Geometric mean ratios for Cmax and AUClast were 11% and 25% higher respectively for \nsubjects with mild hepatic impairment, and 32% and 46% higher respectively for subjects with \nmoderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. The effects of \nmoderate hepatic impairment may be underestimated due to limited data in patients with decreased \nmetabolic capacity and higher renal clearance in these subjects. The results should therefore be \ninterpreted with caution. The pharmacokinetics of maraviroc has not been studied in subjects with \nsevere hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  \n  \nRace \n \nNo relevant difference between Caucasian, Asian and Black subjects has been observed. The \npharmacokinetics in other races has not been evaluated. \n \nGender \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n51 \n \n\nNo relevant differences in pharmacokinetics have been observed.  \n \nPharmacogenomics \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of maraviroc is dependent on CYP3A5 activity and expression level, which \ncan be modulated by genetic variation. Subjects with a functional CYP3A5 (CYP3A5*1 allele) \nhave been shown to have a reduced exposure to maraviroc compared to subjects with defect \nCYP3A5 activity (e.g., CYP3A5*3, CYP3A5*6, and CYP3A5*7). The CYP3A5 allelic frequency \ndepends on ethnicity: the majority of Caucasians (~90%) are poor metabolisers of CYP3A5 \nsubstrates (i.e., subjects with no copy of functional CYP3A5 alleles) while approximately 40% of \nAfrican-Americans and 70% of Sub-Saharan Africans are extensive metabolisers (i.e., subjects \nwith two copies of functional CYP3A5 alleles). \n \nIn a Phase 1 study conducted in healthy subjects, Blacks with a CYP3A5 genotype conferring \nextensive maraviroc metabolism (2 CYP3A5*1 alleles; n=12) had a 37% and 26% lower AUC \nwhen dosed with maraviroc 300 mg twice daily compared with Black (n=11) and Caucasian (n=12) \nsubjects with CYP3A5 genotype conferring poor maraviroc metabolism (no CYP3A5*1 allele), \nrespectively. The difference in maraviroc exposure between CYP3A5 extensive and poor \nmetabolisers was reduced when maraviroc was administered together with a strong CYP3A \ninhibitor: extensive CYP3A5 metabolisers (n=12) had a 17% lower maraviroc AUC compared with \npoor CYP3A5 metabolisers (n=11) when dosed with maraviroc 150 mg once daily in the presence \nof darunavir/cobicistat (800/150 mg). \n \nAll subjects in the Phase 1 study achieved the Cavg concentrations that have been shown to be \nassociated with near maximal virologic efficacy with maraviroc (75 ng/mL) in the Phase 3 study in \ntreatment-naïve adult patients (MERIT).  Therefore, despite differences in CYP3A5 genotype \nprevalence by race, the effect of CYP3A5 genotype on maraviroc exposure is not considered \nclinically significant and no maraviroc dose adjustment according to CYP3A5 genotype, race or \nethnicity is needed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPrimary pharmacological activity (CCR5 receptor affinity) was present in the monkey (100% \nreceptor occupancy) and limited in the mouse, rat, rabbit and dog. In mice and human beings that \nlack CCR5 receptors through genetic deletion, no significant adverse consequences have been \nreported. \n \nIn vitro and in vivo studies showed that maraviroc has a potential to increase QTc interval at \nsupratherapeutic doses with no evidence of arrhythmia.  \n \nRepeated dose toxicity studies in rats identified the liver as the primary target organ for toxicity \n(increases in transaminases, bile duct hyperplasia, and necrosis). \n \nMaraviroc was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by a 6 month transgenic mouse study and a 24 \nmonth study in rats. In mice, no statistically significant increase in the incidence of tumours was \nreported at systemic exposures from 7 to 39-times the human exposure (unbound AUC 0-24h \nmeasurement) at a dose of 300 mg twice daily. In rats, administration of maraviroc at a systemic \nexposure 21-times the expected human exposure produced thyroid adenomas associated with \nadaptive liver changes. These findings are considered of low human relevance. In addition, \ncholangiocarcinomas (2/60 males at 900 mg/kg) and cholangioma (1/60 females at 500 mg/kg) \nwere reported in the rat study at a systemic exposure at least 15-times the expected free human \nexposure. \n \nMaraviroc was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including \nbacterial reverse mutation, chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes and mouse bone \nmarrow micronucleus.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n52 \n \n\n \nMaraviroc did not impair mating or fertility of male or female rats, and did not affect sperm of \ntreated male rats up to 1000 mg/kg. The exposure at this dose level corresponded to 39-fold the \nestimated free clinical AUC for a 300 mg twice daily dose.  \n \nEmbryofoetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits at doses up to 39- and 34-\nfold the estimated free clinical AUC for a 300 mg twice daily dose. In rabbit, 7 foetuses had \nexternal anomalies at maternally toxic doses and 1 foetus at the mid dose of 75 mg/kg. \n \nPre- and post-natal developmental studies were performed in rats at doses up to 27-fold the \nestimated free clinical AUC for a 300 mg twice daily dose. A slight increase in motor activity in \nhigh-dose male rats at both weaning and as adults was noted, while no effects were seen in females. \nOther developmental parameters of these offspring, including fertility and reproductive \nperformance, were not affected by the maternal administration of maraviroc. \n \n \n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nCitric acid (anhydrous)  \nSodium citrate dihydrate \nSucralose \nSodium benzoate \nStrawberry flavouring  \nPurified water \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nNot applicable. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n4 years. \n \nAfter first opening: 60 days \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore below 30 ºC.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet.  See Section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n \n1. What CELSENTRI is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take CELSENTRI \n3. How to take CELSENTRI \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store CELSENTRI \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What CELSENTRI is and what it is used for \n \nCELSENTRI contains a medicine called maraviroc. Maraviroc belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled CCR5 antagonists. CELSENTRI works by blocking a receptor called CCR5 which HIV uses \nto enter and infect your blood cells. \n \nCELSENTRI is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type-1 (HIV-1) in adults, \nadolescents and children of 2 years and older, and weighing at least 10 kg. \n \nCELSENTRI must be taken in combination with other medicines which are also used to treat the \nHIV infection. These medicines are all called anti-HIV medicines or antiretrovirals. \n \nCELSENTRI, as part of combination therapy, reduces the amount of virus in your body, and keeps \nit at a low level. This helps your body to increase the CD4 cell count in your blood. CD4 cells are a \ntype of white blood cell that are important in helping your body to fight infection. \n  \n \n2 What you need to know before you take CELSENTRI \n \nDo not take CELSENTRI: \n• if you (or your child, if they are the patient) are allergic to maraviroc or to peanut or soya or to \n\nany of the other ingredients of CELSENTRI (listed in section 6 ). \n\n Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you or your child. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n94 \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nYour doctor must take blood samples to test whether CELSENTRI is an appropriate treatment for \nyou (or your child, if they are the patient). \n \nSome people taking CELSENTRI have developed serious allergic reactions or skin reactions (see \nalso ‘Serious side effects’ in section 4). \n \nBefore taking this medicine, make sure that your doctor knows if you (or your child) have or in the \npast had any of the following: \n \n• liver problems, including chronic hepatitis B or C. Only a limited number of people with liver \n\nproblems have taken CELSENTRI. Your liver function may need to be closely monitored.  \n(See also ‘Liver problems’ in section 4).       \n\n• low blood pressure, including dizziness when you stand up or sit up quickly, or if you are \ntaking any medicines to lower blood pressure. This is due to a sudden fall in blood pressure. If \nthis happens, lie down until you (or your child) feel better. When getting up, do so as slowly as \npossible. \n\n• tuberculosis (TB) or serious fungal infections. CELSENTRI could potentially increase your \nrisk of developing infections. \n\n• kidney problems. This is particularly important if you are also taking some other medicines \n(see ‘Other medicines and CELSENTRI’ later in section 2). \n\n problems with your heart or circulatory system. Only a limited number of people with \nserious heart or circulatory problems have taken CELSENTRI. \n\n Tell your doctor before starting treatment if you think any of these apply to you (or your \nchild). \n\n \nConditions you need to look out for \n \n\nSome people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. \nThese include: \n symptoms of infections and inflammation \n joint pain, stiffness and bone problems \n \nYou need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you’re taking \nCELSENTRI. \n\n Read the information ‘Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV’ in \nSection 4 of this leaflet. \n\n \nProtect other people \nHIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who has the infection, or by transfer of \ninfected blood (for example, by sharing injection needles). You (or your child) can still pass on \nHIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective treatment. \n\n Talk to your doctor about how to avoid infecting other people. \n \nOlder people \nCELSENTRI has only been taken by limited numbers of people 65 years or older. If you belong to \nthis age group, discuss with your doctor if you can use CELSENTRI. \n \nChildren \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n95 \n \n\nThe use of CELSENTRI has not been tested in children under the age of 2 or weighing less than 10 \nkg . Therefore CELSENTRI is not recommended in children younger than 2, or weighing less than \n10 kg. \n \nOther medicines and CELSENTRI \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you (or your child) are taking, any other medicines, have \nrecently taken, or might take any other medicines.  \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you (or your child) begin taking a new medicine while  taking \nCELSENTRI. \n \nMedicines containing St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) are likely to prevent CELSENTRI \nfrom working properly. You should not take them while you’re taking CELSENTRI. \n \n\nSome medicines may change the amount of CELSENTRI in the body when they are taken at the \nsame time as CELSENTRI. These include: \n\n• other medicines to treat HIV or hepatitis C infection (such as atazanavir, cobicistat, darunavir, \nefavirenz, etravirine, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, \nboceprevir, telaprevir) \n\n•  antibiotics (clarithromycin, telithromycin, rifampicin, rifabutin)  \n\n• antifungal medicines (ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole) \n\n• anticonvulsant medicines (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital). \n \n\n Tell your doctor if you (or your child) are taking any of these medicines. This will allow your \ndoctor to prescribe the right dose of CELSENTRI.  \n\n \nPregnancy \n \nIf you are pregnant, if you become pregnant, or if you are planning to have a baby: \n\n  Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking CELSENTRI. \n \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nWomen who are HIV-positive must not breast-feed, because HIV infection can be passed on to \nthe baby in breast milk.   \n\nIt is not known whether the ingredients in CELSENTRI can also pass into breast milk. If you are \nbreast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding: \n\n Talk to your doctor immediately. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nCELSENTRI can make you dizzy. \n\n Do not drive, cycle, or operate tools or machines unless you are sure you’re not affected. \n \nCELSENTRI contains soya lecithin. \n \nIf you are allergic to peanut or soya do not use this medicinal product.  \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n96 \n \n\n3. How to take CELSENTRI  \n \nAlways take or give this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nYour doctor will advise you whether it is better to take CELSENTRI oral solution, if you (or your \nchild) are unable to swallow tablets. \n \nHow much to take \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose of CELSENTRI is 150 mg, 300 mg or 600 mg twice per day depending \non other medicines that you are taking at the same time. Always take the dose recommended by \nyour doctor. \n \nPeople with kidney problems  \nIf you have a kidney problem, your doctor may alter your dose.  \n\n Talk to your doctor if this applies to you. \n \nAdolescents and children from 2 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg \nYour doctor will decide the correct dose of CELSENTRI based on weight and on other medicines \nbeing taken at the same time. \n \nCELSENTRI can be taken with or without food. CELSENTRI should always be taken by \nmouth.  \n \nCELSENTRI must be taken in combination with other medicines to treat HIV. Refer to the \nPackage Leaflets of these other medicines for guidance on how to take them.  \n \nIf you take or give more CELSENTRI than you should \n \nIf you accidentally take or give too much CELSENTRI: \n\n Contact your doctor or the nearest hospital immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take or give CELSENTRI \n \nIf you (or your child) miss a dose of CELSENTRI, take or give the missed dose as soon as possible \nand then continue with the next dose at its regular time.  \n \nIf it is almost time for the next dose, do not take or give the missed dose. Wait for the next dose at \nits regular time. \n\nDo not take or give a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \nIf you or your child stop taking CELSENTRI \n \nKeep taking CELSENTRI until your doctor tells you to stop. \n\nTaking your medicines at the right time every day is important, as it makes sure the HIV infection \ndoes not increase in your body.  Therefore, unless your doctor tells you (or your child) to stop \ntreatment, it is important to keep taking CELSENTRI correctly, as described above. \n\n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or your pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n97 \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Tell \nyour doctor if you notice anything unusual about your own health or your child’s health. \n \n Serious side effects — get medical help immediately \n \nSerious allergic or skin reactions \nSome people taking CELSENTRI have developed severe and life-threatening skin reactions and \nallergic reactions. These are rare, and may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people taking CELSENTRI. \n\nIf you get any of the following symptoms while you’re taking CELSENTRI : \n swelling of the face, lips or tongue  \n difficulty breathing  \n widespread skin rash  \n fever (high temperature)  \n blisters and peeling skin, particularly around the mouth, nose, eyes and genitals. \n Get medical help immediately if you get these symptoms. Stop taking CELSENTRI. \n\n \nLiver problems  \n\nThese are rare, and may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people taking CELSENTRI.  \nSigns include:  \n• loss of appetite  \n• feeling sick or being sick \n• yellowing of skin or eyes \n• skin rash or itching \n• feeling very tired \n• stomach pain or tenderness \n• dark urine \n• drowsiness and confusion \n• fever (high temperature). \n \n Contact a doctor immediately if you get these symptoms. Stop taking CELSENTRI. \n\n \nOther side effects \n \nCommon side effects  \n\nThese may affect 1 to 10 in 100 people: \n• diarrhoea, feeling sick, stomach ache, wind (flatulence),  \n• loss of appetite \n• headache,  problems sleeping,depression \n• rash (see also ‘Serious allergic or skin reactions’ earlier in section 4) \n•  feeling weak or lack of energy, anaemia (seen in blood test result) \n increase in liver enzymes (seen in blood test results), which can be a sign of liver problems (see \n\nalso ‘Liver problems’ earlier in section 4).  \n \n\nUncommon side effects \n\nThese may affect up to 1 in 100 people:  \n lung infection \n fungal infection of the gullet (oesophagus) \n fits (seizures)  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n98 \n \n\n feeling dizzy, faint or light headed when standing up \n kidney failure, protein in the urine \n• an increase in a substance  known as CPK (seen in blood test results) which is a sign that \n muscles are inflamed or damaged.  \n \nRare side effects \n\nThese may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people: \n chest pain (caused by reduced blood flow to the heart)  \n decrease in muscle size  \n some types of cancer, such as of the gullet (oesophagus) and bile duct  \n decrease in number of blood cells (seen in blood test results). \n \n\n \nOther possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV \n\nPeople taking combination therapy for HIV may get other side effects. \n \nSymptoms of infection and inflammation \n\nPeople with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to \ndevelop serious infections (opportunistic infections). When they start treatment, the immune \nsystem becomes stronger, so the body starts to fight infections. \n\nSymptoms of infection and inflammation may develop, caused by either: \n old, hidden infections flaring up again as the body fights them \n the immune system attacking healthy body tissue (autoimmune disorders). \n\nThe symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking \nmedicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: \n muscle weakness  \n weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body  \n palpitations or tremor \n hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement). \nIf you get any symptoms of infection or if you notice any of the symptoms above: \n\n Tell your doctor immediately. Don’t take other medicines for the infection without your \ndoctor’s advice. \n \nJoint pain, stiffness and bone problems \n\nSome people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With \nthis condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. \n\nIt is not known how common this condition is. You may be more likely to develop it: \n if you have been taking combination therapy for a long time \n if you are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids \n if you drink alcohol \n if you have a very weak immune system  \n if you are overweight. \n\n \nSigns to look out for include: \n stiffness in the joints \n aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) \n difficulty moving. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n99 \n \n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms: \n\n Tell your doctor. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet.  See Section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n \n1. What CELSENTRI is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take CELSENTRI \n3. How to take CELSENTRI \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store CELSENTRI \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What CELSENTRI is and what it is used for \n \nCELSENTRI contains a medicine called maraviroc. Maraviroc belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled CCR5 antagonists. CELSENTRI works by blocking a receptor called CCR5 which HIV uses \nto enter and infect your blood cells. \n \nCELSENTRI is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type-1 (HIV-1) in adults, \nadolescents and children of 2 years and older, and weighing at least 10 kg. \n \nCELSENTRI must be taken in combination with other medicines which are also used to treat the \nHIV infection. These medicines are all called anti-HIV medicines or antiretrovirals. \n \nCELSENTRI, as part of combination therapy, reduces the amount of virus in your body, and keeps \nit at a low level. This helps your body to increase the CD4 cell count in your blood. CD4 cells are a \ntype of white blood cell that are important in helping your body to fight infection. \n  \n \n2 What you need to know before you take CELSENTRI \n \nDo not take CELSENTRI: \n• if you (or your child, if they are the patient) are allergic to maraviroc or to any of the other \n\ningredients of CELSENTRI (listed in section 6 ). \n\n Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you or your child. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nYour doctor must take blood samples to test whether CELSENTRI is an appropriate treatment for \nyou (or your child, if they are the patient). \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n103 \n \n\nSome people taking CELSENTRI have developed serious allergic reactions or skin reactions (see \nalso ‘Serious side effects’ in section 4). \n \nBefore taking this medicine, make sure that your doctor knows if you (or your child) have or in the \npast had any of the following: \n liver problems, including chronic hepatitis B or C. Only a limited number of people with liver \n\nproblems have taken CELSENTRI. Your liver function may need to be closely monitored.  (See \nalso ‘Liver problems’ in section 4). \n\n low blood pressure, including dizziness when you stand up or sit up quickly, or if you are \ntaking any medicines to lower blood pressure. This is due to a sudden fall in blood pressure. If \nthis happens, lie down until you (or your child) feel better. When getting up, do so as slowly as \npossible. \n\n tuberculosis (TB) or serious fungal infections. CELSENTRI could potentially increase your \nrisk of developing infections. \n\n kidney problems. This is particularly important if you are also taking some other medicines (see \n‘Other medicines and CELSENTRI’ later in section 2). \n\n problems with your heart or circulatory system. Only a limited number of people with \nserious heart or circulatory problems have taken CELSENTRI. \n\n Tell your doctor before starting treatment if you think any of these apply to you (or your \nchild). \n\n \n\nConditions you need to look out for \n\nSome people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. \nThese include: \n symptoms of infections and inflammation \n joint pain, stiffness and bone problems. \nYou need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you’re taking \nCELSENTRI. \n\n Read the information ‘Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV’ in \nSection 4 of this leaflet. \n\n \nProtect other people \nHIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who has the infection, or by transfer of \ninfected blood (for example, by sharing injection needles). You (or your child) can still pass on \nHIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective treatment.  \n\n Talk to your doctor about how to avoid infecting other people. \n \nOlder people \nCELSENTRI has only been taken by limited numbers of people 65 years or older. If you belong to \nthis age group, discuss with your doctor if you can use CELSENTRI. \n \nChildren \nCELSENTRI has not been tested in children under the age of 2 or weighing less than 10 kg. \nTherefore CELSENTRI is not recommended for children younger than 2 years, or weighing less \nthan 10 kg. \n \nOther medicines and CELSENTRI \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you (or your child) are taking any other medicines,have \nrecently taken, or might take any other medicines.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n104 \n \n\n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you (or your child) begin taking a new medicine while taking \nCELSENTRI. \n \nMedicines containing St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) are likely to prevent CELSENTRI \nfrom working properly. You should not take them while you’re taking CELSENTRI. \n \nSome medicines may change the amount of CELSENTRI in the body when they are taken at the \nsame time as CELSENTRI. These include:  \n other medicines to treat HIV or hepatitis C infection (such as atazanavir, cobicistat, darunavir, \n\nefavirenz, etravirine, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, \nboceprevir, telaprevir) \n\n antibiotics (clarithromycin, telithromycin, rifampicin, rifabutin) \n antifungal medicines (ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole) \n anticonvulsant medicines (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital). \n \n\n Tell your doctor if you (or your child) are taking any of these medicines. This will allow your \ndoctor to prescribe the right dose of CELSENTRI.  \n\n \nPregnancy \n\nIf you are pregnant, if you become pregnant, or if you are planning to have a baby: \n\n Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking CELSENTRI.  \n \n\nBreast-feeding \nWomen who are HIV-positive must not breast-feed, because HIV infection can be passed on to \nthe baby in breast milk.  \n\nIt is not known whether the ingredients in CELSENTRI can also pass into breast milk. If you are \nbreast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding: \n\n Talk to your doctor immediately. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nCELSENTRI can make you dizzy. \n\n Don’t drive, cycle, or operate tools or machines unless you are sure you’re not affected. \n \n \n3. How to take CELSENTRI  \n \nAlways take or give this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nYour doctor will advise you whether it is better to take CELSENTRI oral solution, if you (or your \nchild) are unable to swallow tablets. \n \nHow much to take \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose of CELSENTRI is either 150 mg (7.5 ml), 300 mg (15 ml) or 600 mg \n(30 ml) twice daily, depending on other medicines that you are taking at the same time. Always \ntake the dose recommended by your doctor. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n105 \n \n\n \nPeople with kidney problems \nIf you have a kidney problem, your doctor may alter your dose.  \n\n Talk to your doctor if this applies to you. \n \n\nAdolescents and children from 2 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg \nYour doctor will decide the correct dose of CELSENTRI, based on weight and on other medicines \nbeing taken at the same time.  \n\nSee the diagram and instructions at the end of this section for how to measure and take (or \ngive) a dose of medicine. \n \nCELSENTRI can be taken with or without food. CELSENTRI should always be taken by \nmouth.  \n \nCELSENTRI must be taken in combination with other medicines to treat HIV. Refer to the \nPackage Leaflets of these other medicines for guidance on how to take them.  \n \nIf you take or give more CELSENTRI than you should \n \nIf you accidentally take or give too much CELSENTRI: \n\n Contact your doctor or the nearest hospital immediately.  \n \nIf you forget to take or give CELSENTRI \n \nIf you (or your child) miss a dose of CELSENTRI, take or give the missed dose as soon as possible \nand then continue with the next dose at its regular time. \n\nIf it is almost time for the next dose, do not take or give the missed dose. Wait for the next dose at \nits regular time. \n\nDo not take or give a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you or your child stop taking CELSENTRI \n \nKeep taking CELSENTRI until your doctor tells you to stop.  \n\nTaking your medicines at the right time every day is important as it makes sure the HIV infection \ndoes not increase in your body. Therefore, unless your doctor tells you (or your child) to stop \ntreatment, it is important to keep taking CELSENTRI correctly, as described above.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or your pharmacist. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n106 \n \n\nHow to measure the dose and take the medicine \n\n \n \nUse the oral applicator supplied with the pack to measure your dose accurately.  \n\n1. Remove the bottle cap (A). Keep it safely \n\n2. Hold the bottle firmly. Push the plastic adapter (B) into the neck of the bottle so it is fully \ninserted.  \n\n3. Insert the applicator (C) firmly into the adapter. \n\n4.  Turn the bottle upside down. \n\n5. Pull out applicator plunger (D) until the applicator contains the first part of the full dose.  \n\n6. Turn the bottle the correct way up. Remove the applicator from the adapter. \n\n7. Put the applicator into your (or your child’s) mouth, placing the tip of the applicator against \nthe inside of the cheek. Slowly push the plunger in, allowing time to swallow. Do not push too \nhard and squirt the liquid into the back of the throat, as that could cause choking.  \n\n8. Repeat steps 3 to 7 in the same way until the whole dose has been taken. For example, if the \ndose is 15 ml, you need one and a half applicator -full of medicine. \n\n9. Remove and wash the applicator thoroughly in clean water once you have finished using it. Let \nit dry completely before you use it again. \n\n10. Close the bottle tightly with the cap, leaving the adaptor in place. \n \nDispose of any unused oral solution 60 days after first opening the bottle. \n \n4.
