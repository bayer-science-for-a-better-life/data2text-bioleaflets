CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with: \n\n\uf0b7 operable node-positive breast cancer \n\uf0b7 operable node-negative breast cancer \n\n \nFor patients with operable node-negative breast cancer, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to \npatients eligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary \ntherapy of early breast cancer (see section 5.1). \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this \ncondition. \n \nTAXOTERE monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have \nincluded an anthracycline or an alkylating agent. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer whose tumours over express HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy \nfor metastatic disease. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy should \nhave included an anthracycline. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nTAXOTERE is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small \ncell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable, \nlocally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously \nreceived chemotherapy for this condition. \n \nProstate cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients \nwith metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. \nTAXOTERE in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), with or without prednisone or \nprednisolone, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate \ncancer. \n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of patients \nwith metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, \nwho have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. \n \nHead and neck cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment \nof patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the \nuse of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \nPosology \n \nFor breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral \ncorticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to \ndocetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4).  \nFor metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or \nprednisolone the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours \nand 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). \nFor metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, irrespective of the concurrent use of prednisone or \nprednisolone, the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg 12 hours, 3 hours, \nand 1 hour before docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). \n \nProphylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. \n \nDocetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks. \n \nBreast cancer \nIn the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the recommended \ndose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide \n500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment).  \nFor the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose \nof docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is given in \ncombination therapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2). \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \nIn combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 every three weeks, \nwith trastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started \nthe day following the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered \nimmediately after completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was \nwell tolerated. For trastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nIn combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, \ncombined with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks \nfollowed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, \nsee capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nIn chemotherapy na\u00efve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen \nis docetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment \nafter failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m\u00b2 as a single \nagent. \n \nProstate cancer  \nMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer  \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily \nis administered continuously (see section 5.1). \n \nMetastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Prednisone or \nprednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily may be administered continuously. \n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin \n75 mg/m2, as a 1- to 3-hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 per \nday given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. \nTreatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and \nappropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the \nrisk of haematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). \n \nHead and neck cancer \nPatients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after \ncisplatin administration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological \ntoxicities. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, received \nprophylactic antibiotics. \n \n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) \n\nFor the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head \nand neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion \nfollowed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a \ncontinuous infusion at 750 mg/m2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every \n3 weeks for 4 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) \n\nFor the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low \nprobability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the \nhead and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous \ninfusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute to 3-hour \ninfusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion from day 1 to day 4. \nThis regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.  Following chemotherapy, patients \nshould receive chemoradiotherapy. \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose modifications, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nGeneral  \nDocetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is \uf0b3 1,500 cells/mm3.  \nIn patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3 for more than \none week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel \ntherapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from 75 to \n60 mg/m\u00b2. If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m\u00b2, the treatment should be \ndiscontinued.  \n \nAdjuvant therapy for breast cancer \nPrimary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide (TAC) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Patients who experience febrile \nneutropenia and/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m\u00b2 in all \nsubsequent cycles (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should \nhave their dose decreased to 60 mg/m\u00b2. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin \nFor patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose \nnadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who \nexperience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel \ndose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2. For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the \ncorresponding summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with capecitabine \n\uf0b7 For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n\uf0b7 For patients developing the first appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the \n\nnext docetaxel/capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and resume at \n100% of the original dose. \n\n\uf0b7 For patients developing the second appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of \nGrade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1 \nand then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/m\u00b2. \n\n\uf0b7 For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the docetaxel \ndose. \n\n \nFor trastuzumab dose modifications, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nIf an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite \nG-CSF use, the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. If subsequent episodes of \ncomplicated neutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m2. In case of \nGrade 4 thrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. Patients should \nnot be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level \n> 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. Discontinue treatment if these \ntoxicities persist see section 4.4). \nRecommended dose modifications for toxicities in patients treated with docetaxel in combination with \ncisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nToxicity Dose adjustment \nDiarrhoea grade 3  First episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%. \n\nSecond episode: then reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\nDiarrhoea grade 4 First episode: reduce docetaxel and 5-FU doses by 20%. \n\nSecond episode: discontinue treatment.\nStomatitis/mucositis \ngrade 3  \n\nFirst episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%. \nSecond episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. \nThird episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\n\nStomatitis/mucositis \ngrade 4 \n\nFirst episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. \nSecond episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose adjustments, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nIn the pivotal SCCHN studies patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide \nprophylactic coverage (eg, day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles. \n \nSpecial populations: \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nBased on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent, patients who have both \nelevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal \nrange (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of \ndocetaxel is 75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin > ULN and/or \nALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase > 6 times the ULN, no \ndose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated.  \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of TAXOTERE in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 1 month to less \nthan 18 years have not yet been established. \nThere is no relevant use of TAXOTERE in the paediatric population in the indications breast cancer, \nnon-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not including \ntype II and III less differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma.  \n \nOlder people \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the older \npeople. \nIn combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of \ncapecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \nMethod of administration \nFor instructions on preparation and administration of the product, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with baseline neutrophil count of < 1,500 cells/mm3. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with severe liver impairment since there is no data available \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nContraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as \ndexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel \nadministration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well \nas the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral \ndexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). \n \nHaematology \n \nNeutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median \nof 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of \ncomplete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be \nretreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level \uf0b3 1,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). \n \nIn the case of severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of \ndocetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate \nsymptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile \nneutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic \nG-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of \ncomplicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). \nPatients receiving TCF should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), \nfebrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received \nprimary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive \nadjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile \nneutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be \nclosely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nGastrointestinal reactions \n\n \nCaution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing \ngastrointestinal complications. Although majority of cases occurred during the first or second cycle of \ndocetaxel containing regimen, enterocolitis could develop at any time, and could lead to death as early \nas on the first day of onset. Patients should be closely monitored for early manifestations of serious \ngastrointestinal toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.4 Haematology, and 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nPatients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and \nsecond infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation \nof the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should \nbe available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised \ncutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe \nhypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of \ndocetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions \nshould not be re-challenged with docetaxel. Patients who have previously experienced a \nhypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may be at risk to develop hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nincluding more severe hypersensitivity reaction. These patients should be closely monitored during \ninitiation of docetaxel therapy. \n \nCutaneous reactions \n \nLocalised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema \nfollowed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by \ndesquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see \nsection 4.2). \n\nSevere Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic \nEpidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) have been \nreported with docetaxel treatment. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of \nserious skin manifestations and closely monitored. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions \nappear discontinuation of docetaxel should be considered. \n\n \nFluid retention \n \nPatients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be \nmonitored closely. \n \nRespiratory disorders \n \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, \npulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure have been reported and may be associated with fatal \noutcome. Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant \nradiotherapy. \nIf new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly \ninvestigated, and appropriately treated. Interruption of docetaxel therapy is recommended until \ndiagnosis is available. Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition. The \nbenefit of resuming docetaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. \n \nPatients with liver impairment \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels \n(ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels \ngreater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as \ntoxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, \ninfections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel \nin those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at \nbaseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). \nFor patients with serum bilirubin levels > ULN and/or ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN concurrent \nwith serum alkaline phosphatase levels > 6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended \nand docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nThere are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nNervous system \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). \n \nCardiac toxicity \n \nHeart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, \nparticularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may \nbe moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). \n \nWhen patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they \nshould undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during \ntreatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For \nmore details see summary of product characteristics of trastuzumab. \n \nVentricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (sometimes fatal) has been reported in \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and/ or \ncyclophosphamide (see section 4.8).  \nBaseline cardiac assessment is recommended.   \n \nEye disorders \n \nCystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with \nimpaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examination. In case CMO is \ndiagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated (see section \n4.8). \n \nSecond primary malignancies \n \nSecond primary malignancies have been reported when docetaxel was given in combination with \nanticancer treatments known to be associated with second primary malignancies. Second primary \nmalignancies (including acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin \nlymphoma) may occur several months or years after docetaxel-containing therapy. Patients should be \nmonitored for second primary malignancies (see section 4.8). \n \nTumour Lysis Syndrome \n \nTumour lysis syndrome has been reported with docetaxel after the first or the second cycle (see section \n4.8). Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome (e.g. with renal impairment, hyperuricemia, bulky \ntumour, rapid progression) should be closely monitored. Correction of dehydration and treatment of \nhigh uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of treatment. \n \nOthers \n \nContraceptive measures must be taken by both men and women during treatment and for men at least \n6 months after cessation of therapy (see section 4.6). \n \nThe concomitant use of docetaxel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nclarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and \nvoriconazole) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nAdditional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \n \nComplicated neutropenia \nFor patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or \ninfection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). \n \nGastrointestinal reactions \nSymptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, \nmay be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated \npromptly. \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) \nPatients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the \nfollow up period. In patients treated with the TAC regimen for node positive breast cancer, the risk of \nCHF has been shown to be higher during the first year after treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).  \n \nPatients with 4+ nodes \nAs the benefit observed in patient with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on disease-free \nsurvival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ \nnodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis (see section 5.1). \n \n \n \nElderly \n \nCautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \nThere are limited data available in patients > 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with \ndoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n \nCautions for use in castration-resistant prostate cancer \nOf the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study (TAX 327), \n209 patients were 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients \ntreated with docetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate \n\uf0b3 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The \nincidence of related fever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates \uf0b3 10% higher \nin patients who were 75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years. \n \nCautions for use in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer \nOf the 545 patients treated with docetaxel every 3 weeks in a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer study \n(STAMPEDE), 296 patients were 65 years of age or older, and 48 patients were 75 years of age or \nolder. More patients aged \u226565 years in the docetaxel arm reported hypersensitivity reaction, \nneutropenia, anaemia, fluid retention, dyspnea, and nail changes when compared to the patients aged \nless than 65 years. None of these increases in frequency reached 10% difference with the control arm. \nIn patients who were 75 years of age or older, when compared to younger patients, neutropenia, \nanaemia, diarrhea, dyspnea and upper respiratory tract infection were reported with a greater incidence \n(at least 10% higher).  \n \nCautions for use in gastric adenocarcinoma cancer \nAmong the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer \nstudy, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of \nserious adverse events was higher in older people compared to younger patients. The incidence of the \nfollowing adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection occurred at rates \n\uf0b3 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients.  \nOlder people treated with TCF should be closely monitored. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains 13 % (w/w) ethanol 95% v/v (alcohol), i.e. up to 252 mg ethanol 95% \nv/v per solvent vial, equivalent to 6 ml of beer or 2.6 ml wine. \n \nHarmful for those suffering from alcoholism.  \nTo be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, in children and in high-risk groups \nsuch as patients with liver disease, or epilepsy. \n \nConsideration should be given to possible effects on the central nervous system. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other medicinal products. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant \nadministration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the \nenzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, ketoconazole and erythromycin. As \na result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal products as \nconcomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. \n \nIn case of combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the occurrence of docetaxel adverse reactions may \nincrease, as a result of reduced metabolism. If the concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., \nketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, \ntelithromycin and voriconazole) cannot be avoided, a close clinical surveillance is warranted and a \ndose-adjustment of docetaxel may be suitable during the treatment with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor \n(see section 4.4). In a pharmacokinetic study with 7 patients, the co-administration of docetaxel with \nthe strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole leads to a significant decrease in docetaxel clearance by \n49%. \nDocetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic \nprostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. \nNo statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \nDocetaxel is highly protein bound (> 95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with \nconcomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions \nwith tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, \nphenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of \ndocetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not \ninfluence the binding of digitoxin. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their \nco-administration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction \nbetween docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was \nabout 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be \nboth embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats, and to reduce fertility in rats. As with other \ncytotoxic medicinal products, docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant \nwomen. Therefore, docetaxel must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated. \nWomen of childbearing age receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant, and to \ninform the treating physician immediately should this occur. \n \nBreast-feeding \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \nDocetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. \nConsequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be \ndiscontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nAn effective method of contraception should be used during treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nIn non clinical studies, docetaxel has genotoxic effects and may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). \nTherefore, men being treated with docetaxel are advised not to father a child during and up to \n6 months after treatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The amount of \nalcohol in this medicinal product and the side effects of the product may impair the ability to drive or \nuse machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Therefore, patients should be warned of the potential impact \nof the amount of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal product on the ability to drive or use \nmachines, and be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience these side effects during \ntreatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile for all indications \n \nThe adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel \nhave been obtained in:  \n\n\uf0b7 1312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/m\u00b2 and 75 mg/m\u00b2 of docetaxel as a single agent \nrespectively. \n\n\uf0b7 258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin.  \n\uf0b7 406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin.  \n\uf0b7 92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab.  \n\uf0b7 255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. \n\uf0b7 332 patients (TAX327) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or \n\nprednisolone (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\uf0b7 1276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received \n\ndocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important \ntreatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\uf0b7 300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and \n79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and \n5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\uf0b7 174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with \ncisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are \npresented). \n\n\uf0b7 545 patients (STAMPEDE study) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or \nprednisolone and ADT. \n\n \nThese reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; \ngrade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4), the COSTART and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available \ndata). \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was \nreversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe \nneutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea \nand asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in \ncombination with other chemotherapeutic agents. \n \nFor combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in \u2265 10% are displayed. There \nwas an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the \ntrastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. \n \nFor combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects (\u2265 5%) \nreported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see \ncapecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \nFor combination with ADT and with prednisone or prednisolone (STAMPEDE study), adverse events \noccurring over the 6 cycles of treatment with docetaxel and having at least 2% higher incidence in the \ndocetaxel treatment arm by comparison to the control arm, are presented, using the CTCAE grading \nscale. \n \nThe following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel: \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the \ninfusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms \nwere flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills.  \nSevere reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized \nrash/erythema (see section 4.4). \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paresthesia, dysesthesia or pain \nincluding burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nReversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to \nmoderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and \nhands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently \nassociated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. \nLess frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to \ninterruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe \nnail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis.   \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nInfusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, \nredness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein. \nFluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, \npericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The peripheral oedema usually starts at the lower \nextremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of 3 kg or more. Fluid retention is \ncumulative in incidence and severity (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions in breast cancer for TAXOTERE 100 mg/m\u00b2 single agent \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions \n \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nInfections (G3/4: 5.7%; \nincluding sepsis and \npneumonia, fatal in \n1.7%)  \n\nInfection associated \nwith G4 neutropenia \n(G3/4: 4.6%) \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nNeutropenia (G4: \n76.4%);  \nAnaemia (G3/4: 8.9%); \nFebrile neutropenia\n\nThrombocytopenia (G4: \n0.2%) \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nHypersensitivity (G3/4: \n5.3%) \n\n  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nAnorexia   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nPeripheral sensory \nneuropathy (G3: 4.1%); \nPeripheral motor \nneuropathy (G3/4: 4%); \nDysgeusia (severe: \n0.07%) \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders  Arrhythmia (G3/4: \n0.7%)\n\nCardiac failure \n\nVascular disorders  Hypotension; \nHypertension; \nHaemorrhage\n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDyspnoea (severe: \n2.7%) \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nStomatitis (G3/4: \n5.3%);  \nDiarrhoea (G3/4: 4%);  \nNausea (G3/4: 4%);  \nVomiting (G3/4: 3%) \n\nConstipation (severe: \n0.2%);  \nAbdominal pain \n(severe: 1%);  \nGastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage (severe: \n0.3%)\n\nOesophagitis (severe: \n0.4%) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nAlopecia;  \nSkin reaction (G3/4: \n5.9%);  \nNail disorders (severe: \n2.6%) \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nMyalgia (severe: 1.4%) Arthralgia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nFluid retention (severe: \n6.5%); \nAsthenia (severe: \n11.2%);  \nPain \n\nInfusion site reaction;  \nNon-cardiac chest pain \n(severe: 0.4%) \n\n \n\nInvestigations  G3/4 Blood bilirubin \nincreased (< 5%); \nG3/4 Blood alkaline \nphosphatase increased \n(< 4%); \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions \n \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nG3/4 AST increased \n(< 3%); \nG3/4 ALT increased \n(< 2%)\n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for TAXOTERE 100 mg/m2 single agent \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nRare: bleeding episodes associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. \n \nNervous system disorders \nReversibility data are available among 35.3% of patients who developed neurotoxicity following \ndocetaxel treatment at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent.

Tumour lysis syndrome, potentially fatal, has been reported (frequency not known). \n \n\nMusculoskeletal disorder \nMyositis has been reported with docetaxel (frequency not known). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of \noverdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In \ncases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated \ncomplications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and \nmucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. \nOther appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Taxanes, ATC Code: L01CD 02 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nMechanism of action \n \nDocetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable \nmicrotubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The \nbinding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for \nvital mitotic and interphase cellular functions.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDocetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and \nagainst freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular \nconcentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some \nbut not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance \ngene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental anti-tumour \nactivity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nBreast cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy \n \nPatients with operable node-positive breast cancer (TAX 316) \n \nData from a multi-centre open label randomised study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS \uf0b3 80%, between 18 and \n70 years of age. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 4+), \n1491 patients were randomised to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after \ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 \nfollowed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC arm). Both regimens \nwere administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, \nall other medicinal products were given as intravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as \nsecondary prophylaxis to patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, \nprolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on the TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with \nciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In \nboth arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive eostrogen and/or progesterone \nreceptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed \naccording to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who \nreceived TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. Two interim analyses and one final analysis \nwere performed. The first interim analysis was planned 3 years after the date when half of study \nenrolment was done. The second interim analysis was done after 400 DFS events had been recorded \noverall, which led to a median follow-up of 55 months. The final analysis was performed when all \npatients had reached their 10-year follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-\nup before). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) \nwas the secondary efficacy endpoint. \n \nA final analysis was performed with an actual median follow up of 96 months. Significantly longer \ndisease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of \nrelapses at 10 years was reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC \n(39% versus 45%, respectively) i.e. an absolute risk reduction by 6% (p = 0.0043). Overall survival at \n10 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (76% versus 69%, respectively) \ni.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death by 7% (p = 0.002). As the benefit observed in patients \nwith 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on DFS and OS, the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC \nin patients with 4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\nOverall, the study results demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC. \n \nTAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were \nanalysed: \n \n\n  Disease free survival Overall survival \nPatient subset Number \n\nof \npatients \n\nHazard \nratio* \n\n95% CI p = Hazard \nratio* \n\n95% CI p = \n\nNo of positive \nnodes \n\n       \n\nOverall 745 0.80 0.68-0.93 0.0043 0.74 0.61-0.90 0.0020 \n1-3 467 0.72 0.58-0.91 0.0047 0.62 0.46-0.82 0.0008 \n4+ 278 0.87 0.70-1.09 0.2290 0.87 0.67-1.12 0.2746 \n\n*a hazard ratio of less than 1 indicates that TAC is associated with a longer disease-free survival and \noverall survival compared to FAC \n  \nPatients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy (GEICAM 9805)  \n \nData from a multi-centre open label randomised trial support the use of TAXOTERE for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy.  \n1060 patients were randomised to receive either TAXOTERE 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after \ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in TAC arm), or doxorubicin \n50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (521 patients in \nFAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node-negative breast cancer patients with high risk of \nrelapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour size >2 cm and/or negative ER and PR and/or \nhigh histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age <35 years). Both regimens were administered \nonce every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. TAXOTERE was administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other \nmedicinal products were given intraveinously on day 1 every three weeks. Primary prophylactic \nG-CSF was made mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients were randomised. The incidence of \nGrade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection was decreased in patients who \nreceived primary G-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, after the last cycle of \nchemotherapy, patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 20 mg once a day for up to \n5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was administered according to guidelines in place at participating \ninstitutions and was given to 57.3% of patients who received TAC and 51.2% of patients who received \nFAC. \n \nOne primary analysis and one updated analysis were performed. The primary analysis was done when \nall patients had a follow-up of greater than 5 years (median follow-up time of 77 months). The updated \nanalysis was performed when all patients had reached their 10-year (median follow up time of 10 \nyears and 5 months) follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-up \npreviously). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) \nwas the secondary efficacy endpoint. \n \nAt the median follow-up time of 77 months, significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm \ncompared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of \nrelapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). At the \nmedian follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 16,5% reduction in the \nrisk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI (0.65-1.08), \np=0.1646). DFS data were not statistically significant but were still associated with a positive trend in \nfavour of TAC. \n \nAt the median follow-up time of 77 months, overall survival (OS) was longer in the TAC arm with \nTAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard \nratio = 0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29). However, the distribution of OS was not significantly \ndifferent between the 2 groups. \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nAt the median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 9% reduction in \nthe risk of death compared to FAC-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% CI (0.63-1.32)).  \nThe survival rate was 93.7% in the TAC arm and 91.4 % in the FAC arm, at the 8-year follow-up time \npoint, and 91.3 % in the TAC arm and 89 % in the FAC arm, at the 10-year follow-up time point. \n \nThe positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC remained unchanged.   \n \nTAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were analysed \nin the primary analysis (at the median follow-up time of 77 months) (see table below): \n \nSubset Analyses-Adjuvant Therapy in Patients with Node-negative Breast Cancer Study  \n(Intent-to-Treat Analysis) \n\n \n  Disease Free Survival \nPatient subset Number of patients \n\nin TAC group \nHazard ratio* 95% CI \n\nOverall 539 0.68 0.49-0.93 \nAge category 1   \n<50 years 260 0.67 0.43-1.05 \n\u226550 years 279 0.67 0.43-1.05 \nAge category 2   \n<35 years 42 0.31 0.11-0.89 \n\u226535 years 497 0.73 0.52-1.01 \nHormonal receptor \nstatus \n\n   \n\nNegative 195 0.7 0.45-1.1 \nPositive 344 0.62 0.4-0.97 \nTumour size    \n\uf0a32 cm 285 0.69 0.43-1.1 \n>2 cm 254 0.68 0.45-1.04 \nHistological grade   \nGrade1 (includes grade \nnot assessed) \n\n64 0.79 0.24-2.6 \n\nGrade 2 216 0.77 0.46-1.3 \nGrade 3 259 0.59 0.39-0.9 \nMenopausal status   \nPre-Menopausal 285 0.64 0.40-1 \nPost-Menopausal 254 0.72 0.47-1.12 \n*a hazard ratio (TAC/FAC) of less than 1 indicates that TAC is associated with a longer disease free survival \ncompared to FAC. \n \nExploratory subgroup analyses for disease-free survival for patients who meet the 2009 St. Gallen \nchemotherapy criteria \u2013 (ITT population) were performed and presented here below: \n \n  \n\nTAC \n \n\nFAC \nHazard ratio \n(TAC/FAC) \n\n \n \n\nSubgroups (n=539) (n=521) (95% CI) p-value\n \nMeeting relative indication \nfor chemotherapy a \n\n    \n\n \nNo \n\n \n18/214 \n(8.4%)\n\n \n26/227 \n(11.5%)\n\n \n0.796 (0.434 - 1.459) \n\n \n0.4593 \n\n \nYes \n\n \n48/325 \n(14.8%)\n\n \n69/294 \n(23.5%)\n\n \n0.606 (0.42 - 0.877) \n\n \n0.0072 \n\nTAC = docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nFAC = 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \nCI = confidence interval; ER = eostrogen receptor \nPR = progesterone receptor \na ER/PR-negative or Grade 3 or tumour size >5 cm \n \nThe estimated hazard ratio was using Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as the \nfactor. \n \nTAXOTERE as single agent \n \nTwo randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or \n392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the \nrecommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks. \n \nIn alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). \nWithout affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p = 0.38) or \ntime to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p = 0.54), docetaxel increased \nresponse rate (52% vs. 37%, p = 0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, \np = 0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas \n15 doxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart \nfailure). \n \nIn anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and \nvinblastine (12 mg/m\u00b2 every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate \n(33% vs. 12%, p < 0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p = 0.0004) and \nprolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p = 0.01). \n \nDuring these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety profile \nobserved in phase II studies (see section 4.8). \n \nAn open-label, multi-centre, randomised phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel \nmonotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous \ntherapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomised to receive \neither docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m\u00b2 as a 3 hour \ninfusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. \nWithout affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p = 0.10), docetaxel \nprolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p < 0.01) and median survival \n(15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p = 0.03). \nMore grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to \npaclitaxel (23.0%). \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin \n \nOne large randomised phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic \ndisease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m\u00b2) \n(AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m\u00b2) (AC \narm). Both regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks. \n \n\uf0b7 Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.0138. \nThe median TTP was 37.3 weeks (95% CI: 33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95% CI: \n27.4 - 36.0) in AC arm. \n\uf0b7 Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.009. \nThe ORR was 59.3% (95% CI: 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95% CI: 39.8 - 53.2) in AC arm. \n \nIn this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile \nneutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia \n(8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\nhigher incidence of severe anaemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher \nincidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF \ndecrease \uf0b3 20% (13.1% versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease \uf0b3 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic \ndeaths occurred in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm (1 \ndue to septic shock and 3 due to congestive heart failure). \nIn both arms, quality of life measured by the EORTC questionnaire was comparable and stable during \ntreatment and follow-up. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with trastuzumab \n \nDocetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer whose tumours over express HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy \nfor metastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomised to receive docetaxel \n(100 mg/m2) with or without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant \nchemotherapy. Docetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had \nreceived prior adjuvant anthracyclines. The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in \nthis pivotal study was immunohistochemistry (IHC). A minority of patients were tested using \nfluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, 87% of patients had disease that was IHC 3+, \nand 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive.

In this \nstudy, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous \ninfusion every 3 weeks) and capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week \nrest period). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m2 as a 1 hour \nintravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine \ncombination arm (p = 0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days \n(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator \nassessment) were 41.6% (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to \nprogressive disease was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p < 0.0001). The \nmedian time to progression was 186 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nPatients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy \n \nIn a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) \nand overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to Best Supportive \nCare. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). \nThere was less use of morphinic analgesic (p < 0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p < 0.01), other \ndisease-related medications (p = 0.06) and radiotherapy (p < 0.01) in patients treated with docetaxel at \n75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to those with BSC. \nThe overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was \n26.1 weeks. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients \n \nIn a phase III study, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or \ngreater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either \ndocetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/m2 over \n30-60 minutes every 3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with \ncarboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ml.min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2 \nadministered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on \nday 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks (VCis). \n \nSurvival data, median time to progression and response rates for two arms of the study are illustrated \nin the following table: \n \n\n TCis \nn = 408\n\nVCis \nn = 404\n\nStatistical analysis \n\nOverall survival  \n(Primary end-point):\n\n   \n\nMedian survival (months) 11.3 10.1 Hazard ratio: 1.122 \n[97.2% CI: 0.937; 1.342]*\n\n1-year Survival (%) 46 41 Treatment difference: 5.4% \n[95% CI: -1.1; 12.0] \n\n2-year Survival (%) 21 14 Treatment difference: 6.2% \n[95% CI: 0.2; 12.3] \n\nMedian time to progression \n(weeks): \n\n \n22.0 \n\n \n23.0 \n\n \nHazard ratio: 1.032 \n\n[95% CI: 0.876; 1.216] \nOverall response rate (%): 31.6 24.5 Treatment difference: 7.1% \n\n[95% CI: 0.7; 13.5] \n*: Corrected for multiple comparisons and adjusted for stratification factors (stage of disease and \nregion of treatment), based on evaluable patient population. \n\n \nSecondary end-points included change of pain, global rating of quality of life by EuroQoL-5D, Lung \nCancer Symptom Scale, and changes in Karnosfky performance status.

A total of 445 patients with KPS > 70 were treated with either docetaxel (T) \n(75 mg/m2 on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) \n(750 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per \nday for 5 days). The length of a treatment cycle was 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF \narm. The median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 (with a range of 1-16) for the TCF \narm compared to 4 (with a range of 1-12) for the CF arm. Time to progression (TTP) was the primary \nendpoint. The risk reduction of progression was 32.1% and was associated with a significantly longer \nTTP (p = 0.0004) in favour of the TCF arm.

In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, \nand WHO performance status 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two treatment arms.  Patients on the \ndocetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m2 followed by \n5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m2 per day as a continuous infusion for 5 days. This regimen was \nadministered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response (\u2265 25% reduction in \nbidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with \na minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not \nprogress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (TPF/RT). \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\nPatients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) \n1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case \nat least a minor response (\u2265 25% reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed \nafter 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval \nof 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to \ninstitutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either \nwith a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to \n70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum \ninterfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of 70 Gy was recommended for accelerated \nregimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical resection was allowed following \nchemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm received antibiotic prophylaxis \nwith ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. \nThe primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was significantly longer in the \nTPF arm compared to the PF arm, p = 0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4 vs. 8.3 months respectively) with an \noverall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall survival was also significantly longer in \nfavour of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median OS: 18.6 vs. 14.5 months respectively) with a \n28% risk reduction of mortality, p = 0.0128.

In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and \na WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two arms. The study population \ncomprised patients with technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure \nand patients aiming at organ preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival \nendpoints and the success of organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel \narm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m\u00b2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) \n100 mg/m\u00b2 administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous \nintravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles were \nrepeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to receive \nchemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT). Patients on the comparator arm received \ncisplatin (P) 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by the \ncontinuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 5. The cycles \nwere repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to \nreceive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT). \nPatients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy \nwith a minimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to \nday 56 of last cycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour \nintravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses. Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment \nusing once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of \n70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at any time \nfollowing completion of CRT. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the study received \nprophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, overall survival (OS) was \nsignificantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxel-containing regimen compared to PF \n(median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk reduction in mortality compared \nto PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) with an overall median \nfollow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% risk reduction of \nprogression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF and 13.1 for \nPF). This was also statistically significant with an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; log-rank test \np = 0.004.

The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent \nwith a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half-lives for the \uf061, \uf062 and \uf067 phases of 4 min, \n36 min and 11.1 h, respectively. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel \nfrom the peripheral compartment.  \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one-hour infusion a mean peak plasma \nlevel of 3.7 \u00b5g/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h.\u00b5g/ml. Mean values for total body \nclearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter \nindividual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% \nbound to plasma proteins. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\nElimination \n \nA study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in \nboth the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl \nester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of \nthe administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is \nexcreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites \nand very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge and gender \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. \nPharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I \nstudies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a small number of patients (n = 23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver \nfunction impairment (ALT, AST \uf0b3 1.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase \uf0b3\n 2.5 times the ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2).  \n \nFluid retention \nDocetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are \nno data available in patients with severe fluid retention. \n \nCombination therapy \n \nDoxorubicin \nWhen used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma \nlevels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin \nand cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their coadministration. \n \nCapecitabine \nPhase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa \nshowed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no effect \nby docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5\u2019-DFUR. \n \nCisplatin \nClearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following \nmonotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is \nsimilar to that observed with cisplatin alone. \n \nCisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nThe combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid \ntumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product. \n \nPrednisone and dexamethasone \nThe effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard \ndexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients.  \n \nPrednisone \nNo effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\nDocetaxel has been shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro micronucleus and chromosome aberration \ntest in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. However, it did not induce \nmutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. These results are consistent \nwith the pharmacological activity of docetaxel. \n \nUndesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair \nmale fertility. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nConcentrate vial:  \nPolysorbate 80 \nCitric acid. \n \nSolvent vial:  \nEthanol 95%  \nWater for injections. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf-life \n \n\uf0b7 2 years. \n\uf0b7 Premix solution: The premix solution contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used \n\nimmediately after preparation. However the chemical and physical stability of the premix solution \nhas been demonstrated for 8 hours when stored either between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C or at room \ntemperature (below 25\u00b0C). \n\n\uf0b7 Infusion solution: the infusion solution should be used within 4 hours at room temperature (below \n25\u00b0C). \n\n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nDo not store above 25\u00b0C or below 2\u00b0C.  \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \nFor storage conditions of the diluted medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nEach blister pack contains: \n\uf0b7 one single-dose vial of concentrate and, \n\uf0b7 one single-dose vial of solvent. \n \nTAXOTERE 20 mg/0.5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion vial \n \n7 ml clear glass Type I vial with a green flip-off cap. \n \nThis vial contains 0.5 ml of a 40 mg/ml solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 (fill volume: \n24.4 mg/0.61 ml). This fill volume has been established during the development of TAXOTERE to \ncompensate for liquid loss during preparation of the premix due to foaming, adhesion to the walls of \nthe vial and \"dead-volume\". This overfill ensures that after dilution with the entire contents of the \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\naccompanying solvent for TAXOTERE vial, there is a minimal extractable premix volume of 2 ml \ncontaining 10 mg/ml docetaxel which corresponds to the labelled amount of 20 mg/0.5 ml per vial. \n \nSolvent vial \n \n7 ml clear glass Type I vial with a transparent colourless flip-off cap. \n \nSolvent vial contains 1.5 ml of a 13% w/w solution of ethanol 95% in water for injections (fill volume: \n1.98 ml). The addition of the entire contents of the solvent vial to the contents of the TAXOTERE 20 \nmg/0.5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion vial ensures a premix concentration of 10 mg/ml \ndocetaxel. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nTAXOTERE is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should \nbe exercised when handling it and preparing TAXOTERE solutions. The use of gloves is \nrecommended. \n \nIf TAXOTERE concentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, \nwash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If TAXOTERE concentrate, premix solution \nor infusion solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and \nthoroughly with water. \n \nPreparation for the intravenous administration \n \na) Preparation of the TAXOTERE premix solution (10 mg docetaxel/ml) \n \nIf the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of TAXOTERE boxes to stand at \nroom temperature (below 25\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. \n \nUsing a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw the entire contents of the solvent for \nTAXOTERE vial by partially inverting the vial.  \n \nInject the entire contents of the syringe into the corresponding TAXOTERE vial. \n \nRemove the syringe and needle and mix manually by repeated inversions for at least 45 seconds. Do \nnot shake. \n \nAllow the premix vial to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and then check that \nthe solution is homogenous and clear (foaming is normal even after 5 minutes due to the presence of \npolysorbate 80 in the formulation).  \n \nThe premix solution contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used immediately after preparation. \nHowever the chemical and physical stability of the premix solution has been demonstrated for 8 hours \nwhen stored either between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C or at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C). \n \nb) Preparation of the infusion solution \n \nMore than one premix vial may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. Based on the \nrequired dose for the patient expressed in mg, aseptically withdraw the corresponding premix volume \ncontaining 10 mg/ml docetaxel from the appropriate number of premix vials using graduated syringes \nfitted with a needle. For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require 14 ml docetaxel premix \nsolution. \n \nInject the required premix volume into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing either 5% glucose \nsolution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\nIf a dose greater than 200 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so \nthat a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n \nMix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n \nThe TAXOTERE infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be aseptically \nadministered as a 1-hour infusion under room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and normal lighting \nconditions. \n \nAs with all parenteral products, TAXOTERE premix solution and infusion solution should be visually \ninspected prior to use, solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with: \n\n\uf0b7 operable node-positive breast cancer \n\uf0b7 operable node-negative breast cancer \n\n \nFor patients with operable node-negative breast cancer, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to \npatients eligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary \ntherapy of early breast cancer (see section 5.1).  \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this \ncondition. \n \nTAXOTERE monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have \nincluded an anthracycline or an alkylating agent. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer whose tumours over express HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy \nfor metastatic disease. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy should \nhave included an anthracycline. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nTAXOTERE is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small \ncell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable, \nlocally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously \nreceived chemotherapy for this condition. \n \nProstate cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients \nwith  metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), with or without prednisone or \nprednisolone, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate \ncancer. \n \n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of patients \nwith metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, \nwho have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. \n \nHead and neck cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment \nof patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the \nuse of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \nPosology \n \nFor breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral \ncorticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to \ndocetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4). \nFor metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or \nprednisolone the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours \nand 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). \nFor metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, irrespective of the concurrent use of prednisone or \nprednisolone, the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg 12 hours, 3 hours, \nand 1 hour before docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). \n \n \nProphylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. \n \nDocetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks. \n \nBreast cancer \nIn the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the recommended \ndose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide \n500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment).  \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nFor the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose \nof docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is given in \ncombination therapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2). \n \nIn combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 every three weeks, \nwith trastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started \nthe day following the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered \nimmediately after completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was \nwell tolerated. For trastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nIn combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, \ncombined with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks \nfollowed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, \nsee capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nIn chemotherapy na\u00efve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen \nis docetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment \nafter failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m\u00b2 as a single \nagent. \n \nProstate cancer \nMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily \nis administered continuously (see section 5.1). \n \nMetastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Prednisone or \nprednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily may be administered continuously. \n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin \n75 mg/m2, as a 1- to 3-hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 per \nday given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. \nTreatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and \nappropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the \nrisk of haematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). \n \nHead and neck cancer \nPatients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after \ncisplatin administration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological \ntoxicities. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, received \nprophylactic antibiotics. \n \n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) \n\nFor the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head \nand neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion \nfollowed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a \ncontinuous infusion at 750 mg/m2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every \n3 weeks for 4 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) \n\nFor the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low \nprobability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the \nhead and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous \ninfusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute to 3-hour \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\ninfusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion from day 1 to day 4. \nThis regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.  Following chemotherapy, patients \nshould receive chemoradiotherapy. \n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose modifications, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nGeneral  \nDocetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is \uf0b3 1,500 cells/mm3.  \nIn patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3 for more than \none week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel \ntherapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from 75 to \n60 mg/m\u00b2. If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m\u00b2, the treatment should be \ndiscontinued.  \n \nAdjuvant therapy for breast cancer \nPrimary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide (TAC) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Patients who experience febrile \nneutropenia and/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m\u00b2 in all \nsubsequent cycles (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should \nhave their dose decreased to 60 mg/m\u00b2. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin \nFor patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose \nnadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who \nexperience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel \ndose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2. For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the \ncorresponding summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with capecitabine \n\uf0b7 For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n\uf0b7 For patients developing the first appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the \n\nnext docetaxel/capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and resume at \n100% of the original dose. \n\n\uf0b7 For patients developing the second appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of \nGrade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1 \nand then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/m\u00b2. \n\n\uf0b7 For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the docetaxel \ndose. \n\n \nFor trastuzumab dose modifications, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nIf an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite \nG-CSF use, the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. If subsequent episodes of \ncomplicated neutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m2. In case of \nGrade 4 thrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. Patients should \nnot be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level \n> 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. Discontinue treatment if these \ntoxicities persist see section 4.4). \nRecommended dose modifications for toxicities in patients treated with docetaxel in combination with \ncisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): \n \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\nToxicity Dose adjustment \nDiarrhoea grade 3  First episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%. \n\nSecond episode: then reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\nDiarrhoea grade 4 First episode: reduce docetaxel and 5-FU doses by 20%. \n\nSecond episode: discontinue treatment.\nStomatitis/mucositis \ngrade 3  \n\nFirst episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%. \nSecond episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. \nThird episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\n\nStomatitis/mucositis \ngrade 4 \n\nFirst episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. \nSecond episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose adjustments, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nIn the pivotal SCCHN studies patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide \nprophylactic coverage (eg, day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles. \n \nSpecial populations: \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nBased on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent, patients who have both \nelevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal \nrange (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of \ndocetaxel is 75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin > ULN and/or \nALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase > 6 times the ULN, no dose-\nreduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated.  \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of TAXOTERE in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 1 month to less \nthan 18 years have not yet been established. \nThere is no relevant use of TAXOTERE in the paediatric population in the indications breast cancer, \nnon-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not including \ntype II and III less differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma.  \n \nOlder people \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in older \npeople. \nIn combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of \ncapecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \nMethod of administration \nFor instructions on preparation and administration of the product, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with baseline neutrophil count of < 1,500 cells/mm3. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with severe liver impairment since there is no data available \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nContraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as \ndexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel \nadministration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well \nas the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral \ndexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). \n \nHaematology \n \nNeutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median \nof 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of \ncomplete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be \nretreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level \uf0b3 1,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). \n \nIn the case of severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of \ndocetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate \nsymptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile \nneutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic \nG-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of \ncomplicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). \nPatients receiving TCF should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), \nfebrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received \nprimary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive \nadjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile \nneutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be \nclosely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nGastrointestinal reactions \n\n \nCaution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing \ngastrointestinal complications. Although majority of cases occurred during the first or second cycle of \ndocetaxel containing regimen, enterocolitis could develop at any time, and could lead to death as early \nas on the first day of onset. Patients should be closely monitored for early manifestations of serious \ngastrointestinal toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.4 Haematology, and 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nPatients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and \nsecond infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation \nof the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should \nbe available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised \ncutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe \nhypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of \ndocetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions \nshould not be re-challenged with docetaxel. Patients who have previously experienced a \nhypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may be at risk to develop hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\nincluding more severe hypersensitivity reaction. These patients should be closely monitored during \ninitiation of docetaxel therapy. \n \nCutaneous reactions \n \nLocalised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema \nfollowed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by \ndesquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see \nsection 4.2). \n\nSevere Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic \nEpidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) have been \nreported with docetaxel treatment. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of \nserious skin manifestations and closely monitored. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions \nappear discontinuation of docetaxel should be considered. \n\n \nFluid retention \n \nPatients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be \nmonitored closely. \n \nRespiratory disorders \n \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, \npulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure have been reported and may be associated with fatal \noutcome. Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant \nradiotherapy. \nIf new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly \ninvestigated, and appropriately treated. Interruption of docetaxel therapy is recommended until \ndiagnosis is available. Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition. The \nbenefit of resuming docetaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. \n \nPatients with liver impairment \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels \n(ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels \ngreater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as \ntoxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, \ninfections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel \nin those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at \nbaseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). \nFor patients with serum bilirubin levels > ULN and/or ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN concurrent \nwith serum alkaline phosphatase levels > 6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended \nand docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nThere are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\nNervous system \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). \n \nCardiac toxicity \n \nHeart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, \nparticularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may \nbe moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). \n \nWhen patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they \nshould undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during \ntreatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For \nmore details see summary of product characteristics of trastuzumab. \n \nVentricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (sometimes fatal) has been reported in \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and/ or \ncyclophosphamide (see section 4.8).  \nBaseline cardiac assessment is recommended. \n \nEye disorders \n \nCystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with \nimpaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examination. In case CMO is \ndiagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated (see section \n4.8). \n \nSecond primary malignancies \n \nSecond primary malignancies have been reported when docetaxel was given in combination with \nanticancer treatments known to be associated with second primary malignancies. Second primary \nmalignancies (including acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin \nlymphoma) may occur several months or years after docetaxel-containing therapy. Patients should be \nmonitored for second primary malignancies (see section 4.8). \n \nTumour Lysis Syndrome \n \nTumour lysis syndrome has been reported with docetaxel after the first or the second cycle (see section \n4.8). Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome (e.g. with renal impairment, hyperuricemia, bulky \ntumour, rapid progression) should be closely monitored. Correction of dehydration and treatment of \nhigh uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of treatment. \n \n \nOthers \n \nContraceptive measures must be taken by both men and women during treatment and for men at least  \n6 months after cessation of therapy (see section 4.6). \n \nThe concomitant use of docetaxel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nclarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and \nvoriconazole) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\nAdditional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \n \nComplicated neutropenia \nFor patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or \ninfection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). \n \nGastrointestinal reactions \nSymptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, \nmay be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated \npromptly. \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) \nPatients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the \nfollow up period. In patients treated with the TAC regimen for node positive breast cancer, the risk of \nCHF has been shown to be higher during the first year after treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nPatients with 4+ nodes \nAs the benefit observed in patient with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on disease-free \nsurvival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ \nnodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis (see section 5.1). \n \n \n \nElderly \n \nCautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \nThere are limited data available in patients > 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with \ndoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n \nCautions for use in castration-resistant prostate cancerOf the 333 patients treated with docetaxel \nevery three weeks in a prostate cancer study (TAX 327), 209 patients were 65 years of age or greater \nand 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks, the \nincidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate \uf0b3 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age \nor greater compared to younger patients. The incidence of related fever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and \nperipheral oedema occurred at rates \uf0b3 10% higher in patients who were 75 years of age or greater \nversus less than 65 years. \n \nCautions for use in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer \nOf the 545 patients treated with docetaxel every 3 weeks in a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer study \n(STAMPEDE), 296 patients were 65 years of age or older, and 48 patients were 75 years of age or \nolder. More patients aged \u226565 years in the docetaxel arm reported hypersensitivity reaction, \nneutropenia, anaemia, fluid retention, dyspnea, and nail changes when compared to the patients aged \nless than 65 years. None of these increases in frequency reached 10% difference with the control arm. \nIn patients who were 75 years of age or older, when compared to younger patients, neutropenia, \nanaemia, diarrhea, dyspnea and upper respiratory tract infection were reported with a greater incidence \n(at least 10% higher).  \n \n \nCautions for use in gastric adenocarcinoma cancer \nAmong the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer \nstudy, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of \nserious adverse events was higher in older people compared to younger patients. The incidence of the \nfollowing adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection occurred at rates \n\uf0b3 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients.  \nOlder people treated with TCF should be closely monitored. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains 13 % (w/w) ethanol 95% v/v (alcohol), i.e. up to 932 mg ethanol 95% \nv/v per solvent vial, equivalent to 23 ml of beer or 9.5 ml wine. \n \nHarmful for those suffering from alcoholism.  \nTo be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, in children and in high-risk groups \nsuch as patients with liver disease, or epilepsy. \n \nConsideration should be given to possible effects on the central nervous system. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other medicinal products. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant \nadministration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the \nenzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, ketoconazole and erythromycin. As \na result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal products as \nconcomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. \n \nIn case of combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the occurrence of docetaxel adverse reactions may \nincrease, as a result of reduced metabolism. If the concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., \nketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, \ntelithromycin and voriconazole) cannot be avoided, a close clinical surveillance is warranted and a \ndose-adjustment of docetaxel may be suitable during the treatment with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor \n(see section 4.4). In a pharmacokinetic study with 7 patients, the co-administration of docetaxel with \nthe strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole leads to a significant decrease in docetaxel clearance by \n49%. \nDocetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic \nprostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. \nNo statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \nDocetaxel is highly protein bound (> 95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with \nconcomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions \nwith tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, \nphenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of \ndocetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not \ninfluence the binding of digitoxin. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their \nco-administration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction \nbetween docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was \nabout 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be \nboth embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats, and to reduce fertility in rats. As with other \ncytotoxic medicinal products, docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant \nwomen. Therefore, docetaxel must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated. \n \nWomen of childbearing age receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant, and to \ninform the treating physician immediately should this occur. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nDocetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. \nConsequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be \ndiscontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nAn effective method of contraception should be used during treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nIn non clinical studies, docetaxel has genotoxic effects and may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). \nTherefore, men being treated with docetaxel are advised not to father a child during and up to \n6 months after treatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The amount of \nalcohol in this medicinal product and the side effects of the product may impair the ability to drive or \nuse machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Therefore, patients should be warned of the potential impact \nof the amount of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal product on the ability to drive or use \nmachines, and be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience these side effects during \ntreatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile for all indications \n \nThe adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel \nhave been obtained in:  \n\n\uf0b7 1312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/m\u00b2 and 75 mg/m\u00b2 of docetaxel as a single agent \nrespectively. \n\n\uf0b7 258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin.  \n\uf0b7 406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin.  \n\uf0b7 92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab.  \n\uf0b7 255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. \n\uf0b7 332 patients (TAX327) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or \n\nprednisolone (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\uf0b7 1276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received \n\ndocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important \ntreatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\uf0b7 300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and \n79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and \n5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\uf0b7 174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with \ncisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are \npresented). \n\n\uf0b7 545 patients (STAMPEDE study) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or \nprednisolone and ADT. \n\n \nThese reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; \ngrade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4), the COSTART and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available \ndata). \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was \nreversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe \nneutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea \nand asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in \ncombination with other chemotherapeutic agents. \n \nFor combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in \u2265 10% are displayed. There \nwas an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the \ntrastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. \n \nFor combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects (\u2265 5%) \nreported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see \ncapecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \nFor combination with ADT and with prednisone or prednisolone (STAMPEDE study), adverse events \noccurring over the 6 cycles of treatment with docetaxel and having at least 2% higher incidence in the \ndocetaxel treatment arm by comparison to the control arm, are presented, using the CTCAE grading \nscale. \n \nThe following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel: \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the \ninfusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms \nwere flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills.  \nSevere reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized \nrash/erythema (see section 4.4). \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paresthesia, dysesthesia or pain \nincluding burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nReversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to \nmoderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and \nhands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently \nassociated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. \nLess frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to \ninterruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe \nnail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis.   \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nInfusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, \nredness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein. \nFluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, \npericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The peripheral oedema usually starts at the lower \nextremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of 3 kg or more. Fluid retention is \ncumulative in incidence and severity (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions in breast cancer for TAXOTERE 100 mg/m\u00b2 single agent \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions \n \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nInfections (G3/4: 5.7%; \nincluding sepsis and \npneumonia, fatal in \n1.7%)  \n\nInfection associated \nwith G4 neutropenia \n(G3/4: 4.6%) \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nNeutropenia (G4: \n76.4%);  \nAnaemia (G3/4: 8.9%); \nFebrile neutropenia\n\nThrombocytopenia (G4: \n0.2%) \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nHypersensitivity (G3/4: \n5.3%) \n\n  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nAnorexia   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nPeripheral sensory \nneuropathy (G3: 4.1%); \nPeripheral motor \nneuropathy (G3/4: 4%); \nDysgeusia (severe: \n0.07%) \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders  Arrhythmia (G3/4: \n0.7%)\n\nCardiac failure \n\nVascular disorders  Hypotension; \nHypertension; \nHaemorrhage\n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDyspnoea (severe: \n2.7%) \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nStomatitis (G3/4: \n5.3%);  \nDiarrhoea (G3/4: 4%);  \nNausea (G3/4: 4%);  \nVomiting (G3/4: 3%) \n\nConstipation (severe: \n0.2%);  \nAbdominal pain \n(severe: 1%);  \nGastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage (severe: \n0.3%)\n\nOesophagitis (severe: \n0.4%) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nAlopecia;  \nSkin reaction (G3/4: \n5.9%);  \nNail disorders (severe: \n2.6%) \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nMyalgia (severe: 1.4%) Arthralgia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nFluid retention (severe: \n6.5%); \nAsthenia (severe: \n11.2%);  \nPain \n\nInfusion site reaction;  \nNon-cardiac chest pain \n(severe: 0.4%) \n\n \n\nInvestigations  G3/4 Blood bilirubin \nincreased (< 5%); \nG3/4 Blood alkaline \nphosphatase increased \n(< 4%); \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions \n \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nG3/4 AST increased \n(< 3%); \nG3/4 ALT increased \n(< 2%)\n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for TAXOTERE 100 mg/m2 single agent \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nRare: bleeding episodes associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. \n \nNervous system disorders \nReversibility data are available among 35.3% of patients who developed neurotoxicity following \ndocetaxel treatment at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent.

In the docetaxel plus trastuzumab arm, \n64% had received a prior anthracycline as adjuvant therapy compared with 55% in the docetaxel arm \nalone. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Haematological toxicity was increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and \ndocetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone (32% grade 3/4 neutropenia versus 22%, using NCI-CTC \ncriteria). Note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a dose of 100 mg/m2 is \nknown to result in neutropenia in 97% of patients, 76% grade 4, based on nadir blood counts. The \nincidence of febrile neutropenia/neutropenic sepsis was also increased in patients treated with \nHerceptin plus docetaxel (23% versus 17% for patients treated with docetaxel alone). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions in breast cancer for TAXOTERE 75 mg/m\u00b2 in combination with \ncapecitabine \n \nMedDRA system organ classes Very common adverse \n\nreactions \n \n\nCommon adverse reactions \n \n\nInfections and infestations  Oral candidiasis (G3/4: < 1%)\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nNeutropenia (G3/4: 63%);

These reactions sometimes appear during the infusion of the medicinal product. \n \nEye disorders \nVery rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring \nduring infusion of the medicinal product and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been \nreported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of lacrimation with or \nwithout conjunctivitis, as cases of lacrimal duct obstruction resulting in excessive tearing have been \nrarely reported. Cases of cystoid macular oedema (CMO) have been reported in patients treated with \ndocetaxel. \n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n\n \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nRare cases of ototoxicity, hearing impaired and/or hearing loss have been reported. \n \nCardiac disorders \nRare cases of myocardial infarction have been reported. \nVentricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (frequency not known), sometimes fatal, has \nbeen reported in patients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-\nfluorouracil and/ or cyclophosphamide. \n \nVascular disorders \nVenous thromboembolic events have rarely been reported. \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome and cases of interstitial pneumonia/ pneumonitis, interstitial lung \ndisease, pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure sometimes fatal have rarely been reported.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of \noverdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In \ncases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated \ncomplications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and \nmucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. \nOther appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Taxanes, ATC Code: L01CD 02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDocetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable \nmicrotubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The \nbinding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for \nvital mitotic and interphase cellular functions.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDocetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and \nagainst freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular \nconcentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some \nbut not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance \ngene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental anti-tumour \nactivity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nBreast cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy \n \nPatients with operable node-positive breast cancer (TAX 316) \n \nData from a multi-centre open label randomised study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS \uf0b3 80%, between 18 and \n70 years of age. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 4+), \n1491 patients were randomised to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after \ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 \nfollowed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC arm). Both regimens \n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n\nwere administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, \nall other medicinal products were given as intravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as \nsecondary prophylaxis to patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, \nprolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on the TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with \nciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In \nboth arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive eostrogen and/or progesterone \nreceptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed \naccording to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who \nreceived TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. Two interim analyses and one final analysis \nwere performed. The first interim analysis was planned 3 years after the date when half of study \nenrolment was done. The second interim analysis was done after 400 DFS events had been recorded \noverall, which led to a median follow-up of 55 months. The final analysis was performed when all \npatients had reached their 10-year follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-\nup before). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) \nwas the secondary efficacy endpoint. \n \nA final analysis was performed with an actual median follow up of 96 months. Significantly longer \ndisease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of \nrelapses at 10 years was reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC \n(39% versus 45%, respectively) i.e. an absolute risk reduction by 6% (p = 0.0043). Overall survival at \n10 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (76% versus 69%, respectively) \ni.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death by 7% (p = 0.002). As the benefit observed in patients \nwith 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on DFS and OS, the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC \nin patients with 4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis. \n \nOverall, the study results demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC.  \n \nTAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were \nanalysed: \n \n\n  Disease free survival Overall survival \nPatient subset Number \n\nof \npatients \n\nHazard \nratio* \n\n95% CI p = Hazard \nratio* \n\n95% CI p = \n\nNo of positive \nnodes \n\n       \n\nOverall 745 0.80 0.68-0.93 0.0043 0.74 0.61-0.90 0.0020 \n1-3 467 0.72 0.58-0.91 0.0047 0.62 0.46-0.82 0.0008 \n4+ 278 0.87 0.70-1.09 0.2290 0.87 0.67-1.12 0.2746 \n\n*a hazard ratio of less than 1 indicates that TAC is associated with a longer disease-free survival and \noverall survival compared to FAC \n \nPatients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy (GEICAM 9805)  \n \nData from a multi-centre open label randomised trial support the use of TAXOTERE for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy . \n1060 patients were randomised to receive either TAXOTERE 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after \ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in TAC arm), or doxorubicin \n50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (521 patients in \nFAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node-negative breast cancer patients with high risk of \nrelapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour size >2 cm and/or negative ER and PR and/or \nhigh histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age <35 years). Both regimens were administered \nonce every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. TAXOTERE was administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other \nmedicinal products were given as intraveinously on day 1 every three weeks. Primary prophylactic \nG-CSF was made mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients were randomised. The incidence of \nGrade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection was decreased in patients who \nreceived primary G-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, after the last cycle of \n\n\n\n \n\n77 \n\nchemotherapy, patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 20 mg once a day for up to \n5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was administered according to guidelines in place at participating \ninstitutions and was given to 57.3% of patients who received TAC and 51.2% of patients who received \nFAC. \n \nOne primary analysis and one updated analysis were performed. The primary analysis was done when \nall patients had a follow-up of greater than 5 years (median follow-up time of 77 months). The updated \nanalysis was performed when all patients had reached their 10-year (median follow up time of 10 \nyears and 5 months) follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-up \npreviously). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) \nwas the secondary efficacy endpoint. \n \nAt the median follow-up time of 77 months, significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm \ncompared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of \nrelapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). At the \nmedian follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 16,5% reduction in the \nrisk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI (0.65-1.08), \np=0.1646). DFS data were not statistically significant but were still associated with a positive trend in \nfavour of TAC.   \n \n At the median follow-up time of 77 months, overall survival (OS) was longer in the TAC arm with \nTAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard \nratio = 0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29).

Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas \n15 doxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart \nfailure). \n \nIn anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and \nvinblastine (12 mg/m\u00b2 every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate \n(33% vs. 12%, p < 0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p = 0.0004) and \nprolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p = 0.01). \n \nDuring these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety profile \nobserved in phase II studies (see section 4.8). \n \nAn open-label, multi-centre, randomised phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel \nmonotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous \n\n\n\n \n\n79 \n\ntherapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomised to receive \neither docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m\u00b2 as a 3 hour \ninfusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. \nWithout affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p = 0.10), docetaxel \nprolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p < 0.01) and median survival \n(15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p = 0.03). \nMore grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to \npaclitaxel (23.0%). \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin \n \nOne large randomised phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic \ndisease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m\u00b2) \n(AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m\u00b2) (AC \narm). Both regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks. \n \n\uf0b7 Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.0138. \nThe median TTP was 37.3 weeks (95% CI: 33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95% CI: \n27.4 - 36.0) in AC arm. \n\uf0b7 Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.009. \nThe ORR was 59.3% (95% CI: 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95% CI: 39.8 - 53.2) in AC arm. \n \nIn this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile \nneutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia \n(8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a \nhigher incidence of severe anaemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher \nincidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF \ndecrease \uf0b3 20% (13.1% versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease \uf0b3 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic \ndeaths occurred in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm (1 \ndue to septic shock and 3 due to congestive heart failure). \nIn both arms, quality of life measured by the EORTC questionnaire was comparable and stable during \ntreatment and follow-up. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with trastuzumab \n \nDocetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer whose tumours over express HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy \nfor metastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomised to receive docetaxel \n(100 mg/m2) with or without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant \nchemotherapy. Docetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had \nreceived prior adjuvant anthracyclines. The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in \nthis pivotal study was immunohistochemistry (IHC). A minority of patients were tested using \nfluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, 87% of patients had disease that was IHC 3+, \nand 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive.

In this \nstudy, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous \ninfusion every 3 weeks) and capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week \nrest period). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m2 as a 1 hour \nintravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine \ncombination arm (p = 0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days \n(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator \nassessment) were 41.6% (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to \nprogressive disease was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p < 0.0001). The \nmedian time to progression was 186 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nPatients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy \n \nIn a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) \nand overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to Best Supportive \nCare. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). \nThere was less use of morphinic analgesic (p < 0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p < 0.01), other \ndisease-related medications (p = 0.06) and radiotherapy (p < 0.01) in patients treated with docetaxel at \n75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to those with BSC. \nThe overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was \n26.1 weeks. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients \n \nIn a phase III study, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or \ngreater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either \ndocetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/m2 over \n30-60 minutes every 3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with \ncarboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ml.min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2 \nadministered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on \nday 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks (VCis). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n81 \n\nSurvival data, median time to progression and response rates for two arms of the study are illustrated \nin the following table: \n \n\n TCis \nn = 408\n\nVCis \nn = 404\n\nStatistical analysis \n\nOverall survival  \n(Primary end-point):\n\n   \n\nMedian survival (months) 11.3 10.1 Hazard ratio: 1.122 \n[97.2% CI: 0.937; 1.342]*\n\n1-year Survival (%) 46 41 Treatment difference: 5.4% \n[95% CI: -1.1; 12.0] \n\n2-year Survival (%) 21 14 Treatment difference: 6.2% \n[95% CI: 0.2; 12.3] \n\nMedian time to progression \n(weeks): \n\n \n22.0 \n\n \n23.0 \n\n \nHazard ratio: 1.032 \n\n[95% CI: 0.876; 1.216] \nOverall response rate (%): 31.6 24.5 Treatment difference: 7.1% \n\n[95% CI: 0.7; 13.5] \n*: Corrected for multiple comparisons and adjusted for stratification factors (stage of disease and \nregion of treatment), based on evaluable patient population. \n\n \nSecondary end-points included change of pain, global rating of quality of life by EuroQoL-5D, Lung \nCancer Symptom Scale, and changes in Karnosfky performance status.

Patients treated with TCF had a longer time to 5% definitive deterioration of global \nhealth status on the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (p = 0.0121) and a longer time to definitive worsening of \nKarnofsky performance status (p = 0.0088) compared to patients treated with CF. \n \nHead and neck cancer \n \n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX323) \nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with squamous cell \ncarcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a phase III, multicenter, open-label, \nrandomised study (TAX323). In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, \nand WHO performance status 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two treatment arms.  Patients on the \ndocetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m2 followed by \n5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m2 per day as a continuous infusion for 5 days. This regimen was \nadministered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response (\u2265 25% reduction in \nbidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with \na minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not \nprogress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (TPF/RT). \nPatients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) \n1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case \nat least a minor response (\u2265 25% reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed \nafter 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval \nof 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to \ninstitutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either \nwith a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to \n70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum \ninterfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of 70 Gy was recommended for accelerated \nregimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical resection was allowed following \n\n\n\n \n\n86 \n\nchemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm received antibiotic prophylaxis \nwith ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. \nThe primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was significantly longer in the \nTPF arm compared to the PF arm, p = 0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4 vs. 8.3 months respectively) with an \noverall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall survival was also significantly longer in \nfavour of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median OS: 18.6 vs. 14.5 months respectively) with a \n28% risk reduction of mortality, p = 0.0128.

Pain intensity score improved during treatment in both groups indicating adequate \npain management. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n87 \n\n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX324) \nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced \nsquamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a randomised, multi-centre \nopen-label, phase III study (TAX324). In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and \na WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two arms. The study population \ncomprised patients with technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure \nand patients aiming at organ preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival \nendpoints and the success of organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel \narm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m\u00b2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) \n100 mg/m\u00b2 administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous \nintravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles were \nrepeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to receive \nchemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT). Patients on the comparator arm received \ncisplatin (P) 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by the \ncontinuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 5. The cycles \nwere repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to \nreceive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT). \nPatients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy \nwith a minimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to \nday 56 of last cycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour \nintravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses. Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment \nusing once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of \n70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at any time \nfollowing completion of CRT. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the study received \nprophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, overall survival (OS) was \nsignificantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxel-containing regimen compared to PF \n(median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk reduction in mortality compared \nto PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) with an overall median \nfollow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% risk reduction of \nprogression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF and 13.1 for \nPF). This was also statistically significant with an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; log-rank test \np = 0.004.

The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent \nwith a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half-lives for the \uf061, \uf062 and \uf067 phases of 4 min, \n36 min and 11.1 h, respectively. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel \nfrom the peripheral compartment.  \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one-hour infusion a mean peak plasma \nlevel of 3.7 \u00b5g/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h.\u00b5g/ml. Mean values for total body \nclearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter \nindividual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% \nbound to plasma proteins. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n89 \n\nElimination \n \nA study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in \nboth the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl \nester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of \nthe administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is \nexcreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites \nand very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge and gender \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. \nPharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I \nstudies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a small number of patients (n = 23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver \nfunction impairment (ALT, AST \uf0b3 1.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase \uf0b3\n 2.5 times the ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2).  \n \nFluid retention \nDocetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are \nno data available in patients with severe fluid retention. \n \nCombination therapy \n \nDoxorubicin \nWhen used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma \nlevels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin \nand cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their coadministration. \n \nCapecitabine \nPhase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa \nshowed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no effect \nby docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5\u2019-DFUR. \n \nCisplatinClearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed \nfollowing monotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel \ninfusion is similar to that observed with cisplatin alone. \n \nCisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nThe combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid \ntumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product. \n \nPrednisone and dexamethasone \nThe effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard \ndexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients.  \n \nPrednisone \nNo effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n90 \n\nDocetaxel has been shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro micronucleus and chromosome aberration \ntest in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. However, it did not induce \nmutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. These results are consistent \nwith the pharmacological activity of docetaxel. \n \nUndesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair \nmale fertility. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nConcentrate vial:  \nPolysorbate 80 \nCitric acid. \n \nSolvent vial:  \nEthanol 95%  \nWater for injections. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf-life \n \n\uf0b7 3 years. \n\uf0b7 Premix solution: The premix solution contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used \n\nimmediately after preparation. However the chemical and physical stability of the premix solution \nhas been demonstrated for 8 hours when stored either between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C or at room \ntemperature (below 25\u00b0C). \n\n\uf0b7 Infusion solution: the infusion solution should be used within 4 hours at room temperature (below \n25\u00b0C). \n\n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nDo not store above 25\u00b0C or below 2\u00b0C.  \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \nFor storage conditions of the diluted medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nEach blister pack contains: \n\uf0b7 one single-dose vial of concentrate and, \n\uf0b7 one single-dose vial of solvent. \n \nTAXOTERE 80 mg/2 ml concentrate for solution for infusion vial \n \n15 ml clear glass Type I vial with a red flip-off cap. \n \nThis vial contains 2 ml of a 40 mg/ml solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 (fill volume: \n94.4 mg/2.36 ml). This fill volume has been established during the development of TAXOTERE to \ncompensate for liquid loss during preparation of the premix due to foaming, adhesion to the walls of \nthe vial and \"dead-volume\". This overfill ensures that after dilution with the entire contents of the \n\n\n\n \n\n91 \n\naccompanying solvent for TAXOTERE vial, there is a minimal extractable premix volume of 8 ml \ncontaining 10 mg/ml docetaxel which corresponds to the labelled amount of 80 mg/2 ml per vial. \n \nSolvent vial \n \n15 ml clear glass Type I vial with a transparent colourless flip-off cap. \n \nSolvent vial contains 6 ml of a 13% w/w solution of ethanol 95% in water for injections (fill volume: \n7.33 ml). The addition of the entire contents of the solvent vial to the contents of the TAXOTERE \n80 mg/2 ml concentrate for solution for infusion vial ensures a premix concentration of 10 mg/ml \ndocetaxel. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nTAXOTERE is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should \nbe exercised when handling it and preparing TAXOTERE solutions. The use of gloves is \nrecommended. \n \nIf TAXOTERE concentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, \nwash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If TAXOTERE concentrate, premix solution \nor infusion solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and \nthoroughly with water. \n \nPreparation for the intravenous administration \n \na) Preparation of the TAXOTERE premix solution (10 mg docetaxel/ml) \n \nIf the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of TAXOTERE boxes to stand at \nroom temperature (below 25\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. \n \nUsing a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw the entire contents of the solvent for \nTAXOTERE vial by partially inverting the vial.  \n \nInject the entire contents of the syringe into the corresponding TAXOTERE vial. \n \nRemove the syringe and needle and mix manually by repeated inversions for at least 45 seconds. Do \nnot shake. \n \nAllow the premix vial to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and then check that \nthe solution is homogenous and clear (foaming is normal even after 5 minutes due to the presence of \npolysorbate 80 in the formulation).  \n \nThe premix solution contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used immediately after preparation. \nHowever the chemical and physical stability of the premix solution has been demonstrated for 8 hours \nwhen stored either between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C or at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C). \n \nb) Preparation of the infusion solution \n \nMore than one premix vial may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. Based on the \nrequired dose for the patient expressed in mg, aseptically withdraw the corresponding premix volume \ncontaining 10 mg/ml docetaxel from the appropriate number of premix vials using graduated syringes \nfitted with a needle. For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require 14 ml docetaxel premix \nsolution. \n \nInject the required premix volume into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing either 5% glucose \nsolution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n92 \n\nIf a dose greater than 200 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so \nthat a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n \nMix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n \nThe TAXOTERE infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be aseptically \nadministered as a 1-hour infusion under room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and normal lighting \nconditions. \n \nAs with all parenteral products, TAXOTERE premix solution and infusion solution should be visually \ninspected prior to use, solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with: \n\n\uf0b7 operable node-positive breast cancer \n\uf0b7 operable node-negative breast cancer . \n\n \nFor patients with operable node-negative breast cancer, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to \npatients eligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary \ntherapy of early breast cancer (see section 5.1). \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this \ncondition. \n \nTAXOTERE monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have \nincluded an anthracycline or an alkylating agent. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer whose tumours over express HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy \nfor metastatic disease. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy should \nhave included an anthracycline. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n94 \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nTAXOTERE is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small \ncell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable, \nlocally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously \nreceived chemotherapy for this condition. \n \nProstate cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients \nwith  metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), with or without prednisone or \nprednisolone, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate \ncancer. \n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of patients \nwith metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, \nwho have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. \n \nHead and neck cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment \nof patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the \nuse of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \nPosology \n \nFor breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral \ncorticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to \ndocetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4). \nFor metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or \nprednisolone the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours \nand 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). \nFor metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, irrespective of the concurrent use of prednisone or \nprednisolone, the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg 12 hours, 3 hours, \nand 1 hour before docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). \n \nProphylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. \n \nDocetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks. \n \nBreast cancer \nIn the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the recommended \ndose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide \n500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment).  \n\n\n\n \n\n95 \n\nFor the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose \nof docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is given in \ncombination therapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2).  \n \nIn combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 every three weeks, \nwith trastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started \nthe day following the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered \nimmediately after completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was \nwell tolerated. For trastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nIn combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, \ncombined with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks \nfollowed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, \nsee capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nIn chemotherapy na\u00efve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen \nis docetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment \nafter failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m\u00b2 as a single \nagent. \n \nProstate cancer \nMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily \nis administered continuously (see section 5.1). \n \nMetastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Prednisone or \nprednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily may be administered continuously. \n \n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin \n75 mg/m2, as a 1- to 3-hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 per \nday given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. \nTreatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and \nappropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the \nrisk of haematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). \n \nHead and neck cancer \nPatients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after \ncisplatin administration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological \ntoxicities. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, received \nprophylactic antibiotics. \n \n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) \n\nFor the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head \nand neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion \nfollowed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a \ncontinuous infusion at 750 mg/m2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every \n3 weeks for 4 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy.  \n\n \n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) \n\nFor the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low \nprobability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the \nhead and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous \n\n\n\n \n\n96 \n\ninfusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute to 3-hour \ninfusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion from day 1 to day 4. \nThis regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should \nreceive chemoradiotherapy. \n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose modifications, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nGeneral  \nDocetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is \uf0b3 1,500 cells/mm3.  \nIn patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3 for more than \none week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel \ntherapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from 75 to \n60 mg/m\u00b2. If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m\u00b2, the treatment should be \ndiscontinued.  \n \nAdjuvant therapy for breast cancer \nPrimary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide (TAC) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Patients who experience febrile \nneutropenia and/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m\u00b2 in all \nsubsequent cycles (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should \nhave their dose decreased to 60 mg/m\u00b2. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin \nFor patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose \nnadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who \nexperience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel \ndose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2. For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the \ncorresponding summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with capecitabine \n\uf0b7 For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n\uf0b7 For patients developing the first appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the \n\nnext docetaxel/capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and resume at \n100% of the original dose.  \n\n\uf0b7 For patients developing the second appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of \nGrade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1 \nand then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/m\u00b2.  \n\n\uf0b7 For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the docetaxel \ndose. \n\n \nFor trastuzumab dose modifications, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nIf an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite \nG-CSF use, the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. If subsequent episodes of \ncomplicated neutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m2. In case of \nGrade 4 thrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. Patients should \nnot be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level \n> 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. Discontinue treatment if these \ntoxicities persist (see section 4.4). \nRecommended dose modifications for toxicities in patients treated with docetaxel in combination with \ncisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n\nToxicity Dose adjustment \nDiarrhoea grade 3  First episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%. \n\nSecond episode: then reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\nDiarrhoea grade 4 First episode: reduce docetaxel and 5-FU doses by 20%. \n\nSecond episode: discontinue treatment.\nStomatitis/mucositis \ngrade 3  \n\nFirst episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%. \nSecond episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. \nThird episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\n\nStomatitis/mucositis \ngrade 4 \n\nFirst episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. \nSecond episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose adjustments, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nIn the pivotal SCCHN studies patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide \nprophylactic coverage (eg, day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nBased on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent, patients who have both \nelevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal \nrange (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of \ndocetaxel is 75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin > ULN and/or \nALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase > 6 times the ULN, no dose-\nreduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated.  \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of TAXOTERE in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 1 month to less \nthan 18 years have not yet been established. \nThere is no relevant use of TAXOTERE in the paediatric population in the indications breast cancer, \nnon-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not including \ntype II and III less differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma.  \n \nOlder people \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the older \npeople. \nIn combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of \ncapecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \nMethod of administration \nFor instructions on preparation and administration of the product, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nPatients with baseline neutrophil count of < 1,500 cells/mm3. \n \nPatients with severe liver impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n\n\n \n\n98 \n\n \nContraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as \ndexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel \nadministration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well \nas the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral \ndexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2).  \n \nHaematology \n \nNeutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median \nof 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of \ncomplete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be \nretreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level \uf0b3 1,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). \n \nIn the case of severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of \ndocetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate \nsymptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile \nneutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic \nG-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of \ncomplicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). \nPatients receiving TCF should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), \nfebrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received \nprimary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive \nadjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile \nneutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be \nclosely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nGastrointestinal reactions \n\n \nCaution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing \ngastrointestinal complications. Although majority of cases occurred during the first or second cycle of \ndocetaxel containing regimen, enterocolitis could develop at any time, and could lead to death as early \nas on the first day of onset. Patients should be closely monitored for early manifestations of serious \ngastrointestinal toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.4 Haematology, and 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nPatients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and \nsecond infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation \nof the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should \nbe available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised \ncutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe \nhypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of \ndocetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions \nshould not be re-challenged with docetaxel. Patients who have previously experienced a \nhypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may be at risk to develop hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, \nincluding more severe hypersensitivity reaction. These patients should be closely monitored during \ninitiation of docetaxel therapy. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n99 \n\nCutaneous reactions \n \nLocalised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema \nfollowed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by \ndesquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see \nsection 4.2).  \n\nSevere Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic \nEpidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) have been \nreported with docetaxel treatment. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of \nserious skin manifestations and closely monitored. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions \nappear discontinuation of docetaxel should be considered. \n\n \nFluid retention \n \nPatients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be \nmonitored closely. \n \nRespiratory disorders \n \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, \npulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure have been reported and may be associated with fatal \noutcome. Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant \nradiotherapy. \nIf new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly \ninvestigated, and appropriately treated. Interruption of docetaxel therapy is recommended until \ndiagnosis is available. Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition. The \nbenefit of resuming docetaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. \n \nPatients with liver impairment \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels \n(ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels \ngreater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as \ntoxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, \ninfections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel \nin those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at \nbaseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). \nFor patients with serum bilirubin levels > ULN and/or ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN concurrent \nwith serum alkaline phosphatase levels > 6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended \nand docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nThere are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel.  \n \nNervous system \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n100 \n\nCardiac toxicity \n \nHeart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, \nparticularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may \nbe moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). \n \nWhen patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they \nshould undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during \ntreatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For \nmore details see summary of product characteristics of trastuzumab. \n \nVentricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (sometimes fatal) has been reported in \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and/ or \ncyclophosphamide (see section 4.8).  \nBaseline cardiac assessment is recommended \n \nEye disorders \n \nCystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with \nimpaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examination. In case CMO is \ndiagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated (see section \n4.8). \n \nSecond primary malignancies \n \nSecond primary malignancies have been reported when docetaxel was given in combination with \nanticancer treatments known to be associated with second primary malignancies. Second primary \nmalignancies (including acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin \nlymphoma) may occur several months or years after docetaxel-containing therapy. Patients should be \nmonitored for second primary malignancies (see section 4.8). \n \nTumour Lysis Syndrome \n \nTumour lysis syndrome has been reported with docetaxel after the first or the second cycle (see section \n4.8). Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome (e.g. with renal impairment, hyperuricemia, bulky \ntumour, rapid progression) should be closely monitored. Correction of dehydration and treatment of \nhigh uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of treatment. \n \nOthers \n \nContraceptive measures must be taken by both men and women during treatment and for men at least  \n6 months after cessation of therapy (see section 4.6). \n \nThe concomitant use of docetaxel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nclarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and \nvoriconazole) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nAdditional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \n \nComplicated neutropenia \nFor patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or \ninfection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n101 \n\nGastrointestinal reactions \nSymptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, \nmay be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated \npromptly. \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) \nPatients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the \nfollow up period. In patients treated with the TAC regimen for node positive breast cancer, the risk of \nCHF has been shown to be higher during the first year after treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nPatients with 4+ nodes \nAs the benefit observed in patient with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on disease-free \nsurvival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ \nnodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis (see section 5.1). \n \nElderly \n \n \nCautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \nThere are limited data available in patients > 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with \ndoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n \nCautions for use in castration-resistant prostate cancer \nOf the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study(TAX 327), \n209 patients were 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients \ntreated with docetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate \n\uf0b3 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The \nincidence of related fever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates \uf0b3 10% higher \nin patients who were 75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years. \n \nCautions for use in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer \nOf the 545 patients treated with docetaxel every 3 weeks in a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer study \n(STAMPEDE), 296 patients were 65 years of age or older, and 48 patients were 75 years of age or \nolder. More patients aged \u226565 years in the docetaxel arm reported hypersensitivity reaction, \nneutropenia, anaemia, fluid retention, dyspnea, and nail changes when compared to the patients aged \nless than 65 years. None of these increases in frequency reached 10% difference with the control arm. \nIn patients who were 75 years of age or older, when compared to younger patients, neutropenia, \nanaemia, diarrhea, dyspnea and upper respiratory tract infection were reported with a greater incidence \n(at least 10% higher).  \n \nCautions for use in gastric adenocarcinoma cancer \nAmong the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer \nstudy, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of \nserious adverse events was higher in older people compared to younger patients. The incidence of the \nfollowing adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection occurred at rates \n\uf0b3 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients.  \nOlder people treated with TCF should be closely monitored. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains 50 vol % ethanol anhydrous (alcohol), i.e. up to 395 mg ethanol \nanhydrous per vial, equivalent to 10 ml of beer or 4 ml wine. \nHarmful for those suffering from alcoholism.  \nTo be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups such as \npatients with liver disease, or epilepsy. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n102 \n\nConsideration should be given to possible effects on the central nervous system. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other medicinal products. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant \nadministration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the \nenzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, ketoconazole and erythromycin. As \na result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal products as \nconcomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. \n \nIn case of combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the occurrence of docetaxel adverse reactions may \nincrease, as a result of reduced metabolism. If the concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., \nketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, \ntelithromycin and voriconazole) cannot be avoided, a close clinical surveillance is warranted and a \ndose-adjustment of docetaxel may be suitable during the treatment with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor \n(see section 4.4). In a pharmacokinetic study with 7 patients, the co-administration of docetaxel with \nthe strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole leads to a significant decrease in docetaxel clearance by \n49%. \nDocetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic \nprostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. \nNo statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \nDocetaxel is highly protein bound (> 95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with \nconcomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions \nwith tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, \nphenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of \ndocetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not \ninfluence the binding of digitoxin. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their \nco-administration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction \nbetween docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was \nabout 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be \nboth embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats, and to reduce fertility in rats. As with other \ncytotoxic medicinal products, docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant \nwomen. Therefore, docetaxel must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated. \n \nWomen of childbearing age receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant, and to \ninform the treating physician immediately should this occur. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nDocetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. \nConsequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be \ndiscontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nAn effective method of contraception should be used during treatment. \n\n\n\n \n\n103 \n\n \nFertility \n \nIn non clinical studies, docetaxel has genotoxic effects and may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). \nTherefore, men being treated with docetaxel are advised not to father a child during and up to \n6 months after treatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The amount of \nalcohol in this medicinal product and the side effects of the product may impair the ability to drive or \nuse machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Therefore, patients should be warned of the potential impact \nof the amount of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal product on the ability to drive or use \nmachines, and be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience these side effects during \ntreatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile for all indications \n \nThe adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel \nhave been obtained in:  \n\n\uf0b7 1312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/m\u00b2 and 75 mg/m\u00b2 of docetaxel as a single agent \nrespectively. \n\n\uf0b7 258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin.  \n\uf0b7 406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin.  \n\uf0b7 92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab.  \n\uf0b7 255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. \n\uf0b7 332 patients (TAX327) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or \n\nprednisolone (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\uf0b7 1276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received \n\ndocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important \ntreatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\uf0b7 300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and \n79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and \n5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\uf0b7 174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with \ncisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are \npresented). \n\n\uf0b7 545 patients (STAMPEDE study) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or \nprednisolone and ADT. \n\n \nThese reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; \ngrade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4), the COSTART and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available \ndata). \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was \nreversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe \nneutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea \nand asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in \ncombination with other chemotherapeutic agents. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n104 \n\nFor combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in \u2265 10% are displayed. There \nwas an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the \ntrastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. \n \nFor combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects (\u2265 5%) \nreported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see \ncapecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \nFor combination with ADT and with prednisone or prednisolone (STAMPEDE study), adverse events \noccurring occurring over the 6 cycles of treatment with docetaxel and having at least 2% higher \nincidence in the docetaxel treatment arm by comparison to the control arm, are presented, using the \nCTCAE grading scale. \n \n \nThe following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel: \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the \ninfusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms \nwere flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills. \nSevere reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized \nrash/erythema (see section 4.4). \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paresthesia, dysesthesia or pain \nincluding burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nReversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to \nmoderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and \nhands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently \nassociated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. \nLess frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to \ninterruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe \nnail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis.  \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nInfusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, \nredness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein. \nFluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, \npericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The peripheral oedema usually starts at the lower \nextremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of 3 kg or more. Fluid retention is \ncumulative in incidence and severity (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions in breast cancer for TAXOTERE 100 mg/m\u00b2 single agent \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions \n \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nInfections (G3/4: 5.7%; \nincluding sepsis and \npneumonia, fatal in \n\nInfection associated \nwith G4 neutropenia \n(G3/4: 4.6%)\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n105 \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions \n \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\n1.7%)  \nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nNeutropenia (G4: \n76.4%);  \nAnaemia (G3/4: 8.9%); \nFebrile neutropenia\n\nThrombocytopenia (G4: \n0.2%) \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nHypersensitivity (G3/4: \n5.3%) \n\n  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nAnorexia   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nPeripheral sensory \nneuropathy (G3: 4.1%); \nPeripheral motor \nneuropathy (G3/4: 4%); \nDysgeusia (severe: \n0.07%) \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders  Arrhythmia (G3/4: \n0.7%)\n\nCardiac failure \n\nVascular disorders  Hypotension;  \nHypertension; \nHaemorrhage\n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDyspnoea (severe: \n2.7%) \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nStomatitis (G3/4: \n5.3%);  \nDiarrhoea (G3/4: 4%);  \nNausea (G3/4: 4%);  \nVomiting (G3/4: 3%) \n\nConstipation (severe: \n0.2%);  \nAbdominal pain \n(severe: 1%);  \nGastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage (severe: \n0.3%)\n\nOesophagitis (severe: \n0.4%) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nAlopecia;  \nSkin reaction (G3/4: \n5.9%);  \nNail disorders (severe: \n2.6%) \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nMyalgia (severe: 1.4%) Arthralgia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nFluid retention (severe: \n6.5%); \nAsthenia (severe: \n11.2%);  \nPain \n\nInfusion site reaction;  \nNon-cardiac chest pain \n(severe: 0.4%) \n\n \n\nInvestigations  G3/4 Blood bilirubin \nincreased (< 5%); \nG3/4 Blood alkaline \nphosphatase increased \n(< 4%);  \nG3/4 AST increased \n(< 3%); \nG3/4 ALT increased \n(< 2%)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n106 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for Taxotere 100 mg/m2 single agent \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nRare: bleeding episodes associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. \n \nNervous system disorders \nReversibility data are available among 35.3% of patients who developed neurotoxicity following \ndocetaxel treatment at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent.

Note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a dose of 100 mg/m2 is \nknown to result in neutropenia in 97% of patients, 76% grade 4, based on nadir blood counts. The \nincidence of febrile neutropenia/neutropenic sepsis was also increased in patients treated with \nHerceptin plus docetaxel (23% versus 17% for patients treated with docetaxel alone). \n \nCardiac disorders \nSymptomatic cardiac failure was reported in 2.2% of the patients who received docetaxel plus \ntrastuzumab compared to 0% of patients given docetaxel alone. In the docetaxel plus trastuzumab arm, \n64% had received a prior anthracycline as adjuvant therapy compared with 55% in the docetaxel arm \nalone. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n110 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions in breast cancer for TAXOTERE 75 mg/m\u00b2 in combination with \ncapecitabine \n \nMedDRA system organ classes Very common adverse \n\nreactions \n \n\nCommon adverse reactions \n \n\nInfections and infestations  Oral candidiasis (G3/4: < 1%)\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nNeutropenia (G3/4: 63%);

Tumour lysis syndrome, potentially fatal, has been reported (frequency not known). \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n121 \n\nMusculoskeletal disorder \nMyositis has been reported with docetaxel (frequency not known). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of \noverdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In \ncases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated \ncomplications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and \nmucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. \nOther appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Taxanes, ATC Code: L01CD02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDocetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable \nmicrotubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The \nbinding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for \nvital mitotic and interphase cellular functions.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDocetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and \nagainst freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular \nconcentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some \nbut not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance \ngene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental anti-tumour \nactivity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nBreast cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy \n \nPatients with operable node-positive breast cancer (TAX 316) \n \nData from a multi-centre open label randomised study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS \uf0b3 80%, between 18 and \n70 years of age. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 4+), \n1491 patients were randomised to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after \ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 \nfollowed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC arm). Both regimens \n\n\n\n \n\n122 \n\nwere administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, \nall other medicinal products were given as intravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as \nsecondary prophylaxis to patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, \nprolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on the TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with \nciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In \nboth arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive eostrogen and/or progesterone \nreceptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed \naccording to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who \nreceived TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. Two interim analyses and one final analysis \nwere performed. The first interim analysis was planned 3 years after the date when half of study \nenrolment was done. The second interim analysis was done after 400 DFS events had been recorded \noverall, which led to a median follow-up of 55 months. The final analysis was performed when all \npatients had reached their 10-year follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-\nup before). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) \nwas the secondary efficacy endpoint. \n \nA final analysis was performed with an actual median follow up of 96 months. Significantly longer \ndisease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of \nrelapses at 10 years was reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC \n(39% versus 45%, respectively) i.e. an absolute risk reduction by 6% (p = 0.0043). Overall survival at \n10 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (76% versus 69%, respectively) \ni.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death by 7% (p = 0.002). As the benefit observed in patients \nwith 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on DFS and OS, the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC \nin patients with 4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis. \n \nOverall, the study results demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC. \n \nTAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were \nanalysed: \n \n\n  Disease free survival Overall survival \nPatient subset Number \n\nof \npatients \n\nHazard \nratio* \n\n95% CI p = Hazard \nratio* \n\n95% CI p = \n\nNo of positive \nnodes \n\n       \n\nOverall 745 0.80 0.68-0.93 0.0043 0.74 0.61-0.90 0.0020\n1-3 467 0.72 0.58-0.91 0.0047 0.62 0.46-0.82 0.0008\n4+ 278 0.87 0.70-1.09 0.2290 0.87 0.67-1.12 0.2746\n*a hazard ratio of less than 1 indicates that TAC is associated with a longer disease-free survival and \noverall survival compared to FAC \n \nPatients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy (GEICAM 9805)  \n \nData from a multi-centre open label randomised trial support the use of TAXOTERE for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy . \n1060 patients were randomised to receive either TAXOTERE 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after \ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in TAC arm), or doxorubicin \n50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (521 patients in \nFAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node-negative breast cancer patients with high risk of \nrelapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour size >2 cm and/or negative ER and PR and/or \nhigh histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age <35 years).). Both regimens were \nadministered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. TAXOTERE was administered as a 1-hour infusion, all \nother medicinal products were given intraveinously on day 1 every three weeks. Primary prophylactic \nG-CSF was made mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients were randomised. The incidence of \nGrade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection was decreased in patients who \nreceived primary G-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, after the last cycle of \n\n\n\n \n\n123 \n\nchemotherapy, patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 20 mg once a day for up to \n5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was administered according to guidelines in place at participating \ninstitutions and was given to 57.3% of patients who received TAC and 51.2% of patients who received \nFAC. \n \nOne primary analysis and one updated analysis were performed. The primary analysis was done when \nall patients had a follow-up of greater than 5 years (median follow-up time of 77 months). The updated \nanalysis was performed when all patients had reached their 10-year (median follow up time of 10 \nyears and 5 months) follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-up \npreviously). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) \nwas the secondary efficacy endpoint. \n \nAt the median follow-up time of 77 months, significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm \ncompared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of \nrelapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). At the \nmedian follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 16,5% reduction in the \nrisk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI (0.65-1.08), \np=0.1646). DFS data were not statistically significant but were still associated with a positive trend in \nfavour of TAC. \n \n At the median follow-up time of 77 months, overall survival (OS) was longer in the TAC arm with \nTAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard \nratio = 0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29). However, the distribution of OS was not significantly \ndifferent between the 2 groups. \nAt the median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 9% reduction in \nthe risk of death compared to FAC-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% CI (0.63-1.32)).  \nThe survival rate was 93.7% in the TAC arm and 91.4 % in the FAC arm, at the 8-year follow-up time \npoint, and 91.3 % in the TAC arm and 89 % in the FAC arm, at the 10-year follow-up time point. \n \nThe positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC remained unchanged.   \n \nTAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were analysed \nin the primary analysis (at the median follow-up time of 77 months) (see table below): \n \nSubset Analyses-Adjuvant Therapy in Patients with Node-negative Breast Cancer Study  \n(Intent-to-Treat Analysis) \n\n \n  Disease Free Survival \nPatient subset Number of patients \n\nin TAC group \nHazard ratio* 95% CI \n\nOverall 539 0.68 0.49-0.93 \nAge category 1   \n<50 years 260 0.67 0.43-1.05 \n\u226550 years 279 0.67 0.43-1.05 \nAge category 2   \n<35 years 42 0.31 0.11-0.89 \n\u226535 years 497 0.73 0.52-1.01 \nHormonal receptor \nstatus \n\n   \n\nNegative 195 0.7 0.45-1.1 \nPositive 344 0.62 0.4-0.97 \nTumour size    \n\uf0a32 cm 285 0.69 0.43-1.1 \n>2 cm 254 0.68 0.45-1.04 \nHistological grade   \nGrade1 (includes grade \nnot assessed) \n\n64 0.79 0.24-2.6 \n\n\n\n \n\n124 \n\nGrade 2 216 0.77 0.46-1.3 \nGrade 3 259 0.59 0.39-0.9 \nMenopausal status   \nPre-Menopausal 285 0.64 0.40-1 \nPost-Menopausal 254 0.72 0.47-1.12 \n*a hazard ratio (TAC/FAC) of less than 1 indicates that TAC is associated with a longer disease free survival \ncompared to FAC. \n \nExploratory subgroup analyses for disease-free survival for patients who meet the 2009 St. Gallen \nchemotherapy criteria \u2013 (ITT population) were performed and presented here below: \n \n  \n\nTAC \n \n\nFAC \nHazard ratio \n(TAC/FAC) \n\n \n \n\nSubgroups (n=539) (n=521) (95% CI) p-value\n \nMeeting relative indication \nfor chemotherapy a \n\n    \n\n \nNo \n\n \n18/214 \n(8.4%)\n\n \n26/227 \n(11.5%)\n\n \n0.796 (0.434 - 1.459) \n\n \n0.4593 \n\n \nYes \n\n \n48/325 \n(14.8%)\n\n \n69/294 \n(23.5%)\n\n \n0.606 (0.42 - 0.877) \n\n \n0.0072 \n\nTAC = docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \nFAC = 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \nCI = confidence interval; ER = eostrogen receptor \nPR = progesterone receptor \na ER/PR-negative or Grade 3 or tumour size >5 cm \n \nThe estimated hazard ratio was using Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as the \nfactor. \n \nTAXOTERE as single agent \n \nTwo randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or \n392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the \nrecommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks. \n \nIn alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). \nWithout affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p = 0.38) or \ntime to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p = 0.54), docetaxel increased \nresponse rate (52% vs. 37%, p = 0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, \np = 0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas \n15 doxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart \nfailure). \n \nIn anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and \nvinblastine (12 mg/m\u00b2 every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate \n(33% vs. 12%, p < 0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p = 0.0004) and \nprolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p = 0.01). \n \nDuring these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety profile \nobserved in phase II studies (see section 4.8).  \n \nAn open-label, multi-centre, randomised phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel \nmonotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous \ntherapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomised to receive \n\n\n\n \n\n125 \n\neither docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m\u00b2 as a 3 hour \ninfusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. \nWithout affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p = 0.10), docetaxel \nprolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p < 0.01) and median survival \n(15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p = 0.03). \nMore grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to \npaclitaxel (23.0%).  \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin \n \nOne large randomised phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic \ndisease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m\u00b2) \n(AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m\u00b2) \n(AC arm). Both regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks. \n \n\uf0b7 Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.0138. \nThe median TTP was 37.3 weeks (95% CI: 33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95% CI: \n27.4 - 36.0) in AC arm. \n\uf0b7 Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.009. \nThe ORR was 59.3% (95% CI: 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95% CI: 39.8 - 53.2) in AC arm. \n \nIn this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile \nneutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia \n(8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a \nhigher incidence of severe anaemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher \nincidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF \ndecrease \uf0b3 20% (13.1% versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease \uf0b3 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic \ndeaths occurred in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm \n(1 due to septic shock and 3 due to congestive heart failure). \nIn both arms, quality of life measured by the EORTC questionnaire was comparable and stable during \ntreatment and follow-up. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with trastuzumab \n \nDocetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy \nfor metastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomised to receive docetaxel \n(100 mg/m2) with or without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant \nchemotherapy. Docetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had \nreceived prior adjuvant anthracyclines. The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in \nthis pivotal study was immunohistochemistry (IHC). A minority of patients were tested using \nfluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, 87% of patients had disease that was IHC 3+, \nand 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive.

In this \nstudy, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous \ninfusion every 3 weeks) and capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week \nrest period). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m2 as a 1 hour \nintravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine \ncombination arm (p = 0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days \n(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator \nassessment) were 41.6% (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to \nprogressive disease was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p < 0.0001). The \nmedian time to progression was 186 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nPatients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy \n \nIn a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) \nand overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to Best Supportive \nCare. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). \nThere was less use of morphinic analgesic (p < 0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p < 0.01), other \ndisease-related medicinal products (p = 0.06) and radiotherapy (p < 0.01) in patients treated with \ndocetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to those with BSC. \nThe overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was \n26.1 weeks. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients \n \nIn a phase III study, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or \ngreater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either \ndocetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/m2 over \n30-60 minutes every 3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with \ncarboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ml.min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2 \nadministered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on \nday 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks (VCis). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n127 \n\nSurvival data, median time to progression and response rates for two arms of the study are illustrated \nin the following table: \n \n\n TCis \nn = 408\n\nVCis \nn = 404\n\nStatistical analysis \n\nOverall survival  \n(Primary end-point):\n\n   \n\nMedian survival (months) 11.3 10.1 Hazard Ratio: 1.122 \n[97.2% CI: 0.937; 1.342]*\n\n1-year Survival (%) 46 41 Treatment difference: 5.4% \n[95% CI: -1.1; 12.0] \n\n2-year Survival (%) 21 14 Treatment difference: 6.2% \n[95% CI: 0.2; 12.3] \n\nMedian time to progression \n(weeks): \n\n \n22.0 \n\n \n23.0 \n\n \nHazard Ratio: 1.032 \n\n[95% CI: 0.876; 1.216] \nOverall response rate (%): 31.6 24.5 Treatment difference: 7.1% \n\n[95% CI: 0.7; 13.5] \n*: Corrected for multiple comparisons and adjusted for stratification factors (stage of disease and \nregion of treatment), based on evaluable patient population. \n\n \nSecondary end-points included change of pain, global rating of quality of life by EuroQoL-5D, Lung \nCancer Symptom Scale, and changes in Karnosfky performance status.

A total of 445 patients with KPS > 70 were treated with either docetaxel (T) \n(75 mg/m2 on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) \n(750 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per \nday for 5 days). The length of a treatment cycle was 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF \narm. The median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 (with a range of 1-16) for the TCF \narm compared to 4 (with a range of 1-12) for the CF arm. Time to progression (TTP) was the primary \nendpoint. The risk reduction of progression was 32.1% and was associated with a significantly longer \nTTP (p = 0.0004) in favour of the TCF arm. Overall survival was also significantly longer \n(p = 0.0201) in favour of the TCF arm with a risk reduction of mortality of 22.7%.

Patients treated with TCF had a longer time to 5% definitive deterioration of global \nhealth status on the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (p = 0.0121) and a longer time to definitive worsening of \nKarnofsky performance status (p = 0.0088) compared to patients treated with CF. \n \nHead and neck cancer \n \n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX323) \nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with squamous cell \ncarcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a phase III, multi-centre, open-label, \nrandomised study (TAX323). In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, \nand WHO performance status 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two treatment arms. Patients on the \ndocetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m2 followed by \n5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m2 per day as a continuous infusion for 5 days. This regimen was \nadministered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response (\u2265 25% reduction in \nbidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with \na minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not \nprogress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (TPF/RT). \nPatients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) \n\n\n\n \n\n132 \n\n1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case \nat least a minor response (\u2265 25% reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed \nafter 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval \nof 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to \ninstitutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either \nwith a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to \n70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum \ninterfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of 70 Gy was recommended for accelerated \nregimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical resection was allowed following \nchemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm received antibiotic prophylaxis \nwith ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. \nThe primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was significantly longer in the \nTPF arm compared to the PF arm, p = 0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4 vs. 8.3 months respectively) with an \noverall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall survival was also significantly longer in \nfavour of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median OS: 18.6 vs. 14.5 months respectively) with a \n28% risk reduction of mortality, p = 0.0128.

Pain intensity score improved during treatment in both groups indicating adequate \npain management. \n \n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX324) \nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced \nsquamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a randomised, multi-centre \nopen-label, phase III study (TAX324). In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and \na WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two arms. The study population \ncomprised patients with technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure \nand patients aiming at organ preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival \nendpoints and the success of organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel \narm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m\u00b2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) \n100 mg/m\u00b2 administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous \nintravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles were \nrepeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to receive \nchemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT). Patients on the comparator arm received \ncisplatin (P) 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by the \ncontinuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 5. The cycles \nwere repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to \nreceive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT).  \nPatients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy \nwith a minimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to \nday 56 of last cycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour \nintravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses. Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment \nusing once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of \n70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at any time \nfollowing completion of CRT. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the study received \nprophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, overall survival (OS) was \nsignificantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxel-containing regimen compared to PF \n(median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk reduction in mortality compared \nto PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) with an overall median \nfollow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% risk reduction of \nprogression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF and 13.1 for \nPF). This was also statistically significant with an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; log-rank test \np = 0.004.

The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent \nwith a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half-lives for the \uf061, \uf062 and \uf067 phases of 4 min, \n36 min and 11.1 h, respectively. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel \nfrom the peripheral compartment.  \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one-hour infusion a mean peak plasma \nlevel of 3.7 \u00b5g/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h.\u00b5g/ml. Mean values for total body \nclearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter \nindividual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% \nbound to plasma proteins. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n135 \n\nElimination \n \nA study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in \nboth the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl \nester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of \nthe administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is \nexcreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites \nand very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge and gender \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. \nPharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I \nstudies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a small number of patients (n = 23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver \nfunction impairment (ALT, AST \uf0b3 1.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase \uf0b3\n 2.5 times the ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2).  \n \n \nFluid retention \nDocetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are \nno data available in patients with severe fluid retention. \n \nCombination therapy \n \nDoxorubicin \nWhen used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma \nlevels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin \nand cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their co-administration. \n \nCapecitabine \nPhase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa \nshowed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no \neffect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5\u2019-DFUR. \n \nCisplatin \nClearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following \nmonotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is \nsimilar to that observed with cisplatin alone. \n \nCisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nThe combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid \ntumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product. \n \nPrednisone and dexamethasone \nThe effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard \ndexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients.  \n \nPrednisone \nNo effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. \n\n\n\n \n\n136 \n\n \nDocetaxel has been shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro micronucleus and chromosome aberration \ntest in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. However, it did not induce \nmutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. These results are consistent \nwith the pharmacological activity of docetaxel. \n \nUndesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair \nmale fertility. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with: \n\n\uf0b7 operable node- positive breast cancer \n\uf0b7 operable node-negative breast cancer . \n\n \nFor patients with operable node-negative breast cancer, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to \npatients eligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary \ntherapy of early breast cancer (see section 5.1). \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this \ncondition. \n \nTAXOTERE monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have \nincluded an anthracycline or an alkylating agent. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer whose tumours over express HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy \nfor metastatic disease. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy should \nhave included an anthracycline. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n140 \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nTAXOTERE is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small \ncell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable, \nlocally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously \nreceived chemotherapy for this condition. \n \nProstate cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients \nwith  metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), with or without prednisone or \nprednisolone, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate \ncancer. \n \n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of patients \nwith metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, \nwho have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. \n \nHead and neck cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment \nof patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the \nuse of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \nPosology \n \nFor breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral \ncorticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to \ndocetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4).  \nFor metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or \nprednisolone the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours \nand 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). \nFor metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, irrespective of the concurrent use of prednisone or \nprednisolone, the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg 12 hours, 3 hours, \nand 1 hour before docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). \n \nProphylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. \n \nDocetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks. \n \nBreast cancer \nIn the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the recommended \ndose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide \n500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment).  \n\n\n\n \n\n141 \n\nFor the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose \nof docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is given in \ncombination therapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2).  \n \nIn combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 every three weeks, \nwith trastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started \nthe day following the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered \nimmediately after completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was \nwell tolerated. For trastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nIn combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, \ncombined with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks \nfollowed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, \nsee capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nIn chemotherapy na\u00efve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen \nis docetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment \nafter failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m\u00b2 as a single \nagent. \n \nProstate cancer  \nMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily \nis administered continuously (see section 5.1). \n \nMetastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Prednisone or \nprednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily may be administered continuously. \n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin \n75 mg/m2, as a 1- to 3-hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 per \nday given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. \nTreatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and \nappropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the \nrisk of haematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). \n \nHead and neck cancer \nPatients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after \ncisplatin administration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological \ntoxicities. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, received \nprophylactic antibiotics. \n \n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) \n\nFor the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head \nand neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion \nfollowed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a \ncontinuous infusion at 750 mg/m2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every \n3 weeks for 4 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy.  \n\n \n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) \n\nFor the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low \nprobability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the \nhead and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous \ninfusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute to 3-hour \n\n\n\n \n\n142 \n\ninfusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion from day 1 to day 4. \nThis regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should \nreceive chemoradiotherapy. \n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose modifications, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nGeneral  \nDocetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is \uf0b3 1,500 cells/mm3.  \nIn patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3 for more than \none week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel \ntherapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from 75 to \n60 mg/m\u00b2. If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m\u00b2, the treatment should be \ndiscontinued.  \n \nAdjuvant therapy for breast cancer \nPrimary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide (TAC) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Patients who experience febrile \nneutropenia and/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m\u00b2 in all \nsubsequent cycles (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should \nhave their dose decreased to 60 mg/m\u00b2. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin \nFor patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose \nnadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who \nexperience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel \ndose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2. For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the \ncorresponding summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with capecitabine \n\uf0b7 For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n\uf0b7 For patients developing the first appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the \n\nnext docetaxel/capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and resume at \n100% of the original dose.  \n\n\uf0b7 For patients developing the second appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of \nGrade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1 \nand then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/m\u00b2.  \n\n\uf0b7 For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the docetaxel \ndose. \n\n \nFor trastuzumab dose modifications, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nIf an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite \nG-CSF use, the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. If subsequent episodes of \ncomplicated neutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m2. In case of \nGrade 4 thrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. Patients should \nnot be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level \n> 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. Discontinue treatment if these \ntoxicities persist (see section 4.4). \nRecommended dose modifications for toxicities in patients treated with docetaxel in combination with \ncisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): \n \n\nToxicity Dose adjustment \nDiarrhoea grade 3  First episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%.\n\n\n\n \n\n143 \n\nSecond episode: then reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\nDiarrhoea grade 4 First episode: reduce docetaxel and 5-FU doses by 20%. \n\nSecond episode: discontinue treatment.\nStomatitis/mucositis \ngrade 3  \n\nFirst episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%. \nSecond episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. \nThird episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\n\nStomatitis/mucositis \ngrade 4 \n\nFirst episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. \nSecond episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose adjustments, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nIn the pivotal SCCHN studies patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide \nprophylactic coverage (eg, day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nBased on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent, patients who have both \nelevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal \nrange (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of \ndocetaxel is 75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin > ULN and/or \nALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase > 6 times the ULN, no dose-\nreduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated.  \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of TAXOTERE in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 1 month to less \nthan 18 years have not yet been established. \nThere is no relevant use of TAXOTERE in the paediatric population in the indications breast cancer, \nnon-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not including \ntype II and III less differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma.  \n \nOlder people \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the older \npeople. \nIn combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of \ncapecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \nMethod of administration \nFor instructions on preparation and administration of the product, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nPatients with baseline neutrophil count of < 1,500 cells/mm3. \n \nPatients with severe liver impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nContraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. \n\n\n\n \n\n144 \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as \ndexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel \nadministration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well \nas the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral \ndexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2).  \n \nHaematology \n \nNeutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median \nof 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of \ncomplete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be \nretreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level \uf0b3 1,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). \n \nIn the case of severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of \ndocetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate \nsymptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile \nneutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic \nG-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of \ncomplicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). \nPatients receiving TCF should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), \nfebrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received \nprimary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive \nadjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile \nneutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be \nclosely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nGastrointestinal reactions \n\n \nCaution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing \ngastrointestinal complications. Although majority of cases occurred during the first or second cycle of \ndocetaxel containing regimen, enterocolitis could develop at any time, and could lead to death as early \nas on the first day of onset. Patients should be closely monitored for early manifestations of serious \ngastrointestinal toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.4 Haematology, and 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nPatients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and \nsecond infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation \nof the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should \nbe available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised \ncutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe \nhypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of \ndocetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions \nshould not be re-challenged with docetaxel. Patients who have previously experienced a \nhypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may be at risk to develop hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, \nincluding more severe hypersensitivity reaction. These patients should be closely monitored during \ninitiation of docetaxel therapy. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n145 \n\nCutaneous reactions \n \nLocalised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema \nfollowed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by \ndesquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see \nsection 4.2).  \n\nSevere Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic \nEpidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) have been \nreported with docetaxel treatment. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of \nserious skin manifestations and closely monitored. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions \nappear discontinuation of docetaxel should be considered. \n\n \nFluid retention \n \nPatients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be \nmonitored closely. \n \nRespiratory disorders \n \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, \npulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure have been reported and may be associated with fatal \noutcome. Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant \nradiotherapy. \nIf new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly \ninvestigated, and appropriately treated. Interruption of docetaxel therapy is recommended until \ndiagnosis is available. Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition. The \nbenefit of resuming docetaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. \n \nPatients with liver impairment \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels \n(ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels \ngreater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as \ntoxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, \ninfections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel \nin those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at \nbaseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). \nFor patients with serum bilirubin levels > ULN and/or ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN concurrent \nwith serum alkaline phosphatase levels > 6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended \nand docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nThere are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel.  \n \nNervous system \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n146 \n\nCardiac toxicity \n \nHeart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, \nparticularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may \nbe moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). \n \nWhen patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they \nshould undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during \ntreatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For \nmore details see summary of product characteristics of trastuzumab. \n \nVentricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (sometimes fatal) has been reported in \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and/ or \ncyclophosphamide (see section 4.8).  \nBaseline cardiac assessment is recommended.  \n \nEye disorders \n \nCystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with \nimpaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examination. In case CMO is \ndiagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated (see section \n4.8). \n \nSecond primary malignancies \n \nSecond primary malignancies have been reported when docetaxel was given in combination with \nanticancer treatments known to be associated with second primary malignancies. Second primary \nmalignancies (including acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin \nlymphoma) may occur several months or years after docetaxel-containing therapy. Patients should be \nmonitored for second primary malignancies (see section 4.8). \n \nTumour Lysis Syndrome \n \nTumour lysis syndrome has been reported with docetaxel after the first or the second cycle (see section \n4.8). Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome (e.g. with renal impairment, hyperuricemia, bulky \ntumour, rapid progression) should be closely monitored. Correction of dehydration and treatment of \nhigh uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of treatment. \n \nOthers \n \nContraceptive measures must be taken by both men and women during treatment and for men at least  \n6 months after cessation of therapy (see section 4.6). \n \nThe concomitant use of docetaxel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nclarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and \nvoriconazole) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nAdditional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \n \nComplicated neutropenia \nFor patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or \ninfection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n147 \n\nGastrointestinal reactions \nSymptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, \nmay be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated \npromptly. \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) \nPatients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the \nfollow up period. In patients treated with the TAC regimen for node positive breast cancer, the risk of \nCHF has been shown to be higher during the first year after treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n \nPatients with 4+ nodes \nAs the benefit observed in patient with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on disease-free \nsurvival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with \n4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis (see section 5.1). \n \n \nElderly \n \nCautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \nThere are limited data available in patients > 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with \ndoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n \nCautions for use in castration-resistant prostate cancer \nOf the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study (TAX 327), \n209 patients were 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients \ntreated with docetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate \n\uf0b3 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The \nincidence of related fever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates \uf0b3 10% higher \nin patients who were 75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years. \n \nCautions for use in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer \nOf the 545 patients treated with docetaxel every 3 weeks in a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer study \n(STAMPEDE), 296 patients were 65 years of age or older, and 48 patients were 75 years of age or \nolder. More patients aged \u226565 years in the docetaxel arm reported hypersensitivity reaction, \nneutropenia, anaemia, fluid retention, dyspnea, and nail changes when compared to the patients aged \nless than 65 years. None of these increases in frequency reached 10% difference with the control arm. \nIn patients who were 75 years of age or older, when compared to younger patients, neutropenia, \nanaemia, diarrhea, dyspnea and upper respiratory tract infection were reported with a greater incidence \n(at least 10% higher).  \n \nCautions for use in gastric adenocarcinoma cancer \nAmong the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer \nstudy, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of \nserious adverse events was higher in older people compared to younger patients. The incidence of the \nfollowing adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection occurred at rates \n\uf0b3 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients.  \nOlder people treated with TCF should be closely monitored. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains 50 vol % ethanol anhydrous (alcohol), i.e. up to 1.58 g ethanol \nanhydrous per vial, equivalent to 40 ml of beer or 17 ml wine. \nHarmful for those suffering from alcoholism.  \nTo be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups such as \npatients with liver disease, or epilepsy. \n\n\n\n \n\n148 \n\n \nConsideration should be given to possible effects on the central nervous system. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other medicinal products. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant \nadministration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the \nenzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, ketoconazole and erythromycin. As \na result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal products as \nconcomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. \n \nIn case of combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the occurrence of docetaxel adverse reactions may \nincrease, as a result of reduced metabolism. If the concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., \nketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, \ntelithromycin and voriconazole) cannot be avoided, a close clinical surveillance is warranted and a \ndose-adjustment of docetaxel may be suitable during the treatment with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor \n(see section 4.4). In a pharmacokinetic study with 7 patients, the co-administration of docetaxel with \nthe strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole leads to a significant decrease in docetaxel clearance by \n49%. \nDocetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic \nprostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. \nNo statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \nDocetaxel is highly protein bound (> 95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with \nconcomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions \nwith tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, \nphenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of \ndocetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not \ninfluence the binding of digitoxin. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their \nco-administration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction \nbetween docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was \nabout 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be \nboth embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats, and to reduce fertility in rats. As with other \ncytotoxic medicinal products, docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant \nwomen. Therefore, docetaxel must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated. \n \nWomen of childbearing age receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant, and to \ninform the treating physician immediately should this occur. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nDocetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. \nConsequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be \ndiscontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. \n \nContraception in males and females \n \n\n\n\n \n\n149 \n\nAn effective method of contraception should be used during treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nIn non clinical studies, docetaxel has genotoxic effects and may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). \nTherefore, men being treated with docetaxel are advised not to father a child during and up to \n6 months after treatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The amount of \nalcohol in this medicinal product and the side effects of the product may impair the ability to drive or \nuse machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Therefore, patients should be warned of the potential impact \nof the amount of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal product on the ability to drive or use \nmachines, and be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience these side effects during \ntreatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile for all indications \n \nThe adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel \nhave been obtained in:  \n\n\uf0b7 1312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/m\u00b2 and 75 mg/m\u00b2 of docetaxel as a single agent \nrespectively. \n\n\uf0b7 258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin.  \n\uf0b7 406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin.  \n\uf0b7 92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab.  \n\uf0b7 255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. \n\uf0b7 332 patients (TAX327) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or \n\nprednisolone (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\uf0b7 1276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received \n\ndocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important \ntreatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\uf0b7 300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and \n79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and \n5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\uf0b7 174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with \ncisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are \npresented). \n\n\uf0b7 545 patients (STAMPEDE study) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or \nprednisolone and ADT. \n\n \nThese reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; \ngrade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4), the COSTART and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available \ndata). \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was \nreversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe \nneutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea \nand asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in \ncombination with other chemotherapeutic agents. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n150 \n\nFor combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in \u2265 10% are displayed. There \nwas an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the \ntrastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. \n \nFor combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects (\u2265 5%) \nreported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see \ncapecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \nFor combination with ADT and with prednisone or prednisolone (STAMPEDE study), adverse events \noccurring over the 6 cycles of treatment with docetaxel and having at least 2% higher incidence in the \ndocetaxel treatment arm by comparison to the control arm, are presented, using the CTCAE grading \nscale. \n \nThe following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel: \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the \ninfusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms \nwere flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills. \nSevere reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized \nrash/erythema (see section 4.4). \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paresthesia, dysesthesia or pain \nincluding burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nReversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to \nmoderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and \nhands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently \nassociated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. \nLess frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to \ninterruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe \nnail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis.  \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nInfusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, \nredness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein. \nFluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, \npericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The peripheral oedema usually starts at the lower \nextremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of 3 kg or more. Fluid retention is \ncumulative in incidence and severity (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions in breast cancer for TAXOTERE 100 mg/m\u00b2 single agent \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions \n \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nInfections (G3/4: 5.7%; \nincluding sepsis and \npneumonia, fatal in \n1.7%)  \n\nInfection associated \nwith G4 neutropenia \n(G3/4: 4.6%) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n151 \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions \n \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nNeutropenia (G4: \n76.4%);  \nAnaemia (G3/4: 8.9%); \nFebrile neutropenia\n\nThrombocytopenia (G4: \n0.2%) \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nHypersensitivity (G3/4: \n5.3%) \n\n  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nAnorexia   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nPeripheral sensory \nneuropathy (G3: 4.1%); \nPeripheral motor \nneuropathy (G3/4: 4%); \nDysgeusia (severe: \n0.07%) \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders  Arrhythmia (G3/4: \n0.7%)\n\nCardiac failure \n\nVascular disorders  Hypotension;  \nHypertension; \nHaemorrhage\n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDyspnoea (severe: \n2.7%) \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nStomatitis (G3/4: \n5.3%);  \nDiarrhoea (G3/4: 4%);  \nNausea (G3/4: 4%);  \nVomiting (G3/4: 3%) \n\nConstipation (severe: \n0.2%);  \nAbdominal pain \n(severe: 1%);  \nGastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage (severe: \n0.3%)\n\nOesophagitis (severe: \n0.4%) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nAlopecia;  \nSkin reaction (G3/4: \n5.9%);  \nNail disorders (severe: \n2.6%) \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nMyalgia (severe: 1.4%) Arthralgia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nFluid retention (severe: \n6.5%); \nAsthenia (severe: \n11.2%);  \nPain \n\nInfusion site reaction;  \nNon-cardiac chest pain \n(severe: 0.4%) \n\n \n\nInvestigations  G3/4 Blood bilirubin \nincreased (< 5%); \nG3/4 Blood alkaline \nphosphatase increased \n(< 4%);  \nG3/4 AST increased \n(< 3%); \nG3/4 ALT increased \n(< 2%)\n\n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for TAXOTERE 100 mg/m\u00b2 single agent \n\n\n\n \n\n152 \n\n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nRare: bleeding episodes associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. \n \nNervous system disorders \nReversibility data are available among 35.3% of patients who developed neurotoxicity following \ndocetaxel treatment at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent.

Note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a dose of 100 mg/m2 is \nknown to result in neutropenia in 97% of patients, 76% grade 4, based on nadir blood counts. The \nincidence of febrile neutropenia/neutropenic sepsis was also increased in patients treated with \nHerceptin plus docetaxel (23% versus 17% for patients treated with docetaxel alone). \n \nCardiac disorders \nSymptomatic cardiac failure was reported in 2.2% of the patients who received docetaxel plus \ntrastuzumab compared to 0% of patients given docetaxel alone. In the docetaxel plus trastuzumab arm, \n64% had received a prior anthracycline as adjuvant therapy compared with 55% in the docetaxel arm \nalone. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n156 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions in breast cancer for TAXOTERE 75 mg/m\u00b2 in combination with \ncapecitabine \n \nMedDRA system organ classes Very common adverse \n\nreactions \n \n\nCommon adverse reactions \n \n\nInfections and infestations  Oral candidiasis (G3/4: < 1%)\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nNeutropenia (G3/4: 63%);

Tumour lysis syndrome, potentially fatal, has been reported (frequency not known). \n \n\nMusculoskeletal disorder \nMyositis has been reported with docetaxel (frequency not known). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of \noverdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In \ncases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated \ncomplications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and \nmucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. \nOther appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Taxanes, ATC Code: L01CD02 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n167 \n\nMechanism of action \n \nDocetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable \nmicrotubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The \nbinding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for \nvital mitotic and interphase cellular functions.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDocetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and \nagainst freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular \nconcentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some \nbut not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance \ngene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental anti-tumour \nactivity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nBreast cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy \n \nPatients with operable node-positive breast cancer (TAX 316) \n \nData from a multi-centre open label randomised study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS \uf0b3 80%, between 18 and \n70 years of age. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 4+), \n1491 patients were randomised to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after \ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 \nfollowed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC arm). Both regimens \nwere administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, \nall other medicinal products were given as intravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as \nsecondary prophylaxis to patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, \nprolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on the TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with \nciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In \nboth arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive eostrogen and/or progesterone \nreceptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed \naccording to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who \nreceived TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. Two interim analyses and one final analysis \nwere performed. The first interim analysis was planned 3 years after the date when half of study \nenrolment was done. The second interim analysis was done after 400 DFS events had been recorded \noverall, which led to a median follow-up of 55 months. The final analysis was performed when all \npatients had reached their 10-year follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-\nup before). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) \nwas the secondary efficacy endpoint. \n \nA final analysis was performed with an actual median follow up of 96 months. Significantly longer \ndisease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of \nrelapses at 10 years was reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC \n(39% versus 45%, respectively) i.e. an absolute risk reduction by 6% (p = 0.0043). Overall survival at \n10 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (76%versus 69%, respectively) \ni.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death by 7% (p = 0.002). As the benefit observed in patients \nwith 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on DFS and OS, the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC \nin patients with 4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n168 \n\nOverall, the study results demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC.  \n \nTAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were \nanalysed: \n \n\n  Disease free survival Overall survival \nPatient subset Number \n\nof \npatients \n\nHazard \nratio* \n\n95% CI p = Hazard \nratio* \n\n95% CI p = \n\nNo of positive \nnodes \n\n       \n\nOverall 745 0.80 0.68-0.93 0.0043 0.74 0.61-0.90 0.0020\n1-3 467 0.72 0.58-0.91 0.0047 0.62 0.46-0.82 0.0008\n4+ 278 0.87 0.70-1.09 0.2290 0.87 0.67-1.12 0.2746\n\n*a hazard ratio of less than 1 indicates that TAC is associated with a longer disease-free survival and \noverall survival compared to FAC \n \n \nPatients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy (GEICAM 9805)  \n \nData from a multi-centre open label randomised trial support the use of TAXOTERE for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy. \n1060 patients were randomised to receive either TAXOTERE 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after \ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in TAC arm), or doxorubicin \n50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (521 patients in \nFAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node-negative breast cancer patients with high risk of \nrelapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour size >2 cm and/or negative ER and PR and/or \nhigh histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age <35 years). Both regimens were administered \nonce every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. TAXOTERE was administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other \nmedicinal products were given intraveinously on day 1 every three weeks. Primary prophylactic \nG-CSF was made mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients were randomised. The incidence of \nGrade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection was decreased in patients who \nreceived primary G-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, after the last cycle of \nchemotherapy, patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 20 mg once a day for up to \n5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was administered according to guidelines in place at participating \ninstitutions and was given to 57.3% of patients who received TAC and 51.2% of patients who received \nFAC. \n \nOne primary analysis and one updated analysis were performed. The primary analysis was done when \nall patients had a follow-up of greater than 5 years (median follow-up time of 77 months). The updated \nanalysis was performed when all patients had reached their 10-year (median follow up time of 10 \nyears and 5 months) follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-up \npreviously). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) \nwas the secondary efficacy endpoint. \n \nAt the median follow-up time of 77 months, significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm \ncompared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of \nrelapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). At the \nmedian follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 16,5% reduction in the \nrisk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI (0.65-1.08), \np=0.1646). DFS data were not statistically significant but were still associated with a positive trend in \nfavour of TAC.   \n \nAt the median follow-up time of 77 months, overall survival (OS) was longer in the TAC arm with \nTAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard \nratio = 0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29). However, the distribution of OS was not significantly \ndifferent between the 2 groups. \n\n\n\n \n\n169 \n\nAt the median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 9% reduction in \nthe risk of death compared to FAC-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% CI (0.63-1.32)).  \nThe survival rate was 93.7% in the TAC arm and 91.4 % in the FAC arm, at the 8-year follow-up time \npoint, and 91.3 % in the TAC arm and 89 % in the FAC arm, at the 10-year follow-up time point. \n \nThe positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC remained unchanged.   \n \nTAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were analysed \nin the primary analysis (at the median follow-up time of 77 months) (see table below): \n \nSubset Analyses-Adjuvant Therapy in Patients with Node-negative Breast Cancer Study  \n(Intent-to-Treat Analysis) \n\n \n  Disease Free Survival \nPatient subset Number of patients \n\nin TAC group \nHazard ratio* 95% CI \n\nOverall 539 0.68 0.49-0.93 \nAge category 1   \n<50 years 260 0.67 0.43-1.05 \n\u226550 years 279 0.67 0.43-1.05 \nAge category 2   \n<35 years 42 0.31 0.11-0.89 \n\u226535 years 497 0.73 0.52-1.01 \nHormonal receptor \nstatus \n\n   \n\nNegative 195 0.7 0.45-1.1 \nPositive 344 0.62 0.4-0.97 \nTumour size    \n\uf0a32 cm 285 0.69 0.43-1.1 \n>2 cm 254 0.68 0.45-1.04 \nHistological grade   \nGrade1 (includes grade \nnot assessed) \n\n64 0.79 0.24-2.6 \n\nGrade 2 216 0.77 0.46-1.3 \nGrade 3 259 0.59 0.39-0.9 \nMenopausal status   \nPre-Menopausal 285 0.64 0.40-1 \nPost-Menopausal 254 0.72 0.47-1.12 \n*a hazard ratio (TAC/FAC) of less than 1 indicates that TAC is associated with a longer disease free survival \ncompared to FAC. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n170 \n\nExploratory subgroup analyses for  disease-free survival for  patients who meet the 2009 St. Gallen \nchemotherapy criteria \u2013 (ITT population) were performed and presented here below: \n \n  \n\nTAC \n \n\nFAC \nHazard ratio \n(TAC/FAC) \n\n \n \n\nSubgroups (n=539) (n=521) (95% CI) p-value\n \nMeeting relative indication \nfor chemotherapy a \n\n    \n\n \nNo \n\n \n18/214 \n(8.4%)\n\n \n26/227 \n(11.5%)\n\n \n0.796 (0.434 - 1.459) \n\n \n0.4593 \n\n \nYes \n\n \n48/325 \n(14.8%)\n\n \n69/294 \n(23.5%)\n\n \n0.606 (0.42 - 0.877) \n\n \n0.0072 \n\nTAC = docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \nFAC = 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \nCI = confidence interval \nER = eostrogen receptor \nPR = progesterone receptor \na ER/PR-negative or Grade 3 or tumour size >5 cm \n \nThe estimated hazard ratio was using Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as the \nfactor. \n \nTAXOTERE as single agent \n \nTwo randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or \n392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the \nrecommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks. \n \nIn alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). \nWithout affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p = 0.38) or \ntime to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p = 0.54), docetaxel increased \nresponse rate (52% vs. 37%, p = 0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, \np = 0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas \n15 doxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart \nfailure). \n \nIn anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and \nvinblastine (12 mg/m\u00b2 every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate \n(33% vs. 12%, p < 0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p = 0.0004) and \nprolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p = 0.01). \n \nDuring these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety profile \nobserved in phase II studies (see section 4.8).  \n \nAn open-label, multi-centre, randomised phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel \nmonotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous \ntherapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomised to receive \neither docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m\u00b2 as a 3 hour \ninfusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. \nWithout affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p = 0.10), docetaxel \nprolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p < 0.01) and median survival \n(15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p = 0.03). \nMore grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to \npaclitaxel (23.0%).  \n\n\n\n \n\n171 \n\n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin \n \nOne large randomised phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic \ndisease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m\u00b2) \n(AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m\u00b2) \n(AC arm). Both regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks. \n \n\uf0b7 Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.0138. \nThe median TTP was 37.3 weeks (95% CI: 33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95% CI: \n27.4 - 36.0) in AC arm. \n\uf0b7 Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.009. \nThe ORR was 59.3% (95% CI: 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95% CI: 39.8 - 53.2) in AC arm. \n \nIn this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile \nneutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia \n(8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a \nhigher incidence of severe anaemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher \nincidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF \ndecrease \uf0b3 20% (13.1% versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease \uf0b3 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic \ndeaths occurred in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm \n(1 due to septic shock and 3 due to congestive heart failure). \nIn both arms, quality of life measured by the EORTC questionnaire was comparable and stable during \ntreatment and follow-up. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with trastuzumab \n \nDocetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy \nfor metastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomised to receive docetaxel \n(100 mg/m2) with or without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant \nchemotherapy. Docetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had \nreceived prior adjuvant anthracyclines. The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in \nthis pivotal study was immunohistochemistry (IHC). A minority of patients were tested using \nfluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, 87% of patients had disease that was IHC 3+, \nand 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive.

In this \nstudy, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous \ninfusion every 3 weeks) and capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week \nrest period). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m2 as a 1 hour \nintravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine \ncombination arm (p = 0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days \n(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator \nassessment) were 41.6% (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to \nprogressive disease was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p < 0.0001).

In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, \nand WHO performance status 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two treatment arms. Patients on the \ndocetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m2 followed by \n5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m2 per day as a continuous infusion for 5 days. This regimen was \nadministered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response (\u2265 25% reduction in \nbidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with \na minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not \nprogress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (TPF/RT). \nPatients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) \n\n\n\n \n\n178 \n\n1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case \nat least a minor response (\u2265 25% reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed \nafter 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval \nof 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to \ninstitutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either \nwith a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to \n70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum \ninterfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of 70 Gy was recommended for accelerated \nregimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical resection was allowed following \nchemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm received antibiotic prophylaxis \nwith ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. \nThe primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was significantly longer in the \nTPF arm compared to the PF arm, p = 0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4 vs. 8.3 months respectively) with an \noverall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall survival was also significantly longer in \nfavour of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median OS: 18.6 vs. 14.5 months respectively) with a \n28% risk reduction of mortality, p = 0.0128.

In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and \na WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two arms. The study population \ncomprised patients with technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure \nand patients aiming at organ preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival \nendpoints and the success of organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel \narm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m\u00b2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) \n100 mg/m\u00b2 administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous \nintravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles were \nrepeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to receive \nchemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT). Patients on the comparator arm received \ncisplatin (P) 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by the \ncontinuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 5. The cycles \nwere repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to \nreceive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT).  \nPatients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy \nwith a minimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to \nday 56 of last cycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour \nintravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses. Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment \nusing once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of \n70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at any time \nfollowing completion of CRT. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the study received \nprophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, overall survival (OS) was \nsignificantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxel-containing regimen compared to PF \n(median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk reduction in mortality compared \nto PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) with an overall median \nfollow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% risk reduction of \nprogression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF and 13.1 for \nPF).

The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel \nfrom the peripheral compartment.  \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one-hour infusion a mean peak plasma \nlevel of 3.7 \u00b5g/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h.\u00b5g/ml. Mean values for total body \nclearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter \nindividual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% \nbound to plasma proteins. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n181 \n\nElimination \n \nA study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in \nboth the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl \nester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of \nthe administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is \nexcreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites \nand very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge and gender \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. \nPharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I \nstudies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a small number of patients (n = 23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver \nfunction impairment (ALT, AST \uf0b3 1.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase \uf0b3\n 2.5 times the ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2).  \n \nFluid retention \nDocetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are \nno data available in patients with severe fluid retention. \n \nCombination therapy \n \nDoxorubicin \nWhen used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma \nlevels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin \nand cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their co-administration. \n \nCapecitabine \nPhase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa \nshowed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no \neffect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5\u2019-DFUR. \n \nCisplatin \nClearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following \nmonotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is \nsimilar to that observed with cisplatin alone. \n \nCisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nThe combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid \ntumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product. \n \nPrednisone and dexamethasone \nThe effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard \ndexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients.  \n \nPrednisone \nNo effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n182 \n\nDocetaxel has been shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro micronucleus and chromosome aberration \ntest in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. However, it did not induce \nmutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. These results are consistent \nwith the pharmacological activity of docetaxel. \n \nUndesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair \nmale fertility. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with: \n\n\uf0b7 operable node-positive breast cancer \n\uf0b7 operable node-negative breast cancer  \n\n \nFor patients with operable node-negative breast cancer, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to \npatients eligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary \ntherapy of early breast cancer (see section 5.1). \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this \ncondition. \n \nTAXOTERE monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have \nincluded an anthracycline or an alkylating agent. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer whose tumours over express HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy \nfor metastatic disease. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy should \nhave included an anthracycline. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n186 \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nTAXOTERE is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small \ncell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable, \nlocally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously \nreceived chemotherapy for this condition. \n \nProstate cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients \nwith  metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), with or without prednisone or \nprednisolone, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate \ncancer. \n \n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of patients \nwith metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, \nwho have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. \n \nHead and neck cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment \nof patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the \nuse of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \nPosology \n \nFor breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral \ncorticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to \ndocetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4).  \nFor metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or \nprednisolone the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours \nand 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). \nFor metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, irrespective of the concurrent use of prednisone or \nprednisolone, the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg 12 hours, 3 hours, \nand 1 hour before docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). \n \nProphylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. \n \nDocetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks. \n \nBreast cancer \nIn the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the recommended \ndose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide \n500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment).  \n\n\n\n \n\n187 \n\nFor the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose \nof docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is given in \ncombination therapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2).  \n \nIn combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 every three weeks, \nwith trastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started \nthe day following the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered \nimmediately after completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was \nwell tolerated. For trastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nIn combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, \ncombined with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks \nfollowed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, \nsee capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nIn chemotherapy na\u00efve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen \nis docetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment \nafter failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m\u00b2 as a single \nagent. \n \nProstate cancer  \nMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily \nis administered continuously (see section 5.1). \n \nMetastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Prednisone or \nprednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily may be administered continuously. \n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin \n75 mg/m2, as a 1- to 3-hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 per \nday given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. \nTreatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and \nappropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the \nrisk of haematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). \n \nHead and neck cancer \nPatients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after \ncisplatin administration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological \ntoxicities. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, received \nprophylactic antibiotics. \n \n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) \n\nFor the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head \nand neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion \nfollowed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a \ncontinuous infusion at 750 mg/m2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every \n3 weeks for 4 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy.  \n\n \n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) \n\nFor the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low \nprobability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the \nhead and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous \ninfusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute to 3-hour \n\n\n\n \n\n188 \n\ninfusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion from day 1 to day 4. \nThis regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should \nreceive chemoradiotherapy. \n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose modifications, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nGeneral  \nDocetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is \uf0b3 1,500 cells/mm3.  \nIn patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3 for more than \none week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel \ntherapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from 75 to \n60 mg/m\u00b2. If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m\u00b2, the treatment should be \ndiscontinued.  \n \nAdjuvant therapy for breast cancer \nPrimary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide (TAC) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Patients who experience febrile \nneutropenia and/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m\u00b2 in all \nsubsequent cycles (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should \nhave their dose decreased to 60 mg/m\u00b2. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin \nFor patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose \nnadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who \nexperience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel \ndose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2. For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the \ncorresponding summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with capecitabine \n\uf0b7 For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n\uf0b7 For patients developing the first appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the \n\nnext docetaxel/capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and resume at \n100% of the original dose.  \n\n\uf0b7 For patients developing the second appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of \nGrade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1 \nand then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/m\u00b2.  \n\n\uf0b7 For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the docetaxel \ndose. \n\n \nFor trastuzumab dose modifications, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nIf an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite \nG-CSF use, the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. If subsequent episodes of \ncomplicated neutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m2. In case of \nGrade 4 thrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. Patients should \nnot be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level \n> 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. Discontinue treatment if these \ntoxicities persist (see section 4.4). \nRecommended dose modifications for toxicities in patients treated with docetaxel in combination with \ncisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): \n \n\nToxicity Dose adjustment \nDiarrhoea grade 3  First episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%.\n\n\n\n \n\n189 \n\nSecond episode: then reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\nDiarrhoea grade 4 First episode: reduce docetaxel and 5-FU doses by 20%. \n\nSecond episode: discontinue treatment.\nStomatitis/mucositis \ngrade 3  \n\nFirst episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%. \nSecond episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. \nThird episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\n\nStomatitis/mucositis \ngrade 4 \n\nFirst episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. \nSecond episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.\n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose adjustments, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nIn the pivotal SCCHN studies patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide \nprophylactic coverage (eg, day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nBased on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent, patients who have both \nelevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal \nrange (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of \ndocetaxel is 75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin > ULN and/or \nALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase > 6 times the ULN, no dose-\nreduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated.  \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of TAXOTERE in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 1 month to less \nthan 18 years have not yet been established. \nThere is no relevant use of TAXOTERE in the paediatric population in the indications breast cancer, \nnon-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not including \ntype II and III less differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma.  \n \nOlder people \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the older \npeople. \nIn combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of \ncapecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \nMethod of administration \nFor instructions on preparation and administration of the product, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nPatients with baseline neutrophil count of < 1,500 cells/mm3. \n \nPatients with severe liver impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nContraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. \n\n\n\n \n\n190 \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as \ndexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel \nadministration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well \nas the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral \ndexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2).  \n \nHaematology \n \nNeutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median \nof 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of \ncomplete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be \nretreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level \uf0b3 1,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). \n \nIn the case of severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of \ndocetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate \nsymptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile \nneutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic \nG-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of \ncomplicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). \nPatients receiving TCF should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), \nfebrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received \nprimary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive \nadjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile \nneutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be \nclosely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nGastrointestinal reactions \n\n \nCaution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing \ngastrointestinal complications. Although majority of cases occurred during the first or second cycle of \ndocetaxel containing regimen, enterocolitis could develop at any time, and could lead to death as early \nas on the first day of onset. Patients should be closely monitored for early manifestations of serious \ngastrointestinal toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.4 Haematology, and 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nPatients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and \nsecond infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation \nof the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should \nbe available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised \ncutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe \nhypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of \ndocetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions \nshould not be re-challenged with docetaxel. Patients who have previously experienced a \nhypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may be at risk to develop hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, \nincluding more severe hypersensitivity reaction. These patients should be closely monitored during \ninitiation of docetaxel therapy. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n191 \n\nCutaneous reactions \n \nLocalised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema \nfollowed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by \ndesquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see \nsection 4.2).  \n\nSevere Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic \nEpidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) have been \nreported with docetaxel treatment. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of \nserious skin manifestations and closely monitored. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions \nappear discontinuation of docetaxel should be considered. \n\n \nFluid retention \n \nPatients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be \nmonitored closely. \n \nRespiratory disorders \n \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, \npulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure have been reported and may be associated with fatal \noutcome. Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant \nradiotherapy. \nIf new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly \ninvestigated, and appropriately treated. Interruption of docetaxel therapy is recommended until \ndiagnosis is available. Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition. The \nbenefit of resuming docetaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. \n \nPatients with liver impairment \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels \n(ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels \ngreater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as \ntoxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, \ninfections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel \nin those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at \nbaseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). \nFor patients with serum bilirubin levels > ULN and/or ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN concurrent \nwith serum alkaline phosphatase levels > 6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended \nand docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nThere are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel.  \n \nNervous system \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n192 \n\nCardiac toxicity \n \nHeart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, \nparticularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may \nbe moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). \n \nWhen patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they \nshould undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during \ntreatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For \nmore details see summary of product characteristics of trastuzumab. \n \nVentricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (sometimes fatal) has been reported in \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and/ or \ncyclophosphamide (see section 4.8).  \nBaseline cardiac assessment is recommended. \n \nEye disorders \n \nCystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with \nimpaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examination. In case CMO is \ndiagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated (see section \n4.8). \n \nSecond primary malignancies \n \nSecond primary malignancies have been reported when docetaxel was given in combination with \nanticancer treatments known to be associated with second primary malignancies. Second primary \nmalignancies (including acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin \nlymphoma) may occur several months or years after docetaxel-containing therapy. Patients should be \nmonitored for second primary malignancies (see section 4.8). \n \nTumour Lysis Syndrome \n \nTumour lysis syndrome has been reported with docetaxel after the first or the second cycle (see section \n4.8). Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome (e.g. with renal impairment, hyperuricemia, bulky \ntumour, rapid progression) should be closely monitored. Correction of dehydration and treatment of \nhigh uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of treatment. \n \nOthers \n \nContraceptive measures must be taken by both men and women during treatment and for men at least  \n6 months after cessation of therapy (see section 4.6). \n \nThe concomitant use of docetaxel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nclarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and \nvoriconazole) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nAdditional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \n \nComplicated neutropenia \nFor patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or \ninfection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n193 \n\nGastrointestinal reactions \nSymptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, \nmay be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated \npromptly. \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) \nPatients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the \nfollow up period. In patients treated with the TAC regimen for node positive breast cancer, the risk of \nCHF has been shown to be higher during the first year after treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nPatients with 4+ nodes \nAs the benefit observed in patient with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on disease-free \nsurvival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with \n4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis (see section 5.1). \n \nElderly \n \nCautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \nThere are limited data available in patients > 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with \ndoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n \nCautions for use in castration-resistant prostate cancer \nOf the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study (TAX 327), \n209 patients were 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients \ntreated with docetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate \n\uf0b3 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The \nincidence of related fever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates \uf0b3 10% higher \nin patients who were 75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years. \n \nCautions for use in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer \nOf the 545 patients treated with docetaxel every 3 weeks in a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer study \n(STAMPEDE), 296 patients were 65 years of age or older, and 48 patients were 75 years of age or \nolder. More patients aged \u226565 years in the docetaxel arm reported hypersensitivity reaction, \nneutropenia, anaemia, fluid retention, dyspnea, and nail changes when compared to the patients aged \nless than 65 years. None of these increases in frequency reached 10% difference with the control arm. \nIn patients who were 75 years of age or older, when compared to younger patients, neutropenia, \nanaemia, diarrhea, dyspnea and upper respiratory tract infection were reported with a greater incidence \n(at least 10% higher).  \n \n \nCautions for use in gastric adenocarcinoma cancer \nAmong the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer \nstudy, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of \nserious adverse events was higher in older people compared to younger patients. The incidence of the \nfollowing adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection occurred at rates \n\uf0b3 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients.  \nOlder people treated with TCF should be closely monitored. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains 50 vol % ethanol anhydrous (alcohol), i.e. up to 3.16 g ethanol \nanhydrous per vial, equivalent to 80 ml of beer or 33 ml wine. \nHarmful for those suffering from alcoholism.  \nTo be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups such as \npatients with liver disease, or epilepsy. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n194 \n\nConsideration should be given to possible effects on the central nervous system. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other medicinal products. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant \nadministration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the \nenzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, ketoconazole and erythromycin. As \na result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal products as \nconcomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. \n \nIn case of combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the occurrence of docetaxel adverse reactions may \nincrease, as a result of reduced metabolism. If the concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., \nketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, \ntelithromycin and voriconazole) cannot be avoided, a close clinical surveillance is warranted and a \ndose-adjustment of docetaxel may be suitable during the treatment with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor \n(see section 4.4). In a pharmacokinetic study with 7 patients, the co-administration of docetaxel with \nthe strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole leads to a significant decrease in docetaxel clearance by \n49%. \nDocetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic \nprostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. \nNo statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \nDocetaxel is highly protein bound (> 95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with \nconcomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions \nwith tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, \nphenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of \ndocetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not \ninfluence the binding of digitoxin. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their \nco-administration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction \nbetween docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was \nabout 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be \nboth embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats, and to reduce fertility in rats. As with other \ncytotoxic medicinal products, docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant \nwomen. Therefore, docetaxel must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated. \n \nWomen of childbearing age receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant, and to \ninform the treating physician immediately should this occur. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nDocetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. \nConsequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be \ndiscontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nAn effective method of contraception should be used during treatment. \n\n\n\n \n\n195 \n\n \nFertility \n \nIn non clinical studies, docetaxel has genotoxic effects and may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). \nTherefore, men being treated with docetaxel are advised not to father a child during and up to \n6 months after treatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The amount of \nalcohol in this medicinal product and the side effects of the product may impair the ability to drive or \nuse machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Therefore, patients should be warned of the potential impact \nof the amount of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal product on the ability to drive or use \nmachines, and be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience these side effects during \ntreatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile for all indications \n \nThe adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel \nhave been obtained in:  \n\n\uf0b7 1312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/m\u00b2 and 75 mg/m\u00b2 of docetaxel as a single agent \nrespectively. \n\n\uf0b7 258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin.  \n\uf0b7 406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin.  \n\uf0b7 92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab.  \n\uf0b7 255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. \n\uf0b7 332 patients (TAX327) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or \n\nprednisolone (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\uf0b7 1276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received \n\ndocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important \ntreatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\uf0b7 300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and \n79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and \n5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\uf0b7 174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with \ncisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are \npresented). \n\n\uf0b7 545 patients (STAMPEDE study) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or \nprednisolone ADT. \n\n \nThese reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; \ngrade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4), the COSTART and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available \ndata). \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was \nreversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe \nneutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea \nand asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in \ncombination with other chemotherapeutic agents. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n196 \n\nFor combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in \u2265 10% are displayed. There \nwas an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the \ntrastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. \n \nFor combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects (\u2265 5%) \nreported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see \ncapecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \nFor combination with ADT and with prednisone or prednisolone (STAMPEDE study), adverse events \noccurring over the 6 cycles of treatment with docetaxel and having at least 2% higher incidence in the \ndocetaxel treatment arm by comparison to the control arm, are presented, using the CTCAE grading \nscale. \n \nThe following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel: \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the \ninfusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms \nwere flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills. \nSevere reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized \nrash/erythema (see section 4.4). \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paresthesia, dysesthesia or pain \nincluding burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nReversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to \nmoderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and \nhands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently \nassociated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. \nLess frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to \ninterruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe \nnail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis.  \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nInfusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, \nredness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein. \nFluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, \npericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The peripheral oedema usually starts at the lower \nextremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of 3 kg or more. Fluid retention is \ncumulative in incidence and severity (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions in breast cancer for TAXOTERE 100 mg/m\u00b2 single agent \n \nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions \n \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nInfections (G3/4: 5.7%; \nincluding sepsis and \npneumonia, fatal in \n1.7%)  \n\nInfection associated \nwith G4 neutropenia \n(G3/4: 4.6%) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n197 \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions \n \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions \n \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nNeutropenia (G4: \n76.4%);  \nAnaemia (G3/4: 8.9%); \nFebrile neutropenia\n\nThrombocytopenia (G4: \n0.2%) \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nHypersensitivity (G3/4: \n5.3%) \n\n  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nAnorexia   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nPeripheral sensory \nneuropathy (G3: 4.1%); \nPeripheral motor \nneuropathy (G3/4: 4%); \nDysgeusia (severe: \n0.07%) \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders  Arrhythmia (G3/4: \n0.7%)\n\nCardiac failure \n\nVascular disorders  Hypotension;  \nHypertension; \nHaemorrhage\n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDyspnoea (severe: \n2.7%) \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nStomatitis (G3/4: \n5.3%);  \nDiarrhoea (G3/4: 4%);  \nNausea (G3/4: 4%);  \nVomiting (G3/4: 3%) \n\nConstipation (severe: \n0.2%);  \nAbdominal pain \n(severe: 1%);  \nGastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage (severe: \n0.3%)\n\nOesophagitis (severe: \n0.4%) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nAlopecia;  \nSkin reaction (G3/4: \n5.9%);  \nNail disorders (severe: \n2.6%) \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nMyalgia (severe: 1.4%) Arthralgia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nFluid retention (severe: \n6.5%); \nAsthenia (severe: \n11.2%);  \nPain \n\nInfusion site reaction;  \nNon-cardiac chest pain \n(severe: 0.4%) \n\n \n\nInvestigations  G3/4 Blood bilirubin \nincreased (< 5%); \nG3/4 Blood alkaline \nphosphatase increased \n(< 4%);  \nG3/4 AST increased \n(< 3%); \nG3/4 ALT increased \n(< 2%)\n\n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for TAXOTERE 100 mg/m2 single agent \n\n\n\n \n\n198 \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nRare: bleeding episodes associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. \n \nNervous system disorders \nReversibility data are available among 35.3% of patients who developed neurotoxicity following \ndocetaxel treatment at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent.

Note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a dose of 100 mg/m2 is \nknown to result in neutropenia in 97% of patients, 76% grade 4, based on nadir blood counts. The \nincidence of febrile neutropenia/neutropenic sepsis was also increased in patients treated with \nHerceptin plus docetaxel (23% versus 17% for patients treated with docetaxel alone). \n \nCardiac disorders \nSymptomatic cardiac failure was reported in 2.2% of the patients who received docetaxel plus \ntrastuzumab compared to 0% of patients given docetaxel alone. In the docetaxel plus trastuzumab arm, \n64% had received a prior anthracycline as adjuvant therapy compared with 55% in the docetaxel arm \nalone. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions in breast cancer for TAXOTERE 75 mg/m\u00b2 in combination with \ncapecitabine \n \nMedDRA system organ classes Very common adverse \n\nreactions \n \n\nCommon adverse reactions \n \n\nInfections and infestations  Oral candidiasis (G3/4: < 1%)\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nNeutropenia (G3/4: 63%);

These reactions sometimes appear during the infusion of the medicinal product. \n \nEye disorders \nVery rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring \nduring infusion of the medicinal product and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been \nreported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of lacrimation with or \nwithout conjunctivitis, as cases of lacrimal duct obstruction resulting in excessive tearing have been \nrarely reported.

Tumour lysis syndrome, potentially fatal, has been reported (frequency not known). \n \n\nMusculoskeletal disorder \nMyositis has been reported with docetaxel (frequency not known). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of \noverdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In \ncases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated \ncomplications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and \nmucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. \nOther appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Taxanes, ATC Code: L01CD02 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n213 \n\nMechanism of action \n \nDocetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable \nmicrotubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The \nbinding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for \nvital mitotic and interphase cellular functions.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDocetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and \nagainst freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular \nconcentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some \nbut not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance \ngene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental anti-tumour \nactivity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours. \nmulti \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nBreast cancer \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy \n \nPatients with operable node-positive breast cancer (TAX 316) \n \nData from a multi-centre open label randomised study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS \uf0b3 80%, between 18 and \n70 years of age. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 4+), \n1491 patients were randomised to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after \ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 \nfollowed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC arm). Both regimens \nwere administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, \nall other medicinal products were given as intravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as \nsecondary prophylaxis to patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, \nprolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on the TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with \nciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In \nboth arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive eostrogen and/or progesterone \nreceptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed \naccording to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who \nreceived TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. Two interim analyses and one final analysis \nwere performed. The first interim analysis was planned 3 years after the date when half of study \nenrolment was done. The second interim analysis was done after 400 DFS events had been recorded \noverall, which led to a median follow-up of 55 months. The final analysis was performed when all \npatients had reached their 10-year follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-\nup before). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) \nwas the secondary efficacy endpoint. \n \nA final analysis was performed with an actual median follow up of 96 months. Significantly longer \ndisease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of \nrelapses at 10 years was reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC \n(39% versus 45%, respectively) i.e. an absolute risk reduction by 6% (p = 0.0043). Overall survival at \n10 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (76% versus 69%, respectively) \ni.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death by 7% (p = 0.002). As the benefit observed in patients \nwith 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on DFS and OS, the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC \nin patients with 4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n214 \n\nOverall, the study results demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC.  \n \nTAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were \nanalysed: \n \n\n  Disease free survival Overall survival \nPatient subset Number \n\nof \npatients \n\nHazard \nratio* \n\n95% CI p = Hazard \nratio* \n\n95% CI p = \n\nNo of positive \nnodes \n\n       \n\nOverall 745 0.80 0.68-0.93 0.0043 0.74 0.61-0.90 0.0020\n1-3 467 0.72 0.58-0.91 0.0047 0.62 0.46-0.82 0.0008\n4+ 278 0.87 0.70-1.09 0.2290 0.87 0.67-1.12 0.2746\n\n*a hazard ratio of less than 1 indicates that TAC is associated with a longer disease-free survival and \noverall survival compared to FAC \n \nPatients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy (GEICAM 9805)  \n \nData from a multi-centre open label randomised trial support the use of TAXOTERE for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy . \n1060 patients were randomised to receive either TAXOTERE 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after \ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in TAC arm), or doxorubicin \n50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (521 patients in \nFAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node-negative breast cancer patients with high risk of \nrelapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour size >2 cm and/or negative ER and PR and/or \nhigh histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age <35 years).). Both regimens were \nadministered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. TAXOTERE was administered as a 1-hour infusion, all \nother medicinal products were given intraveinously on day 1 every three weeks. Primary prophylactic \nG-CSF was made mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients were randomised. The incidence of \nGrade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection was decreased in patients who \nreceived primary G-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, after the last cycle of \nchemotherapy, patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 20 mg once a day for up to \n5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was administered according to guidelines in place at participating \ninstitutions and was given to 57.3% of patients who received TAC and 51.2% of patients who received \nFAC. \n \nOne primary analysis and one updated analysis were performed. The primary analysis was done when \nall patients had a follow-up of greater than 5 years (median follow-up time of 77 months). The updated \nanalysis was performed when all patients had reached their 10-year (median follow up time of 10 \nyears and 5 months) follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-up \npreviously). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) \nwas the secondary efficacy endpoint. \n \nAt the median follow-up time of 77 months, significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm \ncompared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of \nrelapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). At the \nmedian follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 16,5% reduction in the \nrisk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI (0.65-1.08), \np=0.1646). DFS data were not statistically significant but were still associated with a positive trend in \nfavour of TAC.   \n \nAt the median follow-up time of 77 months, overall survival (OS) was longer in the TAC arm with \nTAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard \nratio = 0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29). However, the distribution of OS was not significantly \ndifferent between the 2 groups. \n\n\n\n \n\n215 \n\nAt the median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 9% reduction in \nthe risk of death compared to FAC-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% CI (0.63-1.32)).  \nThe survival rate was 93.7% in the TAC arm and 91.4 % in the FAC arm, at the 8-year follow-up time \npoint, and 91.3 % in the TAC arm and 89 % in the FAC arm, at the 10-year follow-up time point. \n \nThe positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC remained unchanged.   \n \nTAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were analysed \nin the primary analysis (at the median follow-up time of 77 months) (see table below): \n \nSubset Analyses-Adjuvant Therapy in Patients with Node-negative Breast Cancer Study  \n(Intent-to-Treat Analysis) \n\n \n  Disease Free Survival \nPatient subset Number of patients \n\nin TAC group \nHazard ratio* 95% CI \n\nOverall 539 0.68 0.49-0.93 \nAge category 1   \n<50 years 260 0.67 0.43-1.05 \n\u226550 years 279 0.67 0.43-1.05 \nAge category 2   \n<35 years 42 0.31 0.11-0.89 \n\u226535 years 497 0.73 0.52-1.01 \nHormonal receptor \nstatus \n\n   \n\nNegative 195 0.7 0.45-1.1 \nPositive 344 0.62 0.4-0.97 \nTumour size    \n\uf0a32 cm 285 0.69 0.43-1.1 \n>2 cm 254 0.68 0.45-1.04 \nHistological grade   \nGrade1 (includes grade \nnot assessed) \n\n64 0.79 0.24-2.6 \n\nGrade 2 216 0.77 0.46-1.3 \nGrade 3 259 0.59 0.39-0.9 \nMenopausal status   \nPre-Menopausal 285 0.64 0.40-1 \nPost-Menopausal 254 0.72 0.47-1.12 \n*a hazard ratio (TAC/FAC) of less than 1 indicates that TAC is associated with a longer disease free survival \ncompared to FAC. \n \nExploratory subgroup analyses for  disease-free survival for  patients who meet the 2009 St. Gallen \nchemotherapy criteria \u2013 (ITT population) were performed and presented here below: \n \n  \n\nTAC \n \n\nFAC \nHazard ratio \n(TAC/FAC) \n\n \n \n\nSubgroups (n=539) (n=521) (95% CI) p-value\n \nMeeting relative indication \nfor chemotherapy a \n\n    \n\n \nNo \n\n \n18/214 \n(8.4%)\n\n \n26/227 \n(11.5%)\n\n \n0.796 (0.434 - 1.459) \n\n \n0.4593 \n\n \nYes \n\n \n48/325 \n(14.8%)\n\n \n69/294 \n(23.5%)\n\n \n0.606 (0.42 - 0.877) \n\n \n0.0072 \n\nTAC = docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \n\n\n\n \n\n216 \n\nFAC = 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \nCI = confidence interval \nER = eostrogen receptor \nPR = progesterone receptor \na ER/PR-negative or Grade 3 or tumour size >5 cm \n \nThe estimated hazard ratio was using Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as the \nfactor. \n \nTAXOTERE as single agent \n \nTwo randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or \n392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the \nrecommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks. \n \nIn alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). \nWithout affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p = 0.38) or \ntime to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p = 0.54), docetaxel increased \nresponse rate (52% vs. 37%, p = 0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, \np = 0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas \n15 doxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart \nfailure). \n \nIn anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and \nvinblastine (12 mg/m\u00b2 every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate \n(33% vs. 12%, p < 0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p = 0.0004) and \nprolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p = 0.01). \n \nDuring these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety profile \nobserved in phase II studies (see section 4.8).  \n \nAn open-label, multi-centre, randomised phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel \nmonotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous \ntherapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomised to receive \neither docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m\u00b2 as a 3 hour \ninfusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. \nWithout affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p = 0.10), docetaxel \nprolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p < 0.01) and median survival \n(15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p = 0.03). \nMore grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to \npaclitaxel (23.0%).  \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin \n \nOne large randomised phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic \ndisease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m\u00b2) \n(AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m\u00b2) \n(AC arm). Both regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks. \n \n\uf0b7 Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.0138. \nThe median TTP was 37.3 weeks (95% CI: 33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95% CI: \n27.4 - 36.0) in AC arm. \n\uf0b7 Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.009. \nThe ORR was 59.3% (95% CI: 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95% CI: 39.8 - 53.2) in AC arm. \n \nIn this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile \nneutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia \n\n\n\n \n\n217 \n\n(8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a \nhigher incidence of severe anaemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher \nincidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF \ndecrease \uf0b3 20% (13.1% versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease \uf0b3 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic \ndeaths occurred in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm \n(1 due to septic shock and 3 due to congestive heart failure). \nIn both arms, quality of life measured by the EORTC questionnaire was comparable and stable during \ntreatment and follow-up. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with trastuzumab \n \nDocetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy \nfor metastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomised to receive docetaxel \n(100 mg/m2) with or without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant \nchemotherapy. Docetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had \nreceived prior adjuvant anthracyclines. The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in \nthis pivotal study was immunohistochemistry (IHC). A minority of patients were tested using \nfluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, 87% of patients had disease that was IHC 3+, \nand 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive.

In this \nstudy, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous \ninfusion every 3 weeks) and capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week \nrest period). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m2 as a 1 hour \nintravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine \ncombination arm (p = 0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days \n(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator \nassessment) were 41.6% (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to \nprogressive disease was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p < 0.0001). The \nmedian time to progression was 186 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nPatients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy \n \n\n\n\n \n\n218 \n\nIn a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) \nand overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to Best Supportive \nCare. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). \nThere was less use of morphinic analgesic (p < 0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p < 0.01), other \ndisease-related medicinal products (p = 0.06) and radiotherapy (p < 0.01) in patients treated with \ndocetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to those with BSC. \nThe overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was \n26.1 weeks. \n \nTAXOTERE in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients \n \nIn a phase III study, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or \ngreater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either \ndocetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/m2 over \n30-60 minutes every 3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with \ncarboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ml.min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2 \nadministered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on \nday 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks (VCis). \n \nSurvival data, median time to progression and response rates for two arms of the study are illustrated \nin the following table: \n \n\n TCis \nn = 408\n\nVCis \nn = 404\n\nStatistical analysis \n\nOverall survival  \n(Primary end-point):\n\n   \n\nMedian survival (months) 11.3 10.1 Hazard Ratio: 1.122 \n[97.2% CI: 0.937; 1.342]*\n\n1-year Survival (%) 46 41 Treatment difference: 5.4% \n[95% CI: -1.1; 12.0] \n\n2-year Survival (%) 21 14 Treatment difference: 6.2% \n[95% CI: 0.2; 12.3] \n\nMedian time to progression \n(weeks): \n\n \n22.0 \n\n \n23.0 \n\n \nHazard Ratio: 1.032 \n\n[95% CI: 0.876; 1.216] \nOverall response rate (%): 31.6 24.5 Treatment difference: 7.1% \n\n[95% CI: 0.7; 13.5] \n*: Corrected for multiple comparisons and adjusted for stratification factors (stage of disease and \nregion of treatment), based on evaluable patient population. \n\n \nSecondary end-points included change of pain, global rating of quality of life by EuroQoL-5D, Lung \nCancer Symptom Scale, and changes in Karnosfky performance status. Results on these end-points \nwere supportive of the primary end-points results.  \n \nFor docetaxel/carboplatin combination, neither equivalent nor non-inferior efficacy could be proven \ncompared to the reference treatment combination VCis. \n \nProstate cancer \n \nMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer \n \nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone in patients with \nmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomised multi-centre phase III \nstudy (TAX 327). A total of 1006 patients with KPS \uf0b3 60 were randomised to the following treatment \ngroups: \n\uf0b7 Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. \n\n\n\n \n\n219 \n\n\uf0b7 Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 administered weekly for the first 5 weeks in a 6 week cycle for 5 cycles. \n\uf0b7 Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. \nAll 3 regimens were administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily, \ncontinuously. \n \nPatients who received docetaxel every three weeks demonstrated significantly longer overall survival \ncompared to those treated with mitoxantrone.

In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, \nand WHO performance status 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two treatment arms. Patients on the \ndocetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m2 followed by \n5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m2 per day as a continuous infusion for 5 days. This regimen was \nadministered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response (\u2265 25% reduction in \nbidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with \na minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not \nprogress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (TPF/RT). \nPatients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) \n\n\n\n \n\n223 \n\n1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case \nat least a minor response (\u2265 25% reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed \nafter 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval \nof 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to \ninstitutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either \nwith a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to \n70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum \ninterfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of 70 Gy was recommended for accelerated \nregimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical resection was allowed following \nchemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm received antibiotic prophylaxis \nwith ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. \nThe primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was significantly longer in the \nTPF arm compared to the PF arm, p = 0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4 vs. 8.3 months respectively) with an \noverall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall survival was also significantly longer in \nfavour of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median OS: 18.6 vs. 14.5 months respectively) with a \n28% risk reduction of mortality, p = 0.0128.

Pain intensity score improved during treatment in both groups indicating adequate \npain management. \n \n\uf0b7 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX324) \nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced \nsquamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a randomised, multi-centre \nopen-label, phase III study (TAX324). In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and \na WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two arms. The study population \ncomprised patients with technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure \nand patients aiming at organ preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival \nendpoints and the success of organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel \narm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m\u00b2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) \n100 mg/m\u00b2 administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous \nintravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles were \nrepeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to receive \nchemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT). Patients on the comparator arm received \ncisplatin (P) 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by the \ncontinuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 5. The cycles \nwere repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to \nreceive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT).  \nPatients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy \nwith a minimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to \nday 56 of last cycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour \nintravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses. Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment \nusing once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of \n70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at any time \nfollowing completion of CRT. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the study received \nprophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, overall survival (OS) was \nsignificantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxel-containing regimen compared to PF \n(median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk reduction in mortality compared \nto PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) with an overall median \nfollow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% risk reduction of \nprogression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF and 13.1 for \nPF). This was also statistically significant with an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; log-rank test \np = 0.004.

The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent \nwith a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half-lives for the \uf061, \uf062 and \uf067 phases of 4 min, \n36 min and 11.1 h, respectively. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel \nfrom the peripheral compartment.  \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one-hour infusion a mean peak plasma \nlevel of 3.7 \u00b5g/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h.\u00b5g/ml. Mean values for total body \nclearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter \nindividual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% \nbound to plasma proteins. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n226 \n\nElimination \n \nA study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in \nboth the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl \nester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of \nthe administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is \nexcreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites \nand very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge and gender \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. \nPharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I \nstudies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a small number of patients (n = 23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver \nfunction impairment (ALT, AST \uf0b3 1.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase \uf0b3\n 2.5 times the ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2).  \n \nFluid retention \nDocetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are \nno data available in patients with severe fluid retention. \n \nCombination therapy \n \nDoxorubicin \nWhen used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma \nlevels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin \nand cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their co-administration. \n \nCapecitabine \nPhase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa \nshowed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no \neffect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5\u2019-DFUR. \n \nCisplatin \nClearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following \nmonotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is \nsimilar to that observed with cisplatin alone. \n \nCisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nThe combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid \ntumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product. \n \nPrednisone and dexamethasone \nThe effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard \ndexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients.  \n \nPrednisone \nNo effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n227 \n\nDocetaxel has been shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro micronucleus and chromosome aberration \ntest in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. However, it did not induce \nmutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. These results are consistent \nwith the pharmacological activity of docetaxel. \n \nUndesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair \nmale fertility. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nPolysorbate 80 \nEthanol anhydrous \nCitric acid \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf-life \n \nUnopened vial \n3 years \n \nAfter opening of the vial \nEach vial is for single use and should be used immediately after opening. If not used immediately, \nin-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.  \n \nOnce added to the infusion bag  \nFrom a microbiological point of view, reconstitution/dilution must take place in controlled and aseptic \nconditions and the medicinal product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use \nstorage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. \n \nOnce added as recommended into the infusion bag, the docetaxel infusion solution, if stored below \n25\u00b0C, is stable for 6 hours. It should be used within 6 hours (including the one hour infusion \nintravenous administration).  \n \nIn addition, physical and chemical in-use stability of the infusion solution prepared as recommended \nhas been demonstrated in non-PVC bags up to 48 hours when stored between 2 to 8\u00b0C.  \n \nDocetaxel infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time. If crystals appear, \nthe solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nDo not store above 25\u00b0C.  \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions of the diluted medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n228 \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n15 ml clear glass (type I) vial with a blue aluminium seal and blue plastic flip-off cap containing 8 ml \nof concentrate. \n \nEach box contains one vial. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nTAXOTERE is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should \nbe exercised when handling it and preparing TAXOTERE solutions. The use of gloves is \nrecommended. \n \nIf TAXOTERE concentrate or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, wash immediately \nand thoroughly with soap and water. If TAXOTERE concentrate or infusion solution should come into \ncontact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with water. \n \nPreparation for the intravenous administration \n \nPreparation of the infusion solution \nDO NOT use other docetaxel medicinal products consisting of 2 vials (concentrate and solvent) \nwith this medicinal product (TAXOTERE 160 mg/8 ml concentrate for solution for infusion, \nwhich contains only 1 vial). \n \nTAXOTERE 160 mg/8 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires NO prior dilution with a \nsolvent and is ready to add to the infusion solution. \n \nEach vial is of single use and should be used immediately. \n \nIf the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of boxes of TAXOTERE \nconcentrate for solution for infusion to stand below 25\u00b0C for 5 minutes before use. \nMore than one vial of TAXOTERE concentrate for solution for infusion may be necessary to obtain \nthe required dose for the patient. Aseptically withdraw the required amount of TAXOTERE \nconcentrate for solution for infusion using a calibrated syringe fitted with a 21G needle. \n \nIn TAXOTERE 160 mg/8 ml vial the concentration of docetaxel is 20 mg/ml. \nThe required volume of TAXOTERE concentrate for solution for infusion must be injected via a \nsingle injection (one shot) into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing either 5% glucose solution \nor sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. \n \nIf a dose greater than 190 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so \nthat a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded.  \n \nMix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n \nThe infusion bag solution should be used within 6 hours below 25\u00b0C including the one hour infusion \nto the patient. \n \nAs with all parenteral products, TAXOTERE infusion solution should be visually inspected prior to \nuse, solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n229 \n\n7.

FORMULATION \n \nTAXOTERE 20 mg/0.5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion is a clear viscous, yellow to brown-\nyellow solution containing 40 mg/ml docetaxel (anhydrous) in polysorbate 80 and citric acid. The \nsolvent for TAXOTERE is a 13% w/w solution of ethanol 95% in water for injections. \n \n \n2. PRESENTATION \n \nTAXOTERE is supplied as single-dose vials. \n \nEach box contains one TAXOTERE vial (20 mg/0.5 ml) and one corresponding solvent for \nTAXOTERE vial in a blister pack. \n \nTAXOTERE vials should be stored between 2\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C and protected from light. \nTAXOTERE should not be used after the expiry date shown on the carton, blister pack and vials. \n \n2.1 TAXOTERE 20 mg/0.5 ml vial \n \n\uf0b7 The TAXOTERE 20 mg/0.5 ml vial is a 7 ml clear glass vial with a green flip-off cap. \n \n\uf0b7 The TAXOTERE 20 mg/0.5 ml vial contains a solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 at a \n\nconcentration of 40 mg/ml. \n \n\uf0b7 Each TAXOTERE 20 mg/0.5 ml vial contains 0.5 ml of a 40 mg/ml solution of docetaxel in \n\npolysorbate 80 (fill volume: 24.4 mg/0.61 ml). This volume has been established during the \ndevelopment of TAXOTERE to compensate for liquid loss during preparation of the premix \n(see section 4) due to foaming, adhesion to the walls of the vial and \"dead-volume\". This \noverfill ensures that after dilution with the entire contents of the accompanying solvent for \nTAXOTERE vial, there is a minimal extractable premix volume of 2 ml containing 10 mg/ml \ndocetaxel which corresponds to the labelled amount of 20 mg/0.5 ml per vial. \n\n \n2.2 Solvent for TAXOTERE 20 mg/0.5 ml vial \n \n\uf0b7 The solvent for TAXOTERE 20 mg/0.5 ml vial is a 7 ml clear glass vial with a transparent \n\ncolourless flip-off cap. \n \n\uf0b7 The solvent for TAXOTERE composition is a 13% w/w solution of ethanol 95% in water for \n\ninjections. \n \n\uf0b7 Each solvent for TAXOTERE 20 mg/0.5 ml vial contains 1.98 ml. This volume has been \n\nestablished based on the fill volume of the TAXOTERE 20 mg/0.5 ml vial. The addition of the \nentire contents of the solvent vial to the contents of the TAXOTERE 20 mg/0.5 ml vial ensures \na premix concentration of 10 mg/ml docetaxel. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n266 \n\n3. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SAFE HANDLING \n \nTAXOTERE is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should \nbe exercised when handling it and preparing TAXOTERE solutions. The use of gloves is \nrecommended.  \n \nIf TAXOTERE concentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, \nwash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If TAXOTERE concentrate, premix solution \nor infusion solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and \nthoroughly with water. \n \n \n4. PREPARATION FOR THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION \n \n4.1 Preparation of the TAXOTERE premix solution (10 mg docetaxel/ml) \n \n4.1.1 If the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required \n\nnumber of TAXOTERE boxes to stand at room temperature \n(below 25\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. \n\n \n  \n4.1.2 Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw the \n\nentire contents of the solvent for TAXOTERE vial by partially \ninverting the vial. \n\n \n  \n4.1.3 Inject the entire contents of the syringe into the corresponding \n\nTAXOTERE vial. \n\n \n  \n4.1.4 Remove the syringe and needle and mix manually by repeated \n\ninversions for at least 45 seconds. Do not shake. \n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n267 \n\n4.1.5 Allow the premix vial to stand for 5 minutes at room \ntemperature (below 25\u00b0C) and then check that the solution is \nhomogenous and clear (foaming is normal even after \n5 minutes due to the presence of polysorbate 80 in the \nformulation). \n \nThe premix solution contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel and should \nbe used immediately after preparation. However the chemical \nand physical stability of the premix solution has been \ndemonstrated for 8 hours when stored either between + 2\u00b0C \nand + 8\u00b0C or at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C). \n \n\n \n\n \n4.2 Preparation of the infusion solution \n \n4.2.1 More than one premix vial may be necessary to obtain the \n\nrequired dose for the patient. Based on the required dose for \nthe patient expressed in mg, aseptically withdraw the \ncorresponding premix volume containing 10 mg/ml docetaxel \nfrom the appropriate number of premix vials using graduated \nsyringes fitted with a needle. For example, a dose of 140 mg \ndocetaxel would require 14 ml docetaxel premix solution. \n\n \n  \n4.2.2 Inject the required premix volume into a 250 ml infusion bag \n\nor bottle containing either 5% glucose solution or sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose \ngreater than 200 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger \nvolume of the infusion vehicle so that a concentration of \n0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n  \n\n  \n4.2.3 Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking \n\nmotion. \n\n \n  \n4.2.4 The TAXOTERE infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be aseptically \n\nadministered as a 1-hour infusion under room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and normal lighting \nconditions. \n\n  \n \n4.2.5 \n\n \nAs with all parenteral products, TAXOTERE premix solution \nand infusion solution should be visually inspected prior to use, \nsolutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n268 \n\n5. DISPOSAL \n \nAll materials that have been utilised for dilution and administration should be disposed of according to \nstandard procedures. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n\n\n \n\n269 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\nTAXOTERE 80 mg/2 ml concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion \ndocetaxel \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, hospital pharmacist or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, hospital pharmacist or nurse.

FORMULATION \n \nTAXOTERE 80 mg/2 ml concentrate for solution for infusion is a clear viscous, yellow to brown-\nyellow solution containing 40 mg/ml docetaxel (anhydrous) in polysorbate 80 and citric acid. The \nsolvent for TAXOTERE is a 13% w/w solution of ethanol 95% in water for injections. \n \n \n2. PRESENTATION \n \nTAXOTERE is supplied as single-dose vials. \n \nEach box contains one TAXOTERE vial (80 mg/2 ml) and one corresponding solvent for \nTAXOTERE vial in a blister pack. \n \nTAXOTERE vials should be stored between 2\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C and protected from light. \nTAXOTERE should not be used after the expiry date shown on the carton, blister pack and vials. \n \n2.1 TAXOTERE 80 mg/2 ml vial \n \n\uf0b7 The TAXOTERE 80 mg/2 ml vial is a 15 ml clear glass vial with a red flip-off cap. \n \n\uf0b7 The TAXOTERE 80 mg/2 ml vial contains a solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 at a \n\nconcentration of 40 mg/ml. \n \n\uf0b7 Each TAXOTERE 80 mg/2 ml vial contains 2.0 ml of a 40 mg/ml solution of docetaxel in \n\npolysorbate 80 (fill volume: 94.4 mg/2.36 ml). This volume has been established during the \ndevelopment of TAXOTERE to compensate for liquid loss during preparation of the premix \n(see section 4) due to foaming, adhesion to the walls of the vial and \"dead-volume\". This \noverfill ensures that after dilution with the entire contents of the accompanying solvent for \nTAXOTERE vial, there is a minimal extractable premix volume of 8 ml containing 10 mg/ml \ndocetaxel which corresponds to the labelled amount of 80 mg/2 ml per vial. \n\n \n2.2 Solvent for TAXOTERE 80 mg/2 ml vial \n \n\uf0b7 The solvent for TAXOTERE 80 mg/2 ml vial is a 15 ml clear glass vial with a transparent \n\ncolourless flip-off cap. \n \n\uf0b7 The solvent for TAXOTERE composition is a 13% w/w solution of ethanol 95% in water for \n\ninjections. \n \n\uf0b7 Each solvent for TAXOTERE 80 mg/2 ml vial contains 7.33 ml. This volume has been \n\nestablished based on the fill volume of the TAXOTERE 80 mg/2 ml vial. The addition of the \nentire contents of the solvent vial to the contents of the TAXOTERE 80 mg/2 ml vial ensures a \npremix concentration of 10 mg/ml docetaxel. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n278 \n\n3. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SAFE HANDLING \n \nTAXOTERE is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should \nbe exercised when handling it and preparing TAXOTERE solutions. The use of gloves is \nrecommended.  \n \nIf TAXOTERE concentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, \nwash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If TAXOTERE concentrate, premix solution \nor infusion solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and \nthoroughly with water. \n \n \n4. PREPARATION FOR THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION \n \n4.1 Preparation of the TAXOTERE premix solution (10 mg docetaxel/ml) \n \n4.1.1 If the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required \n\nnumber of TAXOTERE boxes to stand at room temperature \n(below 25\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. \n\n \n  \n4.1.2 Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw the \n\nentire contents of the solvent for TAXOTERE vial by partially \ninverting the vial. \n\n \n  \n4.1.3 Inject the entire contents of the syringe into the corresponding \n\nTAXOTERE vial. \n\n \n  \n4.1.4 Remove the syringe and needle and mix manually by repeated \n\ninversions for at least 45 seconds. Do not shake. \n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n279 \n\n4.1.5 Allow the premix vial to stand for 5 minutes at room \ntemperature (below 25\u00b0C) and then check that the solution is \nhomogenous and clear (foaming is normal even after \n5 minutes due to the presence of polysorbate 80 in the \nformulation). \n \nThe premix solution contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel and should \nbe used immediately after preparation. However the chemical \nand physical stability of the premix solution has been \ndemonstrated for 8 hours when stored either between + 2\u00b0C \nand + 8\u00b0C or at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C). \n \n\n \n\n \n4.2 Preparation of the infusion solution \n \n4.2.1 More than one premix vial may be necessary to obtain the \n\nrequired dose for the patient. Based on the required dose for \nthe patient expressed in mg, aseptically withdraw the \ncorresponding premix volume containing 10 mg/ml docetaxel \nfrom the appropriate number of premix vials using graduated \nsyringes fitted with a needle. For example, a dose of 140 mg \ndocetaxel would require 14 ml docetaxel premix solution. \n\n \n  \n4.2.2 Inject the required premix volume into a 250 ml infusion bag \n\nor bottle containing either 5% glucose solution or sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose \ngreater than 200 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger \nvolume of the infusion vehicle so that a concentration of \n0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n  \n\n  \n4.2.3 Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking \n\nmotion. \n\n \n  \n4.2.4 The TAXOTERE infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be aseptically \n\nadministered as a 1-hour infusion under room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and normal lighting \nconditions. \n\n  \n4.2.5 As with all parenteral products, TAXOTERE premix solution \n\nand infusion solution should be visually inspected prior to \nuse, solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n280 \n\n5. DISPOSAL \n \nAll materials that have been utilised for dilution and administration should be disposed of according to \nstandard procedures. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n\n\n \n\n281 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n  \nTAXOTERE 20 mg/1 ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n\ndocetaxel \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

The use of gloves is recommended.  \n \nIf TAXOTERE concentrate or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, wash immediately \nand thoroughly with soap and water. If it should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash \nimmediately and thoroughly with water. \n \nPreparation of the intravenous administration \n \nPreparation of the infusion solution \nDO NOT use other docetaxel medicinal products consisting of 2 vials (concentrate and solvent) \nwith this medicinal product (TAXOTERE 20 mg/1 ml concentrate for solution for infusion, \nwhich contains only 1 vial). \n \nTAXOTERE 20 mg/1 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires NO prior dilution with a \nsolvent and is ready to add to the infusion solution.  \n\uf0b7 Each vial is for single use and should be used immediately after opening. If not used \n\nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. More than \none vial of concentrate for solution for infusion may be necessary to obtain the required dose for \nthe patient. For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require 7 ml docetaxel concentrate \nfor solution. \n\n\uf0b7 Aseptically withdraw the required amount of concentrate for solution for infusion with a \ncalibrated syringe fitted with a 21G needle. \n\nIn TAXOTERE 20 mg/1 ml vial the concentration of docetaxel is 20 mg/ml. \n\uf0b7 Then, inject via a single injection (one shot) into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing \n\neither 5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose \ngreater than 190 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so that \na concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n\n\uf0b7 Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n\uf0b7 From a microbiological point of view, reconstitution /dilution must take place in controlled and \n\naseptic conditions and the infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. \nOnce added as recommended into the infusion bag, the docetaxel infusion solution, if stored \nbelow 25\u00b0C, is stable for 6 hours. It should be used within 6 hours (including the one hour \ninfusion intravenous administration).  \nIn addition, physical and chemical in-use stability of the infusion solution prepared as \nrecommended has been demonstrated in non-PVC bags up to 48 hours when stored between 2\u00b0C \nto 8\u00b0C.  \nDocetaxel infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time. If crystals \nappear, the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded. \n\n\uf0b7 As with all parenteral products, infusion solution should be visually inspected prior to use, \nsolutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n\n \nDisposal \nAll materials that have been utilised for dilution and administration should be disposed of according to \nstandard procedures. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.  \n\n\n\n \n\n290 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n \n\nTAXOTERE 80 mg/4 ml concentrate for solution for infusion \ndocetaxel \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

The use of gloves is recommended.  \n \nIf TAXOTERE concentrate or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, wash immediately \nand thoroughly with soap and water. If it should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash \nimmediately and thoroughly with water. \n \nPreparation of the intravenous administration \n \nPreparation of the infusion solution \nDO NOT use other docetaxel medicinal products consisting of 2 vials (concentrate and solvent) \nwith this medicinal product (TAXOTERE 80 mg/4 ml concentrate for solution for infusion, \nwhich contains only 1 vial). \n \nTAXOTERE 80 mg/4 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires NO prior dilution with a \nsolvent and is ready to add to the infusion solution.  \n\uf0b7 Each vial is for single use and should be used immediately after opening. If not used \n\nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. More than \none vial of concentrate for solution for infusion may be necessary to obtain the required dose for \nthe patient. For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require 7 ml docetaxel concentrate \nfor solution. \n\n\uf0b7 Aseptically withdraw the required amount of concentrate for solution for infusion with a \ncalibrated syringe fitted with a 21G needle. \n\nIn TAXOTERE 80 mg/4 ml vial the concentration of docetaxel is 20 mg/ml. \n\uf0b7 Then, inject via a single injection (one shot) into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing \n\neither 5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose \ngreater than 190 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so that \na concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n\n\uf0b7 Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n\uf0b7 From a microbiological point of view, reconstitution /dilution must take place in controlled and \n\naseptic conditions and the infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. \nOnce added as recommended into the infusion bag, the docetaxel infusion solution, if stored \nbelow 25\u00b0C, is stable for 6 hours. It should be used within 6 hours (including the one hour \ninfusion intravenous administration).  \nIn addition, physical and chemical in-use stability of the infusion solution prepared as \nrecommended has been demonstrated in non-PVC bags up to 48 hours when stored between 2\u00b0C \nto 8\u00b0C.  \nDocetaxel infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time. If crystals \nappear, the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded. \n\n\uf0b7 As with all parenteral products, infusion solution should be visually inspected prior to use, \nsolutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n\n \nDisposal \nAll materials that have been utilised for dilution and administration should be disposed of according to \nstandard procedures. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.  \n\n\n\n \n\n299 \n\n \nPackage Leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \nTAXOTERE 160 mg/8 ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n\ndocetaxel \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

The use of gloves is recommended.  \n \nIf TAXOTERE concentrate or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, wash immediately \nand thoroughly with soap and water. If it should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash \nimmediately and thoroughly with water. \n \nPreparation of the intravenous administration \n \nPreparation of the infusion solution \nDO NOT use other docetaxel medicinal products consisting of 2 vials (concentrate and solvent) \nwith this medicinal product (TAXOTERE 160 mg/8 ml concentrate for solution for infusion, \nwhich contains only 1 vial). \n \nTAXOTERE 160 mg/8 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires NO prior dilution with a \nsolvent and is ready to add to the infusion solution.  \n\uf0b7 Each vial is for single use and should be used immediately after opening. If not used \n\nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. More than \none vial of concentrate for solution for infusion may be necessary to obtain the required dose for \nthe patient. For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require 7 ml docetaxel concentrate \nfor solution. \n\n\uf0b7 Aseptically withdraw the required amount of concentrate for solution for infusion with a \ncalibrated syringe fitted with a 21G needle. \n\nIn TAXOTERE 160 mg/8 ml vial the concentration of docetaxel is 20 mg/ml. \n\uf0b7 Then, inject via a single injection (one shot) into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing \n\neither 5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose \ngreater than 190 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so that \na concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n\n\uf0b7 Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n\uf0b7 From a microbiological point of view, reconstitution /dilution must take place in controlled and \n\naseptic conditions and the infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. \nOnce added as recommended into the infusion bag, the docetaxel infusion solution, if stored \nbelow 25\u00b0C, is stable for 6 hours. It should be used within 6 hours (including the one hour \ninfusion intravenous administration).  \nIn addition, physical and chemical in-use stability of the infusion solution prepared as \nrecommended has been demonstrated in non-PVC bags up to 48 hours when stored between \n2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C.  \nDocetaxel infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time. If crystals \nappear, the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded. \n\n\uf0b7 As with all parenteral products, infusion solution should be visually inspected prior to use, \nsolutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n\n \nDisposal \nAll materials that have been utilised for dilution and administration should be disposed of according to \nstandard procedures. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.  \n\n\n\tANNEX ISUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURERS RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.

difficulty in breathing fever or chills back pain low blood pressure. more severe reactions may occur. if you had an allergic reaction to paclitaxel, you may also experience an allergic reaction to docetaxel, which may be more severe. the hospital staff will monitor your condition closely during treatment. tell them immediately if you notice any of these effects. between infusions of taxotere the following may occur, and the frequency may vary with the combinations of medicines that are received: very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): infections, decrease in the number of red
