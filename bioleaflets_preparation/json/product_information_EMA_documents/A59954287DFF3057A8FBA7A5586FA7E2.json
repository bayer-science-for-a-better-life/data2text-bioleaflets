This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRienso 30 mg/ml solution for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 ml of solution contains 30 mg of iron as ferumoxytol.  \nEach vial of 17 ml solution contains 510 mg of iron as ferumoxytol. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for infusion.  \nBlack to reddish brown solution \nOsmolality: 270-330 mosm/kg \npH: 6.5 to 8.0 \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRienso is indicated for the intravenous treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in adult patients with \nchronic kidney disease (CKD). \n \nThe diagnosis of iron deficiency must be based on appropriate laboratory tests (see section 4.2). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRienso should only be administered when staff trained to evaluate and manage anaphylactic reactions \nis immediately available, in an environment where full resuscitation facilities can be assured. \nPatients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions including \nmonitoring of blood pressure and pulse during and for at least 30 minutes following each infusion of \nRienso. In addition, patients should be placed in a reclining or semi-reclining position during infusion \nand for at least 30 minutes thereafter (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nTreatment Course \n \nThe recommended course of Rienso is based on the patient’s pre-treatment haemoglobin and body \nweight as provided in Table 1.  \n \nEach 510 mg dose is administered as an intravenous infusion for at least 15 minutes. For patients \nreceiving two doses, the second 510 mg infusion is to be administered 2 to 8 days later as per Table1.   \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 3 \n\nTable 1: Recommended Dosing Table for Rienso Administration \n \n Total Amount of Rienso to Administer \n\nmg of Iron (Number of vials) \nHaemoglobin ≤ 50 kg Body Weight > 50 kg Body Weight \n> 10-12 g/dl 510 mg iron (1 vial) 2 × 510 mg iron (2 vials) \n≤ 10 g/dl 2 × 510 mg iron (2 vials) 2 × 510 mg iron (2 vials) \n \nThe maximum dose is 1020 mg (2 vials) and the two doses of Rienso must not be administered at the \nsame time. \n \nRienso should not be given to patients if their haemoglobin is greater than 12 g/dl, serum Transferrin \nSaturation (TSAT) is greater than 50% or Ferritin is greater than 800 ng/ml (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients should be re-assessed at least one month after the completion of a course of Rienso and this \nshould include laboratory testing of haematologic and blood iron parameters.   \n \nRe-treatment \n \nTo maintain the target haemoglobin value, re-treatment with Rienso may be given after the patient has \nbeen re-assessed and confirmed to be iron deficient. For maintenance therapy and patient monitoring, \nthe recommendations of current guidelines (e.g. Revised European Best Practice Guidelines) should \nbe followed. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rienso in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years has not been \nestablished. No data are available. Therefore Rienso should not be administered to children and \nadolescents below the age of 18 years (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial population – patients receiving haemodialysis  \n \nFor patients receiving haemodialysis, Rienso should be administered once the blood pressure is stable \nand the patient has completed at least one hour of haemodialysis.  \n \nHepatic Impairment \n \nRienso has not been specifically studied in patients with hepatic impairment; clinical experience is \nlimited to 8 patients. In patients with liver dysfunction, parenteral iron should only be administered \nafter careful risk/benefit assessment. No change in dosage is recommended from Table 1. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nIntravenous use by infusion. \n \nRienso should be administered as an infusion in 50-250 ml of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride or sterile \n5% glucose for at least 15 minutes (see sections 6.3 and 6.6). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nThe use of Rienso is contraindicated in cases of: \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to Rienso or any of its excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• Patients with any known history of drug allergy including hypersensitivity to other parenteral \n\niron products  \n• Evidence of iron overload \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 4 \n\n• Anaemia not caused by iron deficiency \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity Reactions \nParenterally administered iron preparations can cause hypersensitivity reactions including serious and \npotentially fatal anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been \nreported after previously uneventful doses of parenteral iron complexes.  \n \nThe risk is enhanced for patients with known allergies including drug allergies, including patients \nwith a history of severe asthma, eczema or other atopic allergy (see section 4.3). \nThere is also an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions to parenteral iron complexes in patients \nwith immune or inflammatory conditions (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis). \n \nRienso should only be administered when staff trained to evaluate and manage anaphylactic reactions \nis immediately available, in an environment where full resuscitation facilities can be assured. Patients \nshould be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions including \nmonitoring of blood pressure and pulse during and for at least 30 minutes following each infusion of \nRienso. In addition, patients should be placed in a reclining or semi-reclining position during infusion \nand for at least 30 minutes thereafter.  \n \nIf hypersensitivity reactions or signs of intolerance occur during administration, the treatment must be \nstopped immediately. Facilities for cardio respiratory resuscitation and equipment for handling acute \nanaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions should be available, including an injectable 1:1000 adrenaline \nsolution. Additional treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids should be given as \nappropriate. \n \nFatal and life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions have been observed with Rienso in the post \nmarketing setting. Clinical presentation has included anaphylactic type reactions presenting with \ncardiac arrest/cardiorespiratory arrest, clinically significant hypotension, syncope, and \nunresponsiveness (see section 4.8).  \n \nElderly patients (> 65 years of age) or patients with multiple co-morbidities who experience a serious \nhypersensitivity reaction may have more severe outcomes.  \n \nHypotension \nSevere adverse reactions of clinically significant hypotension have been reported. Hypotension may \nfollow Rienso administration with or without accompanying signs of hypersensitivity (see section \n4.8).  \n \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypotension following each Rienso \nadministration. \n \nIron Overload \nRienso should not be administered to patients with iron overload. Rienso must not be given to patients \nif their haemoglobin is greater than 12 g/dl, serum Transferrin Saturation (TSAT) is greater than 50% \nor ferritin is greater than 800 ng/ml (see section 4.2). \n \nImmunologic Disease or Infection \nParenteral iron should be used with caution in cases of immunologic disease or acute or chronic \ninfection. It is not recommended to administer Rienso to patients with ongoing bacteraemia. \n \nRe-treatment / Long term use \nLimited clinical study data is available regarding re-treatment with Rienso and no clinical study data \nis available for repeated long term use. For information on post-marketing experience see section 5.1. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 5 \n\n \nEthanol and sodium content \nThis medicinal product contains small amounts of ethanol (alcohol), less than 100 mg per 17 ml vial. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 23 mg sodium per 17 ml vial, i.e., is essentially “sodium \nfree”. \n \nMagnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging \nAdministration of Rienso may transiently affect the diagnostic ability of MR imaging.  \nAnticipated MR imaging studies should be conducted prior to the administration of Rienso.  \nThe effect on vascular MR imaging lasts approximately 1-2 days while tissue diagnostic imaging may \nbe affected for up to 6 months.  \nMR images are interpretable earlier by readers aware of the recent administration of Rienso or by the \nuse of T1- or proton density-weighted MR pulse sequences. \nRienso will not interfere with X-ray, computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography \n(PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), ultrasound or nuclear medicine \nimaging. \n \nInterference with Serological Testing \nIn the 24 hours following administration of Rienso, laboratory assays may overestimate serum iron \nand transferrin bound iron by also measuring the iron in the Rienso complex. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. As with all parenteral iron preparations the \nabsorption of oral iron is reduced when administered concomitantly. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential and pregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of Rienso in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). A careful risk/benefit evaluation is therefore \nrequired before use during pregnancy and Rienso should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \nnecessary (see section 4.4). \n \nIron deficiency anaemia occurring in the first trimester of pregnancy can in many cases be treated \nwith oral iron. Treatment with Rienso should be confined to second and third trimester if the benefit is \njudged to outweigh the potential risk for both the mother and the foetus. \n \nRienso is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using adequate contraception. \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is unknown whether Rienso is excreted in human milk. Available pharmacokinetic data in animals \nhave shown excretion of Rienso in milk (see section 5.3).  \n \nA risk to breastfeeding newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Rienso therapy, \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of the therapy for the \nmother. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 6 \n\nFertility \n \nNo adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance were noted in adult rats (see \nSection 5.3). In a prenatal and postnatal developmental study in rats adverse effects on sexual \nmaturation and on the ability to produce a litter were noted in the F1-generation (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRienso may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In the case of symptoms \nof dizziness, confusion or light headedness following the administration of Rienso, patients should not \ndrive or use machinery until the symptoms have ceased.  \n \nNo studies regarding effects on the ability to drive or operate machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn clinical trials involving 1562 subjects with CKD, adverse reactions were seen in 7.9% of patients \nwho received Rienso, of which 0.2% were considered serious. \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhoea, \nconstipation, nausea and vomiting), headache, dizziness and hypotension, all occurring in less than \n2.5% of patients. Serious hypersensitivity or hypotensive reactions are uncommon (less than 1 case \nper 100 patients) and were reported in 0.2% (3/1562) of subjects with CKD who received Rienso \nduring the clinical studies. One of these three cases was also characterized as an anaphylactoid \nreaction.   \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 2 presents all adverse experiences observed during the clinical studies in which 1562 subjects \nwith CKD received two injections of 510 mg of Rienso separated by an interval of 2 to 8 days and \npost-marketing experience. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies and post-marketing \n\nexperience \n \nSYSTEM \nORGAN \nCLASS \n\nCOMMON  \n(≥ 1/100 to \n\n< 1/10) \n\nUNCOMMON  \n(≥ 1/1,000 to \n\n< 1/100) \n\nRARE \n(≥ 1/10,000 to \n\n< 1/1,000) \n\nFREQUENCY NOT \nKNOWN (CANNOT BE \nESTIMATED FROM \nAVAILABLE DATA) \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n  Eosinophilia  \n\nImmune system \ndisorders  \n\n Hypersensitivity \nincluding \nanaphylaxis* \n\n Life-threatening \nAnaphylactic/Anaphylactoid \nreactions* \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n Decreased \nappetite \nIncreased appetite \n\nDehydration \nGout \nHyperkalaemia \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Dizziness \nDysgeusia  \nHeadache \nSomnolence  \nBurning sensation \n\nParaesthesia Syncope \nUnresponsiveness  \nLoss of consciousness  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 7 \n\nSYSTEM \nORGAN \nCLASS \n\nCOMMON  \n(≥ 1/100 to \n\n< 1/10) \n\nUNCOMMON  \n(≥ 1/1,000 to \n\n< 1/100) \n\nRARE \n(≥ 1/10,000 to \n\n< 1/1,000) \n\nFREQUENCY NOT \nKNOWN (CANNOT BE \nESTIMATED FROM \nAVAILABLE DATA) \n\nEye disorders   Lacrimation \nincreased \nVision blurred \n\n \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n   Tachycardia/Arrhythmia, \nCardiac arrest \nCardio-respiratory arrest \nMyocardial infarction \nCyanosis \nCongestive heart failure \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Hypotension \n(hypotension, \nblood pressure \ndecreased) \nFlushing (flushing, \nhot flush) \nHypertension \n(hypertension, \naccelerated \nhypertension) \n\n Vasodilation \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Dyspnoea Epistaxis Bronchospasm \nCough \nHyperventilation  \nHypoxia \nLaryngeal oedema  \nPharyngeal oedema \nRespiratory arrest \nRespiratory failure \nThroat irritation \nThroat tightness \nWheezing \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Diarrhoea \nConstipation \nNausea \nAbdominal pain \n(Abdominal \ndistension, \nabdominal pain \nupper, abdominal \ndiscomfort) \nVomiting \nFaeces \ndiscoloured \n\nDry mouth \nDyspepsia \nGlossodynia \n\nLip swelling  \nSwollen tongue \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Hepatic function \nabnormal \n\n Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 8 \n\nSYSTEM \nORGAN \nCLASS \n\nCOMMON  \n(≥ 1/100 to \n\n< 1/10) \n\nUNCOMMON  \n(≥ 1/1,000 to \n\n< 1/100) \n\nRARE \n(≥ 1/10,000 to \n\n< 1/1,000) \n\nFREQUENCY NOT \nKNOWN (CANNOT BE \nESTIMATED FROM \nAVAILABLE DATA) \n\nSkin & \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Rash (rash, rash \ngeneralised, rash \npruritic, urticaria) \nPruritus (pruritus \ngeneralised) \nEcchymosis \nSweating \n(hyperhidrosis, \nnight sweats) \nSkin \nhyperpigmentation \nSkin reaction \n\n Angioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Muscle/joint pain \nor stiffness \n(arthralgia, \nmyalgia, muscular \nweakness, \nmusculoskeletal \nstiffness) \nBack pain \nMuscle spasms \n\n  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site \nreactions \n(infusion/injection \nsite bruising, pain, \nreaction, swelling, \nwarmth, \nhaemorrhage, \nirritation, rash) \n\nFatigue (asthenia, \nfatigue) \nChest pain (chest \ndiscomfort, chest \npain) \nChills \nFever (feeling hot, \npyrexia) \n\n Injection site discolouration \nInjection site pruritus \n\nInvestigations  Serum ferritin \nincreased  \n\nBlood glucose \ndecreased \n\nPulse absent \nOxygen saturation decreased \n\nInjury, \npoisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications \n\n Contusion   \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nIn clinical trials, adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation and occurring in ≥ 2 \nRienso-treated patients included hypotension, infusion site swelling, increased serum ferritin levels, \nchest pain, diarrhoea, dizziness, ecchymosis, pruritis, chronic renal failure and urticaria. \n \n*Fatal and life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions have been observed with Rienso in the post \nmarketing setting (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions is an important way to gather more information to continuously \nmonitor the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.

During the \npost-marketing phase, several patients received an overdose of Rienso ranging from 1 g in 1 day to \n2.5 g over 21 days. Only one case of minor rash was observed. Excessive administration of Rienso \nmay lead to accumulation of iron in storage sites potentially leading to haemosiderosis.  \n \nPeriodic monitoring of laboratory parameters of iron storage, such as serum ferritin and transferrin \nsaturation, enables recognition of iron accumulation. However, caution should be exercised in \ninterpreting serum iron levels in the 24 hours following administration of Rienso as laboratory assays \nmay overestimate serum iron and transferrin bound iron by also measuring the iron in Rienso. Please \nsee the iron overload section 4.4 and for dosing guidance, see section 4.2. \n \nOverdose should be treated, if required, with an iron chelating agent. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Not yet assigned, ATC code: Not yet assigned \n \nMechanism of Action \n \nRienso is a colloidal iron-carbohydrate complex. It includes iron oxide particles with an iron oxide \ncore surrounded by a polyglucose sorbitol-carboxymethylether shell. The shell isolates the bioactive \niron from plasma components until the iron-carbohydrate complex enter reticuloendothelial system \nmacrophages of the liver, spleen and bone marrow. The iron is then released intracellularly from the \niron-carbohydrate complex within vesicles in macrophages. Iron then either enters the intracellular \nstorage iron pool (e.g., ferritin) or is transferred to plasma transferrin for transport to erythroid \nprecursor cells for incorporation into haemoglobin. \n \nClinical Efficacy and Safety \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rienso (cumulative dose of 1.02 grams) for the treatment of iron deficiency \nin CKD patients with IDA were assessed in three randomized, open-label, controlled clinical studies \n(Studies 1, 2 and 3). The principal efficacy results at Day 35 from the controlled phase of each study \nare shown in Table 3. This includes the Baseline and mean change to Day 35 in haemoglobin \n(Hgb, g/dl), transferrin saturation (TSAT, %) and ferritin (ng/ml) as well as the proportion of subjects \nwho were Hgb Responders at Day 35 (defined as proportion of subjects with an increase in Hgb of at \nleast 1.0 g/dl) in each treatment group for Studies 1, 2, and 3. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 10 \n\nTable 3: Summary of Efficacy Endpoints at Day 35 (Intent to Treat Population) \n \n\nEndpoint \n\nStudy 1 \nNon-dialysis CKD \n\nStudy 2 \nNon-dialysis CKD \n\nStudy 3 \nCKD on Haemodialysis \n\nRienso \nn = 226 \n\nOral Iron \nn = 77 \n\nRienso \nn = 228 \n\nOral Iron \nn = 76 \n\nRienso \nn = 114 \n\nOral Iron \nn = 116 \n\nBaseline Hgb \n(mean ± SD, g/dl) \n\n9.9  \n± 0.8 \n\n9.9  \n± 0.7 \n\n10.0  \n± 0.7 \n\n10.0  \n± 0.8 \n\n10.6  \n± 0.7 \n\n10.7  \n± 0.6 \n\nHgb change from \nBaseline at Day 35 \n(mean ± SD, g/dl) \n\n1.2*  \n± 1.3 \n\n0.5  \n± 1.0 \n\n0.8*  \n± 1.2 \n\n0.2  \n± 1.0 \n\n1.0*  \n± 1.1 \n\n0.5  \n± 1.1 \n\nProportion of Hgb \nResponders (%) 51.8 19.5 39.0 18.4 49.1 25.0 \n\nBaseline TSAT \n(mean ± SD, %) \n\n9.8  \n± 5.4 \n\n10.4  \n± 5.2 \n\n11.3 \n± 6.1 \n\n10.1  \n± 5.5 \n\n15.7  \n± 7.2 \n\n15.9  \n± 6.3 \n\nTSAT change from \nBaseline at Day 35 \n(mean ± SD, %) \n\n9.2  \n± 9.4 \n\n0.3  \n± 4.7 \n\n9.8  \n± 9.2 \n\n1.3  \n± 6.4 \n\n6.4  \n± 12.6 \n\n0.6  \n± 8.3 \n\nBaseline ferritin \n(mean ± SD, ng/ml) \n\n123.7  \n± 125.4 \n\n146.2  \n± 136.3 \n\n146.1  \n± 173.6 \n\n143.5  \n± 144.9 \n\n340.5  \n± 159.1 \n\n357.6  \n± 171.7 \n\nFerritin change from \nBaseline at Day 35 \n(mean ± SD, ng/ml) \n\n300.7  \n± 214.9 \n\n0.3  \n± 82.0 \n\n381.7  \n± 278.6 \n\n6.9  \n± 60.1 \n\n233.9  \n± 207.0 \n\n-59.2  \n± 106.2 \n\n* p≤0.001 for main efficacy endpoint \nHgb = haemoglobin; TSAT = transferrin saturation; SD = standard deviation \n \nIn all three studies, patients with CKD and iron deficiency anaemia were randomized to treatment \nwith Rienso or oral iron. Rienso was administered as two 510 mg intravenous injections (separated by \n2 to 8 days) and oral iron (ferrous fumarate) was administered at a total daily dose of 200 mg \nelemental iron for 21 days. The major study outcomes assessed the change in haemoglobin from \nBaseline to Day 35. Studies 1 and 2 enrolled patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD and Study \n3 enrolled patients who were undergoing haemodialysis. \n \nIn Study 1, the mean age of patients was 66 years (range, 23 to 95); 60% were female; 65% were \nCaucasian, 32% were Black, and 2% were other races. In the Rienso and oral iron groups, 42% and \n44% of patients, respectively, were receiving erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) at Baseline. \n \nIn Study 2, the mean age of patients was 65 years (range, 31 to 96); 61% were female; 58% were \nCaucasian, 35% were Black, and 7% were other races. In the Rienso and oral iron groups, 36% and \n43% of patients, respectively, were receiving ESAs at Baseline. \n \nIn Study 3, the mean age of patients was 60 years (range, 24 to 87); 43% were female; 34% were \nCaucasian, 59% were Black, and 7% were other races. All patients were receiving ESAs at Baseline. \n \nFollowing completion of the controlled phase of each of the Phase 3 trials, patients who were iron \ndeficient and anaemic could be optionally retreated and receive two additional 510 mg intravenous \ninjections of Rienso for a total cumulative dose of 2.04 g. Overall, 69 patients received a total \ncumulative dose of 2.04 g. Adverse reactions following this repeat Rienso dosing were similar in \ncharacter and frequency to those observed following the first two intravenous injections.   \n \nIn a placebo-controlled, cross-over trial, 713 patients with CKD received a single 510 mg dose of \nRienso and placebo. Adverse reactions reported in these patients were similar in character and \nfrequency to those observed in the other clinical trials. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 11 \n\nPost-Marketing Data from Dialysis Clinics in the United States \n \nRetrospective observational data from three large haemodialysis clinics in the US over a 1 year period \nincluded the treatment of over 8,600 patients with more than 33,300 administered doses of Rienso; \nnearly 50% of patients received repeat dosing with 4 or more doses. Mean haemoglobin increased \n(0.5-0.9 g/dl) post-treatment and stabilised in the range of 11-11.7 g/dl over the 10 month post-dose \nperiod; no new safety signals were identified with repeat dosing. \n \nPaediatric Population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nRienso in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic (PK) behaviour of Rienso has been examined in healthy subjects and in patients \nwith CKD stage 5D on haemodialysis. Rienso exhibited dose-dependent, capacity-limited elimination \nfrom plasma with a half life of approximately 16 hours in humans. The clearance (CL) was decreased \nwith increased doses of Rienso. Volume of distribution (Vd) was consistent with plasma volume, and \nthe mean maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and terminal half-life (t1/2) values increased \nwith dose. The estimated values of CL and Vd following two 510 mg doses of Rienso administered \nintravenously within 24 hours were 69.1 ml/hr and 3.3 l, respectively. The Cmax and time of maximum \nconcentration (tmax) were 206 mcg/ml and 0.32 hr, respectively. Rate of infusion had no influence on \nRienso PK parameters. No gender differences in Rienso PK parameters were observed. Rienso is not \nremoved by haemodialysis. \n \n5.3 Preclinical Safety Data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, local tolerance and immunotoxicity. In a 4 week \nrepeated dose toxicity study in rats after a recovery of 26 weeks hepatic changes (focal or multifocal \nhaemorrhage, hemorrhagic necrosis, chronic inflammation, and/or bile duct hyperplasia) were seen in \nthe female animals (the cumulative HED of the dose groups compares to a safety multiple of 5.1 and \n10.5 to the cumulative human therapeutic dose (2 x 510 mg Fe) in a 60 kg human). Such effects were \nnot seen in the male animals of that study or in the 13 weeks repeated dose toxicity study in rats \n(without recovery). As seen from clinical data there is no evidence that these effects seen in female \nrats are relevant for humans. \n \nNo carcinogenicity studies were performed with Rienso. \n \nNo adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance were noted in rats given IV Rienso \nat doses up to 18 mg Fe/kg/day (Human Equivalent Dose of 2.9 mg Fe/kg/day).  \n \nAdministration of Rienso during organogenesis in rats at maternally toxic doses of 100 mg Fe/kg/day \ncaused a decrease in foetal weights.  \n \nIn rabbits administration of Rienso during organogenesis induced decreased foetal weights and \nexternal and/or soft tissue malformations (malrotated or flexed fore- and malrotated hindlimbs, \ninternal hydrocephaly, absent brains, cleft palate and microglossia) at the high dose of \n45.3 mg Fe/kg/day (HED of 14.6 mg Fe/kg/day), a dose which induced only minimal maternal \ntoxicity.  \n \nIn a pre-natal and post-natal development study in rats sexual maturation was delayed in male pups in \nthe high dose of 60 mg Fe/kg/day (HED of 9.7 mg Fe/kg/day). In female pups of the mid and high \ndose groups of 30 mg Fe/kg/day and 60 mg Fe/kg/day respectively (HED of 4.8 mg Fe/kg/day and \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 12 \n\n9.7 mg Fe/kg/day, respectively) sexual maturation was delayed and a disruption of the oestrus cycle \nwas noted in some females. The ability to produce a litter (reproductive competence) was reduced in \nhigh dose males and in mid and high dose females, irrespective of whether F1 males were mated with \nF1 females or F1 males were mated with naive females and vice versa.  \n \nIn a lactation study in rats, there was minimal excretion of Rienso or Rienso-derived radioactivity into \nmilk following single IV administration of approximately 100 mg Fe/kg (HED of 16.1 mg Fe/kg, \napproximately 2 times the recommended 510 mg human dose on a mg/m2 basis) of either the \nunlabelled, 59Fe or 14C-labelled product to lactating rats 10-11 days post-parturition, which peaked at 8 \nto 24 hours post-administration. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

What Rienso is and what it is used for \n \nRienso is an iron preparation, containing the active substance ferumoxytol, which is given by infusion \ninto a vein. It is used to treat iron deficiency anaemia resulting from a lack of stored iron, in adult \npatients with reduced kidney function.  \n \nIron is an essential element required to make haemoglobin, a molecule in red blood cells that enables \noxygen to be carried around the body. When there is insufficient iron in the body, haemoglobin \ncannot be formed, resulting in anaemia (low levels of haemoglobin). \n \nThe aim of Rienso therapy is to replenish the body’s iron stores. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Rienso \n \nBefore you were prescribed Rienso, the doctor will have carried out a blood test to make sure that you \nhave iron deficiency anaemia.  \n \nYou must not receive Rienso: \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to the product or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n- if you have a history of medicine allergy or have experienced serious allergic (hypersensitive) \n\nreactions to other injectable iron preparations.  \n- if you have iron overload (too much iron in your body). \n- if your anaemia is not caused by iron deficiency. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Rienso: \n- if you have a history of medicine allergy.  \n- if you have systemic lupus erythematosus. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 25 \n\n- if you have rheumatoid arthritis. \n- if you have severe asthma, eczema or other allergies. \n- if you have a problem with your liver. \n- if you have problems with your immune system.  \n- if you have any infections, including infections which have spread to your blood stream. \n- if you are scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging (an MRI scan), as this medicine may \n\ninterfere with the interpretation of the scan. For the same reason also talk to your doctor or \nradiographer if you have been given Rienso within the past 6 months and an MRI is \nsubsequently arranged. \n\nRienso can affect the interpretation of your blood iron test results. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nRienso should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years old. \n \nOther medicines and Rienso \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy \nRienso has not been tested in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. \nIf you are pregnant, you should not receive Rienso. \nIt is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to \nhave a baby. \nIf you are able to become pregnant, you must use birth control during treatment. \nIf you become pregnant during treatment, you must ask your doctor for advice. \nYour doctor will decide whether or not you should be given this medicine. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether the active substance in this medicine can pass into breast milk. If you are \nbreast-feeding, ask your doctor for advice before you are given Rienso. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome people may feel dizzy, confused or lightheaded after receiving treatment. If this happens to you, \ndo not drive or use any tools or machinery. \n \nRienso contains ethanol and sodium \nThis medicine contains small amounts of ethanol (alcohol), less than 100 mg per 17 ml vial. \nThis medicine contains less than 23 mg sodium per 17 ml vial, i.e., it is essentially “sodium free”. \n \n \n3. How Rienso is given \n \nYour doctor will decide how much Rienso to give you based on your weight and blood test results. \nThe treatment you will receive can be 1 or 2 vials of Rienso (510 mg each) by infusion and each dose \nwill be infused into a vein. For patients receiving two vials, the second one will be infused two to \neight days after the first infusion. Your doctor will decide if additional doses of Rienso are needed \nand for how long. He or she will also monitor your blood test results to avoid iron accumulation. \n \nYour doctor or nurse will administer Rienso by infusion into a vein. You will be lying down and your \nblood pressure and pulse will be monitored. Rienso will be administered in an environment where any \nallergic event can receive appropriate and prompt treatment. \n \nYou will be carefully observed during the infusion and for at least 30 minutes after each infusion by \nyour doctor or nurse. Please immediately tell the doctor or nurse if you start to feel unwell. They may \ndecide to stop the infusion. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 26 \n\nIf you are on haemodialysis, you may receive Rienso via infusion over 15 minutes during a dialysis \nsession. \n \nIf you receive more Rienso than you should \n \nOverdose can cause accumulation of iron in your body. Your doctor will monitor iron levels to avoid \niron accumulation. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects: \nTell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience any of the following signs and symptoms \nindicating serious side effects during or shortly after treatment: \nrash, itching, (sudden) dizziness, light-headedness, (increasing) swelling, difficulty breathing, \nwheezing or any other problems you may have.   \n \nIn some patients these allergic reactions can become severe or life-threatening (known as anaphylactic \nreactions). These reactions can be associated with heart and circulation complications, loss of \nconsciousness and may result in death. If you are older than 65 years or have an underlying condition, \nsuch as liver or heart disease, the risk of having severe consequences including death may be higher \nafter a serious allergic reaction. \n \nDoctors are aware of these possible side effects and will monitor you during the infusion and for at \nleast 30 minutes after the infusion, and also have emergency treatment available if required. \n \nOther side effects that you should tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about if they become \nserious:  \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- bleeding, swelling, bruising, pain, rash, irritation or warmth at infusion/injection site \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n- dizziness \n- low blood pressure  \n- feeling weak or tired \n- feeling drowsy or sleepy \n- flushing, hot flush \n- feeling hot, fever \n- sweating (including night sweats) \n- chills \n- high blood pressure (sudden increase in blood pressure) \n- skin rash, itching, darkening of an area of skin or nails, bruising, hives  \n- burning sensation of skin \n- shortness of breath \n- diarrhoea  \n- constipation \n- stomach pain/discomfort \n- stomach distension or bloating \n- nausea, vomiting \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 27 \n\n- discoloured stools \n- changes in taste \n- increased or decreased appetite \n- muscle/joint pain, weakness or stiffness, muscle spasms \n- headache \n- chest pain/discomfort \n- back pain \n- changes in blood test results (e.g. iron parameters) \n- allergic reaction including severe allergic reaction (see paragraph \"serious side effects\") \n\n \nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n- burning, prickling, numbness or tingling sensation of skin \n- dehydration \n- upset stomach/indigestion \n- nose bleed \n- dry mouth \n- burning or tingling sensation of tongue/mouth \n- increased tearing \n- blurred vision \n- gout \n- abnormal blood tests (decreased glucose, elevated potassium, abnormal liver function, elevated \n\ntype of white blood cell i.e. eosinophilia) \n \nSide effects of unknown frequency (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \nThe following serious side effects have been reported shortly after receiving Rienso: \n- life-threatening and fatal allergic reactions (anaphylactic/anaphylactoid hypersensitivity) \n- cardiovascular complications (affecting the heart and blood vessels) including heart attack, \n\ncongestive heart failure, palpitations, blood vessel dilation, changes in your pulse rate including \nweak/absent pulse, heart stops beating, heart and breathing stop, blue discolouration of skin \nand/or mucous membranes due to lack of oxygen in the blood (cyanosis) \n\n- fainting/loss of consciousness/unresponsiveness  \n- sudden swelling up of skin or mucous membranes (angioedema), skin rash \n- wheezing (bronchospasm), cough, upper airway swelling, difficulty breathing (change to \n\nbreathing rate), inability to breathe \n- throat irritation, throat tightness, lip swelling, tongue swelling \n- injection site discolouration, injection site itching and discolouration \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Rienso should be administered as an intravenous infusion into a new or \nexisting venous access site.  \nAdministration should be performed as follows:  \n \nHaemodialysis patients: \n \nDosing should begin when blood pressure is stable and the patient has completed at least one hour of \nhaemodialysis. \n \nFor all patients: \n• Administer Rienso as an infusion as follows: \n\no 510 mg (one vial) diluted in 50-250 ml of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride or sterile 5% \nglucose, administered for at least 15 minutes (concentration of 2-8 mg iron per ml). \n\n• Patients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions \nincluding monitoring of blood pressure and pulse during and for at least 30 minutes following \neach infusion of Rienso. In addition, patients should be placed in a reclining or semi-reclining \nposition during infusion and for at least 30 minutes thereafter. \n\n• Administer a single vial as an infusion. A second vial of the medicine should be administered as \nan infusion two to eight days later if indicated according to the SmPC. \n\n• Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n \nIncompatibilities \n• Rienso must not be mixed with other medicinal products, with the exception of the infusion \n\nfluids mentioned below. \n• Rienso must only be mixed with sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) or sterile 5% glucose \n\nup to a final concentration of 2-8 mg iron per ml. \n• No other intravenous dilution solutions and therapeutic agents should be used. \n \nOverdose \n• Overdose should be treated, if required with an iron chelating agent. See SmPC Section 4.9 for \n\nfurther information. \n \nStability and Storage \n• Shelf-Life – 48 months \n• Shelf life after first opening and after dilution for infusion:  \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 96 hours at 25 °C \n• From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately after first \n\nopening or immediately after dilution. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and \nconditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would not be longer than 4 hours at \n25°C. \n\n• Store in the original package in order to protect from light. Do not freeze. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 32 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX IV \n \n\nSCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS RECOMMENDING THE VARIATION TO \nTHE TERMS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATIONS \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 33 \n\nScientific conclusions \n \nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Rienso, the scientific conclusions \nof PRAC are as follows: \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nCumulatively 21 cases of hypersensitivity (8 serious, 13 non-serious) have been reported during \nclinical trials. Cumulatively, since the granting of the marketing authorisation up to the data lock-\npoint (DLP) of the current PSUR, a total of 527 reported post-marketing cases of hypersensitivity \nreactions of which more than 50 % were serious including life threatening allergic reactions \n(264 serious, 263 non-serious). In total 42 fatal cases have been reported cumulatively. 29 of them \nwere associated with hypersensitivity reactions. Within the limitations inherent to post-marketing \nreporting, the following reporting rate can be calculated: As of 30 June 2014, the cumulative overall \npost-marketing reporting rate of hypersensitivity based on 2 g per person per year is: \n527/266,914 × 100 = 0.20 %. During this PSUR covering period, 45 new cases of hypersensitivity \nreactions have been reported: 24 serious including one fatal case already reported as part of the \nprevious PSUR as late-breaking information and 21 non-serious cases. \n \nAfter the DLP of the present PSUR, 6 additional fatal cases of hypersensitivity reactions with \nferumoxytol have been reported. Two of these reports were included by the MAH as late breaking \ninformation into this PSUR. The additional four cases were reported after this PSUR was submitted \nfor assessment. All six fatal hypersensitivity cases were reported in the US and involved elderly \npatients (> 65 years of age) with co-morbidities. One patient had a prior history of drug allergy. In 5 \nout of these 6 cases, ferumoxytol was administered via IV injection (either quick or slow IV push), for \nthe remaining case the method of administration is unknown. \n \nIt should be noted that 28 out of the 35 fatal cases of hypersensitivity reactions occurred in elderly \npatients (> 65 years of age). There is no evidence that the risk of hypersensitivity reactions as such is \nincreased in elderly patients however these patients have an increased risk of complications. \n \nConsidering the cumulative number of reported cases of hypersensitivity reactions (serious, non-\nserious) including 35 fatal cases, the PRAC considered new additional risk minimisation measures in \naddition to the ones already implemented as part of the previous PSUR, and recommended that a \nwarning on the severity of the outcome of hypersensitivity reactions in patients over 65 or with co-\nmorbidities should be added in section 4.4 of the SmPC. \n \nInterference with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) \nNo spontaneous post-marketing reports of MRI interference have been received to date. Within this \nPSUR, a further literature review has been provided by the MAH identifying 9 relevant publications \naddressing ferumoxytol and MRI. Four case reports have been published describing the \nsupraparamagnetic effects of ferumoxytol on MR imaging and emphasized the importance for the \nradiologists to be aware if a patient received ferumoxytol recently. Based on a limited number of case \nreports, the influence of ferumoxytol on the interpretation of MRIs, due to its unique crystalline \nstructure appears to be primarily noted in the first few weeks after administration and, based on \nanimal data, dissipated within 3 months. The MAH is of the opinion that the current EU SmPC \naccurately reflects the current literature and provides appropriate guidance to EU practitioners. \nHowever, the MAH acknowledges that Rostoker and Cohen recommend a minimum of 6 months \nbetween ferumoxytol’s administration, which they base on the study with 6 healthy volunteers \npublished by Storey et al. Therefore the MAH proposed as part of this PSUR to amend the current \nwarning in section 4.4 of the SmPC to reflect that interference with MRI can occur up to 6 months \nafter administration of ferumoxytoll which was agreed by the PRAC.  \n \nTherefore, in view of available data regarding hypersensitivity reactions and interference with \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the PRAC considered that changes to the product information \nwere warranted.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 34 \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \nGrounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for Rienso, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk \nbalance of the medicinal product containing the active substance ferumoxytol is favourable subject to \nthe proposed changes to the product information. \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
