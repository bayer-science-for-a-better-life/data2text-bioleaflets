CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nREYATAZ capsules, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, are indicated for the treatment of HIV-\n1 infected adults and paediatric patients 6 years of age and older in combination with other \nantiretroviral medicinal products (see section 4.2). \n \nBased on available virological and clinical data from adult patients, no benefit is expected in patients \nwith strains resistant to multiple protease inhibitors (≥ 4 PI mutations).  \n \nThe choice of REYATAZ in treatment experienced adult and paediatric patients should be based on \nindividual viral resistance testing and the patient’s treatment history (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \nAdults \nThe recommended dose of REYATAZ capsules is 300 mg once daily taken with ritonavir 100 mg \nonce daily and with food. Ritonavir is used as a booster of atazanavir pharmacokinetics (see sections \n4.5 and 5.1). (See also section 4.4 Withdrawal of ritonavir only under restrictive conditions). \n \nPaediatric patients (6 years to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg) \nThe dose of atazanavir capsules for paediatric patients is based on body weight as shown in Table 1 \nand should not exceed the recommended adult dose. REYATAZ capsules must be taken with ritonavir \nand have to be taken with food. \n \nTable 1: Dose for paediatric patients (6 years to less than 18 years of age and weighing at \n\nleast 15 kg) for REYATAZ capsules with ritonavir \nBody Weight (kg) REYATAZ once daily dose ritonavir once daily dosea \n15 to less than 35 200 mg 100 mg \nat least 35 300 mg 100 mg \na Ritonavir capsules, tablets or oral solution. \n\n \nPaediatric patients (at least 3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg): REYATAZ oral powder is \navailable for paediatric patients at least 3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg (see Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for REYATAZ oral powder). Switching to REYATAZ capsules from \nREYATAZ oral powder is encouraged as soon as patients are able to consistently swallow capsules. \n \nWhen transitioning between formulations, a change in dose may be needed. Consult the dosing table \nfor the specific formulation (see Summary of Product Characteristics for REYATAZ oral powder). \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is needed. REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended in patients \nundergoing haemodialysis (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nREYATAZ with ritonavir has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. REYATAZ with \nritonavir should be used with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment. REYATAZ with \nritonavir must not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment \n(see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nIn case of withdrawal of ritonavir from the initial recommended ritonavir boosted regimen \n(see section 4.4), unboosted REYATAZ could be maintained in patients with mild hepatic impairment \n\n\n\n 4\n\nat a dose of 400 mg, and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment with a reduced dose of 300 mg \nonce daily with food (see section 5.2). Unboosted REYATAZ must not be used in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment. \n \nPregnancy and Postpartum \nDuring the second and third trimesters of pregnancy: \nREYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg may not provide sufficient exposure to atazanavir, \nespecially when the activity of atazanavir or the whole regimen may be compromised due to drug \nresistance. Since there are limited data available and due to inter-patient variability during pregnancy, \nTherapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) may be considered to ensure adequate exposure. \n \nThe risk of a further decrease in atazanavir exposure is expected when atazanavir is given with \nmedicinal products known to reduce its exposure (e.g., tenofovir disoproxil or H2-receptor \nantagonists). \n If tenofovir disoproxil or an H2-receptor antagonist is needed, a dose increase to REYATAZ \n\n400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg with TDM may be considered (see sections 4.6 and 5.2). \n It is not recommended to use REYATAZ with ritonavir for pregnant patients who are receiving \n\nboth tenofovir disoproxil and an H2-receptor antagonist. \n \n\n(See section 4.4 Withdrawal of ritonavir only under restrictive conditions). \n \nDuring postpartum: \nFollowing a possible decrease in atazanavir exposure during the second and third trimester, atazanavir \nexposures might increase during the first two months after delivery (see section 5.2). Therefore, \npostpartum patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. \n During this time, postpartum patients should follow the same dose recommendation as for non-\n\npregnant patients, including those for co-administration of medicinal products known to affect \natazanavir exposure (see section 4.5). \n\n \nPaediatric patients (less than 3 months of age) \nREYATAZ should not be used in children less than 3 months because of safety concerns especially \ntaking into account the potential risk of kernicterus. \n \nMethod of administration: \nFor oral use. The capsules should be swallowed whole.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nREYATAZ is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency \n(see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). REYATAZ with ritonavir is contraindicated in patients with moderate \nhepatic insufficiency (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nCo-administration with simvastatin or lovastatin (see section 4.5). \n \nCombination of rifampicin (see section 4.5). \n \nCombination of the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension (PAH) only (see section 4.5). For co-administration of sildenafil for the treatment of \nerectile dysfunction see sections 4.4 and 4.5. \n \nCo-administration with medicinal products that are substrates of the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome \nP450 and have narrow therapeutic windows (e.g., quetiapine, lurasidone, alfuzosin, astemizole, \nterfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil, triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for \ncaution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), and ergot alkaloids, particularly, \nergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine) (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n 5\n\n \nCo-administration with grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed dose \ncombination (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination (see section 4.5) \n \nCo-administration with products containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nCo-administration of REYATAZ with ritonavir at doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been \nclinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses may alter the safety profile of atazanavir \n(cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinaemia) and therefore is not recommended. Only when atazanavir with \nritonavir is co-administered with efavirenz, a dose increase of ritonavir to 200 mg once daily could be \nconsidered. In this instance, close clinical monitoring is warranted (see Interaction with other \nMedicinal Products below). \n \nPatients with coexisting conditions \n \nHepatic impairment: Atazanavir is primarily hepatically metabolised and increased plasma \nconcentrations were observed in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). The \nsafety and efficacy of REYATAZ has not been established in patients with significant underlying liver \ndisorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy \nare at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of \nconcomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for these medicinal products (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nRenal impairment: No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. However, \nREYATAZ is not recommended in patients undergoing haemodialysis (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nQT prolongation: Dose related asymptomatic prolongations in PR interval with REYATAZ have been \nobserved in clinical studies. Caution should be used with medicinal products known to induce PR \nprolongations. In patients with pre-existing conduction problems (second degree or higher \natrioventricular or complex bundle-branch block), REYATAZ should be used with caution and only if \nthe benefits exceed the risk (see section 5.1). Particular caution should be used when prescribing \nREYATAZ in association with medicinal products which have the potential to increase the QT \ninterval and/or in patients with pre-existing risk factors (bradycardia, long congenital QT, electrolyte \nimbalances (see sections 4.8 and 5.3). \n \nHaemophiliac patients: There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin \nhaematomas and haemarthroses, in type A and B haemophiliac patients treated with protease \ninhibitors. In some patients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, \ntreatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A \ncausal relationship has been suggested, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n \n\n\n\n 6\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to the disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nIn clinical studies, REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) has been shown to induce dyslipidaemia to a \nlesser extent than comparators.  \n \nHyperbilirubinaemia \nReversible elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl \ntransferase (UGT) have occurred in patients receiving REYATAZ (see section 4.8). Hepatic \ntransaminase elevations that occur with elevated bilirubin in patients receiving REYATAZ should be \nevaluated for alternative aetiologies. Alternative antiretroviral therapy to REYATAZ may be \nconsidered if jaundice or scleral icterus is unacceptable to a patient. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not \nrecommended because it may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. \n \nIndinavir is also associated with indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia due to inhibition of \nUGT. Combinations of REYATAZ and indinavir have not been studied and co-administration of these \nmedicinal products is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nWithdrawal of ritonavir only under restrictive conditions \nThe recommended standard treatment is REYATAZ boosted with ritonavir, ensuring optimal \npharmacokinetic parameters and level of virologic suppression.  \nThe withdrawal of ritonavir from the boosted regimen of REYATAZ is not recommended, but may be \nconsidered in adults patients at the dose of 400 mg once daily with food only under the following \ncombined restrictive conditions: \n absence of prior virologic failure  \n undetectable viral load during the last 6 months under current regimen \n viral strains not harbouring HIV resistance associated mutations (RAMs) to current regimen. \n\n \nREYATAZ given without ritonavir should not be considered in patients treated with a backbone \nregimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and with other concomitant medications that reduce \natazanavir bioavailability (see section 4.5 In case of withdrawal of ritonavir from the recommended \natazanavir boosted regimen) or in case of perceived challenging compliance. \n \nREYATAZ given without ritonavir should not be used in pregnant patients given that it could result of \nsuboptimal exposure of particular concern for the mother infection and vertical transmission.  \n \nCholelithiasis \nCholelithiasis has been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ (see section 4.8). Some patients \nrequired hospitalization for additional management and some had complications. If signs or symptoms \nof cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered. \n \nChronic kidney disease \nChronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has \nbeen reported during postmarketing surveillance. A large prospective observational study has shown \nan association between an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and cumulative exposure to \natazanavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in HIV-infected patients with an initially normal eGFR. This \nassociation was observed independently of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil. Regular monitoring of the \nrenal function of patients should be maintained throughout the treatment duration (see section 4.8). \n \nNephrolithiasis \nNephrolithiasis has been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ (see section 4.8). Some patients \nrequired hospitalization for additional management and some had complications. In some cases, \n\n\n\n 7\n\nnephrolithiasis has been associated with acute renal failure or renal insufficiency. If signs or symptoms \nof nephrolithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered.  \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and \ntreatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune \nhepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported \ntime to onset is more variable and these events can occurs many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nRash and associated syndromes \nRashes are usually mild -to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks \nof starting therapy with REYATAZ.  \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions and drug rash with \neosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported in patients receiving \nREYATAZ. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin \nreactions. REYATAZ should be discontinued if severe rash develops. \n \nThe best results in managing these events come from early diagnosis and immediate interruption of \nany suspect medicines. If the patient has developed SJS or DRESS associated with the use of \nREYATAZ, REYATAZ may not be restarted. \n \nInteractions with other medicinal products \nThe combination of REYATAZ with atorvastatin is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of REYATAZ with nevirapine or efavirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5). \nIf the co-administration of REYATAZ with an NNRTI is required, an increase in the dose of both \nREYATAZ and ritonavir to 400 mg and 200 mg, respectively, in combination with efavirenz could be \nconsidered with close clinical monitoring. \n \nAtazanavir is metabolised principally by CYP3A4. Co-administration of REYATAZ and medicinal \nproducts that induce CYP3A4 is not recommended (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nPDE5 inhibitors used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: particular caution should be used when \nprescribing PDE5-inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) for the treatment of erectile \ndysfunction in patients receiving REYATAZ. Co-administration of REYATAZ with these medicinal \nproducts is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in PDE5-associated \nadverse reactions such as hypotension, visual changes and priapism (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of voriconazole and REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended, unless an \nassessment of the benefit/risk justifies the use of voriconazole. \n \nIn the majority of patients, a reduction in both voriconazole and atazanavir exposures are expected. In \na small number of patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, significantly increased voriconazole \nexposures are expected (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n 8\n\n \nConcomitant use of REYATAZ/ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised \nby CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of \nsystemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression \n(see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of salmeterol and REYATAZ may result in increased cardiovascular adverse events \nassociated with salmeterol. Co-administration of salmeterol and REYATAZ is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n \nThe absorption of atazanavir may be reduced in situations where gastric pH is increased irrespective of \ncause. \n \nCo-administration of REYATAZ with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended (see section 4.5). If \nthe combination of REYATAZ with a proton pump inhibitor is judged unavoidable, close clinical \nmonitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the dose of REYATAZ to 400 mg with \n100 mg of ritonavir; doses of proton pump inhibitors comparable to omeprazole 20 mg should not be \nexceeded. \n \nCo-administration of REYATAZ with other hormonal contraceptives or oral contraceptives containing \nprogestogens other than norgestimate or norethindrone has not been studied, and therefore should be \navoided (see section 4.5). \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety \nAsymptomatic PR interval prolongation was more frequent in paediatric patients than adults. \nAsymptomatic first- and second-degree AV block was reported in paediatric patients (see section 4.8). \nCaution should be used with medicinal products known to induce PR prolongations. In paediatric \npatients with pre-existing conduction problems (second degree or higher atrioventricular or complex \nbundle-branch block), REYATAZ should be used with caution and only if the benefits exceed the risk. \nCardiac monitoring is recommended based on the presence of clinical findings (e.g., bradycardia). \n \nEfficacy \nAtazanavir/ritonavir is not effective in viral strains harbouring multiple mutations of resistance.  \n \nExcipients \nLactose \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nWhen REYATAZ and ritonavir are co-administered, the metabolic drug interaction profile for \nritonavir may predominate because ritonavir is a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor than atazanavir. The \nSummary of Product Characteristics for ritonavir must be consulted before initiation of therapy with \nREYATAZ and ritonavir. \n \nAtazanavir is metabolised in the liver through CYP3A4. It inhibits CYP3A4. Therefore, REYATAZ is \ncontraindicated with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic \nindex: quetiapine, lurasidone, alfuzosin, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, \nbepridil, triazolam, orally administered midazolam, and ergot alkaloids, particularly ergotamine and \ndihydroergotamine (see section 4.3). \nCo-administration of REYATAZ with grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir \nfixed dose combination is contraindicated because of the increase in grazoprevir and elbasvir plasma \nconcentrations and potential for the increase in risk of ALT elevations associated with increased \ngrazoprevir concentrations (see section 4.3). Co-administration of REYATAZ with \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination is contraindicated because of the potential increase in \n\n\n\n 9\n\nthe risk of ALT elevations due to a significant increase in glecapreir and pibrentasvir plasma \nconcentrations (see section 4.3). \n \nOther interactions \nInteractions between atazanavir and other medicinal products are listed in the table below (increase is \nindicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”). If available, 90% confidence intervals (CI) are \nshown in parentheses. The studies presented in Table 2 were conducted in healthy subjects unless \notherwise noted. Of importance, many studies were conducted with unboosted atazanavir, which is not \nthe recommended regimen of atazanavir (see section 4.4). \n  \nIf withdrawal of ritonavir is medically warranted under restrictive conditions (see section 4.4), special \nattention should be given to atazanavir interactions that may differ in the absence of ritonavir \n(see information below Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Interactions between REYATAZ and other medicinal products \n \n\nMedicinal products by \ntherapeutic area \n\nInteraction Recommendations concerning \nco-administration \n\nANTI-HCV AGENTS \n\nGrazoprevir 200 mg once \ndaily \n(atazanavir 300 mg / ritonavir \n100 mg once daily) \n\nAtazanavir AUC ↑43% (↑30% ↑57%) \nAtazanavir Cmax ↑12% (↑1% ↑24%) \nAtazanavir Cmin ↑23% (↑13% ↑134%) \n \nGrazoprevir AUC: ↑958% (↑678% \n↑1339%) \nGrazoprevir Cmax: ↑524% (↑342% \n↑781%) \nGrazoprevir Cmin: ↑1064% (↑696% \n↑1602%) \n \nGrazoprevir concentrations were \ngreatly increased when \nco-administered with \natazanavir/ritonavir. \n\nCo-administration of \nREYATAZ and \nelbasvir/grazoprevir is \ncontraindicated because of a \nsignificant increase in \ngrazoprevir plasma \nconcentrations and an associated \npotential increase in the risk of \nALT elevations \n(see section 4.3). \n\nElbasvir 50 mg once daily \n(atazanavir 300 mg / ritonavir \n100 mg once daily) \n \n\nAtazanavir AUC ↑7% (↓2% ↑17%) \nAtazanavir Cmax ↑2% (↓4% ↑8%) \nAtazanavir Cmin ↑15% (↑2% ↑29%) \n \nElbasvir AUC: ↑376% (↑307% \n↑456%) \nElbasvir Cmax: ↑315% (↑246% ↑397%) \nElbasvir Cmin: ↑545% (↑451% ↑654%) \n \nElbasvir concentrations were increased \nwhen co-administered with \natazanavir/ritonavir. \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nSofosbuvir 400 mg / \nvelpatasvir 100 mg \n/voxilaprevir 100 mg single \ndose* \n(atazanavir 300 mg / ritonavir \n100 mg once daily) \n\nSofosbuvir AUC : ↑40% (↑25% ↑57%) \nSofosbuvir Cmax :↑29% (↑9% ↑52%) \n \nVelpatasvir AUC: ↑93% (↑58% \n↑136%) \nVelpatasvir Cmax : ↑29% (↑7% ↑56%) \n \nVoxilaprevir AUC : ↑331% (↑276% \n↑393%) \nVoxilaprevir Cmax : ↑342% (↑265% \n↑435%) \n \n*Lack of pharmacokinetics interaction \nbounds 70-143%  \n \n\nEffect on atazanavir and ritonavir \nexposure has not been studied. \nExpected: \n↔ Atazanavir  \n↔ Ritonavir  \n \nThe mechanism of interaction between \nREYATAZ/ritonavir and \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir is \ninhibition of OATP1B, Pgp, and \nCYP3A. \n\nCo-administration of \nREYATAZ with voxilaprevir-\ncontaining products is expected \nto increase the concentration of \nvoxilaprevir.

Further dosage \nreduction of rifabutin to 150 mg \ntwice weekly on set days is \nrecommended for patients in \nwhom the 150 mg dose 3 times \nper week is not tolerated. It \nshould be kept in mind that the \ntwice weekly dosage of 150 mg \nmay not provide an optimal \nexposure to rifabutin thus \nleading to a risk of rifamycin \nresistance and a treatment \nfailure. No dose adjustment is \nneeded for REYATAZ. \n\nRifampicin Rifampicin is a strong CYP3A4 \ninducer and has been shown to cause a \n72% decrease in atazanavir AUC \nwhich can result in virological failure \nand resistance development. During \nattempts to overcome the decreased \nexposure by increasing the dose of \nREYATAZ or other protease inhibitors \nwith ritonavir, a high frequency of \nliver reactions was seen. \n\nThe combination of rifampicin \nand REYATAZ is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\nANTIPSYCHOTICS \n\nQuetiapine Due to CYP3A4 inhibition by \nREYATAZ, concentrations of \nquetiapine are expected to increase. \n\nCo-administration of quetiapine \nwith REYATAZ is \ncontraindicated as REYATAZ \nmay increase quetiapine-related \ntoxicity.

Although not studied, \nsimilar results are expected with other \nproton pump inhibitors. This decrease \nin atazanavir exposure might \nnegatively impact the efficacy of \natazanavir. The mechanism of \ninteraction is decreased solubility of \natazanavir as intra-gastric pH increases \nwith proton pump inhibitors. \n \n\nAntacids \n\nAntacids and medicinal \nproducts containing buffers \n\nReduced plasma concentrations of \natazanavir may be the consequence of \nincreased gastric pH if antacids, \nincluding buffered medicinal products, \nare administered with REYATAZ.  \n\nREYATAZ should be \nadministered 2 hours before or \n1 hour after antacids or buffered \nmedicinal products. \n\nALPHA 1-ADRENORECEPTOR ANTAGONIST \n\nAlfuzosin Potential for increased alfuzosin \nconcentrations which can result in \nhypotension.

A \ndose reduction of buprenorphine \nmay be considered. \n\nMethadone, stable \nmaintenance dose \n(atazanavir 400 mg once daily) \n\nNo significant effect on methadone \nconcentrations was observed. Given \nthat low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice \ndaily) has been shown to have no \nsignificant effect on methadone \nconcentrations, no interaction is \nexpected if methadone is co-\nadministered with REYATAZ, based \non these data. \n\nNo dosage adjustment is \nnecessary if methadone is co-\nadministered with REYATAZ. \n\nPULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION \n\nPDE5 Inhibitors \n\nSildenafil Co-administration with REYATAZ \nmay result in increased concentrations \nof the PDE5 inhibitor and an increase \nin PDE5-inhibitor-associated adverse \nevents.  \n \nThe mechanism of interaction is \nCYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir \nand/or ritonavir. \n \n\nA safe and effective dose in \ncombination with REYATAZ \nhas not been established for \nsildenafil when used to treat \npulmonary arterial hypertension. \nSildenafil, when used for the \ntreatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension, is contraindicated \n(see section 4.3). \n\nSEDATIVES \n\nBenzodiazepines \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nMidazolam \nTriazolam \n\nMidazolam and triazolam are \nextensively metabolised by CYP3A4. \nCo-administration with REYATAZ \nmay cause a large increase in the \nconcentration of these \nbenzodiazepines. No drug interaction \nstudy has been performed for the co-\nadministration of REYATAZ with \nbenzodiazepines. Based on data for \nother CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma \nconcentrations of midazolam are \nexpected to be significantly higher \nwhen midazolam is given orally. Data \nfrom concomitant use of parenteral \nmidazolam with other protease \ninhibitors suggest a possible 3-4 fold \nincrease in midazolam plasma levels. \n\nCo-administration of \nREYATAZ with triazolam or \norally administered midazolam \nis contraindicated \n(see section 4.3), whereas \ncaution should be used with co-\nadministration of REYATAZ \nand parenteral midazolam. If \nREYATAZ is co-administered \nwith parenteral midazolam, it \nshould be done in an intensive \ncare unit (ICU) or similar setting \nwhich ensures close clinical \nmonitoring and appropriate \nmedical management in case of \nrespiratory depression and/or \nprolonged sedation. Dosage \nadjustment for midazolam \nshould be considered, especially \nif more than a single dose of \nmidazolam is administered. \n\n \nIn case of withdrawal of ritonavir from the recommended atazanavir boosted regimen (see section 4.4) \nThe same recommendations for drug drug interactions would apply except:  \n that co-administration is not recommended with tenofovir, boceprevir, carbamazepine, phenytoin, \n\nphenobarbital, proton pump inhibitors, and buprenorphine. \n that co-administration with famotidine is not recommended but if required, atazanavir without \n\nritonavir should be administered either 2 hours after famotidine or 12 hours before. No single \ndose of famotidine should exceed 20 mg, and the total daily dose of famotidine should not exceed \n40 mg.  \n\n the need to consider that  \n co-administration of voriconazole and REYATAZ without ritonavir may affect atazanavir \n\nconcentrations \n co-administration of fluticasone and REYATAZ without ritonavir may increase \n\nfluticasone concentrations relative to fluticasone given alone \n if an oral contraceptive is administered with REYATAZ without ritonavir, it is \n\nrecommended that the oral contraceptive contain no more than 30 µg of ethinyloestradiol  \n no dose adjustment of lamotrigine is required  \n\n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nA moderate amount of data in pregnant women (between 300-1000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no \nmalformative toxicity of atazanavir. Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). The use of REYATAZ with ritonavir may be considered during pregnancy only if \nthe potential benefit justifies the potential risk. \n \nIn clinical trial AI424-182 REYATAZ/ritonavir (300/100 mg or 400/100 mg) in combination with \nzidovudine/lamivudine was administered to 41 pregnant women during the second or third trimester. \nSix of 20 (30%) women on REYATAZ/ritonavir 300/100 mg and 13 of 21 (62%) women on \nREYATAZ/ritonavir 400/100 mg experienced grades 3 to 4 hyperbilirubinaemia. There were no cases \nof lactic acidosis observed in the clinical trial AI424-182. \n \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nThe study assessed 40 infants who received antiretroviral prophylactic treatment (which did not \ninclude REYATAZ) and were negative for HIV-1 DNA at the time of delivery and/or during the first \n6 months postpartum. Three of 20 infants (15%) born to women treated with REYATAZ/ritonavir \n300/100 mg and four of 20 infants (20%) born to women treated with REYATAZ/ritonavir \n400/100 mg experienced grade 3-4 bilirubin. There was no evidence of pathologic jaundice and six of \n40 infants in this study received phototherapy for a maximum of 4 days. There were no reported cases \nof kernicterus in neonates. \n \nFor dosing recommendations see section 4.2 and for pharmacokinetic data see section 5.2. \n \nIt is not known whether REYATAZ with ritonavir administered to the mother during pregnancy will \nexacerbate physiological hyperbilirubinaemia and lead to kernicterus in neonates and infants. In the \nprepartum period, additional monitoring should be considered. \n \nBreast-feeding \nAtazanavir has been detected in human milk. As a general rule, it is recommended that HIV infected \nwomen not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \nFertility \nIn a nonclinical fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, atazanavir altered oestrus \ncycling with no effects on mating or fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with regimens \ncontaining REYATAZ (see section 4.8).  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nREYATAZ has been evaluated for safety in combination therapy with other antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts in controlled clinical trials in 1,806 adult patients receiving REYATAZ 400 mg once daily \n(1,151 patients, 52 weeks median duration and 152 weeks maximum duration) or REYATAZ 300 mg \nwith ritonavir 100 mg once daily (655 patients, 96 weeks median duration and 108 weeks maximum \nduration). \n \nAdverse reactions were consistent between patients who received REYATAZ 400 mg once daily and \npatients who received REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, except that jaundice and \nelevated total bilirubin levels were reported more frequently with REYATAZ plus ritonavir. \n \nAmong patients who received REYATAZ 400 mg once daily or REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir \n100 mg once daily, the only adverse reactions of any severity reported very commonly with at least a \npossible relationship to regimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs were nausea (20%), \ndiarrhoea (10%), and jaundice (13%). Among patients receiving REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir \n100 mg, the frequency of jaundice was 19%. In the majority of cases, jaundice was reported within a \nfew days to a few months after the initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nChronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has \nbeen reported during postmarketing surveillance. A large prospective observational study has shown \nan association between an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and cumulative exposure to \natazanavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in HIV-infected patients with an initially normal eGFR. This \nassociation was observed independently of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil. Regular monitoring of the \nrenal function of patients should be maintained throughout the treatment duration (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAssessment of adverse reactions for REYATAZ is based on safety data from clinical studies and post-\nmarketing experience. Frequency is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), \n\n\n\n 26 \n\ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \n\nImmune system disorders: uncommon: hypersensitivity \n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders: \n\nuncommon: weight decreased, weight gain, anorexia, \nappetite increased \n \n\nPsychiatric disorders: \n \n\nuncommon: depression, disorientation, anxiety, insomnia, \nsleep disorder, abnormal dream \n \n\nNervous system disorders: common: headache; \nuncommon: peripheral neuropathy, syncope, amnesia, \ndizziness, somnolence, dysgeusia \n \n\nEye disorders: common: ocular icterus \n \n\nCardiac disorders: uncommon: torsades de pointesa \nrare: QTc prolongationa, oedema, palpitation \n \n\nVascular disorders: \n \n\nuncommon: hypertension \n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n \n\nuncommon: dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: common: vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, \ndyspepsia; \nuncommon: pancreatitis, gastritis, abdominal distension, \nstomatitis aphthous, flatulence, dry mouth \n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: common: jaundice; \nuncommon: hepatitis, cholelithiasisa, cholestasisa; \nrare: hepatosplenomegaly, cholecystitisa \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders: \n \n\ncommon: rash; \nuncommon: erythemia multiformea,b, toxic skin \neruptionsa,b, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic \nsymptoms (DRESS) syndromea,b, angioedemaa, urticaria, \nalopecia, pruritus;  \nrare: Stevens-Johnson syndromea,b, vesiculobullous rash, \neczema, vasodilatation \n \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: \n\nuncommon: muscle atrophy, arthralgia, myalgia;  \nrare: myopathy \n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: uncommon: nephrolithiasisa, haematuria, proteinuria, \npollakiuria, interstitial nephritis, chronic kidney diseasea; \nrare: kidney pain \n \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders: \n \n\nuncommon: gynaecomastia \n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\ncommon: fatigue; \nuncommon: chest pain, malaise, pyrexia, asthenia; \nrare: gait disturbance \n \n\n\n\n 27 \n\na These adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance, however, the frequencies were estimated from \na statistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to REYATAZ in randomised controlled and other \navailable clinical trials (n = 2321). \nb See description of selected adverse reactions for more details. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy \n(see section 4.4). \n \nRash and associated syndromes \nRashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks \nof starting therapy with REYATAZ.  \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions and drug rash with \neosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported with the use of \nREYATAZ (see section 4.4). \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nThe most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in patients receiving regimens containing \nREYATAZ and one or more NRTIs was elevated total bilirubin reported predominantly as elevated \nindirect [unconjugated] bilirubin (87% Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4). Grade 3 or 4 elevation of total bilirubin \nwas noted in 37% (6% Grade 4). Among experienced patients treated with REYATAZ 300 mg once \ndaily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily for a median duration of 95 weeks, 53% had Grade 3-4 total \nbilirubin elevations. Among naive patients treated with REYATAZ 300 mg once daily with 100 mg \nritonavir once daily for a median duration of 96 weeks, 48% had Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations \n(see section 4.4). \n \nOther marked clinical laboratory abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) reported in ≥ 2% of patients receiving \nregimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs included: elevated creatine kinase (7%), \nelevated alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) (5%), low \nneutrophils (5%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase \n(AST/SGOT) (3%), and elevated lipase (3%). \n \nTwo percent of patients treated with REYATAZ experienced concurrent Grade 3-4 ALT/AST and \nGrade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn a clinical study AI424-020, paediatric patients 3 months to less than 18 years of age who received \neither the oral powder or capsule formulation had a mean duration of treatment with REYATAZ of \n115 weeks. The safety profile in this study was overall comparable to that seen in adults. Both \nasymptomatic first-degree (23%) and second-degree (1%) atrioventricular block were reported in \npaediatric patients. The most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in paediatric patients \nreceiving REYATAZ was elevation of total bilirubin (≥ 2.6 times ULN, Grade 3-4) which occurred in \n45% of patients. \n \nIn clinical studies AI424-397 and AI424-451, paediatric patients 3 months to less than 11 years of age \nhad a mean duration of treatment with REYATAZ oral powder of 80 weeks. No deaths were reported. \n\n\n\n 28 \n\nThe safety profile in these studies was overall comparable to that seen in previous paediatric and adult \nstudies. The most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities in paediatric patients receiving \nREYATAZ oral powder was elevation of total bilirubin (≥ 2.6 times ULN, Grade 3-4; 16%) and \nincreased amylase (Grade 3-4; 33%), generally of non-pancreatic origin. Elevation in ALT levels were \nmore frequently reported in paediatric patients in these studies than in adults. \n \nOther special populations \nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus \nAmong 1,151 patients receiving atazanavir 400 mg once daily, 177 patients were co-infected with \nchronic hepatitis B or C, and among 655 patients receiving atazanavir 300 mg once daily with \nritonavir 100 mg once daily, 97 patients were co-infected with chronic hepatitis B or C. Co-infected \npatients were more likely to have baseline hepatic transaminase elevations than those without chronic \nviral hepatitis. No differences in frequency of bilirubin elevations were observed between these \npatients and those without viral hepatitis. The frequency of treatment emergent hepatitis or \ntransaminase elevations in co-infected patients was comparable between REYATAZ and comparator \nregimens (see section 4.4).  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nHuman experience of acute overdose with REYATAZ is limited. Single doses up to 1,200 mg have \nbeen taken by healthy volunteers without symptomatic untoward effects. At high doses that lead to \nhigh drug exposures, jaundice due to indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia (without associated \nliver function test changes) or PR interval prolongations may be observed (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nTreatment of overdose with REYATAZ should consist of general supportive measures, including \nmonitoring of vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG), and observations of the patient's clinical \nstatus. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed atazanavir should be achieved by emesis or gastric \nlavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid removal of unabsorbed drug. \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with REYATAZ. Since atazanavir is extensively \nmetabolised by the liver and is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant \nremoval of this medicinal product. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE08 \n \nMechanism of action \nAtazanavir is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI). The compound selectively inhibits the \nvirus-specific processing of viral Gag-Pol proteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation \nof mature virions and infection of other cells. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro: atazanavir exhibits anti-HIV-1 (including all clades tested) and anti-HIV-2 \nactivity in cell culture. \n \nResistance \nAntiretroviral treatment naive adult patients \nIn clinical trials of antiretroviral treatment naive patients treated with unboosted atazanavir, the I50L \nsubstitution, sometimes in combination with an A71V change, is the signature resistance substitution \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nfor atazanavir. Resistance levels to atazanavir ranged from 3.5- to 29-fold without evidence of \nphenotypic cross resistance to other PIs. In clinical trials of antiretroviral treatment naive patients \ntreated with boosted atazanavir, the I50L substitution did not emerge in any patient without baseline PI \nsubstitutions. The N88S substitution has been rarely observed in patients with virologic failure on \natazanavir (with or without ritonavir). While it may contribute to decreased susceptibility to atazanavir \nwhen it occurs with other protease substitutions, in clinical studies N88S by itself does not always lead \nto phenotypic resistance to atazanavir or have a consistent impact on clinical efficacy. \n \nTable 3. De novo substitutions in treatment naive patients failing therapy with atazanavir + \nritonavir (Study 138, 96 weeks) \nFrequency de novo PI substitution (n=26)a \n>20% none \n10-20% none \na Number of patients with paired genotypes classified as virological failures (HIV RNA ≥ 400 copies/ml). \n\n \nThe M184I/V substitution emerged in 5/26 REYATAZ/ritonavir and 7/26 lopinavir/ritonavir virologic \nfailure patients, respectively. \n \nAntiretroviral treatment experienced adult patients \nIn antiretroviral treatment experienced patients from Studies 009, 043, and 045, 100 isolates from \npatients designated as virological failures on therapy that included either atazanavir, atazanavir + \nritonavir, or atazanavir + saquinavir were determined to have developed resistance to atazanavir. Of \nthe 60 isolates from patients treated with either atazanavir or atazanavir + ritonavir, 18 (30%) \ndisplayed the I50L phenotype previously described in naive patients. \n \nTable 4.

There was less hyperbilirubinaemia and jaundice in the unboosted \nREYATAZ group compared with the REYATAZ + ritonavir group (18 and 28 subjects, respectively). \n\n\n\n 31 \n\n \nIn antiretroviral experienced adult patients \nStudy 045 is a randomised, multicenter trial comparing REYATAZ/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) \nand REYATAZ/saquinavir (400/1,200 mg once daily), to lopinavir + ritonavir (400/100 mg fixed dose \ncombination twice daily), each in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (see sections 4.5 \nand 4.8) and one NRTI, in patients with virologic failure on two or more prior regimens containing at \nleast one PI, NRTI, and NNRTI. For randomised patients, the mean time of prior antiretroviral \nexposure was 138 weeks for PIs, 281 weeks for NRTIs, and 85 weeks for NNRTIs. At baseline, 34% \nof patients were receiving a PI and 60% were receiving an NNRTI. Fifteen of 120 (13%) patients in \nthe REYATAZ + ritonavir treatment arm and 17 of 123 (14%) patients in the lopinavir + ritonavir arm \nhad four or more of the PI substitutions L10, M46, I54, V82, I84, and L90. Thirty-two percent of \npatients in the study had a viral strain with fewer than two NRTI substitutions. \n \nThe primary endpoint was the time-averaged difference in change from baseline in HIV RNA through \n48 weeks (Table 6). \n \nTable 6: Efficacy Outcomes at Week 48a and at Week 96 (Study 045) \n\nParameter \nATV/RTVb (300 mg/ \n100 mg once daily) \n\nn=120 \n\nLPV/RTVc (400 mg/ \n100 mg twice daily) \n\nn=123 \n\nTime-averaged difference \nATV/RTV-LPV/RTV \n\n[97.5% CId] \n Week 48 Week 96 Week 48 Week 96 Week 48 Week 96 \nHIV RNA Mean Change from Baseline, log10 copies/ml \n\nAll patients \n-1.93 \n\n(n=90 e) \n-2.29 \n\n(n=64) \n-1.87 \n\n(n=99) \n-2.08 \n\n(n=65) \n0.13 \n\n[-0.12, 0.39] \n0.14 \n\n[-0.13, 0.41] \nHIV RNA <50 copies/ml, %f (responder/evaluable) \nAll patients 36 (43/120) 32 (38/120) 42 (52/123) 35 (41/118) NA NA \nHIV RNA <50 copies/ml by select baseline PI substitutions,f, g % (responder/evaluable) \n 0-2 44 (28/63) 41 (26/63) 56 (32/57) 48 (26/54) NA NA \n 3 18 (2/11) 9 (1/11) 38 (6/16) 33 (5/15) NA NA \n ≥ 4 27 (12/45) 24 (11/45) 28 (14/50) 20 (10/49) NA NA \nCD4 Mean Change from Baseline, cells/mm3 \nAll patients 110 (n=83) 122 (n=60) 121 (n=94) 154 (n=60) NA NA \n\na The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 337 cells/mm3 (range: 14 to 1,543 cells/mm3) and the mean baseline plasma HIV-1 \nRNA level was 4.4 log10 copies/ml (range: 2.6 to 5.88 log10 copies/ml). \nb ATV/RTV with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (fixed dose 300 mg/200 mg tablets once daily). \nc LPV/RTV with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (fixed dose 300 mg/200 mg tablets once daily). \nd Confidence interval. \ne Number of patients evaluable. \nf Intent-to-treat analysis, with missing values considered as failures.

Overall in this study, 182 paediatric patients (81 antiretroviral-naive and \n101 antiretroviral-experienced) received once daily REYATAZ (capsule or powder formulation), with \nor without ritonavir, in combination with two NRTIs. \n \nThe clinical data derived from this study are inadequate to support the use of atazanavir (with or \nwithout ritonavir) in children below 6 years of age. \n \nEfficacy data observed in the 41 paediatric patients aged 6 years to less than 18 years that received \nREYATAZ capsules with ritonavir are presented in Table 7. For treatment-naive paediatric patients, \nthe mean baseline CD4 cell count was 344 cells/mm3 (range: 2 to 800 cells/ mm3) and mean baseline \nplasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.67 log10 copies/ml (range: 3.70 to 5.00 log10 copies/ml). For treatment-\nexperienced paediatric patients, the mean baseline CD4 cell count was 522 cells/mm3 (range: 100 to \n1157 cells/ mm3) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.09 log10 copies/ml (range: 3.28 to \n5.00 log10 copies/ml). \n \nTable 7:  Efficacy Outcomes (paediatric patients 6 years to less than 18 years of age) at \n\nWeek 48 (Study AI424-020) \n\nParameter \n\nTreatment-Naive \nREYATAZ \n\nCapsules/ritonavir \n(300 mg/100 mg once \n\ndaily) n=16 \n\nTreatment-\nExperienced \nREYATAZ \n\nCapsules/ritonavir \n(300 mg/100 mg once \n\ndaily) n=25 \nHIV RNA <50 copies/ml, % a \nAll patients 81 (13/16) 24 (6/25) \nHIV RNA <400 copies/ml, % a \nAll patients 88 (14/16) 32 (8/25) \nCD4 Mean Change from Baseline, cells/mm3 \nAll patients 293 (n=14b) 229 (n=14b) \nHIV RNA <50 copies/ml by select baseline PI substitutions,c % (responder/evaluabled) \n0-2 NA 27 (4/15) \n3 NA - \n≥ 4 NA 0 (0/3) \n\na Intent-to-treat analysis, with missing values considered as failures. \nb Number of patients evaluable. \nc PI major L24I, D30N, V32I, L33F, M46IL, I47AV, G48V, I50LV, F53LY,I54ALMSTV, L76V, V82AFLST, I84V, \nN88DS, L90M; PI minor: L10CFIRV, V11I, E35G, K43T, Q58E, A71ILTV, G73ACST, T74P, N83D, L89V. \nd Includes patients with baseline resistance data. \nNA = not applicable. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of atazanavir were evaluated in healthy adult volunteers and in HIV-infected \npatients; significant differences were observed between the two groups. The pharmacokinetics of \natazanavir exhibit a non-linear disposition. \n \nAbsorption: in HIV-infected patients (n=33, combined studies), multiple dosing of REYATAZ 300 mg \nonce daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food produced a geometric mean (CV%) for \natazanavir, Cmax of 4466 (42%) ng/ml, with time to Cmax of approximately 2.5 hours. The geometric \nmean (CV%) for atazanavir Cmin and AUC was 654 (76%) ng/ml and 44185 (51%) ng•h/ml, \nrespectively.  \n \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nIn HIV-infected patients (n=13), multiple dosing of REYATAZ 400 mg (without ritonavir) once daily \nwith food produced a geometric mean (CV%) for atazanavir Cmax of 2298 (71) ng/ml, with time to \nCmax of approximately 2.0 hours. The geometric mean (CV%) for atazanavir Cmin and AUC were \n120 (109) ng/ml and 14874 (91) ng•h/ml, respectively. \n \nFood effect: co-administration of REYATAZ and ritonavir with food optimises the bioavailability of \natazanavir. Co-administration of a single 300 mg dose of REYATAZ and 100 mg dose of ritonavir \nwith a light meal resulted in a 33% increase in the AUC and a 40% increase in both the Cmax and the \n24 hour concentration of atazanavir relative to the fasting state. Co-administration with a high-fat meal \ndid not affect the AUC of atazanavir relative to fasting conditions and the Cmax was within 11% of \nfasting values. The 24 hour concentration following a high fat meal was increased by approximately \n33% due to delayed absorption; the median Tmax increased from 2.0 to 5.0 hours. Administration of \nREYATAZ with ritonavir with either a light or a high-fat meal decreased the coefficient of variation \nof AUC and Cmax by approximately 25% compared to the fasting state. To enhance bioavailability and \nminimise variability, REYATAZ is to be taken with food. \n \nDistribution: atazanavir was approximately 86% bound to human serum proteins over a concentration \nrange of 100 to 10,000 ng/ml. Atazanavir binds to both alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin \nto a similar extent (89% and 86%, respectively, at 1,000 ng/ml). In a multiple-dose study in HIV-\ninfected patients dosed with 400 mg of atazanavir once daily with a light meal for 12 weeks, \natazanavir was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and semen.  \n \nMetabolism: studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated \nthat atazanavir is principally metabolised by CYP3A4 isozyme to oxygenated metabolites. Metabolites \nare then excreted in the bile as either free or glucuronidated metabolites. Additional minor metabolic \npathways consist of N-dealkylation and hydrolysis. Two minor metabolites of atazanavir in plasma \nhave been characterised. Neither metabolite demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity. \n \nElimination: following a single 400 mg dose of 14C-atazanavir, 79% and 13% of the total radioactivity \nwas recovered in the faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged drug accounted for approximately \n20% and 7% of the administered dose in the faeces and urine, respectively. Mean urinary excretion of \nunchanged drug was 7% following 2 weeks of dosing at 800 mg once daily. In HIV-infected adult \npatients (n=33, combined studies) the mean half-life within a dosing interval for atazanavir was \n12 hours at steady state following a dose of 300 mg daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with a light \nmeal. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment: in healthy subjects, the renal elimination of unchanged atazanavir was \napproximately 7% of the administered dose. There are no pharmacokinetic data available for \nREYATAZ with ritonavir in patients with renal insufficiency. REYATAZ (without ritonavir) has been \nstudied in adult patients with severe renal impairment (n=20), including those on haemodialysis, at \nmultiple doses of 400 mg once daily. Although this study presented some limitations (i.e., unbound \ndrug concentrations not studied), results suggested that the atazanavir pharmacokinetic parameters \nwere decreased by 30% to 50% in patients undergoing haemodialysis compared to patients with \nnormal renal function. The mechanism of this decrease is unknown. (See sections 4.2 and 4.4.) \n \nHepatic impairment: atazanavir is metabolised and eliminated primarily by the liver. REYATAZ \n(without ritonavir) has been studied in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment \n(14 Child-Pugh Class B and 2 Child-Pugh Class C subjects) after a single 400 mg dose. The mean \nAUC(0-∞) was 42% greater in subjects with impaired hepatic function than in healthy subjects. The \nmean half-life of atazanavir in hepatically impaired subjects was 12.1 hours compared to 6.4 hours in \nhealthy subjects. The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir after a \n300 mg dose with ritonavir have not been studied. Concentrations of atazanavir with or without \nritonavir are expected to be increased in patients with moderately or severely impaired hepatic \nfunction (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nAge/Gender: a study of the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir was performed in 59 healthy male and \nfemale subjects (29 young, 30 elderly). There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic \ndifferences based on age or gender. \n \nRace: a population pharmacokinetic analysis of samples from Phase II clinical trials indicated no \neffect of race on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir. \n \nPregnancy: \nThe pharmacokinetic data from HIV-infected pregnant women receiving REYATAZ capsules with \nritonavir are presented in Table 8. \n \nTable 8: Steady-State Pharmacokinetics of Atazanavir with ritonavir in HIV-Infected \nPregnant Women in the Fed State \n \n\n atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg \n\nPharmacokinetic Parameter \n2nd Trimester \n\n(n=9) \n3rd Trimester \n\n(n=20) \npostpartuma \n\n(n=36) \n\nCmax ng/mL \n Geometric mean (CV%) \n\n3729.09 \n(39) \n\n3291.46 \n(48) \n\n5649.10 \n(31) \n\nAUC ng•h/mL \n Geometric mean (CV%) \n\n34399.1 \n(37) \n\n34251.5 \n(43) \n\n60532.7 \n(33) \n\nCmin ng/mLb \n Geometric mean (CV%) \n\n663.78 \n(36) \n\n668.48 \n(50) \n\n1420.64 \n(47) \n\na Atazanavir peak concentrations and AUCs were found to be approximately 26-40% higher during the postpartum \nperiod (4-12 weeks) than those observed historically in HIV infected, non-pregnant patients. Atazanavir plasma trough \nconcentrations were approximately 2-fold higher during the postpartum period when compared to those observed \nhistorically in HIV infected non-pregnant patients. \nb Cmin is concentration 24 hours post-dose. \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThere is a trend toward a higher clearance in younger children when normalised for body weight. As a \nresult, greater peak to trough ratios are observed, however at recommended doses, geometric mean \natazanavir exposures (Cmin, Cmax and AUC) in paediatric patients are expected to be similar to those \nobserved in adults.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies, conducted in mice, rats, and dogs, atazanavir-related findings were \ngenerally confined to the liver and included generally minimal to mild increases in serum bilirubin and \nliver enzymes, hepatocellular vacuolation and hypertrophy, and, in female mice only, hepatic single-\ncell necrosis. Systemic exposures of atazanavir in mice (males), rats, and dogs at doses associated with \nhepatic changes were at least equal to that observed in humans given 400 mg once daily. In female \nmice, atazanavir exposure at a dose that produced single-cell necrosis was 12 times the exposure in \nhumans given 400 mg once daily. Serum cholesterol and glucose were minimally to mildly increased \nin rats but not in mice or dogs. \n \nDuring in vitro studies, cloned human cardiac potassium channel (hERG), was inhibited by 15% at a \nconcentration (30 μM) of atazanavir corresponding to 30 fold the free drug concentration at Cmax in \nhumans. Similar concentrations of atazanavir increased by 13% the action potential duration (APD90) \nin rabbit Purkinje fibres study. Electrocardiographic changes (sinus bradycardia, prolongation of PR \ninterval, prolongation of QT interval, and prolongation of QRS complex) were observed only in an \ninitial 2 week oral toxicity study performed in dogs. Subsequent 9 month oral toxicity studies in dogs \nshowed no drug-related electrocardiographic changes. The clinical relevance of these non-clinical data \nis unknown. Potential cardiac effects of this product in humans cannot be ruled out (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.8). The potential for PR prolongation should be considered in cases of overdose \n(see section 4.9). \n\n\n\n 35 \n\n \nIn a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, atazanavir altered oestrus cycling with no \neffects on mating or fertility. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats or rabbits at maternally toxic \ndoses. In pregnant rabbits, gross lesions of the stomach and intestines were observed in dead or \nmoribund does at maternal doses 2 and 4 times the highest dose administered in the definitive embryo-\ndevelopment study. In the pre- and postnatal development assessment in rats, atazanavir produced a \ntransient reduction in body weight in the offspring at a maternally toxic dose. Systemic exposure to \natazanavir at doses that resulted in maternal toxicity was at least equal to or slightly greater than that \nobserved in humans given 400 mg once daily. \n \nAtazanavir was negative in an Ames reverse-mutation assay but did induce chromosomal aberrations \nin vitro in both the absence and presence of metabolic activation. In in vivo studies in rats, atazanavir \ndid not induce micronuclei in bone marrow, DNA damage in duodenum (comet assay), or unscheduled \nDNA repair in liver at plasma and tissue concentrations exceeding those that were clastogenic in vitro. \n \nIn long-term carcinogenicity studies of atazanavir in mice and rats, an increased incidence of benign \nhepatic adenomas was seen in female mice only. The increased incidence of benign hepatic adenomas \nin female mice was likely secondary to cytotoxic liver changes manifested by single-cell necrosis and \nis considered to have no relevance for humans at intended therapeutic exposures. There were no \ntumorigenic findings in male mice or in rats. \n \nAtazanavir increased opacity of bovine corneas in an in vitro ocular irritation study, indicating it may \nbe an ocular irritant upon direct contact with the eye. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral powder \nOff white to pale yellow powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nREYATAZ oral powder, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is indicated in combination with \nother antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected paediatric patients at least \n3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg (see section 4.2). \n \nBased on available virological and clinical data from adult patients, no benefit is expected in patients \nwith strains resistant to multiple protease inhibitors (≥ 4 PI mutations). The choice of REYATAZ in \ntreatment experienced adult and paediatric patients should be based on individual viral resistance \ntesting and the patient’s treatment history (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \nPaediatric patients (at least 3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg) \nThe doses of atazanavir oral powder and ritonavir for paediatric patients are based on body weight as \nshown in Table 1. REYATAZ oral powder must be taken with ritonavir and has to be taken with food. \n \nTable 1: Dose of REYATAZ oral powder with ritonavir for paediatric patientsa (at least \n3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg)  \nBody weight (kg) REYATAZ once daily dose  ritonavir once daily dose \nat least 5 to less than 15 200 mg (4 sachetsb) 80 mgc \nat least 15 to less than 35 250 mg (5 sachetsb) 80 mgc \nat least 35  300 mg (6 sachetsb) 100 mgd \na The same recommendations regarding the timing and maximum doses of concomitant proton pump inhibitors and H2-\nreceptor antagonists in adults also apply to paediatric patients (see section 4.5). \nb Each sachet contains 50 mg of atazanavir.  \n\nc Ritonavir oral solution. \nd Ritonavir oral solution or capsule/tablet. \n \nREYATAZ capsules are available for paediatric patients at least 6 years of age who weigh at least \n15 kg and who are able to swallow capsules (see Summary of Product Characteristics for REYATAZ \n\n\n\n 39 \n\ncapsules). Switching from REYATAZ oral powder to REYATAZ capsules is encouraged as soon as \npatients are able to consistently swallow capsules. \n \nWhen transitioning between formulations, a change in dose may be needed. Consult the dosing table \nfor the specific formulation (see Summary of Product Characteristics for REYATAZ capsules). \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is needed. REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended in patients \nundergoing haemodialysis (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nREYATAZ with ritonavir has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. REYATAZ with \nritonavir should be used with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment. REYATAZ must not \nbe used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and Postpartum \nDuring the second and third trimesters of pregnancy: \nREYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg may not provide sufficient exposure to atazanavir, \nespecially when the activity of atazanavir or the whole regimen may be compromised due to drug \nresistance. Since there are limited data available and due to inter-patient variability during pregnancy, \nTherapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) may be considered to ensure adequate exposure. \n \nThe risk of a further decrease in atazanavir exposure is expected when atazanavir is given with \nmedicinal products known to reduce its exposure (e.g., tenofovir disoproxil or H2-receptor \nantagonists). \n If tenofovir disoproxil or an H2-receptor antagonist is needed, a dose increase to REYATAZ \n\n400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg with TDM may be considered (see sections 4.6 and 5.2). \n It is not recommended to use REYATAZ with ritonavir for pregnant patients who are receiving \n\nboth tenofovir disoproxil and an H2-receptor antagonist. \n \nDuring postpartum: \nFollowing a possible decrease in atazanavir exposure during the second and third trimester, atazanavir \nexposures might increase during the first two months after delivery (see section 5.2). Therefore, \npostpartum patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. \n During this time, postpartum patients should follow the same dose recommendation as for non-\n\npregnant patients, including those for co-administration of medicinal products known to affect \natazanavir exposure (see section 4.5). \n\n \nPaediatric patients (less than 3 months of age) \nREYATAZ has not been studied in children less than 3 months of age and is not recommended \nbecause of the potential risk of kernicterus. \n \nMethod of administration \nFor oral use.  \nREYATAZ oral powder should be taken/given with food (e.g. applesauce or yogurt) or drinks (e.g. \nmilk, infant formula or water) for infants who can drink from a cup. For young infants (less than \n6 months) who cannot eat solid food or drink from a cup, REYATAZ oral powder should be mixed \nwith infant formula and given using an oral syringe, which can be obtained from a pharmacist. \nAdministration of REYATAZ and infant formula using an infant bottle is not recommended because \nthe full dose may not be delivered. \n \nFor details on preparation and administration of the REYATAZ oral powder and Instructions for Use, \nsee section 6.6. \n \n\n\n\n 40 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nPatients with moderate to severe hepatic insufficiency (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCo-administration with simvastatin or lovastatin (see section 4.5). \n \nCombination of rifampicin with concomitant low-dose ritonavir (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension (PAH) only (see section 4.5). For co-administration of sildenafil for the treatment of \nerectile dysfunction see sections 4.4 and 4.5. \n \nCo-administration with medicinal products that are substrates of the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome \nP450 and have narrow therapeutic windows (e.g., quetiapine, alfuzosin, astemizole, terfenadine, \ncisapride, pimozide, quinidine, lurasidone, bepridil, triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for \ncaution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), and ergot alkaloids, particularly, \nergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine) (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration with grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed dose \ncombination (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration with products containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nCo-administration of REYATAZ with ritonavir at doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been \nclinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses may alter the safety profile of atazanavir \n(cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinaemia) and therefore is not recommended. Only when atazanavir with \nritonavir is co-administered with efavirenz, a dose increase of ritonavir to 200 mg once daily could be \nconsidered. In this instance, close clinical monitoring is warranted (see Interaction with other \nMedicinal Products below). \n \nPatients with coexisting conditions \n \nHepatic impairment \nAtazanavir is primarily hepatically metabolised and increased plasma concentrations were observed in \npatients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). The safety and efficacy of REYATAZ has \nnot been established in patients with significant underlying liver disorders. Patients with chronic \nhepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe \nand potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B \nor C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products \n(see section 4.8). \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nRenal impairment  \n\n\n\n 41 \n\nNo dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. However, REYATAZ with \nritonavir is not recommended in patients undergoing haemodialysis (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nQT prolongation \nDose related asymptomatic prolongations in PR interval with REYATAZ have been observed in \nclinical studies. Caution should be used with medicinal products known to induce PR prolongations. In \npatients with pre-existing conduction problems (second degree or higher atrioventricular or complex \nbundle-branch block), REYATAZ should be used with caution and only if the benefits exceed the risk \n(see section 5.1). Particular caution should be used when prescribing REYATAZ in association with \nmedicinal products which have the potential to increase the QT interval and/or in patients with pre-\nexisting risk factors (bradycardia, long congenital QT, electrolyte imbalances (see sections 4.8 \nand 5.3). \n \nHaemophiliac patients \nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthroses, in type A and B haemophiliac patients treated with protease inhibitors. In some \npatients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with \nprotease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal \nrelationship has been suggested, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to the disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nIn clinical studies, REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) has been shown to induce dyslipidaemia to a \nlesser extent than comparators.  \n \nHyperbilirubinaemia \nReversible elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl \ntransferase (UGT) have occurred in patients receiving REYATAZ (see section 4.8). Hepatic \ntransaminase elevations that occur with elevated bilirubin in patients receiving REYATAZ should be \nevaluated for alternative aetiologies. Alternative antiretroviral therapy to REYATAZ may be \nconsidered if jaundice or scleral icterus is unacceptable to a patient. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not \nrecommended because it may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. \n \nIndinavir is also associated with indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia due to inhibition of \nUGT. Combinations of REYATAZ and indinavir have not been studied and co-administration of these \nmedicinal products is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nCholelithiasis \nCholelithiasis has been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ (see section 4.8). Some patients \nrequired hospitalization for additional management and some had complications. If signs or symptoms \nof cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered. \n \nChronic kidney disease \nChronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has \nbeen reported during postmarketing surveillance. A large prospective observational study has shown \nan association between an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and cumulative exposure to  \natazanavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in HIV-infected patients with an initially normal eGFR. This \n\n\n\n 42 \n\nassociation was observed independently of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil. Regular monitoring of the \nrenal function of patients should be maintained throughout the treatment duration (see section 4.8). \n \nNephrolithiasis \nNephrolithiasis has been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ (see section 4.8). Some patients \nrequired hospitalization for additional management and some had complications. In some cases, \nnephrolithiasis has been associated with acute renal failure or renal insufficiency. If signs or symptoms \nof nephrolithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered.  \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and \ntreatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune \nhepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported \ntime to onset is more variable and these events can occurs many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nRash and associated syndromes \nRashes are usually mild -to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks \nof starting therapy with REYATAZ.  \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions and drug rash with \neosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported in patients receiving \nREYATAZ. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin \nreactions. REYATAZ should be discontinued if severe rash develops. \n \nThe best results in managing these events come from early diagnosis and immediate interruption of \nany suspect medicines. If the patient has developed SJS or DRESS associated with the use of \nREYATAZ, REYATAZ may not be restarted. \n \nInteractions with other medicinal products \nThe combination of REYATAZ with atorvastatin is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of REYATAZ with nevirapine or efavirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5). \nIf the co-administration of REYATAZ with an NNRTI is required, an increase in the dose of both \nREYATAZ and ritonavir to 400 mg and 200 mg, respectively, in combination with efavirenz could be \nconsidered with close clinical monitoring. \n \nAtazanavir is metabolised principally by CYP3A4. Co-administration of REYATAZ with ritonavir \nand medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 is not recommended (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nPDE5 inhibitors used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: particular caution should be used when \nprescribing PDE5-inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) for the treatment of erectile \ndysfunction in patients receiving REYATAZ with concomitant low-dose ritonavir. Co-administration \nof REYATAZ with these medicinal products is expected to substantially increase their concentrations \nand may result in PDE5-associated adverse reactions such as hypotension, visual changes and \npriapism (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n 43 \n\n \nCo-administration of voriconazole and REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended, unless an \nassessment of the benefit/risk justifies the use of voriconazole. \n \nIn the majority of patients, a reduction in both voriconazole and atazanavir exposures are expected. In \na small number of patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, significantly increased voriconazole \nexposures are expected (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of REYATAZ/ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised \nby CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of \nsystemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression \n(see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of salmeterol and REYATAZ/ritonavir may result in increased cardiovascular \nadverse events associated with salmeterol. Co-administration of salmeterol and REYATAZ is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5). \n \nThe absorption of atazanavir may be reduced in situations where gastric pH is increased irrespective of \ncause. \n \nCo-administration of REYATAZ with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended (see section 4.5). If \nthe combination of REYATAZ with a proton pump inhibitor is judged unavoidable, close clinical \nmonitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the dose of REYATAZ to 400 mg with \n100 mg of ritonavir; doses of proton pump inhibitors comparable to omeprazole 20 mg should not be \nexceeded. \n \nCo-administration of REYATAZ/ritonavir with other hormonal contraceptives or oral contraceptives \ncontaining progestogens other than norgestimate has not been studied, and therefore should be avoided \n(see section 4.5). \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety \nAsymptomatic PR interval prolongation was more frequent in paediatric patients than adults. \nAsymptomatic first- and second-degree AV block was reported in paediatric patients (see section 4.8). \nCaution should be used with medicinal products known to induce PR prolongations. In paediatric \npatients with pre-existing conduction problems (second degree or higher atrioventricular or complex \nbundle-branch block), REYATAZ should be used with caution and only if the benefits exceed the risk. \nCardiac monitoring is recommended based on the presence of clinical findings (e.g., bradycardia). \n \nEfficacy \nAtazanavir/ritonavir is not effective in viral strains harbouring multiple mutations of resistance.  \n \nExcipients \nPhenylketonuria \nREYATAZ oral powder contains aspartame as a sweetening agent. Aspartame provides a source of \nphenylalanine and, therefore, may not be suitable for persons with phenylketonuria. \n \nDiabetic population \nREYATAZ oral powder contains 1305.15 mg of sucrose per sachet. For the recommended paediatric \ndosage, REYATAZ oral powder contains 3915.45 mg sucrose per 150 mg atazanavir, 5220.60 mg \nsucrose per 200 mg atazanavir, 6525.75 mg sucrose per 250 mg atazanavir, and 7830.90 mg sucrose \nper 300 mg atazanavir. This should be taken into account in patients with diabetes mellitus. Patients \nwith rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase \nisomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. \n \n\n\n\n 44 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nWhen REYATAZ and ritonavir are co-administered, the metabolic drug interaction profile for \nritonavir may predominate because ritonavir is a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor than atazanavir. The \nSummary of Product Characteristics for ritonavir must be consulted before initiation of therapy with \nREYATAZ and ritonavir. \n \nAtazanavir is metabolised in the liver through CYP3A4. It inhibits CYP3A4. Therefore, REYATAZ \nwith ritonavir is contraindicated with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 and have a \nnarrow therapeutic index: quetiapine, lurasidone, alfuzosin, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, \npimozide, quinidine, bepridil, triazolam, orally administered midazolam, and ergot alkaloids, \nparticularly ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (see section 4.3). Co-administration of REYATAZ \nwith grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed dose combination is \ncontraindicated because of the increase in grazoprevir and elbasvir plasma concentrations and \npotential for the increase in risk of ALT elevations associated with increased grazoprevir \nconcentrations (see section 4.3). Co-administration of REYATAZ with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed \ndose combination is contraindicated because of the potential increase in the risk of ALT elevations due \nto a significant increase in glecapreir and pibrentasvir plasma concentrations (see section 4.3). \n \nOther interactions \nInteractions between atazanavir/ritonavir and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than \nprotease inhibitors, and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the table below \n(increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”). If available, 90% confidence \nintervals (CI) are shown in parentheses. The studies presented in Table 2 were conducted in healthy \nsubjects unless otherwise noted. Of importance, many studies were conducted with unboosted \natazanavir, which is not the approved regimen of atazanavir. \n \nTable 2: Interactions between REYATAZ and other medicinal products \n \n\nMedicinal products by \ntherapeutic area \n\nInteraction Recommendations concerning \nco-administration \n\nANTI-HCV AGENTS \n\nGrazoprevir 200 mg once \ndaily \n(atazanavir 300 mg / ritonavir \n100 mg once daily) \n\nAtazanavir AUC ↑43% (↑30% ↑57%) \nAtazanavir Cmax ↑12% (↑1% ↑24%) \nAtazanavir Cmin ↑23% (↑13% ↑134%) \n \nGrazoprevir AUC: ↑958% (↑678% \n↑1339%) \nGrazoprevir Cmax: ↑524% (↑342% \n↑781%) \nGrazoprevir Cmin: ↑1064% (↑696% \n↑1602%) \n \nGrazoprevir concentrations were \ngreatly increased when \nco-administered with \natazanavir/ritonavir. \n\nCo-administration of \nREYATAZ and \nelbasvir/grazoprevir is \ncontraindicated because of a \nsignificant increase in \ngrazoprevir plasma \nconcentrations and an associated \npotential increase in the risk of \nALT elevations \n(see section 4.3). \n\n\n\n 45 \n\nElbasvir 50 mg once daily \n(atazanavir 300 mg / ritonavir \n100 mg once daily) \n \n\nAtazanavir AUC ↑7% (↓2% ↑17%) \nAtazanavir Cmax ↑2% (↓4% ↑8%) \nAtazanavir Cmin ↑15% (↑2% ↑29%) \n \nElbasvir AUC: ↑376% (↑307% \n↑456%) \nElbasvir Cmax: ↑315% (↑246% ↑397%) \nElbasvir Cmin: ↑545% (↑451% ↑654%) \n \nElbasvir concentrations were increased \nwhen co-administered with \natazanavir/ritonavir. \n\nSofosbuvir 400 mg / \nvelpatasvir 100 mg / \nvoxilaprevir 100 mg single \ndose* \n(atazanavir 300 mg / ritonavir \n100 mg once daily) \n\nSofosbuvir AUC : ↑40% (↑25% ↑57%) \nSofosbuvir Cmax :↑29% (↑9% ↑52%) \n \nVelpatasvir AUC: ↑93% (↑58% \n↑136%) \nVelpatasvir Cmax : ↑29% (↑7% ↑56%) \n \nVoxilaprevir AUC : ↑331% (↑276% \n↑393%) \nVoxilaprevir Cmax : ↑342% (↑265% \n↑435%) \n \n*Lack of pharmacokinetics interaction \nbounds 70-143% \n \nEffect on atazanavir and ritonavir \nexposure has not been studied. \nExpected: \n↔ Atazanavir  \n↔ Ritonavir  \n \nThe mechanism of interaction between \nREYATAZ/ritonavir and \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir is \ninhibition of OATP1B, Pgp, and \nCYP3A. \n\nCo-administration of \nREYATAZ with voxilaprevir-\ncontaining products is expected \nto increase the concentration of \nvoxilaprevir.

Fluvastatin is partially \nmetabolised by CYP2C9. \n\nCaution should be exercised. \n\nINHALED BETA AGONISTS \n\nSalmeterol Co-administration with \nREYATAZ/ritonavir may result in \nincreased concentrations of salmeterol \nand an increase in salmeterol-\nassociated adverse events. \n \nThe mechanism of interaction is \nCYP3A4 inhibition by \natazanavir/ritonavir. \n\nCo-administration of salmeterol \nwith REYATAZ/ritonavir is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n\nOPIOIDS \n\nBuprenorphine, once daily, \nstable maintenance dose \n(atazanavir 300 mg once daily \nwith ritonavir 100 mg once \ndaily) \n\nBuprenorphine AUC ↑67% \nBuprenorphine Cmax ↑37%  \nBuprenorphine Cmin ↑69% \n \nNorbuprenorphine AUC ↑105% \nNorbuprenorphine Cmax ↑61% \nNorbuprenorphine Cmin ↑101% \n \nThe mechanism of interaction is \nCYP3A4 and UGT1A1 inhibition. \nConcentrations of atazanavir were not \nsignificantly affected. \n\nCo-administration warrants \nclinical monitoring for sedation \nand cognitive effects. A dose \nreduction of buprenorphine may \nbe considered. \n\nMethadone, stable \nmaintenance dose \n(atazanavir 400 mg once daily) \n\nNo significant effect on methadone \nconcentrations was observed. Given \nthat low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice \ndaily) has been shown to have no \nsignificant effect on methadone \nconcentrations, no interaction is \nexpected if methadone is co-\nadministered with REYATAZ and \nritonavir, based on these data. \n\nNo dosage adjustment is \nnecessary if methadone is co-\nadministered with REYATAZ \nand ritonavir. \n\nPULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION \n\nPDE5 Inhibitors \n\n\n\n 58 \n\nSildenafil Co-administration with \nREYATAZ/ritonavir may result in \nincreased concentrations of the PDE5 \ninhibitor and an increase in PDE5-\ninhibitor-associated adverse events.  \n \nThe mechanism of interaction is \nCYP3A4 inhibition by \natazanavir/ritonavir. \n \n\nA safe and effective dose in \ncombination with \nREYATAZ/ritonavir has not \nbeen established for sildenafil \nwhen used to treat pulmonary \narterial hypertension. Sildenafil, \nwhen used for the treatment of \npulmonary arterial hypertension, \nis contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3). \n\nSEDATIVES \n\nBenzodiazepines \n\nMidazolam \nTriazolam \n\nMidazolam and triazolam are \nextensively metabolised by CYP3A4. \nCo-administration with \nREYATAZ/ritonavir may cause a \nlarge increase in the concentration of \nthese benzodiazepines. No drug \ninteraction study has been performed \nfor the co-administration of \nREYATAZ/ritonavir with \nbenzodiazepines. Based on data for \nother CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma \nconcentrations of midazolam are \nexpected to be significantly higher \nwhen midazolam is given orally. Data \nfrom concomitant use of parenteral \nmidazolam with other protease \ninhibitors suggest a possible 3-4 fold \nincrease in midazolam plasma levels. \n\nREYATAZ/ritonavir should not \nbe co-administered with \ntriazolam or orally administered \nmidazolam (see section 4.3), \nwhereas caution should be used \nwith co-administration of \nREYATAZ/ritonavir and \nparenteral midazolam. If \nREYATAZ is co-administered \nwith parenteral midazolam, it \nshould be done in an intensive \ncare unit (ICU) or similar setting \nwhich ensures close clinical \nmonitoring and appropriate \nmedical management in case of \nrespiratory depression and/or \nprolonged sedation. Dosage \nadjustment for midazolam \nshould be considered, especially \nif more than a single dose of \nmidazolam is administered. \n\n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nA moderate amount of data in pregnant women (between 300-1000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no \nmalformative toxicity of atazanavir. Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see \nsection 5.3). The use of REYATAZ may be considered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit \njustifies the potential risk. \n \nIn clinical trial AI424-182 REYATAZ/ritonavir (300/100 mg or 400/100 mg) in combination with \nzidovudine/lamivudine was administered to 41 pregnant women during the second or third trimester. \nSix of 20 (30%) women on REYATAZ/ritonavir 300/100 mg and 13 of 21 (62%) women on \nREYATAZ/ritonavir 400/100 mg experienced grades 3 to 4 hyperbilirubinaemia. There were no cases \nof lactic acidosis observed in the clinical trial AI424-182. \n \nThe study assessed 40 infants who received antiretroviral prophylactic treatment (which did not \ninclude REYATAZ) and were negative for HIV-1 DNA at the time of delivery and/or during the first \n6 months postpartum. Three of 20 infants (15%) born to women treated with REYATAZ/ritonavir \n300/100 mg and four of 20 infants (20%) born to women treated with REYATAZ/ritonavir \n400/100 mg experienced grade 3-4 bilirubin. There was no evidence of pathologic jaundice and six of \n\n\n\n 59 \n\n40 infants in this study received phototherapy for a maximum of 4 days. There were no reported cases \nof kernicterus in neonates. \n \nFor dosing recommendations see section 4.2 and for pharmacokinetic data see section 5.2. \n \nIt is not known whether REYATAZ administered to the mother during pregnancy will exacerbate \nphysiological hyperbilirubinaemia and lead to kernicterus in neonates and infants. In the prepartum \nperiod, additional monitoring should be considered. \n \nBreast-feeding \nAtazanavir has been detected in human milk. As a general rule, it is recommended that HIV infected \nwomen not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \nFertility \nIn a non-clinical fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, atazanavir altered oestrus \ncycling with no effects on mating or fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with regimens \ncontaining REYATAZ (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nREYATAZ has been evaluated for safety in combination therapy with other antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts in controlled clinical trials in 1,806 adult patients receiving REYATAZ 400 mg once daily \n(1,151 patients, 52 weeks median duration and 152 weeks maximum duration) or REYATAZ 300 mg \nwith ritonavir 100 mg once daily (655 patients, 96 weeks median duration and 108 weeks maximum \nduration). \n \nAdverse reactions were consistent between patients who received REYATAZ 400 mg once daily and \npatients who received REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, except that jaundice and \nelevated total bilirubin levels were reported more frequently with REYATAZ plus ritonavir. \n \nAmong patients who received REYATAZ 400 mg once daily or REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir \n100 mg once daily, the only adverse reactions of any severity reported very commonly with at least a \npossible relationship to regimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs were nausea (20%), \ndiarrhoea (10%), and jaundice (13%). Among patients receiving REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir \n100 mg, the frequency of jaundice was 19%. In the majority of cases, jaundice was reported within a \nfew days to a few months after the initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nChronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has \nbeen reported during postmarketing surveillance.  A large prospective observational study has shown \nan association between an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and cumulative exposure to \natazanavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in HIV-infected patients with an initially normal eGFR. This \nassociation was observed independently of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil. Regular monitoring of the \nrenal function of patients should be maintained throughout the treatment duration (see section 4.4).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAssessment of adverse reactions for REYATAZ is based on safety data from clinical studies and post-\nmarketing experience. Frequency is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \n\nImmune system disorders: uncommon: hypersensitivity \n\n\n\n 60 \n\n \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders: \n\nuncommon: weight decreased, weight gain, anorexia, \nappetite increased \n \n\nPsychiatric disorders: \n \n\nuncommon: depression, disorientation, anxiety, insomnia, \nsleep disorder, abnormal dream \n \n\nNervous system disorders: common: headache; \nuncommon: peripheral neuropathy, syncope, amnesia, \ndizziness, somnolence, dysgeusia \n \n\nEye disorders: common: ocular icterus \n \n\nCardiac disorders: uncommon: torsades de pointesa \nrare: QTc prolongationa, oedema, palpitation \n \n\nVascular disorders: \n \n\nuncommon: hypertension \n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n \n\nuncommon: dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: common: vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, \ndyspepsia; \nuncommon: pancreatitis, gastritis, abdominal distension, \nstomatitis aphthous, flatulence, dry mouth \n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: common: jaundice; \nuncommon: hepatitis, cholelithiasisa, cholestasisa; \nrare: hepatosplenomegaly, cholecystitisa \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders: \n \n\ncommon: rash; \nuncommon: erythemia multiformea,b, toxic skin \neruptionsa,b, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic \nsymptoms (DRESS) syndromea,b, angioedemaa, urticaria, \nalopecia, pruritus;  \nrare: Stevens-Johnson syndromea,b, vesiculobullous rash, \neczema, vasodilatation \n \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: \n\nuncommon: muscle atrophy, arthralgia, myalgia;  \nrare: myopathy \n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: uncommon: nephrolithiasisa, haematuria, proteinuria, \npollakiuria, interstitial nephritis, chronic kidney diseasea; \nrare: kidney pain \n \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders: \n \n\nuncommon: gynaecomastia \n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\ncommon: fatigue; \nuncommon: chest pain, malaise, pyrexia, asthenia; \nrare: gait disturbance \n \n\na These adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance, however, the frequencies were estimated from \na statistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to REYATAZ in randomised controlled and other \navailable clinical trials (n = 2321). \nb See description of selected adverse reactions for more details. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n\n\n 61 \n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy \n(see section 4.4). \n \nRash and associated syndromes \nRashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks \nof starting therapy with REYATAZ.  \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions and drug rash with \neosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported with the use of \nREYATAZ (see section 4.4). \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nThe most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in patients receiving regimens containing \nREYATAZ and one or more NRTIs was elevated total bilirubin reported predominantly as elevated \nindirect [unconjugated] bilirubin (87% Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4). Grade 3 or 4 elevation of total bilirubin \nwas noted in 37% (6% Grade 4). Among experienced patients treated with REYATAZ 300 mg once \ndaily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily for a median duration of 95 weeks, 53% had Grade 3-4 total \nbilirubin elevations. Among naive patients treated with REYATAZ 300 mg once daily with 100 mg \nritonavir once daily for a median duration of 96 weeks, 48% had Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations \n(see section 4.4). \n \nOther marked clinical laboratory abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) reported in ≥ 2% of patients receiving \nregimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs included: elevated creatine kinase (7%), \nelevated alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) (5%), low \nneutrophils (5%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase \n(AST/SGOT) (3%), and elevated lipase (3%). \n \nTwo percent of patients treated with REYATAZ experienced concurrent Grade 3-4 ALT/AST and \nGrade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn a clinical study AI424-020, paediatric patients 3 months to less than 18 years of age who received \neither the oral powder or capsule formulation had a mean duration of treatment with REYATAZ of \n115 weeks. The safety profile in this study was overall comparable to that seen in adults. Both \nasymptomatic first-degree (23%) and second-degree (1%) atrioventricular block were reported in \npaediatric patients. The most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities in paediatric patients \nreceiving REYATAZ was elevation of total bilirubin (≥ 2.6 times ULN, Grade 3-4) which occurred in \n45% of patients. \n \nIn clinical studies AI424-397 and AI424-451, paediatric patients 3 months to less than 11 years of age \nhad a mean duration of treatment with REYATAZ oral powder of 80 weeks. No deaths were reported. \nThe safety profile in these studies was overall comparable to that seen in previous paediatric and adult \nstudies. The most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities in paediatric patients receiving \nREYATAZ oral powder was elevation of total bilirubin (≥ 2.6 times ULN, Grade 3-4; 16%) and \nincreased amylase (Grade 3-4; 33%), generally of non-pancreatic origin. Elevation in ALT levels were \nmore frequently reported in paediatric patients in these studies than in adults. \n\n\n\n 62 \n\n \nOther special populations \nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus \nAmong 1,151 patients receiving atazanavir 400 mg once daily, 177 patients were co-infected with \nchronic hepatitis B or C, and among 655 patients receiving atazanavir 300 mg once daily with \nritonavir 100 mg once daily, 97 patients were co-infected with chronic hepatitis B or C. Co-infected \npatients were more likely to have baseline hepatic transaminase elevations than those without chronic \nviral hepatitis. No differences in frequency of bilirubin elevations were observed between these \npatients and those without viral hepatitis. The frequency of treatment emergent hepatitis or \ntransaminase elevations in co-infected patients was comparable between REYATAZ and comparator \nregimens (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nHuman experience of acute overdose with REYATAZ is limited. Single doses up to 1,200 mg have \nbeen taken by healthy volunteers without symptomatic untoward effects. At high doses that lead to \nhigh drug exposures, jaundice due to indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia (without associated \nliver function test changes) or PR interval prolongations may be observed (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nTreatment of overdose with REYATAZ should consist of general supportive measures, including \nmonitoring of vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG), and observations of the patient's clinical \nstatus. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed atazanavir should be achieved by emesis or gastric \nlavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid removal of unabsorbed drug. \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with REYATAZ. Since atazanavir is extensively \nmetabolised by the liver and is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant \nremoval of this medicinal product. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE08 \n \nMechanism of action \nAtazanavir is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI). The compound selectively inhibits the \nvirus-specific processing of viral Gag-Pol proteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation \nof mature virions and infection of other cells. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro: atazanavir exhibits anti-HIV-1 (including all clades tested) and anti-HIV-2 \nactivity in cell culture. \n \nResistance \nAntiretroviral treatment naive adult patients \nIn clinical trials of antiretroviral treatment naive patients treated with unboosted atazanavir, the I50L \nsubstitution, sometimes in combination with an A71V change, is the signature resistance substitution \nfor atazanavir. Resistance levels to atazanavir ranged from 3.5- to 29-fold without evidence of \nphenotypic cross resistance to other PIs. In clinical trials of antiretroviral treatment naive patients \ntreated with boosted atazanavir, the I50L substitution did not emerge in any patient without baseline PI \nsubstitutions. The N88S substitution has been rarely observed in patients with virologic failure on \natazanavir (with or without ritonavir). While it may contribute to decreased susceptibility to atazanavir \n\n\n\n 63 \n\nwhen it occurs with other protease substitutions, in clinical studies N88S by itself does not always lead \nto phenotypic resistance to atazanavir or have a consistent impact on clinical efficacy. \n \nTable 3.

Of \nthe 60 isolates from patients treated with either atazanavir or atazanavir + ritonavir, 18 (30%) \ndisplayed the I50L phenotype previously described in naive patients. \n \nTable 4.

FC susceptibility in cell \nculture relative to the wild-type reference was assayed using PhenoSenseTM (Monogram Biosciences, South San \nFrancisco, California, USA) \n\n \nNone of the de novo substitutions (see Table 4) are specific to atazanavir and may reflect re-\nemergence of archived resistance on atazanavir + ritonavir in Study 045 treatment-experienced \npopulation. \n \nThe resistance in antiretroviral treatment experienced patients mainly occurs by accumulation of the \nmajor and minor resistance substitutions described previously to be involved in protease inhibitor \nresistance. \n \nClinical results \nIn antiretroviral naive adult patients \nStudy 138 is an international randomised, open-label, multicenter, prospective trial of \n883 antiretroviral treatment naive patients comparing REYATAZ/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg once \ndaily) to lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg twice daily), each in combination with fixed dose \ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (300 mg/200 mg tablets once daily). The \nREYATAZ/ritonavir arm showed similar (non-inferior) antiviral efficacy compared to the \nlopinavir/ritonavir arm, as assessed by the proportion of patients with HIV RNA < 50 copies/ml at \nweek 48 (Table 5). \n \nAnalyses of data through 96 weeks of treatment demonstrated durability of antiviral activity (Table 5). \n \nThe mean baseline CD4 cell count was 214 cells/mm3 (range: 2 to 810 cells/mm3) and mean baseline \nplasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.94 log10 copies/ml (range: 2.6 to 5.88 log10 copies/ml). The \nREYATAZ/ritonavir arm has similar (non-inferior) antiviral efficacy compared to the \nlopinavir/ritonavir arm, as assessed by the proportion of patients with HIV RNA < 50 copies/ml at \nweek 48: 78% of patients on REYATAZ/ritonavir compared to 76% on lopinavir/ritonavir (difference \nestimate of ATV/RTV-LPV/RTV: 1.7% [95% CI, -3.8%, 7.1%] according to the Confirmed Virologic \nResponse (CVR) Non-Completer = Failure (NC = F) definition of response. \n \n\n\n\n 64 \n\nIn a per protocol analysis which excluded non-completers (i.e. patients who discontinued before the \nweek 48 HIV RNA assessment) and patients with major protocol deviations, the proportion of patients \nwith HIV RNA < 50 copies/ml at week 48 was 86% (338/392) for REYATAZ/ritonavir and 89% \n(332/372) for lopinavir/ritonavir (difference estimate of ATV/RTV-LPV/RTV: -3% [95% CI, -7.6%, \n1.5%]. \n \nTable 5: Efficacy Outcomes in Study 138 a \n\nParameter \n\nREYATAZ/ritonavirb \n(300 mg/100 mg once daily) \n\nn=440 \n\nLopinavir/ritonavirc \n(400 mg/100 mg twice daily) \n\nn=443 \n Week 48 Week 96 Week 48 Week 96 \nHIV RNA <50 copies/ml, % \nAll patientsd 78 74 76 68 \nDifference estimate  \n    [95% CI]d \n\nWeek 48: 1.7% [-3.8%, 7.1%] \nWeek 96: 6.1% [0.3%, 12.0%] \n\nPer protocol analysise 86 \n(n=392f) \n\n91 \n(n=352) \n\n89 \n(n=372) \n\n89 \n(n=331) \n\nDifference estimatee  \n     [95% CI] \n\nWeek 48: -3% [-7.6%, 1.5%] \nWeek 96: 2.2% [-2.3%, 6.7%] \n\nHIV RNA <50 copies/ml, % by Baseline Characteristicd \nHIV RNA  \n    <100,000 copies/ml 82 (n=217) 75 (n=217) 81 (n=218) 70 (n=218) \n    ≥100,000 copies/ml 74 (n=223) 74 (n=223) 72 (n=225) 66 (n=225) \nCD4 count \n    <50 cells/mm3 \n\n78 (n=58) 78 (n=58) 63 (n=48) 58 (n=48) \n\n    50 to <100 cells/mm3 76 (n=45) 71 (n=45) 69 (n=29) 69 (n=29) \n    100 to <200 cells/mm3 75 (n=106) 71 (n=106) 78 (n=134) 70 (n=134) \n   ≥ 200 cells/mm3 80 (n=222) 76 (n=222) 80 (n=228) 69 (n=228) \nHIV RNA Mean Change from Baseline, log10 copies/ml \n   All patients -3.09 (n=397) -3.21 (n=360) -3.13 (n=379) -3.19 (n=340) \nCD4 Mean Change from Baseline, cells/mm3  \n   All patients 203 (n=370) 268 (n=336) 219 (n=363) 290 (n=317) \nCD4 Mean Change from Baseline, cells/mm3 by Baseline Characteristic \nHIV RNA  \n   <100,000 copies/ml \n\n179 (n=183) 243 (n=163) 194 (n=183) 267 (n=152) \n\n   ≥100,000 copies/ml 227 (n=187) 291 (n=173) 245 (n=180) 310 (n=165) \na Mean baseline CD4 cell count was 214 cells/mm3 (range 2 to 810 cells/mm3) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was \n4.94 log10 copies/ml (range 2.6 to 5.88 log10 copies/ml) \nb REYATAZ/RTV with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (fixed dose 300 mg/200 mg tablets once daily). \nc Lopinavir/RTV with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (fixed dose 300 mg/200 mg tablets once daily). \nd Intent-to-treat analysis, with missing values considered as failures. \ne Per protocol analysis: Excluding non-completers and patients with major protocol deviations. \nf Number of patients evaluable. \n \nIn antiretroviral experienced adult patients \nStudy 045 is a randomised, multicenter trial comparing REYATAZ/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) \nand REYATAZ/saquinavir (400/1,200 mg once daily), to lopinavir + ritonavir (400/100 mg fixed dose \ncombination twice daily), each in combination with tenofovi disoproxil fumarate (see sections 4.5 \nand 4.8) and one NRTI, in patients with virologic failure on two or more prior regimens containing at \nleast one PI, NRTI, and NNRTI.

It is \nimportant to note that at time of the 96-week analysis, 48 % of patients overall remained on study. \n \nREYATAZ + saquinavir was shown to be inferior to lopinavir + ritonavir. \n \nPaediatric population \nPaediatric trials with REYATAZ capsules \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of REYATAZ is based on data \nfrom the open-label, multicenter clinical trial AI424-020 conducted in patients from 3 months to \n21 years of age. Overall in this study, 182 paediatric patients (81 antiretroviral-naive and \n101 antiretroviral-experienced) received once daily REYATAZ (capsule or powder formulation), with \nor without ritonavir, in combination with two NRTIs. \n \nThe clinical data derived from this study are inadequate to support the use of atazanavir capsules (with \nor without ritonavir) in children below 6 years of age. \n \n\n\n\n 66 \n\nEfficacy data observed in the 41 paediatric patients aged 6 years to less than 18 years that received \nREYATAZ capsules with ritonavir are presented in Table 7. For treatment-naive paediatric patients, \nthe mean baseline CD4 cell count was 344 cells/mm3 (range: 2 to 800 cells/ mm3) and mean baseline \nplasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.67 log10 copies/ml (range: 3.70 to 5.00 log10 copies/ml). For treatment-\nexperienced paediatric patients, the mean baseline CD4 cell count was 522 cells/mm3 (range: 100 to \n1157 cells/ mm3) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.09 log10 copies/ml (range: 3.28 to \n5.00 log10 copies/ml). \n \nTable 7:  Efficacy Outcomes (paediatric patients 6 years to less than 18 years of age) at Week \n\n48 (Study AI424-020) \n\nParameter \n\nTreatment-Naive \nREYATAZ \n\nCapsules/ritonavir \n(300 mg/100 mg once \n\ndaily) n=16 \n\nTreatment-\nExperienced \nREYATAZ \n\nCapsules/ritonavir \n(300 mg/100 mg once \n\ndaily) n=25 \nHIV RNA <50 copies/ml, % a \nAll patients 81 (13/16) 24 (6/25) \nHIV RNA <400 copies/ml, % a \nAll patients 88 (14/16) 32 (8/25) \nCD4 Mean Change from Baseline, cells/mm3 \nAll patients 293 (n=14b) 229 (n=14b) \nHIV RNA <50 copies/ml by select baseline PI substitutions,c % (responder/evaluabled) \n0-2 NA 27 (4/15) \n3 NA - \n≥ 4 NA 0 (0/3) \n\na Intent-to-treat analysis, with missing values considered as failures. \nb Number of patients evaluable. \nc PI major L24I, D30N, V32I, L33F, M46IL, I47AV, G48V, I50LV, F53LY, I54ALMSTV, L76V, V82AFLST, I84V, \nN88DS, L90M; PI minor: L10CFIRV, V11I, E35G, K43T, Q58E, A71ILTV, G73ACST, T74P, N83D, L89V. \nd Includes patients with baseline resistance data. \nNA = not applicable. \n \nPaediatric trials with REYATAZ oral powder \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and virologic response of REYATAZ oral \npowder was based on data from two open-label, multicenter clinical trials. \n AI424-397 (PRINCE I): In paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 6 years of age \n AI424-451 (PRINCE II): In paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 11 years of age \n\nIn these studies, 155 patients (59 antiretroviral-naive and 96 antiretroviral-experienced) received once \ndaily REYATAZ oral powder and ritonavir, in combination with two NRTIs. \n \nFor inclusion in both trials, treatment-naive patients had to have genotypic sensitivity to REYATAZ \nand two NRTIs, and treatment-experienced patients had to have documented genotypic and phenotypic \nsensitivity at screening to REYATAZ and at least 2 NRTIs. Patients exposed only to antiretrovirals in \nutero or intrapartum were considered treatment-naive. Patients who received REYATAZ or \nREYATAZ/ritonavir at any time prior to study enrollment or who had a history of treatment failure on \ntwo or more protease inhibitors, protease inhibitor resistance or evidence of pre-existing cardiac \nabnormalities were excluded from the trials. Protease inhibitor resistance was defined as genotypic \nresistance to atazanavir or either component of the local NRTI backbone based on the criteria of 1) any \nmajor mutations: I50L, I84V, N88S and 2) ≥ 2 of the following minor or cross resistant mutations: \nM46I/L, G48V, I54L/V/M/T/A, V82A/T/FI, L90M, V32I. \n \nAt Week 48 there were 134 paediatric patients aged 3 months to less than 11 years that received \nREYATAZ oral powder with ritonavir that were evaluated for efficacy. These data are presented in \nTable 8. For treatment-naive paediatric patients, the mean baseline CD4 cell count was 930 cells/mm3 \n(range: 46 to 2291 cells/mm3) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.81 log10 copies/ml (range: \n3.4 to 5.9 log10 copies/ml).

The geometric \nmean (CV%) for atazanavir Cmin and AUC was 654 (76%) ng/ml and 44185 (51%) ng•h/ml, \nrespectively.  \n \nFood effect: co-administration of REYATAZ and ritonavir with food optimises the bioavailability of \natazanavir. Co-administration of a single 300 mg dose of REYATAZ and 100 mg dose of ritonavir \nwith a light meal resulted in a 33% increase in the AUC and a 40% increase in both the Cmax and the \n24 hour concentration of atazanavir relative to the fasting state. Co-administration with a high-fat meal \ndid not affect the AUC of atazanavir relative to fasting conditions and the Cmax was within 11% of \nfasting values. The 24 hour concentration following a high fat meal was increased by approximately \n33% due to delayed absorption; the median Tmax increased from 2.0 to 5.0 hours. Administration of \nREYATAZ with ritonavir with either a light or a high-fat meal decreased the coefficient of variation \nof AUC and Cmax by approximately 25% compared to the fasting state. To enhance bioavailability and \nminimise variability, REYATAZ is to be taken with food. \n \nDistribution: atazanavir was approximately 86% bound to human serum proteins over a concentration \nrange of 100 to 10,000 ng/ml. Atazanavir binds to both alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin \nto a similar extent (89% and 86%, respectively, at 1,000 ng/ml). In a multiple-dose study in HIV-\ninfected patients dosed with 400 mg of atazanavir once daily with a light meal for 12 weeks, \natazanavir was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and semen.  \n \nMetabolism: studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated \nthat atazanavir is principally metabolised by CYP3A4 isozyme to oxygenated metabolites. Metabolites \nare then excreted in the bile as either free or glucuronidated metabolites. Additional minor metabolic \n\n\n\n 68 \n\npathways consist of N-dealkylation and hydrolysis. Two minor metabolites of atazanavir in plasma \nhave been characterised. Neither metabolite demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity. \n \nElimination: following a single 400 mg dose of 14C-atazanavir, 79% and 13% of the total radioactivity \nwas recovered in the faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged drug accounted for approximately \n20% and 7% of the administered dose in the faeces and urine, respectively. Mean urinary excretion of \nunchanged drug was 7% following 2 weeks of dosing at 800 mg once daily. In HIV-infected adult \npatients (n=33, combined studies) the mean half-life within a dosing interval for atazanavir was 12 \nhours at steady state following a dose of 300 mg daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with a light \nmeal. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity: the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir were evaluated in healthy adult volunteers \nand in HIV infected patients; significant differences were observed between the two groups. The \npharmacokinetics of atazanavir exhibit a non-linear disposition. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment: in healthy subjects, the renal elimination of unchanged atazanavir was \napproximately 7% of the administered dose. There are no pharmacokinetic data available for \nREYATAZ with ritonavir in patients with renal insufficiency. REYATAZ (without ritonavir) has been \nstudied in adult patients with severe renal impairment (n=20), including those on haemodialysis, at \nmultiple doses of 400 mg once daily. Although this study presented some limitations (i.e., unbound \ndrug concentrations not studied), results suggested that the atazanavir pharmacokinetic parameters \nwere decreased by 30% to 50% in patients undergoing haemodialysis compared to patients with \nnormal renal function. The mechanism of this decrease is unknown (see sections 4.2 and 4.4.). \n \nHepatic impairment: atazanavir is metabolised and eliminated primarily by the liver. The effects of \nhepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir after a 300 mg dose with ritonavir have not \nbeen studied. Concentrations of atazanavir with or without ritonavir are expected to be increased in \npatients with moderately or severely impaired hepatic function (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4). \n \nAge/Gender: a study of the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir was performed in 59 healthy male and \nfemale subjects (29 young, 30 elderly). There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic \ndifferences based on age or gender. \n \nRace: a population pharmacokinetic analysis of samples from Phase II clinical trials indicated no \neffect of race on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir. \n \nPregnancy: \nThe pharmacokinetic data from HIV-infected pregnant women receiving REYATAZ capsules with \nritonavir are presented in Table 9. \n \n\n\n\n 69 \n\nTable 9: Steady-State Pharmacokinetics of Atazanavir with ritonavir in HIV-Infected \nPregnant Women in the Fed State \n \n\n atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg \n\nPharmacokinetic Parameter \n2nd Trimester \n\n(n=9) \n3rd Trimester \n\n(n=20) \npostpartuma \n\n(n=36) \n\nCmax ng/mL \n Geometric mean (CV%) \n\n3729.09 \n(39) \n\n3291.46 \n(48) \n\n5649.10 \n(31) \n\nAUC ng•h/mL \n Geometric mean (CV%) \n\n34399.1 \n(37) \n\n34251.5 \n(43) \n\n60532.7 \n(33) \n\nCmin ng/mLb \n Geometric mean (CV%) \n\n663.78 \n(36) \n\n668.48 \n(50) \n\n1420.64 \n(47) \n\na Atazanavir peak concentrations and AUCs were found to be approximately 26-40% higher during the postpartum \nperiod (4-12 weeks) than those observed historically in HIV infected, non-pregnant patients. Atazanavir plasma trough \nconcentrations were approximately 2-fold higher during the postpartum period when compared to those observed \nhistorically in HIV infected non-pregnant patients. \nb Cmin is concentration 24 hours post-dose. \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThere is a trend toward a higher clearance in younger children when normalised for body weight. As a \nresult, greater peak to trough ratios are observed; however at recommended doses, geometric mean \natazanavir exposures (Cmin, Cmax and AUC) in paediatric patients are expected to be similar to those \nobserved in adults. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies, conducted in mice, rats, and dogs, atazanavir-related findings were \ngenerally confined to the liver and included generally minimal to mild increases in serum bilirubin and \nliver enzymes, hepatocellular vacuolation and hypertrophy, and, in female mice only, hepatic single-\ncell necrosis. Systemic exposures of atazanavir in mice (males), rats, and dogs at doses associated with \nhepatic changes were at least equal to that observed in humans given 400 mg once daily. In female \nmice, atazanavir exposure at a dose that produced single-cell necrosis was 12 times the exposure in \nhumans given 400 mg once daily. Serum cholesterol and glucose were minimally to mildly increased \nin rats but not in mice or dogs. \n \nDuring in vitro studies, cloned human cardiac potassium channel (hERG), was inhibited by 15% at a \nconcentration (30 μM) of atazanavir corresponding to 30 fold the free drug concentration at Cmax in \nhumans. Similar concentrations of atazanavir increased by 13% the action potential duration (APD90) \nin rabbit Purkinje fibres study. Electrocardiographic changes (sinus bradycardia, prolongation of PR \ninterval, prolongation of QT interval, and prolongation of QRS complex) were observed only in an \ninitial 2 week oral toxicity study performed in dogs. Subsequent 9 month oral toxicity studies in dogs \nshowed no drug-related electrocardiographic changes. The clinical relevance of these non-clinical data \nis unknown. Potential cardiac effects of this product in humans cannot be ruled out (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.8). The potential for PR prolongation should be considered in cases of overdose \n(see section 4.9). \n \nIn a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, atazanavir altered oestrus cycling with no \neffects on mating or fertility. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats or rabbits at maternally toxic \ndoses. In pregnant rabbits, gross lesions of the stomach and intestines were observed in dead or \nmoribund does at maternal doses 2 and 4 times the highest dose administered in the definitive embryo-\ndevelopment study. In the pre- and postnatal development assessment in rats, atazanavir produced a \ntransient reduction in body weight in the offspring at a maternally toxic dose. Systemic exposure to \natazanavir at doses that resulted in maternal toxicity was at least equal to or slightly greater than that \nobserved in humans given 400 mg once daily. \n \n\n\n\n 70 \n\nAtazanavir was negative in an Ames reverse-mutation assay but did induce chromosomal aberrations \nin vitro in both the absence and presence of metabolic activation. In in vivo studies in rats, atazanavir \ndid not induce micronuclei in bone marrow, DNA damage in duodenum (comet assay), or unscheduled \nDNA repair in liver at plasma and tissue concentrations exceeding those that were clastogenic in vitro. \n \nIn long-term carcinogenicity studies of atazanavir in mice and rats, an increased incidence of benign \nhepatic adenomas was seen in female mice only. The increased incidence of benign hepatic adenomas \nin female mice was likely secondary to cytotoxic liver changes manifested by single-cell necrosis and \nis considered to have no relevance for humans at intended therapeutic exposures. There were no \ntumorigenic findings in male mice or in rats. \n \nAtazanavir increased opacity of bovine corneas in an in vitro ocular irritation study, indicating it may \nbe an ocular irritant upon direct contact with the eye. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n 97 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nREYATAZ 100 mg hard capsules \natazanavir \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. \n\nIt may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What REYATAZ is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take REYATAZ \n3. How to take REYATAZ \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store REYATAZ \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What REYATAZ is and What it is used for \n \nREYATAZ is an antiviral (or antiretroviral) medicine. It is one of a group called protease \ninhibitors. These medicines control Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection by stopping a \nprotein that the HIV needs for its multiplication. They work by reducing the amount of HIV in your \nbody and this in turn, strengthens your immune system. In this way REYATAZ reduces the risk of \ndeveloping illnesses linked to HIV infection. \n \nREYATAZ capsules may be used by adults and children 6 years of age and older. Your doctor has \nprescribed REYATAZ for you because you are infected by the HIV that causes Acquired \nImmunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It is normally used in combination with other anti-HIV \nmedicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of these medicines with REYATAZ \nis best for you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take REYATAZ \n \nDo not take REYATAZ \n if you are allergic to atazanavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n if you have moderate to severe liver problems. Your doctor will evaluate how severe your \n\nliver disease is before deciding whether you can take REYATAZ \n if you are taking any of these medicines: see also Other medicines and REYATAZ \n\n rifampicin (an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis)  \n astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms, these medicines \n\nmay be available without prescription); cisapride (used to treat gastric reflux, sometimes \ncalled heartburn); pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia); quinidine or bepridil (used to \ncorrect heart rhythm); ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine \n(used to treat headaches); and alfuzosin (used to treat enlarged prostatic gland) \n\n quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder); \nlurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia) \n\n medicines containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal preparation) \n\n\n\n 98 \n\n triazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to help you sleep and/or to relieve \nanxiety) \n\n simvastatin and lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol). \n grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed dose combination, \n\nand glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination (used to treat chronic hepatitis  C \ninfection) \n\n \nDo not take sildenafil with REYATAZ when sildenafil is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension. Sildenafil is also used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Tell your doctor if you \nare using sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. \n \nTell your doctor at once if any of these apply to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nREYATAZ is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to develop infections or other \nillnesses linked to HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the \nrisk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to \navoid infecting other people. \n \nSome people will need special care before or while taking REYATAZ. Talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking REYATAZ and make sure your doctor knows: \n if you have hepatitis B or C \n if you develop signs or symptoms of gall stones (pain at the right side of your stomach) \n if you have type A or B haemophilia \n if you require haemodialysis \n \nREYATAZ may affect how well your kidneys work. \n \nKidney stones have been reported in patients taking REYATAZ. If you develop signs or symptoms of \nkidney stones (pain in your side, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate), please inform your \ndoctor immediately. \n \nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs \nand symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \nstarted. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, \nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. In addition to the \nopportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system \nattacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your \nHIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in \nhands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, \nplease inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n \nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor. \n \nHyperbilirubinaemia (an increase in the level of bilirubin in the blood) has occurred in patients \nreceiving REYATAZ. The signs may be a mild yellowing of the skin or eyes. If you notice any of \nthese symptoms please inform your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n 99 \n\nSerious skin rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, has been reported in patients taking \nREYATAZ. If you develop a rash inform your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you notice a change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm changes), please inform your doctor. \nChildren receiving REYATAZ may require their heart to be monitored. Your child's doctor will decide \nthis. \n \nChildren  \nDo not give this medicine to children younger than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg. The \nuse of REYATAZ in children less than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg has not been \nstudied due to the risk of serious complications. \n \nOther medicines and REYATAZ \nYou must not take REYATAZ with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take \nREYATAZ, at the start of Section 2.  \n \nThere are other medicines that may not mix with REYATAZ. Tell your doctor if you are taking, have \nrecently taken, or might take any other medicines. It is especially important to mention these: \n\n other medicines to treat HIV infection (e.g. indinavir, nevirapine and efavirenz) \n boceprevir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (used to treat hepatitis C) \n sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil (used by men to treat impotence (erectile dysfunction))  \n if you are taking an oral contraceptive (\"the Pill\") with REYATAZ to prevent pregnancy, be sure \n\nto take it exactly as instructed by your doctor and not miss any doses \n any medicines used to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach (e.g. antacids to be taken \n\n1 hour before taking REYATAZ or 2 hours after taking REYATAZ, H2-blockers like famotidine \nand proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole) \n\n medicines to lower blood pressure, to slow heart rate, or to correct heart rhythm (amiodarone, \ndiltiazem, systemic lidocaine, verapamil) \n\n atorvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol) \n salmeterol (used to treat asthma) \n cyclosporin, tacrolimus, and sirolimus (medicines to decrease the effects of body's immune \n\nsystem) \n certain antibiotics (rifabutin, clarithromycin) \n ketoconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole (antifungals) \n warfarin (anticoagulant, used to reduce the blood clots) \n carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine (antiepileptics) \n irinotecan (used to treat cancer) \n sedative agents (e.g. midazolam administered by injection) \n buprenorphine (used to treat opioid addiction and pain). \n \nSome medicines may interact with ritonavir, a medicine that is taken with REYATAZ. It is important \nto tell your doctor if you are taking fluticasone or budesonide (given by nose or inhaled to treat \nallergic symptoms or asthma). \n \nREYATAZ with food and drink \nIt is important that you take REYATAZ with food (a meal or a substantial snack) as this helps the \nbody absorb the medicine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Atazanavir, the active substance of \nREYATAZ, is excreted in human milk. Patients should not breast-feed while taking REYATAZ. It is \nrecommended that women infected with HIV do not breast-feed because the virus might be \ntransmitted through the breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIf you feel dizzy or lightheaded, do not drive or use machines and contact your doctor immediately. \n\n\n\n 100\n\n \nREYATAZ contains lactose. \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars (e.g. lactose), contact \nyour doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \n \n3. How to take REYATAZ \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. This way, you can be sure your medicine is fully effective and you reduce the risk of the virus \ndeveloping resistance to the treatment.  \n \nThe recommended adult dose of REYATAZ capsules is 300 mg once daily with 100 mg ritonavir \nonce daily and with food, in combination with other anti-HIV medicines. Your doctor may adjust the \ndose of REYATAZ according to your anti-HIV therapy. \n \nFor children (6 to less than 18 years of age), your child's doctor will decide the right dose based \non your child's weight.

Possible side effects \n \n\n\n\n 101\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When \ntreating HIV infection, it is not always easy to identify what side effects are caused by REYATAZ, by \nthe other medicines you are taking, or by the HIV infection itself. Tell your doctor if you notice \nanything unusual about your health. \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following serious side effects: \n \n Skin rash, itching that may occasionally be severe has been reported. The rash usually disappears \n\nwithin 2 weeks without any change to your REYATAZ treatment. Severe rash may be developed \nin association with other symptoms which could be serious.

If your skin or the \nwhite part of your eyes turns yellow, talk to your doctor immediately. \n\n Changes in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm change) may occasionally happen. Talk to \nyour doctor immediately if you get dizzy, lightheaded or if you suddenly faint. These could be \nsymptoms of a serious heart problem.  \n\n Liver problems may uncommonly happen. Your doctor should do blood tests prior you start \nREYATAZ and during treatment. If you have liver problems, including hepatitis B or C infection, \nyou may experience a worsening of your liver problems. Talk to your doctor immediately if you \nget dark (tea-colored) urine, itching, yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes, pain \naround the stomach, pale colored stools or nausea. \n\n Gallbladder problems uncommonly happen in people taking REYATAZ.

What you need to know before you take REYATAZ \n3. How to take REYATAZ \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store REYATAZ \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What REYATAZ is and What it is used for \n \nREYATAZ is an antiviral (or antiretroviral) medicine. It is one of a group called protease \ninhibitors. These medicines control Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection by stopping a \nprotein that the HIV needs for its multiplication. They work by reducing the amount of HIV in your \nbody and this in turn, strengthens your immune system. In this way REYATAZ reduces the risk of \ndeveloping illnesses linked to HIV infection. \n \nREYATAZ capsules may be used by adults and children 6 years of age and older. Your doctor has \nprescribed REYATAZ for you because you are infected by the HIV that causes Acquired \nImmunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It is normally used in combination with other anti-HIV \nmedicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of these medicines with REYATAZ \nis best for you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take REYATAZ \n \nDo not take REYATAZ \n if you are allergic to atazanavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n if you have moderate to severe liver problems. Your doctor will evaluate how severe your \n\nliver disease is before deciding whether you can take REYATAZ \n if you are taking any of these medicines: see also Other medicines and REYATAZ \n\n rifampicin (an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis)  \n astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms, these medicines \n\nmay be available without prescription); cisapride (used to treat gastric reflux, sometimes \ncalled heartburn); pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia); quinidine or bepridil (used to \ncorrect heart rhythm); ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine \n(used to treat headaches); and alfuzosin (used to treat enlarged prostatic gland) \n\n quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder); \nlurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia) \n\n medicines containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal preparation) \n\n\n\n 106\n\n triazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to help you sleep and/or to relieve \nanxiety) \n\n simvastatin and lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol). \n grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed dose combination, \n\nand glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination (used to treat chronic hepatitis C \ninfection) \n\n \nDo not take sildenafil with REYATAZ when sildenafil is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension. Sildenafil is also used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Tell your doctor if you \nare using sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. \n \nTell your doctor at once if any of these apply to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nREYATAZ is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to develop infections or other \nillnesses linked to HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the \nrisk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to \navoid infecting other people. \n \nSome people will need special care before or while taking REYATAZ. Talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking REYATAZ and make sure your doctor knows: \n if you have hepatitis B or C \n if you develop signs or symptoms of gall stones (pain at the right side of your stomach) \n if you have type A or B haemophilia \n if you require haemodialysis \n \nREYATAZ may affect how well your kidneys work. \n \nKidney stones have been reported in patients taking REYATAZ. If you develop signs or symptoms of \nkidney stones (pain in your side, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate), please inform your \ndoctor immediately. \n \nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs \nand symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \nstarted. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, \nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. In addition to the \nopportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system \nattacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your \nHIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in \nhands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, \nplease inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n \nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor. \n \nHyperbilirubinaemia (an increase in the level of bilirubin in the blood) has occurred in patients \nreceiving REYATAZ. The signs may be a mild yellowing of the skin or eyes. If you notice any of \nthese symptoms please inform your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n 107\n\nSerious skin rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, has been reported in patients taking \nREYATAZ. If you develop a rash inform your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you notice a change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm changes), please inform your doctor. \nChildren receiving REYATAZ may require their heart to be monitored. Your child's doctor will decide \nthis. \n \nChildren \nDo not give this medicine to children younger than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg. The \nuse of REYATAZ in children less than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg has not been \nstudied due to the risk of serious complications. \n \nOther medicines and REYATAZ \nYou must not take REYATAZ with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take \nREYATAZ, at the start of Section 2.  \n \nThere are other medicines that may not mix with REYATAZ. Tell your doctor if you are taking, have \nrecently taken, or might take any other medicines. It is especially important to mention these: \n other medicines to treat HIV infection (e.g. indinavir, nevirapine and efavirenz) \n boceprevir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (used to treat hepatitis C) \n sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil (used by men to treat impotence (erectile dysfunction))  \n if you are taking an oral contraceptive (\"the Pill\") with REYATAZ to prevent pregnancy, be sure \n\nto take it exactly as instructed by your doctor and not miss any doses \n any medicines used to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach (e.g. antacids to be taken \n\n1 hour before taking REYATAZ or 2 hours after taking REYATAZ, H2-blockers like famotidine \nand proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole) \n\n medicines to lower blood pressure, to slow heart rate, or to correct heart rhythm (amiodarone, \ndiltiazem, systemic lidocaine, verapamil) \n\n atorvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol) \n salmeterol (used to treat asthma) \n cyclosporin, tacrolimus, and sirolimus (medicines to decrease the effects of body's immune \n\nsystem) \n certain antibiotics (rifabutin, clarithromycin) \n ketoconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole (antifungals) \n warfarin (anticoagulant, used to reduce the blood clots) \n carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine (antiepileptics) \n irinotecan (used to treat cancer) \n sedative agents (e.g. midazolam administered by injection) \n buprenorphine (used to treat opioid addiction and pain). \n \nSome medicines may interact with ritonavir, a medicine that is taken with REYATAZ. It is important \nto tell your doctor if you are taking fluticasone or budesonide (given by nose or inhaled to treat \nallergic symptoms or asthma). \n \nREYATAZ with food and drink \nIt is important that you take REYATAZ with food (a meal or a substantial snack) as this helps the \nbody absorb the medicine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Atazanavir, the active substance of \nREYATAZ, is excreted in human milk. Patients should not breast-feed while taking REYATAZ. It is \nrecommended that women infected with HIV do not breast-feed because the virus might be \ntransmitted through the breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIf you feel dizzy or lightheaded, do not drive or use machines and contact your doctor immediately. \n\n\n\n 108\n\n \nREYATAZ contains lactose. \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars (e.g. lactose), contact \nyour doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \n \n3. How to take REYATAZ \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. This way, you can be sure your medicine is fully effective and you reduce the risk of the virus \ndeveloping resistance to the treatment.  \n \nThe recommended adult dose of REYATAZ capsules is 300 mg once daily with 100 mg ritonavir \nonce daily and with food, in combination with other anti-HIV medicines. Your doctor may adjust the \ndose of REYATAZ according to your anti-HIV therapy. \n \nFor children (6 to less than 18 years of age), your child's doctor will decide the right dose based \non your child's weight. The dose of REYATAZ capsules for children is calculated by body weight \nand is taken once daily with food and 100 mg ritonavir as shown below: \n\nBody Weight \n(kg) \n\nREYATAZ Dose once daily \n(mg) \n\nRitonavir Dose* once daily \n(mg) \n\n15 to less than 35 200 100 \nat least 35 300 100 \n\n*Ritonavir capsules, tablets or oral solution may be used. \n\n \nREYATAZ is also available as an oral powder for use in children at least 3 months old and weighing \nat least 5 kg. Switching to REYATAZ capsules from REYATAZ oral powder is encouraged as soon as \npatients are able to consistently swallow capsules. \n \nA change in dose may occur when switching between oral powder and capsules. Your doctor will \ndecide the right dose based on your child’s weight. \n \nThere are no dosing recommendations for REYATAZ in paediatric patients less than 3 months of age. \n \nTake REYATAZ capsules with food (a meal or a substantial snack). Swallow the capsules whole. \nDo not open the capsules. \n \nIf you take more REYATAZ than you should \nYellowing of the skin and/or eyes (jaundice) and irregular heart beat (QTc prolongation) may occur if \nyou or your child take too much REYATAZ. \nIf you accidentally take more REYATAZ capsules than your doctor recommended, contact your HIV \ndoctor at once or contact the nearest hospital for advice. \n \nIf you forget to take REYATAZ \nIf you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible with food and then take your next \nscheduled dose at its regular time. If it is almost time for your next dose, do not take the missed dose. \nWait and take the next dose at its regular time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking REYATAZ \nDo not stop taking REYATAZ before talking to your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \n\n\n\n 109\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When \ntreating HIV infection, it is not always easy to identify what side effects are caused by REYATAZ, by \nthe other medicines you are taking, or by the HIV infection itself. Tell your doctor if you notice \nanything unusual about your health. \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following serious side effects: \n \n Skin rash, itching that may occasionally be severe has been reported. The rash usually disappears \n\nwithin 2 weeks without any change to your REYATAZ treatment. Severe rash may be developed \nin association with other symptoms which could be serious. Stop taking REYATAZ and talk to \nyour doctor immediately if you develop a severe rash or a rash with flu-like illness symptoms, \nblisters, fever, mouth sores, muscle or joint pain, swelling in the face, inflammation of the eye \nwhich causes redness (conjunctivitis), painful, warm, or red lumps (nodules).  \n\n Yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes caused by high levels of bilirubin in your \nblood has been commonly reported. This side effect is usually not dangerous in adults and infants \nolder than 3 months of age; but it might be a symptom of a serious problem. If your skin or the \nwhite part of your eyes turns yellow, talk to your doctor immediately. \n\n Changes in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm change) may occasionally happen. Talk to \nyour doctor immediately if you get dizzy, lightheaded or if you suddenly faint. These could be \nsymptoms of a serious heart problem.  \n\n Liver problems may uncommonly happen. Your doctor should do blood tests prior you start \nREYATAZ and during treatment. If you have liver problems, including hepatitis B or C infection, \nyou may experience a worsening of your liver problems.

What you need to know before you take REYATAZ \n3. How to take REYATAZ \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store REYATAZ \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What REYATAZ is and What it is used for \n \nREYATAZ is an antiviral (or antiretroviral) medicine. It is one of a group called protease \ninhibitors. These medicines control Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection by stopping a \nprotein that the HIV needs for its multiplication. They work by reducing the amount of HIV in your \nbody and this in turn, strengthens your immune system. In this way REYATAZ reduces the risk of \ndeveloping illnesses linked to HIV infection. \n \nREYATAZ capsules may be used by adults and children 6 years of age and older. Your doctor has \nprescribed REYATAZ for you because you are infected by the HIV that causes Acquired \nImmunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It is normally used in combination with other anti-HIV \nmedicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of these medicines with REYATAZ \nis best for you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take REYATAZ \n \nDo not take REYATAZ \n if you are allergic to atazanavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n if you have moderate to severe liver problems. Your doctor will evaluate how severe your \n\nliver disease is before deciding whether you can take REYATAZ \n if you are taking any of these medicines: see also Other medicines and REYATAZ \n\n rifampicin (an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis)  \n astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms, these medicines \n\nmay be available without prescription); cisapride (used to treat gastric reflux, sometimes \ncalled heartburn); pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia); quinidine or bepridil (used to \ncorrect heart rhythm); ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine \n(used to treat headaches); and alfuzosin (used to treat enlarged prostatic gland) \n\n quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder); \nlurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia) \n\n medicines containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal preparation) \n\n\n\n 114\n\n triazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to help you sleep and/or to relieve \nanxiety) \n\n simvastatin and lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol). \n grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed dose combination, \n\nand glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination (used to treat chronic hepatitis C \ninfection) \n\n \nDo not take sildenafil with REYATAZ when sildenafil is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension. Sildenafil is also used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Tell your doctor if you \nare using sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. \n \nTell your doctor at once if any of these apply to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nREYATAZ is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to develop infections or other \nillnesses linked to HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the \nrisk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to \navoid infecting other people. \n \nSome people will need special care before or while taking REYATAZ. Talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking REYATAZ and make sure your doctor knows: \n if you have hepatitis B or C \n if you develop signs or symptoms of gall stones (pain at the right side of your stomach) \n if you have type A or B haemophilia \n if you require haemodialysis \n \nREYATAZ may affect how well your kidneys work. \n \nKidney stones have been reported in patients taking REYATAZ. If you develop signs or symptoms of \nkidney stones (pain in your side, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate), please inform your \ndoctor immediately. \n \nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs \nand symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \nstarted. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, \nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. In addition to the \nopportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system \nattacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your \nHIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in \nhands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, \nplease inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n \nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor. \n \nHyperbilirubinaemia (an increase in the level of bilirubin in the blood) has occurred in patients \nreceiving REYATAZ. The signs may be a mild yellowing of the skin or eyes. If you notice any of \nthese symptoms please inform your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n 115\n\nSerious skin rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, has been reported in patients taking \nREYATAZ. If you develop a rash inform your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you notice a change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm changes), please inform your doctor. \nChildren receiving REYATAZ may require their heart to be monitored. Your child's doctor will decide \nthis. \n \nChildren \nDo not give this medicine to children younger than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg. The \nuse of REYATAZ in children less than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg has not been \nstudied due to the risk of serious complications. \n \nOther medicines and REYATAZ \nYou must not take REYATAZ with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take \nREYATAZ, at the start of Section 2.  \n \nThere are other medicines that may not mix with REYATAZ. Tell your doctor if you are taking, have \nrecently taken, or might take any other medicines. It is especially important to mention these: \n other medicines to treat HIV infection (e.g. indinavir, nevirapine and efavirenz) \n boceprevir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (used to treat hepatitis C) \n sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil (used by men to treat impotence (erectile dysfunction))  \n if you are taking an oral contraceptive (\"the Pill\") with REYATAZ to prevent pregnancy, be sure \n\nto take it exactly as instructed by your doctor and not miss any doses \n any medicines used to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach (e.g. antacids to be taken \n\n1 hour before taking REYATAZ or 2 hours after taking REYATAZ, H2-blockers like famotidine \nand proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole) \n\n medicines to lower blood pressure, to slow heart rate, or to correct heart rhythm (amiodarone, \ndiltiazem, systemic lidocaine, verapamil) \n\n atorvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol) \n salmeterol (used to treat asthma) \n cyclosporin, tacrolimus, and sirolimus (medicines to decrease the effects of body's immune \n\nsystem) \n certain antibiotics (rifabutin, clarithromycin) \n ketoconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole (antifungals) \n warfarin (anticoagulant, used to reduce the blood clots) \n carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine (antiepileptics) \n irinotecan (used to treat cancer) \n sedative agents (e.g. midazolam administered by injection) \n buprenorphine (used to treat opioid addiction and pain). \n \nSome medicines may interact with ritonavir, a medicine that is taken with REYATAZ. It is important \nto tell your doctor if you are taking fluticasone or budesonide (given by nose or inhaled to treat \nallergic symptoms or asthma). \n \nREYATAZ with food and drink \nIt is important that you take REYATAZ with food (a meal or a substantial snack) as this helps the \nbody absorb the medicine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Atazanavir, the active substance of \nREYATAZ, is excreted in human milk. Patients should not breast-feed while taking REYATAZ. It is \nrecommended that women infected with HIV do not breast-feed because the virus might be \ntransmitted through the breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIf you feel dizzy or lightheaded, do not drive or use machines and contact your doctor immediately. \n\n\n\n 116\n\n \nREYATAZ contains lactose. \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars (e.g. lactose), contact \nyour doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \n \n3. How to take REYATAZ \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. This way, you can be sure your medicine is fully effective and you reduce the risk of the virus \ndeveloping resistance to the treatment.  \n \nThe recommended adult dose of REYATAZ capsules is 300 mg once daily with 100 mg ritonavir \nonce daily and with food, in combination with other anti-HIV medicines. Your doctor may adjust the \ndose of REYATAZ according to your anti-HIV therapy. \n \nFor children (6 to less than 18 years of age), your child's doctor will decide the right dose based \non your child's weight. The dose of REYATAZ capsules for children is calculated by body weight \nand is taken once daily with food and 100 mg ritonavir as shown below: \n\nBody Weight \n(kg) \n\nREYATAZ Dose once daily \n(mg) \n\nRitonavir Dose* once daily \n(mg) \n\n15 to less than 35 200 100 \nat least 35 300 100 \n\n*Ritonavir capsules, tablets or oral solution may be used. \n\n \nREYATAZ is also available as an oral powder for use in children at least 3 months old and weighing \nat least 5 kg. Switching to REYATAZ capsules from REYATAZ oral powder is encouraged as soon as \npatients are able to consistently swallow capsules. \n \nA change in dose may occur when switching between oral powder and capsules. Your doctor will \ndecide the right dose based on your child’s weight. \n \nThere are no dosing recommendations for REYATAZ in paediatric patients less than 3 months of age. \n \nTake REYATAZ capsules with food (a meal or a substantial snack). Swallow the capsules whole. \nDo not open the capsules. \n \nIf you take more REYATAZ than you should \nYellowing of the skin and/or eyes (jaundice) and irregular heart beat (QTc prolongation) may occur if \nyou or your child take too much REYATAZ. \nIf you accidentally take more REYATAZ capsules than your doctor recommended, contact your HIV \ndoctor at once or contact the nearest hospital for advice. \n \nIf you forget to take REYATAZ \nIf you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible with food and then take your next \nscheduled dose at its regular time. If it is almost time for your next dose, do not take the missed dose. \nWait and take the next dose at its regular time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking REYATAZ \nDo not stop taking REYATAZ before talking to your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \n\n\n\n 117\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When \ntreating HIV infection, it is not always easy to identify what side effects are caused by REYATAZ, by \nthe other medicines you are taking, or by the HIV infection itself. Tell your doctor if you notice \nanything unusual about your health. \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following serious side effects: \n \n Skin rash, itching that may occasionally be severe has been reported. The rash usually disappears \n\nwithin 2 weeks without any change to your REYATAZ treatment. Severe rash may be developed \nin association with other symptoms which could be serious. Stop taking REYATAZ and talk to \nyour doctor immediately if you develop a severe rash or a rash with flu-like illness symptoms, \nblisters, fever, mouth sores, muscle or joint pain, swelling in the face, inflammation of the eye \nwhich causes redness (conjunctivitis), painful, warm, or red lumps (nodules).  \n\n Yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes caused by high levels of bilirubin in your \nblood has been commonly reported.

If your skin or the \nwhite part of your eyes turns yellow, talk to your doctor immediately. \n\n Changes in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm change) may occasionally happen. Talk to \nyour doctor immediately if you get dizzy, lightheaded or if you suddenly faint. These could be \nsymptoms of a serious heart problem.  \n\n Liver problems may uncommonly happen. Your doctor should do blood tests prior you start \nREYATAZ and during treatment. If you have liver problems, including hepatitis B or C infection, \nyou may experience a worsening of your liver problems. Talk to your doctor immediately if you \nget dark (tea-colored) urine, itching, yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes, pain \naround the stomach, pale colored stools or nausea. \n\n Gallbladder problems uncommonly happen in people taking REYATAZ.

You may need to read it again. \n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. \n\nIt may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What REYATAZ is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take REYATAZ \n3. How to take REYATAZ \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store REYATAZ \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What REYATAZ is and What it is used for \n \nREYATAZ is an antiviral (or antiretroviral) medicine. It is one of a group called protease \ninhibitors. These medicines control Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection by stopping a \nprotein that the HIV needs for its multiplication. They work by reducing the amount of HIV in your \nbody and this in turn, strengthens your immune system. In this way REYATAZ reduces the risk of \ndeveloping illnesses linked to HIV infection. \n \nREYATAZ capsules may be used by adults and children 6 years of age and older. Your doctor has \nprescribed REYATAZ for you because you are infected by the HIV that causes Acquired \nImmunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It is normally used in combination with other anti-HIV \nmedicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of these medicines with REYATAZ \nis best for you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take REYATAZ \n \nDo not take REYATAZ \n if you are allergic to atazanavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n if you have moderate to severe liver problems. Your doctor will evaluate how severe your \n\nliver disease is before deciding whether you can take REYATAZ \n if you are taking any of these medicines: see also Other medicines and REYATAZ \n\n rifampicin (an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis)  \n astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms, these medicines \n\nmay be available without prescription); cisapride (used to treat gastric reflux, sometimes \ncalled heartburn); pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia); quinidine or bepridil (used to \ncorrect heart rhythm); ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine \n(used to treat headaches); and alfuzosin (used to treat enlarged prostatic gland) \n\n quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder); \nlurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia) \n\n medicines containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal preparation) \n\n\n\n 122\n\n triazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to help you sleep and/or to relieve \nanxiety) \n\n simvastatin and lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol). \n grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed dose combination, \n\nand glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination (used to treat chronic hepatitis C \ninfection) \n\n \nDo not take sildenafil with REYATAZ when sildenafil is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension. Sildenafil is also used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Tell your doctor if you \nare using sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. \n \nTell your doctor at once if any of these apply to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nREYATAZ is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to develop infections or other \nillnesses linked to HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the \nrisk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to \navoid infecting other people. \n \nSome people will need special care before or while taking REYATAZ. Talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking REYATAZ and make sure your doctor knows: \n if you have hepatitis B or C \n if you develop signs or symptoms of gall stones (pain at the right side of your stomach) \n if you have type A or B haemophilia \n if you require haemodialysis \n \nREYATAZ may affect how well your kidneys work. \n \nKidney stones have been reported in patients taking REYATAZ. If you develop signs or symptoms of \nkidney stones (pain in your side, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate), please inform your \ndoctor immediately. \n \nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs \nand symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \nstarted. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, \nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. In addition to the \nopportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system \nattacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your \nHIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in \nhands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, \nplease inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n \nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor. \n \nHyperbilirubinaemia (an increase in the level of bilirubin in the blood) has occurred in patients \nreceiving REYATAZ. The signs may be a mild yellowing of the skin or eyes. If you notice any of \nthese symptoms please inform your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n 123\n\nSerious skin rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, has been reported in patients taking \nREYATAZ. If you develop a rash inform your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you notice a change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm changes), please inform your doctor. \nChildren receiving REYATAZ may require their heart to be monitored. Your child's doctor will decide \nthis. \n \nChildren  \nDo not give this medicine to children younger than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg. The \nuse of REYATAZ in children less than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg has not been \nstudied due to the risk of serious complications. \n \nOther medicines and REYATAZ \nYou must not take REYATAZ with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take \nREYATAZ, at the start of Section 2.  \n \nThere are other medicines that may not mix with REYATAZ. Tell your doctor if you are taking, have \nrecently taken, or might take any other medicines. It is especially important to mention these: \n other medicines to treat HIV infection (e.g. indinavir, nevirapine and efavirenz) \n boceprevir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (used to treat hepatitis C) \n sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil (used by men to treat impotence (erectile dysfunction))  \n if you are taking an oral contraceptive (\"the Pill\") with REYATAZ to prevent pregancy, be sure \n\nto take it exactly as instructed by your doctor and not miss any doses \n any medicines used to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach (e.g. antacids to be taken \n\n1 hour before taking REYATAZ or 2 hours after taking REYATAZ, H2-blockers like famotidine \nand proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole) \n\n medicines to lower blood pressure, to slow heart rate, or to correct heart rhythm (amiodarone, \ndiltiazem, systemic lidocaine, verapamil) \n\n atorvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol) \n salmeterol (used to treat asthma) \n cyclosporin, tacrolimus, and sirolimus (medicines to decrease the effects of body's immune \n\nsystem) \n certain antibiotics (rifabutin, clarithromycin) \n ketoconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole (antifungals) \n warfarin (anticoagulant, used to reduce the blood clots) \n carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine (antiepileptics) \n irinotecan (used to treat cancer) \n sedative agents (e.g. midazolam administered by injection) \n buprenorphine (used to treat opioid addiction and pain). \n \nSome medicines may interact with ritonavir, a medicine that is taken with REYATAZ. It is important \nto tell your doctor if you are taking fluticasone or budesonide (given by nose or inhaled to treat \nallergic symptoms or asthma). \n \nREYATAZ with food and drink \nIt is important that you take REYATAZ with food (a meal or a substantial snack) as this helps the \nbody absorb the medicine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Atazanavir, the active substance of \nREYATAZ, is excreted in human milk. Patients should not breast-feed while taking REYATAZ. It is \nrecommended that women infected with HIV do not breast-feed because the virus might be \ntransmitted through the breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIf you feel dizzy or lightheaded, do not drive or use machines and contact your doctor immediately. \n\n\n\n 124\n\n \nREYATAZ contains lactose. \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars (e.g. lactose), contact \nyour doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \n \n3. How to take REYATAZ \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. This way, you can be sure your medicine is fully effective and you reduce the risk of the virus \ndeveloping resistance to the treatment.  \n \nThe recommended adult dose of REYATAZ capsules is 300 mg once daily with 100 mg ritonavir \nonce daily and with food, in combination with other anti-HIV medicines. Your doctor may adjust the \ndose of REYATAZ according to your anti-HIV therapy. \n \nFor children (6 to less than 18 years of age), your child's doctor will decide the right dose based \non your child's weight. The dose of REYATAZ capsules for children is calculated by body weight \nand is taken once daily with food and 100 mg ritonavir as shown below: \n\nBody Weight \n(kg) \n\nREYATAZ Dose once daily \n(mg) \n\nRitonavir Dose* once daily \n(mg) \n\n15 to less than 35 200 100 \nat least 35 300 100 \n\n*Ritonavir capsules, tablets or oral solution may be used. \n\n \nREYATAZ is also available as an oral powder for use in children at least 3 months old and weighing \nat least 5 kg. Switching to REYATAZ capsules from REYATAZ oral powder is encouraged as soon as \npatients are able to consistently swallow capsules. \n \nA change in dose may occur when switching between oral powder and capsules. Your doctor will \ndecide the right dose based on your child’s weight. \n \nThere are no dosing recommendations for REYATAZ in paediatric patients less than 3 months of age. \n \nTake REYATAZ capsules with food (a meal or a substantial snack). Swallow the capsules whole. \nDo not open the capsules. \n \nIf you take more REYATAZ than you should \nYellowing of the skin and/or eyes (jaundice) and irregular heart beat (QTc prolongation) may occur if \nyou or your child take too much REYATAZ. \nIf you accidentally take more REYATAZ capsules than your doctor recommended, contact your HIV \ndoctor at once or contact the nearest hospital for advice. \n \nIf you forget to take REYATAZ \nIf you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible with food and then take your next \nscheduled dose at its regular time. If it is almost time for your next dose, do not take the missed dose. \nWait and take the next dose at its regular time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking REYATAZ \nDo not stop taking REYATAZ before talking to your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \n\n\n\n 125\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When \ntreating HIV infection, it is not always easy to identify what side effects are caused by REYATAZ, by \nthe other medicines you are taking, or by the HIV infection itself. Tell your doctor if you notice \nanything unusual about your health. \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following serious side effects: \n \n Skin rash, itching that may occasionally be severe has been reported. The rash usually disappears \n\nwithin 2 weeks without any change to your REYATAZ treatment. Severe rash may be developed \nin association with other symptoms which could be serious. Stop taking REYATAZ and talk to \nyour doctor immediately if you develop a severe rash or a rash with flu-like illness symptoms, \nblisters, fever, mouth sores, muscle or joint pain, swelling in the face, inflammation of the eye \nwhich causes redness (conjunctivitis), painful, warm, or red lumps (nodules).  \n\n Yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes caused by high levels of bilirubin in your \nblood has been commonly reported.

If your skin or the \nwhite part of your eyes turns yellow, talk to your doctor immediately. \n\n Changes in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm change) may occasionally happen. Talk to \nyour doctor immediately if you get dizzy, lightheaded or if you suddenly faint. These could be \nsymptoms of a serious heart problem.  \n\n Liver problems may uncommonly happen. Your doctor should do blood tests prior you start \nREYATAZ and during treatment. If you have liver problems, including hepatitis B or C infection, \nyou may experience a worsening of your liver problems. Talk to your doctor immediately if you \nget dark (tea-colored) urine, itching, yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes, pain \naround the stomach, pale colored stools or nausea. \n\n Gallbladder problems uncommonly happen in people taking REYATAZ. Symptoms of \ngallbladder problems may include pain in the right or middle upper stomach area, nausea, \nvomiting, fever or yellowing your skin or the white part of your eyes. \n\n REYATAZ may affect how well your kidneys work. \n Kidney stones uncommonly happen in people taking REYATAZ.

You may need to read it again. \n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. \n\nIt may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4 \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What REYATAZ is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take REYATAZ \n3. How to take REYATAZ \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store REYATAZ \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What REYATAZ is and What it is used for \n \nREYATAZ is an antiviral (or antiretroviral) medicine. It is one of a group called protease \ninhibitors. These medicines control Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection by stopping a \nprotein that the HIV needs for its multiplication. They work by reducing the amount of HIV in your \nbody and this in turn, strengthens your immune system. In this way REYATAZ reduces the risk of \ndeveloping illnesses linked to HIV infection. \n \nREYATAZ oral powder may be used by children at least 3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg \n(see section 3 How to take REYATAZ). Your doctor has prescribed REYATAZ for you because you \nare infected by the HIV that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It should always \nbe used with a low dose of ritonavir and in combination with other anti-HIV medicines. Your doctor \nwill discuss with you which combination of these medicines with REYATAZ is best for you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take REYATAZ \n \nDo not take REYATAZ \n if you are allergic to atazanavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n if you have moderate to severe liver problems. Your doctor will evaluate how severe your \n\nliver disease is before deciding whether you can take REYATAZ \n if you are taking any of these medicines: see also Other medicines and REYATAZ \n\n rifampicin (an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis) \n astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms, these medicines \n\nmay be available without prescription); cisapride (used to treat gastric reflux, sometimes \ncalled heartburn); pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia); quinidine or bepridil (used to \ncorrect heart rhythm); ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine \n(used to treat headaches); and alfuzosin (used to treat enlarged prostatic gland) \n\n quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder); \nlurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia) \n\n medicines containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal preparation) \n\n\n\n 130\n\n triazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to help you sleep and/or to relieve \nanxiety) \n\n simvastatin and lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol). \n grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed dose combination, \n\nand glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination (used to treat chronic hepatitis C \ninfection) \n\n \nDo not take sildenafil with REYATAZ when sildenafil is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension. Sildenafil is also used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Tell your doctor if you \nare using sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. \n \nTell your doctor at once if any of these apply to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nREYATAZ is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to develop infections or other \nillnesses linked to HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the \nrisk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to \navoid infecting other people. \n \nSome people will need special care before or while taking REYATAZ. Talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking REYATAZ and make sure your doctor knows: \n if you have hepatitis B or C \n if you develop signs or symptoms of gall stones (pain at the right side of your stomach) \n if you have type A or B haemophilia \n if you require haemodialysis \n \nREYATAZ may affect how well your kidneys work. \n \nKidney stones have been reported in patients taking REYATAZ. If you develop signs or symptoms of \nkidney stones (pain in your side, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate), please inform your \ndoctor immediately. \n \nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs \nand symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \nstarted. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, \nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. In addition to the \nopportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system \nattacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your \nHIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in \nhands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, \nplease inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n \nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor. \n \nHyperbilirubinaemia (an increase in the level of bilirubin in the blood) has occurred in patients \nreceiving REYATAZ. The signs may be a mild yellowing of the skin or eyes. If you notice any of \nthese symptoms please inform your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n 131\n\nSerious skin rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, has been reported in patients taking \nREYATAZ. If you develop a rash inform your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you notice a change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm changes), please inform your doctor. \nChildren receiving REYATAZ may require their heart to be monitored. Your child's doctor will decide \nthis. \n \nChildren \nDo not give this medicine to children younger than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg. The \nuse of REYATAZ in children less than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg has not been \nstudied due to the risk of serious complications. \n \nOther medicines and REYATAZ \nYou must not take REYATAZ with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take \nREYATAZ, at the start of Section 2.  \n \nThere are other medicines that may not mix with REYATAZ. Tell your doctor if you are taking, have \nrecently taken, or might take any other medicines. It is especially important to mention these: \n other medicines to treat HIV infection (e.g. indinavir, nevirapine and efavirenz) \n boceprevir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (used to treat hepatitis C) \n sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil (used by men to treat impotence (erectile dysfunction))  \n if you are taking an oral contraceptive (\"the Pill\") with REYATAZ to prevent pregancy, be sure \n\nto take it exactly as instructed by your doctor and not miss any doses \n any medicines used to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach (e.g. antacids to be taken \n\n1 hour before taking REYATAZ or 2 hours after taking REYATAZ, H2-blockers like famotidine \nand proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole) \n\n medicines to lower blood pressure, to slow heart rate, or to correct heart rhythm (amiodarone, \ndiltiazem, systemic lidocaine, verapamil) \n\n atorvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol) \n salmeterol (used to treat asthma) \n cyclosporin, tacrolimus, and sirolimus (medicines to decrease the effects of body's immune \n\nsystem) \n certain antibiotics (rifabutin, clarithromycin) \n ketoconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole (antifungals) \n warfarin (anticoagulant, used to reduce the blood clots) \n carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine (antiepileptics) \n irinotecan (used to treat cancer) \n sedative agents (e.g. midazolam administered by injection) \n buprenorphine (used to treat opioid addiction and pain). \n \nSome medicines may interact with ritonavir, a medicine that is taken with REYATAZ. It is important \nto tell your doctor if you are taking fluticasone or budesonide (given by nose or inhaled to treat \nallergic symptoms or asthma). \n \nREYATAZ with food and drink \nSee section 3 How to take REYATAZ. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Atazanavir, the active substance of REYATAZ, is \nexcreted in human milk. Patients should not breast-feed while taking REYATAZ. It is recommended \nthat women infected with HIV do not breast-feed because the virus might be transmitted through the \nbreast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIf you feel dizzy or lightheaded, do not drive or use machines, and contact your doctor immediately. \n \n\n\n\n 132\n\nREYATAZ oral powder contains : \n 63 mg of aspartame per sachet. Aspartame is a source of phenylalanine. It may be harmful if you \n\nhave phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because \nthe body cannot remove it properly. \n\n 1.3 g of sucrose per sachet. If you have been told by your doctor that your child has an intolerance \nto some sugars, contact your doctor before giving this medicinal product to your child. \n\n \n \n3. How to take REYATAZ \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. This way, you can be sure your medicine is fully effective and you reduce the risk of the virus \ndeveloping resistance to the treatment.  \n \nFor children (at least 3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg), your child's doctor will decide \nthe right dose based on your child's weight. The dose of REYATAZ oral powder for children is \ncalculated by body weight and is taken once daily with food and ritonavir as shown below: \n\nBody Weight \n(kg) \n\nREYATAZ Dose once daily \n(mg) \n\nRitonavir Dose once daily \n(mg) \n\nAt least 5 to less than 15 200 mg (4 sachetsa) 80 mgb \nAt least 15 to less than 35 250 mg (5 sachetsa) 80 mgb \n\nat least 35 300 mg (6 sachetsa) 100 mgc \naEach sachet contains 50 mg of REYATAZ \nbRitonavir oral solution \ncRitonavir oral solution or capsule/tablet \n\n \nREYATAZ is also available in capsules for use in adults and children at least 6 years of age who \nweigh at least 15 kg and who are able to swallow the capsules. Switching from REYATAZ oral \npowder to REYATAZ capsules is encouraged as soon as patients are able to consistently swallow \ncapsules. \n \nA change in dose may occur when switching between oral powder and capsules. Your doctor will \ndecide the right dose based on your child’s weight. \n \nThere are no dosing recommendations for REYATAZ in paediatric patients less than 3 months of age. \n \nInstructions for REYATAZ oral powder:  \n For children who are able to drink from a cup, REYATAZ oral powder must be taken with food \n\nor drinks. If REYATAZ oral powder is mixed with water, food should also be taken at the same \ntime. \n\n For children who cannot eat solid food or drink from a cup, REYATAZ oral powder must be \nmixed with infant formula and should be given using an oral syringe. Ask your pharmacist for an \noral syringe. Do not use an infant bottle to give REYATAZ mixed with infant formula.  \n\n See the \"Instructions for use\" at the end of the package leaflet for how to prepare and give a dose \nof REYATAZ oral powder. \n\n REYATAZ oral powder should be given within 60 minutes of mixing. \n \nIf you take more REYATAZ than you should \nYellowing of the skin and/or eyes (jaundice) and irregular heart beat (QTc prolongation) may occur if \nyou or your child take too much REYATAZ. \nIf you accidentally take or give more REYATAZ oral powder than your doctor recommended, contact \nyour HIV doctor at once or contact the nearest hospital for advice. \n \nIf you forget to take REYATAZ \nIf you miss a dose or if you forget to give your child a dose, take or give the missed dose as soon as \npossible with food and then take or give the next scheduled dose at its regular time. If it is almost time \n\n\n\n 133\n\nfor your or your child's next dose, do not take or give the missed dose. Wait and take or give the next \ndose at its regular time.

Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When \ntreating HIV infection, it is not always easy to identify what side effects are caused by REYATAZ, by \nthe other medicines you are taking, or by the HIV infection itself. Tell your doctor if you notice \nanything unusual about your health. \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following serious side effects: \n \n Skin rash, itching that may occasionally be severe has been reported. The rash usually disappears \n\nwithin 2 weeks without any change to your REYATAZ treatment. Severe rash may be developed \nin association with other symptoms which could be serious. Stop taking REYATAZ and talk to \nyour doctor immediately if you develop a severe rash or a rash with flu-like illness symptoms, \nblisters, fever, mouth sores, muscle or joint pain, swelling in the face, inflammation of the eye \nwhich causes redness (conjunctivitis), painful, warm, or red lumps (nodules).  \n\n Yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes caused by high levels of bilirubin in your \nblood has been commonly reported. This side effect is usually not dangerous in adults and infants \nolder than 3 months of age; but it might be a symptom of a serious problem. If your skin or the \nwhite part of your eyes turns yellow, talk to your doctor immediately. \n\n Changes in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm change) may occasionally happen. Talk to \nyour doctor immediately if you get dizzy, lightheaded or if you suddenly faint. These could be \nsymptoms of a serious heart problem.  \n\n Liver problems may uncommonly happen. Your doctor should do blood tests prior you start \nREYATAZ and during treatment. If you have liver problems, including hepatitis B or C infection, \nyou may experience a worsening of your liver problems. Talk to your doctor immediately if you \nget dark (tea-colored) urine, itching, yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes, pain \naround the stomach, pale colored stools or nausea. \n\n Gallbladder problems uncommonly happen in people taking REYATAZ. Symptoms of \ngallbladder problems may include pain in the right or middle upper stomach area, nausea, \nvomiting, fever or yellowing your skin or the white part of your eyes. \n\n REYATAZ may affect how well your kidneys work. \n Kidney stones uncommonly happen in people taking REYATAZ.
