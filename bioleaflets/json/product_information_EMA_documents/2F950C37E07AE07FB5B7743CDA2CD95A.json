NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCHAMPIX 0.5 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 0.5 mg of varenicline (as tartrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet of 4 mm x 8 mm \n \nWhite, capsular-shaped, biconvex tablets debossed with “Pfizer” on one side and “CHX 0.5” on the \nother side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCHAMPIX is indicated for smoking cessation in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 1 mg varenicline twice daily following a 1-week titration as follows: \n \n\nDays 1 – 3: 0.5 mg once daily \nDays 4 – 7: 0.5 mg twice daily \nDay 8 – End of treatment: 1 mg twice daily \n\n \nThe patient should set a date to stop smoking. CHAMPIX dosing should usually start at 1-2 weeks \nbefore this date (see section 5.1). Patients should be treated with CHAMPIX for 12 weeks. \n \nFor patients who have successfully stopped smoking at the end of 12 weeks, an additional course of \n12 weeks treatment with CHAMPIX at 1 mg twice daily may be considered for the maintenance of \nabstinence (see section 5.1).  \n \nA gradual approach to quitting smoking with CHAMPIX should be considered for patients who are \nnot able or willing to quit abruptly. Patients should reduce smoking during the first 12 weeks of \ntreatment and quit by the end of that treatment period. Patients should then continue taking CHAMPIX \nfor an additional 12 weeks for a total of 24 weeks of treatment (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients who are motivated to quit and who did not succeed in stopping smoking during prior \nCHAMPIX therapy, or who relapsed after treatment, may benefit from another quit attempt with \nCHAMPIX (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients who cannot tolerate adverse reactions of CHAMPIX may have the dose lowered temporarily \nor permanently to 0.5 mg twice daily. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nIn smoking cessation therapy, risk for relapse to smoking is elevated in the period immediately \nfollowing the end of treatment. In patients with a high risk of relapse, dose tapering may be considered \n(see section 4.4).  \n \nElderly \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2). Because elderly patients are \nmore likely to have decreased renal function, prescribers should consider the renal status of an elderly \npatient. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min \nand  80 ml/min) to moderate (estimated creatinine clearance  30 ml/min and  50 ml/min) renal \nimpairment. \n \nFor patients with moderate renal impairment who experience adverse reactions that are not tolerable, \ndosing may be reduced to 1 mg once daily.  \n \nFor patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the \nrecommended dose of CHAMPIX is 1 mg once daily. Dosing should begin at 0.5 mg once daily for \nthe first 3 days then increased to 1 mg once daily. Based on insufficient clinical experience with \nCHAMPIX in patients with end stage renal disease, treatment is not recommended in this patient \npopulation (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nCHAMPIX is not recommended for use in paediatric patients because its efficacy in this population \nwas not demonstrated (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nCHAMPIX is for oral use and the tablets should be swallowed whole with water. \nCHAMPIX can be taken with or without food \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEffect of smoking cessation \n \nPhysiological changes resulting from smoking cessation, with or without treatment with CHAMPIX, \nmay alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of some medicinal products, for which dosage \nadjustment may be necessary (examples include theophylline, warfarin and insulin). As smoking \ninduces CYP1A2, smoking cessation may result in an increase of plasma levels of CYP1A2 substrates. \n \nNeuropsychiatric symptoms \n \nChanges in behaviour or thinking, anxiety, psychosis, mood swings, aggressive behaviour, depression, \nsuicidal ideation and behaviour and suicide attempts have been reported in patients attempting to quit \nsmoking with CHAMPIX in the post-marketing experience.  \n \nA large randomised, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled study was conducted to compare \nthe risk of serious neuropsychiatric events in patients with and without a history of psychiatric \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\ndisorder treated for smoking cessation with varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy \npatch (NRT) or placebo. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of neuropsychiatric adverse \nevents that have been reported in post-marketing experience.  \n \nThe use of varenicline in patients with or without a history of psychiatric disorder was not associated \nwith an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric adverse events in the composite primary endpoint \ncompared with placebo (see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Study in Subjects with and \nwithout a History of Psychiatric Disorder).  \n  \nDepressed mood, rarely including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, may be a symptom of nicotine \nwithdrawal. \n \nClinicians should be aware of the possible emergence of serious neuropsychiatric symptoms in \npatients attempting to quit smoking with or without treatment. If serious neuropsychiatric symptoms \noccur whilst on varenicline treatment, patients should discontinue varenicline immediately and \ncontact a healthcare professional for re-evaluation of treatment. \n \nHistory of psychiatric disorders \n \nSmoking cessation, with or without pharmacotherapy, has been associated with exacerbation of \nunderlying psychiatric illness (e.g. depression). \n \nCHAMPIX smoking cessation studies have provided data in patients with a history of psychiatric \ndisorders (see section 5.1).  \n \nIn a smoking cessation clinical trial, neuropsychiatric adverse events were reported more frequently in \npatients with a history of psychiatric disorders compared to those without a history of psychiatric \ndisorders, regardless of treatment (see section 5.1). \n \nCare should be taken with patients with a history of psychiatric illness and patients should be \nadvised accordingly. \n\nSeizures \n \nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience there have been reports of seizures in patients with or \nwithout a history of seizures, treated with CHAMPIX. CHAMPIX should be used cautiously in \npatients with a history of seizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold.  \n \nTreatment discontinuation \n \nAt the end of treatment, discontinuation of CHAMPIX was associated with an increase in irritability, \nurge to smoke, depression, and/or insomnia in up to 3% of patients. The prescriber should inform the \npatient accordingly and discuss or consider the need for dose tapering. \n \nCardiovascular events \n \nPatients taking CHAMPIX should be instructed to notify their doctor of new or worsening \ncardiovascular symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and \nsymptoms of myocardial infarction or stroke (see section 5.1). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nThere have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients \ntreated with varenicline. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth (tongue, lips, and gums), \nneck (throat and larynx) and extremities. There were rare reports of life-threatening angioedema \nrequiring urgent medical attention due to respiratory compromise. Patients experiencing these \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nsymptoms should discontinue treatment with varenicline and contact a health care provider \nimmediately. \n \nCutaneous reactions \n \nThere have also been post-marketing reports of rare but severe cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-\nJohnson Syndrome and Erythema Multiforme in patients using varenicline. As these skin reactions can \nbe life threatening, patients should discontinue treatment at the first sign of rash or skin reaction and \ncontact a healthcare provider immediately. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBased on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, CHAMPIX has no clinically \nmeaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of CHAMPIX or co-administered medicinal \nproducts listed below is recommended. \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that \nare primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n \nFurthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active \nsubstances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of \nvarenicline (see section 5.2) and therefore a dose adjustment of CHAMPIX would not be required. \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at \ntherapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion (e.g., \nmetformin - see below) are unlikely to be affected by varenicline.  \n \nMetformin  \n \nVarenicline did not affect the pharmacokinetics of metformin. Metformin had no effect on varenicline \npharmacokinetics. \n \nCimetidine \n \nCo-administration of cimetidine, with varenicline increased the systemic exposure of varenicline by \n29% due to a reduction in varenicline renal clearance. No dosage adjustment is recommended based \non concomitant cimetidine administration in subjects with normal renal function or in patients with \nmild to moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment, the concomitant use of \ncimetidine and varenicline should be avoided. \n \nDigoxin  \n \nVarenicline did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin. \n \nWarfarin  \n \nVarenicline did not alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Prothrombin time (INR) was not affected \nby varenicline. Smoking cessation itself may result in changes to warfarin pharmacokinetics (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nAlcohol  \n \nThere are limited clinical data on any potential interaction between alcohol and varenicline. There \nhave been post marketing reports of increased intoxicating effects of alcohol in patients treated with \nvarenicline. A causal relationship between these events and varenicline use has not been established. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nUse with other therapies for smoking cessation  \n \nBupropion  \nVarenicline did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of bupropion. \n \nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) \nWhen varenicline and transdermal NRT were co-administered to smokers for 12 days, there was a \nstatistically significant decrease in average systolic blood pressure (mean 2.6 mmHg) measured on the \nfinal day of the study. In this study, the incidence of nausea, headache, vomiting, dizziness, dyspepsia, \nand fatigue was greater for the combination than for NRT alone. \n \nSafety and efficacy of CHAMPIX in combination with other smoking cessation therapies have not \nbeen studied.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA moderate amount of data on pregnant women indicated no malformative or foetal/neonatal toxicity \nof varenicline (see section 5.1). \n \nAnimal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is \npreferable to avoid the use of varenicline during pregnancy (see section 5.1). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether varenicline is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies suggest that \nvarenicline is excreted in breast milk. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or \nto continue/discontinue therapy with CHAMPIX should be made taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding to the child and the benefit of CHAMPIX therapy to the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no clinical data on the effects of varenicline on fertility. \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no hazard for humans based on standard male and female fertility studies in \nthe rat (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCHAMPIX may have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nCHAMPIX may cause dizziness, somnolence and transient loss of consciousness, and therefore may \ninfluence the ability to drive and use machines. Patients are advised not to drive, operate complex \nmachinery or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until it is known whether this medicinal \nproduct affects their ability to perform these activities. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nSmoking cessation with or without treatment is associated with various symptoms. For example, \ndysphoric or depressed mood; insomnia, irritability, frustration or anger; anxiety; difficulty \nconcentrating; restlessness; decreased heart rate; increased appetite or weight gain have been reported \nin patients attempting to stop smoking. No attempt has been made in either the design or the analysis \nof the CHAMPIX studies to distinguish between adverse reactions associated with study drug \ntreatment or those possibly associated with nicotine withdrawal. Adverse drug reactions are based on \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nevaluation of data from pre-marketing phase 2-3 studies and updated based on pooled data from \n18 placebo-controlled pre- and post-marketing studies, including approximately 5,000 patients treated \nwith varenicline. \n \nIn patients treated with the recommended dose of 1 mg twice daily following an initial titration period \nthe adverse event most commonly reported was nausea (28.6%). In the majority of cases nausea \noccurred early in the treatment period, was mild to moderate in severity and seldom resulted in \ndiscontinuation. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nIn the table below all adverse reactions, which occurred at an incidence greater than placebo are listed \nby system organ class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000)).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs; Drugs used in addictive disorders; Drugs \nused in nicotine dependence, ATC code: N07BA03 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nVarenicline binds with high affinity and selectivity at the α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine \nreceptors, where it acts as a partial agonist - a compound that has both agonist activity, with lower \nintrinsic efficacy than nicotine, and antagonist activities in the presence of nicotine. \n \nElectrophysiology studies in vitro and neurochemical studies in vivo have shown that varenicline \nbinds to the α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and stimulates receptor-mediated activity, \nbut at a significantly lower level than nicotine. Nicotine competes for the same human α4β2 nAChR \nbinding site for which varenicline has higher affinity. Therefore, varenicline can effectively block \nnicotine's ability to fully activate α4β2 receptors and the mesolimbic dopamine system, the neuronal \nmechanism underlying reinforcement and reward experienced upon smoking. Varenicline is highly \nselective and binds more potently to the α4β2 receptor subtype (Ki=0.15 nM) than to other common \nnicotinic receptors (α3β4 Ki=84 nM, α7 Ki= 620 nM, α1βγδ Ki= 3,400 nM), or to non-nicotinic \nreceptors and transporters (Ki > 1µM, except to 5-HT3 receptors: Ki=350 nM). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe efficacy of CHAMPIX in smoking cessation is a result of varenicline's partial agonist activity at \nthe α4β2 nicotinic receptor where its binding produces an effect sufficient to alleviate symptoms of \ncraving and withdrawal (agonist activity), while simultaneously resulting in a reduction of the \nrewarding and reinforcing effects of smoking by preventing nicotine binding to α4β2 receptors \n(antagonist activity). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nSmoking cessation therapies are more likely to succeed for patients who are motivated to stop \nsmoking and who are provided with additional advice and support. \n \nThe efficacy of CHAMPIX in smoking cessation was demonstrated in 3 clinical trials involving \nchronic cigarette smokers ( 10 cigarettes per day). Two thousand six hundred nineteen \n(2619) patients received CHAMPIX 1 mg BID (titrated during the first week), 669 patients received \nbupropion 150 mg BID (also titrated) and 684 patients received placebo. \n \nComparative clinical studies \nTwo identical double-blind clinical trials prospectively compared the efficacy of CHAMPIX (1 mg \ntwice daily), sustained release bupropion (150 mg twice daily) and placebo in smoking cessation. In \nthese 52 week duration studies, patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a 40 week \nnon-treatment phase. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the two studies was the carbon monoxide (CO) confirmed, 4 week continuous \nquit rate (4W-CQR) from week 9 through week 12. The primary endpoint for CHAMPIX \ndemonstrated statistical superiority to bupropion and placebo. \n\nAfter the 40 week non-treatment phase, a key secondary endpoint for both studies was the Continuous \nAbstinence Rate (CA) at week 52. CA was defined as the proportion of all subjects treated who did \nnot smoke (not even a puff of a cigarette) from Week 9 through Week 52 and did not have an exhaled \nCO measurement of > 10 ppm. \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \nThe 4W-CQR (weeks 9 through 12) and CA rate (weeks 9 through 52) from studies 1 and 2 are \nincluded in the following table: \n \n\n  Study 1 (n=1022) Study 2 (n=1023) \n4W CQR CA Wk 9-52 4W CQR CA Wk 9-52 \n\nCHAMPIX 44.4% 22.1% 44.0% 23.0% \nBupropion 29.5% 16.4% 30.0% 15.0% \nPlacebo 17.7% 8.4% 17.7% 10.3% \nOdds ratio  \nCHAMPIX vs. placebo \n\n3.91 \np < 0.0001 \n\n3.13 \np < 0.0001 \n\n3.85 \np < 0.0001 \n\n2.66 \np < 0.0001 \n\nOdds ratio  \nCHAMPIX vs. bupropion \n\n1.96 \np < 0.0001 \n\n1.45 \np = 0.0640 \n\n1.89 \np < 0.0001 \n\n1.72 \np = 0.0062 \n\n \nPatient reported craving, withdrawal and reinforcing effects of smoking \nAcross both Studies 1 and 2 during active treatment, craving and withdrawal were significantly \nreduced in patients randomised to CHAMPIX in comparison with placebo. CHAMPIX also \nsignificantly reduced reinforcing effects of smoking that can perpetuate smoking behaviour in patients \nwho smoke during treatment compared with placebo. The effect of varenicline on craving, withdrawal \nand reinforcing effects of smoking were not measured during the non-treatment long-term follow-up \nphase. \n \nMaintenance of abstinence study \nThe third study assessed the benefit of an additional 12 weeks of CHAMPIX therapy on the \nmaintenance of abstinence. Patients in this study (n=1,927) received open-label CHAMPIX 1 mg \ntwice daily for 12 weeks. Patients who stopped smoking by Week 12 were then randomised to receive \neither CHAMPIX (1 mg twice daily) or placebo for an additional 12 weeks for a total study duration \nof 52 weeks. \n \nThe primary study endpoint was the CO-confirmed continuous abstinence rate from week 13 through \nweek 24 in the double-blind treatment phase. A key secondary endpoint was the continuous abstinence \n(CA) rate for week 13 through week 52.  \n\nThis study showed the benefit of an additional 12-week treatment with CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily \nfor the maintenance of smoking cessation compared to placebo; superiority to placebo for CA was \nmaintained through week 52. The key results are summarised in the following table: \n \nContinuous Abstinence Rates in Subjects Treated with Champix versus Placebo \n \n CHAMPIX \n\nn=602 \nPlacebo \nn=604 \n\nDifference \n(95% CI) \n\nOdds ratio \n(95% CI) \n\nCA* wk 13-24 70.6% 49.8% 20.8% \n(15.4%, 26.2%) \n\n2.47 \n(1.95, 3.15) \n\nCA* wk 13-52 44.0% 37.1% 6.9% \n(1.4%, 12.5%) \n\n1.35 \n(1.07, 1.70) \n\n*CA: Continuous Abstinence Rate \n\n \nThere is currently limited clinical experience with the use of CHAMPIX among black people to \ndetermine clinical efficacy. \n \nFlexible quit date between weeks 1 and 5 \nThe efficacy and safety of varenicline has been evaluated in smokers who had the flexibility of \nquitting between weeks 1 and 5 of treatment. In this 24-week study, patients received treatment for \n12 weeks followed by a 12 week non-treatment follow up phase. The 4 week (week 9-12) CQR for \nvarenicline and placebo was 53.9% and 19.4%, respectively (difference=34.5%, 95% CI: \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n27.0% - 42.0%) and the CA week 9-24 was 35.2% (varenicline) vs. 12.7% (placebo) \n(difference=22.5%, 95% CI: 15.8% - 29.1%). Patients who are not willing or able to set the target quit \ndate within 1-2 weeks, could be offered to start treatment and then choose their own quit date within \n5 weeks. \n \nStudy in subjects re-treated with CHAMPIX  \nCHAMPIX was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 494 patients who had made a \nprevious attempt to quit smoking with CHAMPIX, and either did not succeed in quitting or relapsed \nafter treatment. Subjects who experienced an adverse event of a concern during previous treatment \nwere excluded. Subjects were randomised 1:1 to CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily (N=249) or placebo \n(N=245) for 12 weeks of treatment and followed for up to 40 weeks post-treatment. Patients included \nin this study had taken CHAMPIX for a smoking-cessation attempt in the past (for a total treatment \nduration of a minimum of two weeks), at least three months prior to study entry, and had been \nsmoking for at least four weeks.  \n \nPatients treated with CHAMPIX had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 9 \nthrough 12 and from weeks 9 through 52 compared to subjects treated with placebo. The key results \nare summarised in the following table: \n \nContinuous Abstinence Rates in Subjects Treated with Champix versus Placebo \n \n\n CHAMPIX \nn=249 \n\nPlacebo \nn=245 \n\nOdds ratio (95% CI), \np value \n\nCA* wk 9-12 45.0% 11.8% 7.08 (4.34, 11.55), \np<0.0001 \n\nCA* wk 9-52 20.1% 3.3% 9.00 (3.97, 20.41), \np<0.0001 \n\n*CA: Continuous Abstinence Rate \n\n \nGradual approach to quitting smoking \nCHAMPIX was evaluated in a 52-week double-blind placebo-controlled study of 1,510 subjects who \nwere not able or willing to quit smoking within four weeks, but were willing to gradually reduce their \nsmoking over a 12 week period before quitting. Subjects were randomised to either CHAMPIX 1 mg \ntwice daily (n=760) or placebo (n=750) for 24 weeks and followed up post-treatment through week 52. \nSubjects were instructed to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked by at least 50 percent by the end \nof the first four weeks of treatment, followed by a further 50 percent reduction from week four to \nweek eight of treatment, with the goal of reaching complete abstinence by 12 weeks. After the initial \n12-week reduction phase, subjects continued treatment for another 12 weeks. Subjects treated with \nCHAMPIX had a significantly higher Continuous Abstinence Rate compared with placebo; the key \nresults are summarised in the following table: \n \nContinuous Abstinence Rates in Subjects Treated with Champix versus Placebo \n \n CHAMPIX \n\nn=760 \nPlacebo \nn=750 \n\nOdds ratio (95% CI), \np value \n\nCA* wk 15-24 32.1% 6.9% 8.74 (6.09, 12.53), \np<0.0001  \n\nCA* wk 21-52 27.0% 9.9% 4.02 (2.94, 5.50), \np<0.0001 \n\n*CA: Continuous Abstinence Rate \n\n \nThe CHAMPIX safety profile in this study was consistent with that of pre-marketing studies. \n \nSubjects with cardiovascular disease \nCHAMPIX was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of subjects with \nstable, cardiovascular disease (other than, or in addition to, hypertension) that had been diagnosed for \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nmore than 2 months. Subjects were randomised to CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily (n=353) or placebo \n(n=350) for 12 weeks and then were followed for 40 weeks post-treatment. The 4 week CQR for \nvarenicline and placebo was 47.3% and 14.3%, respectively and the CA week 9-52 was 19.8% \n(varenicline) vs. 7.4% (placebo). \n \nDeaths and serious cardiovascular events were adjudicated by a blinded, committee. The following \nadjudicated events occurred with a frequency ≥ 1% in either treatment group during treatment (or in \nthe 30-day period after treatment): nonfatal myocardial infarction (1.1% vs. 0.3% for CHAMPIX and \nplacebo, respectively), and hospitalisation for angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 1.1%). During non-treatment \nfollow up to 52 weeks, the adjudicated events included need for coronary revascularisation (2.0% vs. \n0.6%), hospitalisation for angina pectoris (1.7% vs. 1.1%), and new diagnosis of peripheral vascular \ndisease (PVD) or admission for a PVD procedure (1.4% vs. 0.6%). Some of the patients requiring \ncoronary revascularisation underwent the procedure as part of management of nonfatal MI and \nhospitalisation for angina. Cardiovascular death occurred in 0.3% of patients in the CHAMPIX arm \nand 0.6% of patients in the placebo arm over the course of the 52-week study. \n \nA meta-analysis of 15 clinical trials of ≥ 12 weeks treatment duration, including 7002 patients \n(4190 CHAMPIX, 2812 placebo), was conducted to systematically assess the cardiovascular safety of \nCHAMPIX. The study in patients with stable cardiovascular disease described above was included in \nthe meta-analysis.  \n \nThe key cardiovascular safety analysis included occurrence and timing of a composite endpoint of \nMajor Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and \nnonfatal stroke. These events included in the endpoint were adjudicated by a blinded, independent \ncommittee. Overall, a small number of MACE occurred during treatment in the trials included in the \nmeta-analysis (CHAMPIX 7 [0.17%]; placebo 2 [0.07%]). Additionally, a small number of MACE \noccurred up to 30 days after treatment (CHAMPIX 13 [0.31%]; placebo 6 [0.21%]).  \n\n \nThe meta-analysis showed that exposure to CHAMPIX resulted in a hazard ratio for MACE \nof 2.83 (95% confidence interval from 0.76 to 10.55, p=0.12) for patients during treatment \nand 1.95 (95% confidence interval from 0.79 to 4.82, p=0.15) for patients up to 30 days after \ntreatment. These are equivalent to an estimated increase of 6.5 MACE events and 6.3 MACE events \nper 1,000 patient-years, respectively of exposure. The hazard ratio for MACE was higher in patients \nwith cardiovascular risk factors in addition to smoking compared with that in patients without \ncardiovascular risk factors other than smoking. There were similar rates of all-cause mortality \n(CHAMPIX 6 [0.14%]; placebo 7 [0.25%]) and cardiovascular mortality (CHAMPIX 2 [0.05%]; \nplacebo 2 [0.07%]) in the CHAMPIX arms compared with the placebo arms in the meta-analysis.  \n \nCardiovascular safety assessment study in subjects with and without a history of psychiatric disorder \nThe cardiovascular (CV) safety of CHAMPIX was evaluated in the Study in Subjects with and without \na History of Psychiatric Disorder (parent study; see section 5.1 - Neuropsychiatric safety) and its non-\ntreatment extension, the Cardiovascular Safety Assessment Study, which enrolled 4595 of the 6293 \nsubjects who completed the parent study (N=8058) and followed them through week 52. Of all \nsubjects treated in the parent study, 1749 (21.7%) had a medium CV risk and 644 (8.0%) had a high \nCV risk, as defined by Framingham score.  \n \nThe primary CV endpoint was the time to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke during treatment. Deaths and \ncardiovascular events were adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee. \n \nThe following table shows the incidence of MACE and Hazard Ratios vs placebo for all treatment \ngroups during treatment, and cumulative for treatment plus 30 days and through end of study. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n CHAMPIX \nN=2016 \n\nBupropion \nN=2006 \n\nNRT \nN=2022 \n\nPlacebo \nN=2014 \n\nDuring treatment \n\nMACE, n (%) 1 (0.05) 2 (0.10) 1 (0.05) 4 (0.20) \nHazard Ratio \n\n(95% CI) vs \nplacebo \n\n0.29 (0.05, 1.68) 0.50 (0.10, 2.50) 0.29 (0.05, 1.70)  \n\nDuring treatment plus 30 days \nMACE, n (%) 1 (0.05) 2 (0.10) 2 (0.10) 4 (0.20) \n\nHazard Ratio \n(95% CI) vs \nplacebo \n\n0.29 (0.05, 1.70) 0.51 (0.10, 2.51) 0.50 (0.10, 2.48)  \n\nThrough end of study \nMACE, n (%) 3 (0.15) 9 (0.45) 6 (0.30) 8 (0.40) \n\nHazard Ratio \n(95% CI) vs \nplacebo \n\n0.39 (0.12, 1.27) 1.09 (0.42, 2.83) 0.75 (0.26, 2.13)  \n\n \nThe use of CHAMPIX, bupropion, and NRT was not associated with an increased risk of CV AEs in \nsmokers treated for up to 12 weeks and followed for up to 1 year compared to placebo, although \nbecause of the relatively low number of events overall, an association cannot be entirely ruled out. \n \nSubjects with mild-moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \nThe efficacy and safety of CHAMPIX (1 mg twice daily) for smoking cessation in subjects with  \nmild-moderate COPD was demonstrated in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical \ntrial. In this 52-week duration study, patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a 40-week \nnon-treatment follow-up phase. The primary endpoint of the study was the CO-confirmed, 4-week \nContinuous Quit Rate (4W CQR) from week 9 through week 12 and a key secondary endpoint was the \nContinuous Abstinence (CA) from Week 9 through Week 52. The safety profile of varenicline was \ncomparable to what was reported in other trials in the general population, including pulmonary safety.  \nThe results for the 4W CQR (weeks 9 through 12) and CA rate (weeks 9 through 52) are shown in the \nfollowing table: \n \n 4W CQR CA Wk 9-52 \n\nCHAMPIX, (n = 248)  42.3% 18.5% \n\nPlacebo, (n = 251)  8.8% 5.6% \n\nOdds ratio  \n(CHAMPIX vs. Placebo)  \n\n8.40 \np < 0.0001 \n\n4.04 \np < 0.0001 \n\n \nStudy in subjects with a history of major depressive disorder \nThe efficacy of varenicline was confirmed in a randomised placebo-controlled trial in 525 subjects \nwith a history of major depression in the past two years or under current stable treatment. The \ncessation rates in this population were similar to those reported in the general population. Continuous \nabstinence rate between weeks 9-12 was 35.9% in the varenicline treatment group versus 15.6% in the \nplacebo group (OR 3.35 (95% CI 2.16-5.21)) and between weeks 9-52 was 20.3% versus 10.4% \nrespectively (OR 2.36 (95% CI 1.40-3.98)). The most common adverse events (≥ 10%) in subjects \ntaking varenicline were nausea (27.0% vs. 10.4% on placebo), headache (16.8% vs. 11.2%), abnormal \ndreams (11.3% vs. 8.2%), insomnia (10.9% vs. 4.8%) and irritability (10.9% vs. 8.2%). Psychiatric \nscales showed no differences between the varenicline and placebo groups and no overall worsening of \ndepression, or other psychiatric symptoms, during the study in either treatment group. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nStudy in subjects with stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder  \nVarenicline safety and tolerability was assessed in a double-blind study of 128 smokers with stable \nschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, on antipsychotic medication, randomised 2:1 to varenicline \n(1 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 weeks with 12-week non-drug follow-up. \n \nThe most common adverse events in subjects taking varenicline were nausea (23.8% vs. 14.0% on \nplacebo), headache (10.7% vs. 18.6% on placebo) and vomiting (10.7% vs. 9.3% on placebo). Among \nreported neuropsychiatric adverse events, insomnia was the only event reported in either treatment \ngroup in ≥ 5% of subjects at a rate higher in the varenicline group than in placebo  \n(9.5% vs. 4.7%).  \n \nOverall, there was no worsening of schizophrenia in either treatment group as measured by psychiatric \nscales and there were no overall changes in extra-pyramidal signs. In the varenicline group compared \nto placebo, a higher proportion of subjects reported suicidal ideation or behaviour prior to enrolment \n(lifetime history) and after the end of active treatment period (on Days 33 to 85 after the last dose of \ntreatment). During the active treatment period, the incidence of suicide-related events was similar \nbetween the varenicline-treated and the placebo-treated subjects (11 vs. 9.3%, respectively). The \npercentage of subjects with suicide-related events in the active treatment phase compared to \npost-treatment phase was unchanged in the varenicline group; in the placebo group, this percentage \nwas lower in the post-treatment phase. Although there were no completed suicides, there was one \nsuicidal attempt in a varenicline-treated subject whose lifetime history included several similar \nattempts. The limited data available from this single smoking cessation study are not sufficient to \nallow for definitive conclusions to be drawn about the safety in patients with schizophrenia or \nschizoaffective disorder. \n \nNeuropsychiatric safety \nStudy in Subjects with and without a History of Psychiatric Disorder: Varenicline was evaluated in a \nrandomised, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled study that included subjects with a history of \npsychiatric disorder (psychiatric cohort, N=4074) and subjects without a history of psychiatric \ndisorder (non-psychiatric cohort, N=3984). Subjects aged 18-75 years, smoking 10 or more cigarettes \nper day were randomised 1:1:1:1 to varenicline 1 mg BID, bupropion SR 150 mg BID, nicotine \nreplacement therapy patch (NRT) 21 mg/day with taper or placebo for a treatment period of 12 weeks; \nthey were then followed for another 12 weeks post-treatment.  \n\nThe primary safety endpoint was a composite of the following neuropsychiatric (NPS) adverse events: \nsevere events of anxiety, depression, feeling abnormal, or hostility, and/or moderate or severe events \nof agitation, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, homicidal ideation, mania, panic, paranoia, \npsychosis, suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviour or completed suicide. \n\nThe following table shows the rates of the composite NPS adverse event primary endpoint by \ntreatment group and the risk differences (RDs) (95% CI) vs placebo in the non-psychiatric cohort.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nIn addition, the table shows the subset of the composite NPS AE endpoint of severe intensity: \n \n\n \n\nNon-psychiatric Cohort \nN=3984 \n\nVarenicline Bupropion NRT Placebo \nNumber of Patients Treated 990 989 1006 999 \nComposite NPS AE Primary \nEndpoint,  \nn (%) \n\n13 (1.3) \n \n\n22 (2.2) \n \n\n25 (2.5) \n \n\n24 (2.4) \n \n\nRD (95% CI) vs Placebo  -1.28 \n(-2.40, -0.15) \n\n-0.08 \n(-1.37, 1.21) \n\n-0.21           \n(-1.54,1.12) \n\n \n\nComposite NPS AE \nEndpoint of severe intensity \nn (%) \n\n1 (0.1) 4 (0.4) 3 (0.3) 5 (0.5) \n\nAE, adverse event; NRT=Nicotine replacement therapy patch  \n\n \nThe rates of events in the composite endpoint were low across all treatment groups and were similar or \nlower for each of the active treatments compared to placebo.

In addition, independent observational studies have not \nsupported an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric events in patients treated with varenicline \ncompared to patients prescribed nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion.  \n\nTreatment discontinuation  \nThe treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 11.4% for varenicline compared with \n9.7% for placebo. In this group, the discontinuation rates for the most common adverse reactions in \nvarenicline treated patients were as follows: nausea (2.7% vs. 0.6% for placebo), headache (0.6% vs. \n1.0% for placebo), insomnia (1.3% vs. 1.2% for placebo), and abnormal dreams (0.2% vs. 0.2% for \nplacebo). \n \nAnalyses of Clinical Trials:  \n\nA meta-analysis of 5 randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trials, including 1907 patients \n(1130 varenicline, 777 placebo), was conducted to assess suicidal ideation and behaviour as reported \non the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). This meta-analysis included one trial \n(N=127) in patients with a history of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and another trial \n(N=525) in patients with a history of depression. The results showed no increase in the incidence of \nsuicidal ideation and/or behaviour in patients treated with varenicline compared to patients treated \nwith placebo, as shown in the table below. Of the 55 patients who reported suicidal ideation or \nbehaviour, 48 (24 varenicline, 24 placebo) were from the two trials that enrolled patients with a history \nof schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder, or of depression. Few patients reported these events in the \nother three trials (4 varenicline, 3 placebo). \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \nNumber of Patients and Risk Ratio for Suicidal Ideation and/or Behaviour Reported on C-SSRS \nfrom a Meta-Analysis of 5 Clinical Trials Comparing Varenicline to Placebo: \n \n\n Varenicline \n(N=1130) \n\nPlacebo \n(N=777) \n\nPatients with suicidal ideation and/or behaviour* [n (%)]** 28 (2.5) 27 (3.5) \n\nPatient-years of exposure 325 217 \nRisk Ratio # (RR; 95% CI) 0.79 (0.46, 1.36) \n* Of these, one patient in each treatment arm reported suicidal behaviour \n\n** Patients with events up to 30 days after treatment; % are not weighted by study \n\n# RR of incidence rates per 100 patient years \n\n \nA meta-analysis of 18 double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials was conducted to \nassess the neuropsychiatric safety of varenicline. These trials included the 5 trials described above that \nused the C-SSRS, and a total of 8521 patients (5072 varenicline, 3449 placebo), some of which had \npsychiatric conditions. The results showed a similar incidence of combined neuropsychiatric adverse \nevents, other than sleep disorders, in patients treated with varenicline compared to patients treated with \nplacebo, with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89-1.15). Pooled data from these 18 trials showed a \nsimilar incidence rate of individual categories of psychiatric events in patients treated with varenicline \ncompared to patients treated with placebo. The table below describes the most frequently (≥ 1%) \nreported categories of adverse events related to psychiatric safety other than sleep disorders and \ndisturbances. \n \nPsychiatric Adverse Events Occurring in ≥ 1% of Patients from Pooled Data from 18 Clinical \nTrials:  \n \n\n Varenicline \n(N=5072) \n\nPlacebo \n(N=3449) \n\nAnxiety disorders and symptoms 253 (5.0) 206 (6.0) \nDepressed mood disorders and disturbances 179 (3.5) 108 (3.1) \nMood disorders and disturbances NEC* 116 (2.3) 53 (1.5) \n* NEC = Not Elsewhere Classified \n\nCounts (percentages) corresponds to the number of patients reporting the event \n \nObservational Studies \n \nFour observational studies, each including 10,000 to 30,000 users of varenicline in the adjusted \nanalyses, compared the risk of serious neuropsychiatric events, including neuropsychiatric \nhospitalizations and fatal and non-fatal self-harm, in patients treated with varenicline versus patients \nprescribed NRT or bupropion. All studies were retrospective cohort studies and included patients with \nand without a psychiatric history. All studies used statistical methods to control for confounding \nfactors, including preferential prescribing of varenicline to healthier patients, although there is the \npossibility of residual confounding. \n\nTwo of the studies found no difference in risk of neuropsychiatric hospitalisations between varenicline \nusers and nicotine patch users (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.56-2.34 in \nthe first study, and 0.76; 95% CI: 0.40-1.46 in the second study). The power to detect differences in \nthese two studies was limited. The third study reported no difference in risk of psychiatric adverse \nevents diagnosed during an emergency department visit or inpatient admission between varenicline \nusers and bupropion users (HR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.55-1.30). Based on post marketing reports, bupropion \nmay be associated with neuropsychiatric adverse events. \n\nThe fourth study showed no evidence of a higher risk of fatal and non-fatal self- harm (HR of 0.88; \n95% CI: 0.52-1.49) in patients prescribed varenicline compared to patients prescribed NRT. The \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\noccurrence of detected suicide was rare during the three months after patients initiated any drug \ntreatment (two cases in 31,260 varenicline users and six cases in 81,545 NRT users). \n \nPregnancy Cohort Study \n \nA population-based cohort study compared infants exposed to CHAMPIX in utero (N=335) with \ninfants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy (N=78,412) and infants born to non-smoking \nmothers (N=806,438). In this study, infants exposed to CHAMPIX in utero as compared to infants \nborn to mothers who smoked during pregnancy had lower rates of congenital malformations \n(3.6% vs 4.3%), stillbirth (0.3% vs 0.5%), preterm birth (7.5% vs 7.9%), small for gestational age \n(12.5% vs 17.1%), and premature rupture of membrane (3.6% vs 5.4%). \n \nPaediatric Population \n \nThe efficacy and safety of varenicline was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled study of 312 patients aged 12 to 19 years, who smoked an average of at least \n5 cigarettes per day during the 30 days prior to recruitment, and had a score of at least 4 on the \nFagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence scale. Patients were stratified by age (12-16 years of age \nand 17-19 years of age) and by body weight (≤55 kg and >55 kg). Following two-week titration, \npatients randomised to varenicline with a body weight >55 kg received 1 mg twice daily (high dose \ngroup) or 0.5 mg twice daily (low dose group), while patients with a body weight ≤55 kg received \n0.5 mg twice daily (high dose group) or 0.5 mg once daily (low dose group). Patients received \ntreatment for 12 weeks, followed by a non-treatment period of 40 weeks, along with age-appropriate \ncounseling throughout the study. \n \nThe following table from the above paediatric study shows a comparison of continuous abstinence \nrates (CAR) from weeks 9-12, confirmed by urine cotinine test, for the full analysis set overall study \npopulation and the 12-17 year old population. \n \nCAR 9-12 (%) Overall \n\nn/N (%) \n12-to-17-Year Olds \n\nn/N (%) \nHigh-Dose Varenicline 22/109 (20.2%) 15/80 (18.8%) \nLow-Dose Varenicline 28/103 (27.2%) 25/78 (32.1%) \nPlacebo 18/100 (18.0%) 13/76 (17.1%) \nTreatment Comparisons Odds ratio in CAR 9-12 (95% CI) [p-value]  \nHigh-Dose Varenicline vs Placebo 1.18 (0.59, 2.37) [0.6337] 1.13 (0.50, 2.56) [0.7753] \nLow-Dose Varenicline vs Placebo 1.73 (0.88, 3.39) [0.1114] 2.28 (1.06, 4.89) [0.0347]* \n* This p value is not considered statistically significant.

Following administration of multiple oral doses to healthy volunteers, steady-state \nconditions were reached within 4 days. Absorption is virtually complete after oral administration and \nsystemic availability is high. Oral bioavailability of varenicline is unaffected by food or time-of-day \ndosing. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nDistribution \n \nVarenicline distributes into tissues, including the brain. Apparent volume of distribution averaged \n415 litres (%CV= 50) at steady-state. Plasma protein binding of varenicline is low (< 20%) and \nindependent of both age and renal function. In rodents, varenicline is transferred through the placenta \nand excreted in milk.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nVarenicline undergoes minimal metabolism with 92% excreted unchanged in the urine and less than \n10% excreted as metabolites. Minor metabolites in urine include varenicline N-carbamoylglucuronide \nand hydroxyvarenicline. In circulation, varenicline comprises 91% of drug-related material. Minor \ncirculating metabolites include varenicline N-carbamoylglucuronide and N-glucosylvarenicline. \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes \n(IC50 > 6,400 ng/ml). The P450 enzymes tested for inhibition were: 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, \n2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline was shown to not induce the \nactivity of cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. Therefore, varenicline is unlikely to alter the \npharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n \nElimination \n \nThe elimination half-life of varenicline is approximately 24 hours. Renal elimination of varenicline is \nprimarily through glomerular filtration along with active tubular secretion via the organic cationic \ntransporter, OCT2 (see section 4.5). \n \nLinearity/Non linearity \n \nVarenicline exhibits linear kinetics when given as single (0.1 to 3 mg) or repeated 1 to 3 mg/day \ndoses. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient populations \n \nThere are no clinically meaningful differences in varenicline pharmacokinetics due to age, race, \ngender, smoking status, or use of concomitant medicinal products, as demonstrated in specific \npharmacokinetic studies and in population pharmacokinetic analyses. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDue to the absence of significant hepatic metabolism, varenicline pharmacokinetics should be \nunaffected in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment  \nVarenicline pharmacokinetics were unchanged in subjects with mild renal impairment (estimated \ncreatinine clearance > 50 ml/min and  80 ml/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment \n(estimated creatinine clearance  30 ml/min and  50 ml/min), varenicline exposure increased 1.5-fold \ncompared with subjects with normal renal function (estimated creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min). In \nsubjects with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), varenicline \nexposure was increased 2.1-fold. In subjects with end-stage-renal disease (ESRD), varenicline was \nefficiently removed by haemodialysis (see section 4.2).  \n \nElderly  \nThe pharmacokinetics of varenicline in elderly patients with normal renal function (aged 65-75 years) \nis similar to that of younger adult subjects (see section 4.2). For elderly patients with reduced renal \nfunction please refer to section 4.2. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nPaediatric population \nSingle and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of varenicline have been investigated in paediatric patients \naged 12 to 17 years old (inclusive) and were approximately dose-proportional over the 0.5 mg to 2 mg \ndaily dose range studied. Steady-state systemic exposure in adolescent patients of bodyweight > 55 kg, \nas assessed by AUC (0-24), was comparable to that noted for the same doses in the adult population. \nWhen 0.5 mg twice daily was given, steady-state daily exposure of varenicline was, on average, higher \n(by approximately 40%) in adolescent patients with bodyweight ≤ 55 kg compared to that noted in the \nadult population. CHAMPIX is not recommended in paediatric patients because its efficacy in this \npopulation was not demonstrated (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, fertility and embryo-foetal development. In male \nrats dosed for 2 years with varenicline, there was a dose-related increase in the incidence of hibernoma \n(tumour of the brown fat). In the offspring of pregnant rats treated with varenicline there were \ndecreases in fertility and increases in the auditory startle response (see section 4.6). These effects were \nobserved only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure \nindicating little relevance to clinical use. Nonclinical data indicate varenicline has reinforcing \nproperties albeit with lower potency than nicotine. In clinical studies in humans, varenicline showed \nlow abuse potential. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCHAMPIX is indicated for smoking cessation in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 1 mg varenicline twice daily following a 1-week titration as follows: \n \n\nDays 1 – 3: 0.5 mg once daily \nDays 4 – 7: 0.5 mg twice daily \nDay 8 – End of treatment: 1 mg twice daily \n\n \nThe patient should set a date to stop smoking. CHAMPIX dosing should usually start 1-2 weeks \nbefore this date (see section 5.1). Patients should be treated with CHAMPIX for 12 weeks. \n \nFor patients who have successfully stopped smoking at the end of 12 weeks, an additional course of 12 \nweeks treatment with CHAMPIX at 1 mg twice daily may be considered for the maintenance of \nabstinence (see section 5.1). \n  \nA gradual approach to quitting smoking with CHAMPIX should be considered for patients who are \nnot able or willing to quit abruptly. Patients should reduce smoking during the first 12 weeks of \ntreatment and quit by the end of that treatment period. Patients should then continue taking CHAMPIX \nfor an additional 12 weeks for a total of 24 weeks of treatment (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients who are motivated to quit and who did not succeed in stopping smoking during prior \nCHAMPIX therapy, or who relapsed after treatment, may benefit from another quit attempt with \nCHAMPIX (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients who cannot tolerate adverse reactions of CHAMPIX may have the dose lowered temporarily \nor permanently to 0.5 mg twice daily. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nIn smoking cessation therapy, risk for relapse to smoking is elevated in the period immediately \nfollowing the end of treatment. In patients with a high risk of relapse, dose tapering may be considered \n(see section 4.4).  \n \nElderly \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2). Because elderly patients are \nmore likely to have decreased renal function, prescribers should consider the renal status of an elderly \npatient. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min \nand  80 ml/min) to moderate (estimated creatinine clearance  30 ml/min and  50 ml/min) renal \nimpairment. \n \nFor patients with moderate renal impairment who experience adverse reactions that are not tolerable, \ndosing may be reduced to 1 mg once daily.  \n \nFor patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the \nrecommended dose of CHAMPIX is 1 mg once daily. Dosing should begin at 0.5 mg once daily for \nthe first 3 days then increased to 1 mg once daily. Based on insufficient clinical experience with \nCHAMPIX in patients with end stage renal disease, treatment is not recommended in this patient \npopulation (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nCHAMPIX is not recommended for use in paediatric patients because its efficacy in this population \nwas not demonstrated (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nCHAMPIX is for oral use and the tablets should be swallowed whole with water. \nCHAMPIX can be taken with or without food \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEffect of smoking cessation \n \nPhysiological changes resulting from smoking cessation, with or without treatment with CHAMPIX, \nmay alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of some medicinal products, for which dosage \nadjustment may be necessary (examples include theophylline, warfarin and insulin). As smoking \ninduces CYP1A2, smoking cessation may result in an increase of plasma levels of CYP1A2 substrates. \n \nNeuropsychiatric symptoms \n \nChanges in behaviour or thinking, anxiety, psychosis, mood swings, aggressive behaviour, depression, \nsuicidal ideation and behaviour and suicide attempts have been reported in patients attempting to quit \nsmoking with CHAMPIX in the post-marketing experience.  \n \nA large randomised, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled study was conducted to compare \nthe risk of serious neuropsychiatric events in patients with and without a history of psychiatric \ndisorder treated for smoking cessation with varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\npatch (NRT) or placebo. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of neuropsychiatric adverse \nevents that have been reported in post-marketing experience.  \n \nThe use of varenicline in patients with or without a history of psychiatric disorder was not associated \nwith an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric adverse events in the composite primary endpoint \ncompared with placebo (see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Study in Subjects with and \nwithout a History of Psychiatric Disorder).  \n \nDepressed mood, rarely including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, may be a symptom of \nnicotine withdrawal. \n \nClinicians should be aware of the possible emergence of serious neuropsychiatric symptoms in \npatients attempting to quit smoking with or without treatment. If serious neuropsychiatric symptoms \noccur whilst on varenicline treatment, patients should discontinue varenicline immediately and \ncontact a healthcare professional for re-evaluation of treatment.  \n \nHistory of psychiatric disorders \n \nSmoking cessation, with or without pharmacotherapy, has been associated with exacerbation of \nunderlying psychiatric illness (e.g. depression). \n \nCHAMPIX smoking cessation studies have provided data in patients with a history of psychiatric \ndisorders (see section 5.1).  \n \nIn a smoking cessation clinical trial, neuropsychiatric adverse events were reported more frequently in \npatients with a history of psychiatric disorders compared to those without a history of psychiatric \ndisorders, regardless of treatment (see section 5.1). \n \nCare should be taken with patients with a history of psychiatric illness and patients should be advised \naccordingly. \n \nSeizures \n \nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience there have been reports of seizures in patients with or \nwithout a history of seizures, treated with CHAMPIX. CHAMPIX should be used cautiously in \npatients with a history of seizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold.  \n \nTreatment discontinuation \n \nAt the end of treatment, discontinuation of CHAMPIX was associated with an increase in irritability, \nurge to smoke, depression, and/or insomnia in up to 3% of patients. The prescriber should inform the \npatient accordingly and discuss or consider the need for dose tapering. \n \nCardiovascular events \n \nPatients taking CHAMPIX should be instructed to notify their doctor of new or worsening \ncardiovascular symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and \nsymptoms of myocardial infarction or stroke (see section 5.1). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nThere have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients \ntreated with varenicline. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth (tongue, lips, and gums), \nneck (throat and larynx) and extremities. There were rare reports of life-threatening angioedema \nrequiring urgent medical attention due to respiratory compromise. Patients experiencing these \nsymptoms should discontinue treatment with varenicline and contact a health care provider \nimmediately.  \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n \nCutaneous reactions \n \nThere have also been post-marketing reports of rare but severe cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-\nJohnson Syndrome and Erythema Multiforme in patients using varenicline. As these skin reactions can \nbe life threatening, patients should discontinue treatment at the first sign of rash or skin reaction and \ncontact a healthcare provider immediately. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBased on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, CHAMPIX has no clinically \nmeaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of CHAMPIX or co-administered medicinal \nproducts listed below is recommended. \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that \nare primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n \nFurthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active \nsubstances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of \nvarenicline (see section 5.2) and therefore a dose adjustment of CHAMPIX would not be required. \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at \ntherapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion  \n(e.g., metformin - see below) are unlikely to be affected by varenicline.  \n \nMetformin \n \nVarenicline did not affect the pharmacokinetics of metformin. Metformin had no effect on varenicline \npharmacokinetics. \n \nCimetidine \n \nCo-administration of cimetidine, with varenicline increased the systemic exposure of varenicline by \n29% due to a reduction in varenicline renal clearance. No dosage adjustment is recommended based \non concomitant cimetidine administration in subjects with normal renal function or in patients with \nmild to moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment, the concomitant use of \ncimetidine and varenicline should be avoided. \n \nDigoxin \n \nVarenicline did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin. \n \nWarfarin \n \nVarenicline did not alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Prothrombin time (INR) was not affected \nby varenicline. Smoking cessation itself may result in changes to warfarin pharmacokinetics (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nAlcohol \n \nThere are limited clinical data on any potential interaction between alcohol and varenicline. There \nhave been post marketing reports of increased intoxicating effects of alcohol in patients treated with \nvarenicline. A causal relationship between these events and varenicline use has not been established. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nUse with other therapies for smoking cessation  \n \nBupropion \nVarenicline did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of bupropion. \n \nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) \nWhen varenicline and transdermal NRT were co-administered to smokers for 12 days, there was a \nstatistically significant decrease in average systolic blood pressure (mean 2.6 mmHg) measured on the \nfinal day of the study. In this study, the incidence of nausea, headache, vomiting, dizziness, dyspepsia, \nand fatigue was greater for the combination than for NRT alone. \n \nSafety and efficacy of CHAMPIX in combination with other smoking cessation therapies have not \nbeen studied.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA moderate amount of data on pregnant women indicated no malformative or foetal/neonatal toxicity \nof varenicline (see section 5.1). \n \nAnimal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is \npreferable to avoid the use of varenicline during pregnancy (see section 5.1). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether varenicline is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies suggest that \nvarenicline is excreted in breast milk. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or \nto continue/discontinue therapy with CHAMPIX should be made taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding to the child and the benefit of CHAMPIX therapy to the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no clinical data on the effects of varenicline on fertility. \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no hazard for humans based on standard male and female fertility studies in \nthe rat (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCHAMPIX may have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nCHAMPIX may cause dizziness, somnolence and transient loss of consciousness, and therefore may \ninfluence the ability to drive and use machines. Patients are advised not to drive, operate complex \nmachinery or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until it is known whether this medicinal \nproduct affects their ability to perform these activities. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nSmoking cessation with or without treatment is associated with various symptoms. For example, \ndysphoric or depressed mood; insomnia, irritability, frustration or anger; anxiety; difficulty \nconcentrating; restlessness; decreased heart rate; increased appetite or weight gain have been reported \nin patients attempting to stop smoking. No attempt has been made in either the design or the analysis \nof the CHAMPIX studies to distinguish between adverse reactions associated with study drug \ntreatment or those possibly associated with nicotine withdrawal. Adverse drug reactions are based on \nevaluation of data from pre-marketing phase 2-3 studies and updated based on pooled data from \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n18 placebo-controlled pre- and post-marketing studies, including approximately 5,000 patients treated \nwith varenicline. \n \nIn patients treated with the recommended dose of 1 mg twice daily following an initial titration period \nthe adverse event most commonly reported was nausea (28.6%). In the majority of cases nausea \noccurred early in the treatment period, was mild to moderate in severity and seldom resulted in \ndiscontinuation. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nIn the table below all adverse reactions, which occurred at an incidence greater than placebo are listed \nby system organ class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000)).

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo cases of overdose were reported in pre-marketing clinical trials. \n \nIn case of overdose, standard supportive measures should be instituted as required. \n \nVarenicline has been shown to be dialyzed in patients with end stage renal disease (see section 5.2), \nhowever, there is no experience in dialysis following overdose. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs; Drugs used in addictive disorders, Drugs \nused in nicotine dependence, ATC code: N07BA03 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nVarenicline binds with high affinity and selectivity at the α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine \nreceptors, where it acts as a partial agonist - a compound that has both agonist activity, with lower \nintrinsic efficacy than nicotine, and antagonist activities in the presence of nicotine.  \n \nElectrophysiology studies in vitro and neurochemical studies in vivo have shown that varenicline \nbinds to the α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and stimulates receptor-mediated activity, \nbut at a significantly lower level than nicotine. Nicotine competes for the same human α4β2 nAChR \nbinding site for which varenicline has higher affinity. Therefore, varenicline can effectively block \nnicotine's ability to fully activate α4β2 receptors and the mesolimbic dopamine system, the neuronal \nmechanism underlying reinforcement and reward experienced upon smoking. Varenicline is highly \nselective and binds more potently to the α4β2 receptor subtype (Ki=0.15 nM) than to other common \nnicotinic receptors (α3β4 Ki=84 nM, α7 Ki= 620 nM, α1βγδ Ki= 3,400 nM), or to non-nicotinic \nreceptors and transporters (Ki > 1µM, except to 5-HT3 receptors: Ki=350 nM). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe efficacy of CHAMPIX in smoking cessation is a result of varenicline's partial agonist activity at \nthe α4β2 nicotinic receptor where its binding produces an effect sufficient to alleviate symptoms of \ncraving and withdrawal (agonist activity), while simultaneously resulting in a reduction of the \nrewarding and reinforcing effects of smoking by preventing nicotine binding to α4β2 receptors \n(antagonist activity). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nSmoking cessation therapies are more likely to succeed for patients who are motivated to stop \nsmoking and who are provided with additional advice and support. \n \nThe efficacy of CHAMPIX in smoking cessation was demonstrated in 3 clinical trials involving \nchronic cigarette smokers ( 10 cigarettes per day). Two thousand six hundred nineteen (2619) \npatients received CHAMPIX 1 mg BID (titrated during the first week), 669 patients received \nbupropion 150 mg BID (also titrated) and 684 patients received placebo. \n \nComparative clinical studies \nTwo identical double-blind clinical trials prospectively compared the efficacy of CHAMPIX  \n(1 mg twice daily), sustained release bupropion (150 mg twice daily) and placebo in smoking \ncessation. In these 52-week duration studies, patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a \n40-week non-treatment phase. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the two studies was the carbon monoxide (CO) confirmed, 4-week \ncontinuous quit rate (4W-CQR) from week 9 through week 12. The primary endpoint for CHAMPIX \ndemonstrated statistical superiority to bupropion and placebo. \n \nAfter the 40 week non-treatment phase, a key secondary endpoint for both studies was the Continuous \nAbstinence Rate (CA) at week 52. CA was defined as the proportion of all subjects treated who did \nnot smoke (not even a puff of a cigarette) from Week 9 through Week 52 and did not have an exhaled \nCO measurement of > 10 ppm. The 4W-CQR (weeks 9 through 12) and CA rate (weeks 9 through 52) \nfrom studies 1 and 2 are included in the following table: \n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n  Study 1 (n=1022) Study 2 (n=1023) \n4W CQR CA Wk 9-52 4W CQR CA Wk 9-52 \n\nCHAMPIX 44.4% 22.1% 44.0% 23.0% \nBupropion 29.5% 16.4% 30.0% 15.0% \nPlacebo 17.7% 8.4% 17.7% 10.3% \nOdds ratio  \nCHAMPIX vs. placebo \n\n3.91 \np < 0.0001 \n\n3.13 \np < 0.0001 \n\n3.85 \np < 0.0001 \n\n2.66 \np < 0.0001 \n\nOdds ratio  \nCHAMPIX vs. bupropion \n\n1.96 \np < 0.0001 \n\n1.45 \np = 0.0640 \n\n1.89 \np < 0.0001 \n\n1.72 \np = 0.0062 \n\n \nPatient reported craving, withdrawal and reinforcing effects of smoking \nAcross both Studies 1 and 2 during active treatment, craving and withdrawal were significantly \nreduced in patients randomised to CHAMPIX in comparison with placebo. CHAMPIX also \nsignificantly reduced reinforcing effects of smoking that can perpetuate smoking behaviour in patients \nwho smoke during treatment compared with placebo. The effect of varenicline on craving, withdrawal \nand reinforcing effects of smoking were not measured during the non-treatment long-term follow-up \nphase. \n \nMaintenance of abstinence study \nThe third study assessed the benefit of an additional 12 weeks of CHAMPIX therapy on the \nmaintenance of abstinence. Patients in this study (n=1,927) received open-label CHAMPIX 1 mg \ntwice daily for 12 weeks. Patients who stopped smoking by Week 12 were then randomised to receive \neither CHAMPIX (1 mg twice daily) or placebo for an additional 12 weeks for a total study duration \nof 52 weeks. \n \nThe primary study endpoint was the CO-confirmed continuous abstinence rate from week 13 through \nweek 24 in the double-blind treatment phase. A key secondary endpoint was the continuous abstinence \n(CA) rate for week 13 through week 52.  \n \nThis study showed the benefit of an additional 12-week treatment with CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily \nfor the maintenance of smoking cessation compared to placebo; superiority to placebo for CA was \nmaintained through week 52. The key results are summarised in the following table: \n \nContinuous Abstinence Rates in Subjects Treated with Champix versus Placebo \n \n CHAMPIX \n\nn=602 \nPlacebo \nn=604 \n\nDifference \n(95% CI) \n\nOdds ratio \n(95% CI) \n\nCA* wk 13-24 70.6% 49.8% 20.8% \n(15.4%, 26.2%) \n\n2.47 \n(1.95, 3.15) \n\nCA* wk 13-52 44.0% 37.1% 6.9% \n(1.4%, 12.5%) \n\n1.35 \n(1.07, 1.70) \n\n*CA: Continuous Abstinence Rate \n \nThere is currently limited clinical experience with the use of CHAMPIX among black people to \ndetermine clinical efficacy. \n \nFlexible quit date between weeks 1 and 5 \nThe efficacy and safety of varenicline has been evaluated in smokers who had the flexibility of \nquitting between weeks 1 and 5 of treatment. In this 24-week study, patients received treatment for \n12 weeks followed by a 12 week non-treatment follow up phase. The 4 week (week 9-12) CQR for \nvarenicline and placebo was 53.9% and 19.4%, respectively (difference=34.5, 95% CI: \n27.0% - 42.0%) and the CA week 9-24 was 35.2% (varenicline) vs. 12.7% (placebo) \n(difference=22.5%, 95% CI: 15.8% - 29.1%). Patients who are not willing or able to set the target quit \ndate within 1-2 weeks, could be offered to start treatment and then choose their own quit date within \n5 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nStudy in subjects re-treated with CHAMPIX  \nCHAMPIX was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 494 patients who had made a \nprevious attempt to quit smoking with CHAMPIX, and either did not succeed in quitting or relapsed \nafter treatment. Subjects who experienced an adverse event of a concern during previous treatment \nwere excluded. Subjects were randomised 1:1 to CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily (N=249) or placebo \n(N=245) for 12 weeks of treatment and followed for up to 40 weeks post-treatment. Patients included \nin this study had taken CHAMPIX for a smoking-cessation attempt in the past (for a total treatment \nduration of a minimum of two weeks), at least three months prior to study entry, and had been \nsmoking for at least four weeks.  \n \nPatients treated with CHAMPIX had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks \n9 through 12 and from weeks 9 through 52 compared to subjects treated with placebo.

Subjects were randomised to either CHAMPIX 1 mg \ntwice daily (n=760) or placebo (n=750) for 24 weeks and followed up post-treatment through week 52. \nSubjects were instructed to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked by at least 50 percent by the end \nof the first four weeks of treatment, followed by a further 50 percent reduction from week four to \nweek eight of treatment, with the goal of reaching complete abstinence by 12 weeks. After the initial \n12-week reduction phase, subjects continued treatment for another 12 weeks. Subjects treated with \nCHAMPIX had a significantly higher Continuous Abstinence Rate compared with placebo; the key \nresults are summarised in the following table: \n \nContinuous Abstinence Rates in Subjects Treated with Champix versus Placebo \n \n CHAMPIX \n\nn=760 \nPlacebo \nn=750 \n\nOdds ratio (95% CI), \np value \n\nCA* wk 15-24 32.1% 6.9% 8.74 (6.09, 12.53) \n p<0.0001  \n\nCA* wk 21-52 27.0% 9.9% 4.02 (2.94, 5.50) \np<0.0001 \n\n*CA: Continuous Abstinence Rate \n\n \n\nThe CHAMPIX safety profile in this study was consistent with that of pre-marketing studies. \n\n \nSubjects with cardiovascular disease \nCHAMPIX was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of subjects with \nstable, cardiovascular disease (other than, or in addition to, hypertension) that had been diagnosed for \nmore than 2 months. Subjects were randomised to CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily (n=353) or placebo \n(n=350) for 12 weeks and then were followed for 40 weeks post-treatment. The 4 week CQR for \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\nvarenicline and placebo was 47.3% and 14.3%, respectively and the CA week 9-52 was 19.8% \n(varenicline) vs. 7.4% (placebo). \n \nDeaths and serious cardiovascular events were adjudicated by a blinded, committee. The following \nadjudicated events occurred with a frequency ≥ 1% in either treatment group during treatment (or in \nthe 30-day period after treatment): nonfatal myocardial infarction (1.1% vs. 0.3% for CHAMPIX and \nplacebo, respectively), and hospitalisation for angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 1.1%). During non-treatment \nfollow up to 52 weeks, the adjudicated events included need for coronary revascularisation (2.0% vs. \n0.6%), hospitalisation for angina pectoris (1.7% vs. 1.1%), and new diagnosis of peripheral vascular \ndisease (PVD) or admission for a PVD procedure (1.4% vs. 0.6%). Some of the patients requiring \ncoronary revascularisation underwent the procedure as part of management of nonfatal MI and \nhospitalisation for angina. Cardiovascular death occurred in 0.3% of patients in the CHAMPIX arm \nand 0.6% of patients in the placebo arm over the course of the 52-week study. \n \nA meta-analysis of 15 clinical trials of ≥ 12 weeks treatment duration, including 7002 patients \n(4190 CHAMPIX, 2812 placebo), was conducted to systematically assess the cardiovascular safety of \nCHAMPIX. The study in patients with stable cardiovascular disease described above was included in \nthe meta-analysis.  \n \nThe key cardiovascular safety analysis included occurrence and timing of a composite endpoint of \nMajor Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and \nnonfatal stroke. These events included in the endpoint were adjudicated by a blinded, independent \ncommittee. Overall, a small number of MACE occurred during treatment in the trials included in the \nmeta-analysis (CHAMPIX 7 [0.17%]; placebo 2 [0.07%]). Additionally, a small number of MACE \noccurred up to 30 days after treatment (CHAMPIX 13 [0.31%]; placebo 6 [0.21%]). \n\n \nThe meta-analysis showed that exposure to CHAMPIX resulted in a hazard ratio for MACE of 2.83 \n(95% confidence interval from 0.76 to 10.55, p=0.12) for patients during treatment and 1.95 (95% \nconfidence interval from 0.79 to 4.82, p=0.15) for patients up to 30 days after treatment. These are \nequivalent to an estimated increase of 6.5 MACE events and 6.3 MACE events per \n1,000 patient-years, respectively of exposure. The hazard ratio for MACE was higher in patients with \ncardiovascular risk factors in addition to smoking compared with that in patients without \ncardiovascular risk factors other than smoking. There were similar rates of all-cause mortality \n(CHAMPIX 6 [0.14%]; placebo 7 [0.25%]) and cardiovascular mortality (CHAMPIX 2 [0.05%]; \nplacebo 2 [0.07%]) in the CHAMPIX arms compared with the placebo arms in the meta-analysis. \n \nCardiovascular safety assessment study in subjects with and without a history of psychiatric disorder \nThe cardiovascular (CV) safety of CHAMPIX was evaluated in the Study in Subjects with and without \na History of Psychiatric Disorder (parent study; see section 5.1 - Neuropsychiatric safety) and its non-\ntreatment extension, the Cardiovascular Safety Assessment Study, which enrolled 4595 of the 6293 \nsubjects who completed the parent study (N=8058) and followed them through week 52. Of all \nsubjects treated in the parent study, 1749 (21.7%) had a medium CV risk and 644 (8.0%) had a high \nCV risk, as defined by Framingham score.  \n \nThe primary CV endpoint was the time to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke during treatment. Deaths and \ncardiovascular events were adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee. \n \nThe following table shows the incidence of MACE and Hazard Ratios vs placebo for all treatment \ngroups during treatment, and cumulative for treatment plus 30 days and through end of study. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n CHAMPIX \nN=2016 \n\nBupropion \nN=2006 \n\nNRT \nN=2022 \n\nPlacebo \nN=2014 \n\nDuring treatment \n\nMACE, n (%) 1 (0.05) 2 (0.10) 1 (0.05) 4 (0.20) \n    Hazard Ratio \n(95% CI) vs \nplacebo \n\n0.29 (0.05, 1.68) 0.50 (0.10, 2.50) 0.29 (0.05, 1.70)  \n\nDuring treatment plus 30 days \nMACE, n (%) 1 (0.05) 2 (0.10) 2 (0.10) 4 (0.20) \n   Hazard Ratio \n(95% CI) vs \nplacebo \n\n0.29 (0.05, 1.70) 0.51 (0.10, 2.51) 0.50 (0.10, 2.48)  \n\nThrough end of study \nMACE, n (%) 3 (0.15) 9 (0.45) 6 (0.30) 8 (0.40) \n   Hazard Ratio \n(95% CI) vs \nplacebo \n\n0.39 (0.12, 1.27) 1.09 (0.42, 2.83) 0.75 (0.26, 2.13)  \n\n \nThe use of CHAMPIX, bupropion, and NRT was not associated with an increased risk of CV AEs in \nsmokers treated for up to 12 weeks and followed for up to 1 year compared to placebo, although \nbecause of the relatively low number of events overall, an association cannot be entirely ruled out.   \n \nSubjects with mild-moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \nThe efficacy and safety of CHAMPIX (1 mg twice daily) for smoking cessation in subjects with  \nmild-moderate COPD was demonstrated in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical \ntrial. In this 52-week duration study, patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a 40-week \nnon-treatment follow-up phase. The primary endpoint of the study was the CO-confirmed, 4-week \nContinuous Quit Rate (4W CQR) from week 9 through week 12 and a key secondary endpoint was the \nContinuous Abstinence (CA) from Week 9 through Week 52. The safety profile of varenicline was \ncomparable to what was reported in other trials in the general population, including pulmonary safety.  \nThe results for the 4W CQR (weeks 9 through 12) and CA rate (weeks 9 through 52) are shown in the \nfollowing table: \n \n 4W CQR CA Wk 9-52 \n\nCHAMPIX, (n = 248)  42.3% 18.5% \n\nPlacebo, (n = 251)  8.8% 5.6% \n\nOdds ratio  \n(CHAMPIX vs. Placebo)  \n\n8.40 \np < 0.0001 \n\n4.04 \np < 0.0001 \n\n \nStudy in subjects with a history of major depressive disorder \nThe efficacy of varenicline was confirmed in a randomised placebo-controlled trial of 525 subjects \nwith a history of major depression in the past two years or under current stable treatment. The \ncessation rates in this population were similar to those reported in the general population. Continuous \nabstinence rate between weeks 9-12 was 35.9% in the varenicline treatment group versus 15.6% in the \nplacebo group (OR 3.35 (95% CI 2.16-5.21)) and between weeks 9-52 was 20.3% versus 10.4% \nrespectively (OR 2.36 (95% CI 1.40-3.98)). The most common adverse events (≥ 10%) in subjects \ntaking varenicline were nausea (27.0% vs. 10.4% on placebo), headache (16.8% vs. 11.2%), abnormal \ndreams (11.3% vs. 8.2%), insomnia (10.9% vs. 4.8%) and irritability (10.9% vs. 8.2%). Psychiatric \nscales showed no differences between the varenicline and placebo groups and no overall worsening of \ndepression, or other psychiatric symptoms, during the study in either treatment group. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\nStudy in subjects with stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder  \nVarenicline safety and tolerability was assessed in a double-blind study of 128 smokers with stable \nschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, on antipsychotic medication, randomised 2:1 to varenicline \n(1 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 weeks with 12-week non-drug follow-up.  \n \nThe most common adverse events in subjects taking varenicline were nausea (23.8% vs. 14.0% on \nplacebo), headache (10.7% vs. 18.6% on placebo) and vomiting (10.7% vs. 9.3% on placebo). Among \nreported neuropsychiatric adverse events, insomnia was the only event reported in either treatment \ngroup in ≥ 5% of subjects at a rate higher in the varenicline group than in placebo (9.5% vs. 4.7%).  \n \nOverall, there was no worsening of schizophrenia in either treatment group as measured by psychiatric \nscales and there were no overall changes in extra-pyramidal signs. In the varenicline group compared \nto placebo, a higher proportion of subjects reported suicidal ideation or behaviour prior to enrolment \n(lifetime history) and after the end of active treatment period (on Days 33 to 85 after the last dose of \ntreatment). During the active treatment period, the incidence of suicide-related events was similar \nbetween the varenicline-treated and the placebo-treated subjects (11 vs. 9.3%, respectively). The \npercentage of subjects with suicide-related events in the active treatment phase compared to \npost-treatment phase was unchanged in the varenicline group; in the placebo group, this percentage \nwas lower in the post-treatment phase. Although there were no completed suicides, there was one \nsuicidal attempt in a varenicline-treated subject whose lifetime history included several similar \nattempts. The limited data available from this single smoking cessation study are not sufficient to \nallow for definitive conclusions to be drawn about the safety in patients with schizophrenia or \nschizoaffective disorder. \n \nNeuropsychiatric Safety Study in Subjects with and without a History of Psychiatric Disorder:  \nVarenicline was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled study that \nincluded subjects with a history of psychiatric disorder (psychiatric cohort, N=4074) and subjects \nwithout a history of psychiatric disorder (non-psychiatric cohort, N=3984). Subjects aged 18-75 years, \nsmoking 10 or more cigarettes per day were randomised 1:1:1:1 to varenicline 1 mg BID, bupropion \nSR 150 mg BID, nicotine replacement therapy patch (NRT) 21 mg/day with taper or placebo for a \ntreatment period of 12 weeks; they were then followed for another 12 weeks post-treatment.  \n\nThe primary safety endpoint was a composite of the following neuropsychiatric (NPS) adverse events: \nsevere events of anxiety, depression, feeling abnormal, or hostility, and/or moderate or severe events \nof agitation, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, homicidal ideation, mania, panic, paranoia, \npsychosis, suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviour or completed suicide. \n\nThe following table shows the rates of the composite NPS adverse event primary endpoint by \ntreatment group and the risk differences (RDs) (95% CI) vs placebo in the non-psychiatric cohort.  \n \nIn addition, the table shows the subset of the composite NPS AE endpoint of severe intensity: \n \n\n \n\nNon-psychiatric Cohort \nN=3984 \n\nVarenicline Bupropion NRT Placebo \nNumber of Patients Treated 990 989 1006 999 \nComposite NPS AE Primary \nEndpoint,  \nn (%) \n\n13 (1.3) \n \n\n22 (2.2) \n \n\n25 (2.5) \n \n\n24 (2.4) \n \n\nRD (95% CI) vs Placebo  -1.28 \n(-2.40, -0.15) \n\n-0.08 \n(-1.37, 1.21) \n\n-0.21           \n(-1.54,1.12) \n\n \n\nComposite NPS AE \nEndpoint of severe intensity \nn (%) \n\n1 (0.1) 4 (0.4) 3 (0.3) 5 (0.5) \n\nAE, adverse event; NRT=Nicotine replacement therapy patch \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\nThe rates of events in the composite endpoint were low across all treatment groups and were similar or \nlower for each of the active treatments compared to placebo. The use of varenicline, bupropion and \nNRT in the non-psychiatric cohort was not associated with a significantly increased risk of NPS \nadverse events in the composite primary endpoint compared with placebo (95% CIs were lower than \nor included zero). \n \nThe percentage of subjects with suicidal ideation and/or behaviour based on the Columbia-Suicide \nSeverity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was similar between the varenicline and placebo groups during \ntreatment and in the non- treatment follow-up, as shown in the following table: \n \n\n Non-psychiatric Cohort \nN=3984 \n\nVarenicline \n \n\nN=990 \nn (%) \n\nBupropion \n \n\nN=989 \nn (%) \n\nNRT \n \n\nN=1006 \nn (%) \n\nPlacebo \n \n\nN=999 \nn (%) \n\nDuring treatment \nNumber assessed 988 983 996 995 \nSuicidal \nbehaviour and/or \nideation \n\n7 (0.7) 4 (0.4) 3 (0.3) 7 (0.7) \n\nSuicidal \nbehaviour \n\n0 0 1 (0.1) 1 (0.1) \n\nSuicidal \nideation \n\n7 (0.7) 4 (0.4) 3 (0.3) 6 (0.6) \n\nDuring follow up \nNumber assessed 807 816 800 805 \nSuicidal \nbehaviour and/or \nideation \n\n3 (0.4) 2 (0.2) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.5) \n\nSuicidal \nbehaviour \n\n0 1 (0.1) 0 0 \n\nSuicidal \nideation \n\n3 (0.4) 2 (0.2) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.5) \n\nNRT=Nicotine replacement therapy patch \n\n \nThere was one completed suicide, which occurred during treatment in a subject treated with placebo in \nthe non-psychiatric cohort. \n\nThe following table shows the rates of the composite NPS adverse event primary endpoint by \ntreatment group and the RDs (95% CI) vs placebo in the psychiatric cohort.

In addition, independent observational studies have not \nsupported an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric events in patients treated with varenicline \ncompared to patients prescribed nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion.  \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\nTreatment discontinuation  \nThe treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 11.4% for varenicline compared with \n9.7% for placebo. In this group, the discontinuation rates for the most common adverse reactions in \nvarenicline treated patients were as follows: nausea (2.7% vs. 0.6% for placebo), headache (0.6% vs. \n1.0% for placebo), insomnia (1.3% vs. 1.2% for placebo), and abnormal dreams (0.2% vs. 0.2% for \nplacebo). \n \nAnalyses of Clinical Trials:  \n \nA meta-analysis of 5 randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trials, including 1907 patients \n(1130 varenicline, 777 placebo), was conducted to assess suicidal ideation and behaviour as reported \non the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). This meta-analysis included one trial \n(N=127) in patients with a history of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and another trial \n(N=525) in patients with a history of depression. The results showed no increase in the incidence of \nsuicidal ideation and/or behaviour in patients treated with varenicline compared to patients treated \nwith placebo, as shown in the table below. Of the 55 patients who reported suicidal ideation or \nbehaviour, 48 (24 varenicline, 24 placebo) were from the two trials that enrolled patients with a history \nof schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder, or of depression. Few patients reported these events in the \nother three trials (4 varenicline, 3 placebo). \n \nNumber of Patients and Risk Ratio for Suicidal Ideation and/or Behaviour Reported on C-SSRS \nfrom a Meta-Analysis of 5 Clinical Trials Comparing Varenicline to Placebo: \n \n\n Varenicline \n(N=1130) \n\nPlacebo \n(N=777) \n\nPatients with suicidal ideation and/or behaviour* [n (%)]** 28 (2.5) 27 (3.5) \n\nPatient-years of exposure 325 217 \nRisk Ratio # (RR; 95% CI) 0.79 (0.46, 1.36) \n* Of these, one patient in each treatment arm reported suicidal behaviour \n\n** Patients with events up to 30 days after treatment; % are not weighted by study \n\n# RR of incidence rates per 100 patient years \n\n \nA meta-analysis of 18 double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials was conducted to \nassess the neuropsychiatric safety of varenicline. These trials included the 5 trials described above that \nused the C-SSRS, and a total of 8521 patients (5072 varenicline, 3449 placebo), some of which had \npsychiatric conditions. The results showed a similar incidence of combined neuropsychiatric adverse \nevents, other than sleep disorders, in patients treated with varenicline compared to patients treated with \nplacebo, with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89-1.15). Pooled data from these 18 trials showed a \nsimilar incidence rate of individual categories of psychiatric events in patients treated with varenicline \ncompared to patients treated with placebo. The table below describes the most frequently (≥ 1%) \nreported categories of adverse events related to psychiatric safety other than sleep disorders and \ndisturbances. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\nPsychiatric Adverse Events Occurring in ≥ 1% of Patients from Pooled Data from 18 Clinical \nTrials:  \n \n\n Varenicline \n(N=5072) \n\nPlacebo \n(N=3449) \n\nAnxiety disorders and symptoms 253 (5.0) 206 (6.0) \nDepressed mood disorders and disturbances 179 (3.5) 108 (3.1) \nMood disorders and disturbances NEC* 116 (2.3) 53 (1.5) \n* NEC = Not Elsewhere Classified \n\nCounts (percentages) corresponds to the number of patients reporting the event \n \nObservational Studies \n \nFour observational studies, each including 10,000 to 30,000 users of varenicline in the adjusted \nanalyses, compared the risk of serious neuropsychiatric events, including neuropsychiatric \nhospitalizations and fatal and non-fatal self-harm, in patients treated with varenicline versus patients \nprescribed NRT or bupropion. All studies were retrospective cohort studies and included patients with \nand without a psychiatric history. All studies used statistical methods to control for confounding \nfactors, including preferential prescribing of varenicline to healthier patients, although there is the \npossibility of residual confounding. \n\nTwo of the studies found no difference in risk of neuropsychiatric hospitalisations between varenicline \nusers and nicotine patch users (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.56–2.34 in \nthe first study, and 0.76; 95% CI: 0.40-1.46 in the second study). The power to detect differences in \nthese two studies was limited. The third study reported no difference in risk of psychiatric adverse \nevents diagnosed during an emergency department visit or inpatient admission between varenicline \nusers and bupropion users (HR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.55-1.30). Based on post marketing reports, bupropion \nmay be associated with neuropsychiatric adverse events. \n\nThe fourth study showed no evidence of a higher risk of fatal and non-fatal self- harm (HR of 0.88; \n95% CI: 0.52-1.49) in patients prescribed varenicline compared to patients prescribed NRT. The \noccurrence of detected suicide was rare during the three months after patients initiated any drug \ntreatment (two cases in 31,260 varenicline users and six cases in 81,545 NRT users). \n \nPregnancy Cohort Study \n \nA population-based cohort study compared infants exposed to CHAMPIX in utero (N=335) with \ninfants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy (N=78,412) and infants born to non-smoking \nmothers (N=806,438). In this study, infants exposed to CHAMPIX in utero as compared to infants \nborn to mothers who smoked during pregnancy had lower rates of congenital malformations \n(3.6% vs 4.3%), stillbirth (0.3% vs 0.5%), preterm birth (7.5% vs 7.9%), small for gestational age \n(12.5% vs 17.1%), and premature rupture of membrane (3.6% vs 5.4%).  \n \nPaediatric Population \n \nThe efficacy and safety of varenicline was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled study of 312 patients aged 12 to 19 years, who smoked an average of at least \n5 cigarettes per day during the 30 days prior to recruitment, and had a score of at least 4 on the \nFagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence scale. Patients were stratified by age (12-16 years of age \nand 17-19 years of age) and by body weight (≤55 kg and >55 kg). Following two-week titration, \npatients randomised to varenicline with a body weight >55 kg received 1 mg twice daily (high dose \ngroup) or 0.5 mg twice daily (low dose group), while patients with a body weight ≤55 kg received \n0.5 mg twice daily (high dose group) or 0.5 mg once daily (low dose group). Patients received \ntreatment for 12 weeks, followed by a non-treatment period of 40 weeks, along with age-appropriate \ncounseling throughout the study. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\nThe following table from the above paediatric study shows a comparison of continuous abstinence \nrates (CAR) from weeks 9-12, confirmed by urine cotinine test, for the full analysis set overall study \npopulation and the 12-17 year old population. \n \nCAR 9-12 (%) Overall \n\nn/N (%) \n12-to-17-Year Olds \n\nn/N (%) \nHigh-Dose Varenicline 22/109 (20.2%) 15/80 (18.8%) \nLow-Dose Varenicline 28/103 (27.2%) 25/78 (32.1%) \nPlacebo 18/100 (18.0%) 13/76 (17.1%) \nTreatment Comparisons Odds ratio in CAR 9-12 (95% CI) [p-value]  \nHigh-Dose Varenicline vs Placebo 1.18 (0.59, 2.37) [0.6337] 1.13 (0.50, 2.56) [0.7753] \nLow-Dose Varenicline vs Placebo 1.73 (0.88, 3.39) [0.1114] 2.28 (1.06, 4.89) [0.0347]* \n* This p value is not considered statistically significant.

Following administration of multiple oral doses to healthy volunteers, steady-state \nconditions were reached within 4 days. Absorption is virtually complete after oral administration and \nsystemic availability is high. Oral bioavailability of varenicline is unaffected by food or time-of-day \ndosing. \n \nDistribution \n \nVarenicline distributes into tissues, including the brain. Apparent volume of distribution averaged \n415 litres (%CV= 50) at steady-state. Plasma protein binding of varenicline is low (< 20%) and \nindependent of both age and renal function. In rodents, varenicline is transferred through the placenta \nand excreted in milk.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nVarenicline undergoes minimal metabolism with 92% excreted unchanged in the urine and less than \n10% excreted as metabolites. Minor metabolites in urine include varenicline N-carbamoylglucuronide \nand hydroxyvarenicline. In circulation, varenicline comprises 91% of drug-related material. Minor \ncirculating metabolites include varenicline N-carbamoylglucuronide and N-glucosylvarenicline. \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes \n(IC50 > 6,400 ng/ml). The P450 enzymes tested for inhibition were: 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, \n2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline was shown to not induce the \nactivity of cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. Therefore, varenicline is unlikely to alter the \npharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n \nElimination \n \nThe elimination half-life of varenicline is approximately 24 hours. Renal elimination of varenicline is \nprimarily through glomerular filtration along with active tubular secretion via the organic cationic \ntransporter, OCT2 (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\nLinearity/Non linearity \n \nVarenicline exhibits linear kinetics when given as single (0.1 to 3 mg) or repeated 1 to 3 mg/day \ndoses. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient populations \n \nThere are no clinically meaningful differences in varenicline pharmacokinetics due to age, race, \ngender, smoking status, or use of concomitant medicinal products, as demonstrated in specific \npharmacokinetic studies and in population pharmacokinetic analyses. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDue to the absence of significant hepatic metabolism, varenicline pharmacokinetics should be \nunaffected in patients with hepatic impairment. (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nVarenicline pharmacokinetics were unchanged in subjects with mild renal impairment (estimated \ncreatinine clearance > 50 ml/min and  80 ml/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment \n(estimated creatinine clearance  30 ml/min and  50 ml/min), varenicline exposure increased 1.5-fold \ncompared with subjects with normal renal function (estimated creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min). In \nsubjects with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), varenicline \nexposure was increased 2.1-fold. In subjects with end-stage-renal disease (ESRD), varenicline was \nefficiently removed by haemodialysis (see section 4.2).  \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of varenicline in elderly patients with normal renal function (aged 65-75 years) \nis similar to that of younger adult subjects (see section 4.2). For elderly patients with reduced renal \nfunction please refer to section 4.2. \n \nPaediatric population \nSingle and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of varenicline have been investigated in paediatric patients \naged 12 to 17 years old (inclusive) and were approximately dose-proportional over the 0.5 mg to 2 mg \ndaily dose range studied. Steady-state systemic exposure in adolescent patients of bodyweight > 55 kg, \nas assessed by AUC (0-24), was comparable to that noted for the same doses in the adult population. \nWhen 0.5 mg twice daily was given, steady-state daily exposure of varenicline was, on average, higher \n(by approximately 40%) in adolescent patients with bodyweight ≤ 55 kg compared to that noted in the \nadult population. CHAMPIX is not recommended in paediatric patients because its efficacy in this \npopulation was not demonstrated (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, fertility and embryo-foetal development. In male \nrats dosed for 2 years with varenicline, there was a dose-related increase in the incidence of hibernoma \n(tumour of the brown fat). In the offspring of pregnant rats treated with varenicline there were \ndecreases in fertility and increases in the auditory startle response (see section 4.6). These effects were \nobserved only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure \nindicating little relevance to clinical use. Nonclinical data indicate varenicline has reinforcing \nproperties albeit with lower potency than nicotine. In clinical studies in humans, varenicline showed \nlow abuse potential. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCHAMPIX is indicated for smoking cessation in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 1 mg varenicline twice daily following a 1-week titration as follows: \n \n\nDays 1 – 3: 0.5 mg once daily \nDays 4 – 7: 0.5 mg twice daily \nDay 8 – End of treatment: 1 mg twice daily \n\n \nThe patient should set a date to stop smoking. CHAMPIX dosing should usually start at 1-2 weeks \nbefore this date (see section 5.1). Patients should be treated with CHAMPIX for 12 weeks. \n \nFor patients who have successfully stopped smoking at the end of 12 weeks, an additional course of \n12 weeks treatment with CHAMPIX at 1 mg twice daily may be considered for the maintenance of \nabstinence (see section 5.1).  \n \nA gradual approach to quitting smoking with CHAMPIX should be considered for patients who are \nnot able or willing to quit abruptly. Patients should reduce smoking during the first 12 weeks of \ntreatment and quit by the end of that treatment period. Patients should then continue taking CHAMPIX \nfor an additional 12 weeks for a total of 24 weeks of treatment (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\nPatients who are motivated to quit and who did not succeed in stopping smoking during prior \nCHAMPIX therapy, or who relapsed after treatment, may benefit from another quit attempt with \nCHAMPIX (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients who cannot tolerate adverse reactions of CHAMPIX may have the dose lowered temporarily \nor permanently to 0.5 mg twice daily. \n \nIn smoking cessation therapy, risk for relapse to smoking is elevated in the period immediately \nfollowing the end of treatment. In patients with a high risk of relapse, dose tapering may be considered \n(see section 4.4).  \n \nElderly \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2). Because elderly patients are \nmore likely to have decreased renal function, prescribers should consider the renal status of an elderly \npatient. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min \nand  80 ml/min) to moderate (estimated creatinine clearance  30 ml/min and  50 ml/min) renal \nimpairment. \n \nFor patients with moderate renal impairment who experience adverse reactions that are not tolerable, \ndosing may be reduced to 1 mg once daily.  \n \nFor patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the \nrecommended dose of CHAMPIX is 1 mg once daily. Dosing should begin at 0.5 mg once daily for \nthe first 3 days then increased to 1 mg once daily. Based on insufficient clinical experience with \nCHAMPIX in patients with end stage renal disease, treatment is not recommended in this patient \npopulation (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nCHAMPIX is not recommended for use in paediatric patients because its efficacy in this population \nwas not demonstrated (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nCHAMPIX is for oral use and the tablets should be swallowed whole with water. \nCHAMPIX can be taken with or without food \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEffect of smoking cessation \n \nPhysiological changes resulting from smoking cessation, with or without treatment with CHAMPIX, \nmay alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of some medicinal products, for which dosage \nadjustment may be necessary (examples include theophylline, warfarin and insulin). As smoking \ninduces CYP1A2, smoking cessation may result in an increase of plasma levels of CYP1A2 substrates. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms \n \nChanges in behaviour or thinking, anxiety, psychosis, mood swings, aggressive behaviour, depression, \nsuicidal ideation and behaviour and suicide attempts have been reported in patients attempting to quit \nsmoking with CHAMPIX in the post-marketing experience.  \n \nA large randomised, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled study was conducted to compare \nthe risk of serious neuropsychiatric events in patients with and without a history of psychiatric \ndisorder treated for smoking cessation with varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy \npatch (NRT) or placebo. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of neuropsychiatric adverse \nevents that have been reported in post-marketing experience.  \n \nThe use of varenicline in patients with or without a history of psychiatric disorder was not associated \nwith an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric adverse events in the composite primary endpoint \ncompared with placebo (see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Study in Subjects with and \nwithout a History of Psychiatric Disorder).  \n \nDepressed mood, rarely including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, may be a symptom of \nnicotine withdrawal. \n \nClinicians should be aware of the possible emergence of serious neuropsychiatric symptoms in \npatients attempting to quit smoking with or without treatment. If serious neuropsychiatric symptoms \noccur whilst on varenicline treatment, patients should discontinue varenicline immediately and \ncontact a healthcare professional for re-evaluation of treatment.  \n \nHistory of psychiatric disorders  \n \nSmoking cessation, with or without pharmacotherapy, has been associated with exacerbation of \nunderlying psychiatric illness (e.g. depression). \n \nCHAMPIX smoking cessation studies have provided data in patients with a history of psychiatric \ndisorders (see section 5.1).  \n \nIn a smoking cessation clinical trial, neuropsychiatric adverse events were reported more frequently in \npatients with a history of psychiatric disorders compared to those without a history of psychiatric \ndisorders, regardless of treatment (see section 5.1). \n \nCare should be taken with patients with a history of psychiatric illness and patients should be advised \naccordingly. \n \nSeizures  \n \nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience there have been reports of seizures in patients with or \nwithout a history of seizures, treated with CHAMPIX. CHAMPIX should be used cautiously in \npatients with a history of seizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold. \n \nTreatment discontinuation  \n \nAt the end of treatment, discontinuation of CHAMPIX was associated with an increase in irritability, \nurge to smoke, depression, and/or insomnia in up to 3% of patients. The prescriber should inform the \npatient accordingly and discuss or consider the need for dose tapering. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\nCardiovascular events  \n \nPatients taking CHAMPIX should be instructed to notify their doctor of new or worsening \ncardiovascular symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and \nsymptoms of myocardial infarction or stroke (see section 5.1). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nThere have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients \ntreated with varenicline. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth (tongue, lips, and gums), \nneck (throat and larynx) and extremities. There were rare reports of life-threatening angioedema \nrequiring urgent medical attention due to respiratory compromise. Patients experiencing these \nsymptoms should discontinue treatment with varenicline and contact a health care provider \nimmediately. \n \nCutaneous reactions \n \nThere have also been post-marketing reports of rare but severe cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-\nJohnson Syndrome and Erythema Multiforme in patients using varenicline. As these skin reactions can \nbe life threatening, patients should discontinue treatment at the first sign of rash or skin reaction and \ncontact a healthcare provider immediately. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBased on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, CHAMPIX has no clinically \nmeaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of CHAMPIX or co-administered medicinal \nproducts listed below is recommended. \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that \nare primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n \nFurthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active \nsubstances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of \nvarenicline (see section 5.2) and therefore a dose adjustment of CHAMPIX would not be required. \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at \ntherapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion (e.g., \nmetformin - see below) are unlikely to be affected by varenicline.  \n \nMetformin \n \nVarenicline did not affect the pharmacokinetics of metformin. Metformin had no effect on varenicline \npharmacokinetics. \n \nCimetidine \n \nCo-administration of cimetidine, with varenicline increased the systemic exposure of varenicline by \n29% due to a reduction in varenicline renal clearance. No dosage adjustment is recommended based \non concomitant cimetidine administration in subjects with normal renal function or in patients with \nmild to moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment, the concomitant use of \ncimetidine and varenicline should be avoided. \n \nDigoxin \n \nVarenicline did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\nWarfarin \n \nVarenicline did not alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Prothrombin time (INR) was not affected \nby varenicline. Smoking cessation itself may result in changes to warfarin pharmacokinetics (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nAlcohol \n \nThere are limited clinical data on any potential interaction between alcohol and varenicline. There \nhave been post marketing reports of increased intoxicating effects of alcohol in patients treated with \nvarenicline. A causal relationship between these events and varenicline use has not been established. \n \nUse with other therapies for smoking cessation  \n \nBupropion  \nVarenicline did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of bupropion. \n \nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT)  \nWhen varenicline and transdermal NRT were co-administered to smokers for 12 days, there was a \nstatistically significant decrease in average systolic blood pressure (mean 2.6 mmHg) measured on the \nfinal day of the study. In this study, the incidence of nausea, headache, vomiting, dizziness, dyspepsia, \nand fatigue was greater for the combination than for NRT alone. \n \nSafety and efficacy of CHAMPIX in combination with other smoking cessation therapies have not \nbeen studied.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA moderate amount of data on pregnant women indicated no malformative or foetal/neonatal toxicity \nof varenicline (see section 5.1). \n \nAnimal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is \npreferable to avoid the use of varenicline during pregnancy (see section 5.1). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether varenicline is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies suggest that \nvarenicline is excreted in breast milk. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or \nto continue/discontinue therapy with CHAMPIX should be made taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding to the child and the benefit of CHAMPIX therapy to the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no clinical data on the effects of varenicline on fertility. \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no hazard for humans based on standard male and female fertility studies in \nthe rat (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCHAMPIX may have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nCHAMPIX may cause dizziness, somnolence and transient loss of consciousness, and therefore may \ninfluence the ability to drive and use machines. Patients are advised not to drive, operate complex \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\nmachinery or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until it is known whether this medicinal \nproduct affects their ability to perform these activities. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nSmoking cessation with or without treatment is associated with various symptoms. For example, \ndysphoric or depressed mood; insomnia, irritability, frustration or anger; anxiety; difficulty \nconcentrating; restlessness; decreased heart rate; increased appetite or weight gain have been reported \nin patients attempting to stop smoking. No attempt has been made in either the design or the analysis \nof the CHAMPIX studies to distinguish between adverse reactions associated with study drug \ntreatment or those possibly associated with nicotine withdrawal. Adverse drug reactions are based on \nevaluation of data from pre-marketing phase 2-3 studies and updated based on pooled data from \n18 placebo-controlled pre- and post-marketing studies, including approximately 5,000 patients treated \nwith varenicline. \n \nIn patients treated with the recommended dose of 1 mg twice daily following an initial titration period \nthe adverse event most commonly reported was nausea (28.6%). In the majority of cases nausea \noccurred early in the treatment period, was mild to moderate in severity and seldom resulted in \ndiscontinuation. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nIn the table below all adverse reactions, which occurred at an incidence greater than placebo are listed \nby system organ class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000)).

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n. \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo cases of overdose were reported in pre-marketing clinical trials. \n \nIn case of overdose, standard supportive measures should be instituted as required. \n \nVarenicline has been shown to be dialyzed in patients with end stage renal disease (see section 5.2), \nhowever, there is no experience in dialysis following overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs; Drugs used in addictive disorders; Drugs \nused in nicotine dependence, ATC code: N07BA03 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nVarenicline binds with high affinity and selectivity at the α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine \nreceptors, where it acts as a partial agonist - a compound that has both agonist activity, with lower \nintrinsic efficacy than nicotine, and antagonist activities in the presence of nicotine. \n \nElectrophysiology studies in vitro and neurochemical studies in vivo have shown that varenicline \nbinds to the α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and stimulates receptor-mediated activity, \nbut at a significantly lower level than nicotine. Nicotine competes for the same human α4β2 nAChR \nbinding site for which varenicline has higher affinity. Therefore, varenicline can effectively block \nnicotine's ability to fully activate α4β2 receptors and the mesolimbic dopamine system, the neuronal \nmechanism underlying reinforcement and reward experienced upon smoking. Varenicline is highly \nselective and binds more potently to the α4β2 receptor subtype (Ki=0.15 nM) than to other common \nnicotinic receptors (α3β4 Ki=84 nM, α7 Ki= 620 nM, α1βγδ Ki= 3,400 nM), or to non-nicotinic \nreceptors and transporters (Ki > 1µM, except to 5-HT3 receptors: Ki=350 nM). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe efficacy of CHAMPIX in smoking cessation is a result of varenicline's partial agonist activity at \nthe α4β2 nicotinic receptor where its binding produces an effect sufficient to alleviate symptoms of \ncraving and withdrawal (agonist activity), while simultaneously resulting in a reduction of the \nrewarding and reinforcing effects of smoking by preventing nicotine binding to α4β2 receptors \n(antagonist activity). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nSmoking cessation therapies are more likely to succeed for patients who are motivated to stop \nsmoking and who are provided with additional advice and support. \n \nThe efficacy of CHAMPIX in smoking cessation was demonstrated in 3 clinical trials involving \nchronic cigarette smokers ( 10 cigarettes per day). Two thousand six hundred nineteen (2619) \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\npatients received CHAMPIX 1 mg BID (titrated during the first week), 669 patients received \nbupropion 150 mg BID (also titrated) and 684 patients received placebo. \n \nComparative clinical studies \nTwo identical double-blind clinical trials prospectively compared the efficacy of CHAMPIX (1 mg \ntwice daily), sustained release bupropion (150 mg twice daily) and placebo in smoking cessation. In \nthese 52-week duration studies, patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a 40-week  \nnon-treatment phase. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the two studies was the carbon monoxide (CO) confirmed, 4-week \ncontinuous quit rate (4W-CQR) from week 9 through week 12. The primary endpoint for CHAMPIX \ndemonstrated statistical superiority to bupropion and placebo. \n \nAfter the 40 week non-treatment phase, a key secondary endpoint for both studies was the Continuous \nAbstinence Rate (CA) at week 52. CA was defined as the proportion of all subjects treated who did \nnot smoke (not even a puff of a cigarette) from Week 9 through Week 52 and did not have an exhaled \nCO measurement of > 10 ppm. The 4W-CQR (weeks 9 through 12) and CA rate (weeks 9 through 52) \nfrom studies 1 and 2 are included in the following table: \n \n\n  Study 1 (n=1022) Study 2 (n=1023) \n4W CQR CA Wk 9-52 4W CQR CA Wk 9-52 \n\nCHAMPIX 44.4% 22.1% 44.0% 23.0% \nBupropion 29.5% 16.4% 30.0% 15.0% \nPlacebo 17.7% 8.4% 17.7% 10.3% \nOdds ratio  \nCHAMPIX vs. placebo \n\n3.91 \np < 0.0001 \n\n3.13 \np < 0.0001 \n\n3.85 \np < 0.0001 \n\n2.66 \np < 0.0001 \n\nOdds ratio  \nCHAMPIX vs. bupropion \n\n1.96 \np < 0.0001 \n\n1.45 \np = 0.0640 \n\n1.89 \np < 0.0001 \n\n1.72 \np = 0.0062 \n\n \nPatient reported craving, withdrawal and reinforcing effects of smoking \n \nAcross both Studies 1 and 2 during active treatment, craving and withdrawal were significantly \nreduced in patients randomised to CHAMPIX in comparison with placebo. CHAMPIX also \nsignificantly reduced reinforcing effects of smoking that can perpetuate smoking behaviour in patients \nwho smoke during treatment compared with placebo. The effect of varenicline on craving, withdrawal \nand reinforcing effects of smoking were not measured during the non-treatment long-term follow-up \nphase. \n \nMaintenance of abstinence study \n \nThe third study assessed the benefit of an additional 12 weeks of CHAMPIX therapy on the \nmaintenance of abstinence. Patients in this study (n=1,927) received open-label CHAMPIX 1 mg \ntwice daily for 12 weeks. Patients who stopped smoking by Week 12 were then randomised to receive \neither CHAMPIX (1 mg twice daily) or placebo for an additional 12 weeks for a total study duration \nof 52 weeks. \n \nThe primary study endpoint was the CO-confirmed continuous abstinence rate from week 13 through \nweek 24 in the double-blind treatment phase. A key secondary endpoint was the continuous abstinence \n(CA) rate for week 13 through week 52.  \n \nThis study showed the benefit of an additional 12-week treatment with CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily \nfor the maintenance of smoking cessation compared to placebo; superiority to placebo for CA was \nmaintained through week 52. The key results are summarised in the following table: \n \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\nContinuous Abstinence Rates in Subjects Treated with Champix versus Placebo \n \n CHAMPIX \n\nn=602 \nPlacebo \nn=604 \n\nDifference \n(95% CI) \n\nOdds ratio \n(95% CI) \n\nCA* wk 13-24 70.6% 49.8% 20.8% \n(15.4%, 26.2%) \n\n2.47 \n(1.95, 3.15) \n\nCA* wk 13-52 44.0% 37.1% 6.9% \n(1.4%, 12.5%) \n\n1.35 \n(1.07, 1.70) \n\n*CA: Continuous Abstinence Rate \n\n \nThere is currently limited clinical experience with the use of CHAMPIX among black people to \ndetermine clinical efficacy. \n \nFlexible quit date between weeks 1 and 5 \nThe efficacy and safety of varenicline has been evaluated in smokers who had the flexibility of \nquitting between weeks 1 and 5 of treatment. In this 24-week study, patients received treatment for \n12 weeks followed by a 12 week non-treatment follow up phase. The 4 week (week 9-12) CQR for \nvarenicline and placebo was 53.9% and 19.4%, respectively (difference=34.5%, 95% CI: 27.0% - \n42.0%) and the CA week 9-24 was 35.2% (varenicline) vs. 12.7% (placebo) (difference=22.5%, 95% \nCI: 15.8% - 29.1%). Patients who are not willing or able to set the target quit date within 1-2 weeks, \ncould be offered to start treatment and then choose their own quit date within 5 weeks. \n \nStudy in subjects re-treated with CHAMPIX  \nCHAMPIX was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 494 patients who had made a \nprevious attempt to quit smoking with CHAMPIX, and either did not succeed in quitting or relapsed \nafter treatment. Subjects who experienced an adverse event of a concern during previous treatment \nwere excluded. Subjects were randomised 1:1 to CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily (N=249) or placebo \n(N=245) for 12 weeks of treatment and followed for up to 40 weeks post-treatment. Patients included \nin this study had taken CHAMPIX for a smoking-cessation attempt in the past (for a total treatment \nduration of a minimum of two weeks), at least three months prior to study entry, and had been \nsmoking for at least four weeks.  \n \nPatients treated with CHAMPIX had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 9 \nthrough 12 and from weeks 9 through 52 compared to subjects treated with placebo. The key results \nare summarised in the following table: \n \nContinuous Abstinence Rates in Subjects Treated with Champix versus Placebo \n \n\n CHAMPIX \nn=249 \n\nPlacebo \nn=245 \n\nOdds ratio (95% CI), \np value \n\nCA* wk 9-12 45.0% 11.8% 7.08 (4.34, 11.55), \np<0.0001 \n\nCA* wk 9-52 20.1% 3.3% 9.00 (3.97, 20.41), \np<0.0001 \n\n*CA: Continuous Abstinence \n \nGradual approach to quitting smoking \nCHAMPIX was evaluated in a 52-week double-blind placebo-controlled study of 1,510 subjects who \nwere not able or willing to quit smoking within four weeks, but were willing to gradually reduce their \nsmoking over a 12 week period before quitting. Subjects were randomised to either CHAMPIX 1 mg \ntwice daily (n=760) or placebo (n=750) for 24 weeks and followed up post-treatment through week 52. \nSubjects were instructed to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked by at least 50 percent by the end \nof the first four weeks of treatment, followed by a further 50 percent reduction from week four to \nweek eight of treatment, with the goal of reaching complete abstinence by 12 weeks. After the initial \n12-week reduction phase, subjects continued treatment for another 12 weeks. Subjects treated with \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\nCHAMPIX had a significantly higher Continuous Abstinence Rate compared with placebo; the key \nresults are summarised in the following table: \n \nContinuous Abstinence Rates in Subjects Treated with Champix versus Placebo \n \n CHAMPIX \n\nn=760 \nPlacebo \nn=750 \n\nOdds ratio (95% CI), \np value \n\nCA* wk 15-24 32.1% 6.9% 8.74 (6.09, 12.53) \n p<0.0001  \n\nCA* wk 21-52 27.0% 9.9% 4.02 (2.94, 5.50) \np<0.0001 \n\n*CA: Continuous Abstinence Rate \n\n \nThe CHAMPIX safety profile in this study was consistent with that of pre-marketing studies. \n \nSubjects with cardiovascular disease \nCHAMPIX was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of subjects with \nstable, cardiovascular disease (other than, or in addition to, hypertension) that had been diagnosed for \nmore than 2 months. Subjects were randomised to CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily (n=353) or placebo \n(n=350) for 12 weeks and then were followed for 40 weeks post-treatment. The 4 week CQR for \nvarenicline and placebo was 47.3% and 14.3%, respectively and the CA week 9-52 was 19.8% \n(varenicline) vs. 7.4% (placebo). \n \nDeaths and serious cardiovascular events were adjudicated by a blinded, committee. The following \nadjudicated events occurred with a frequency ≥ 1% in either treatment group during treatment (or in \nthe 30-day period after treatment): nonfatal myocardial infarction (1.1% vs. 0.3% for CHAMPIX and \nplacebo, respectively), and hospitalisation for angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 1.1%). During non-treatment \nfollow up to 52 weeks, the adjudicated events included need for coronary revascularisation (2.0% vs. \n0.6%), hospitalisation for angina pectoris (1.7% vs. 1.1%), and new diagnosis of peripheral vascular \ndisease (PVD) or admission for a PVD procedure (1.4% vs. 0.6%). Some of the patients requiring \ncoronary revascularisation underwent the procedure as part of management of nonfatal MI and \nhospitalisation for angina. Cardiovascular death occurred in 0.3% of patients in the CHAMPIX arm \nand 0.6% of patients in the placebo arm over the course of the 52-week study. \n \nA meta-analysis of 15 clinical trials of ≥ 12 weeks treatment duration, including 7002 patients \n(4190 CHAMPIX, 2812 placebo), was conducted to systematically assess the cardiovascular safety of \nCHAMPIX. The study in patients with stable cardiovascular disease described above was included in \nthe meta-analysis.  \n \nThe key cardiovascular safety analysis included occurrence and timing of a composite endpoint of \nMajor Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and \nnonfatal stroke. These events included in the endpoint were adjudicated by a blinded, independent \ncommittee. Overall, a small number of MACE occurred during treatment in the trials included in the \nmeta-analysis (CHAMPIX 7 [0.17%]; placebo 2 [0.07%]). Additionally, a small number of MACE \noccurred up to 30 days after treatment (CHAMPIX 13 [0.31%]; placebo 6 [0.21%]). \n\n \nThe meta-analysis showed that exposure to CHAMPIX resulted in a hazard ratio for MACE of 2.83 \n(95% confidence interval from 0.76 to 10.55, p=0.12) for patients during treatment and 1.95 (95% \nconfidence interval from 0.79 to 4.82, p=0.15) for patients up to 30 days after treatment. These are \nequivalent to an estimated increase of 6.5 MACE events and 6.3 MACE events per 1,000 \npatient-years, respectively of exposure. The hazard ratio for MACE was higher in patients with \ncardiovascular risk factors in addition to smoking compared with that in patients without \ncardiovascular risk factors other than smoking. There were similar rates of all-cause mortality \n(CHAMPIX 6 [0.14%]; placebo 7 [0.25%]) and cardiovascular mortality (CHAMPIX 2 [0.05%]; \nplacebo 2 [0.07%]) in the CHAMPIX arms compared with the placebo arms in the meta-analysis. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\nCardiovascular safety assessment study in subjects with and without a history of psychiatric disorder \nThe cardiovascular (CV) safety of CHAMPIX was evaluated in the Study in Subjects with and without \na History of Psychiatric Disorder (parent study; see section 5.1 - Neuropsychiatric safety) and its non-\ntreatment extension, the Cardiovascular Safety Assessment Study, which enrolled 4595 of the 6293 \nsubjects who completed the parent study (N=8058) and followed them through week 52.  Of all \nsubjects treated in the parent study, 1749 (21.7%) had a medium CV risk and 644 (8.0%) had a high \nCV risk, as defined by Framingham score.  \n \nThe primary CV endpoint was the time to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke during treatment. Deaths and \ncardiovascular events were adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee. \n \nThe following table shows the incidence of MACE and Hazard Ratios vs placebo for all treatment \ngroups during treatment, and cumulative for treatment plus 30 days and through end of study. \n \n\n CHAMPIX \nN=2016 \n\nBupropion \nN=2006 \n\nNRT \nN=2022 \n\nPlacebo \nN=2014 \n\nDuring treatment \n\nMACE, n (%) 1 (0.05) 2 (0.10) 1 (0.05) 4 (0.20) \n    Hazard Ratio \n(95% CI) vs \nplacebo \n\n0.29 (0.05, 1.68) 0.50 (0.10, 2.50) 0.29 (0.05, 1.70)  \n\nDuring treatment plus 30 days \nMACE, n (%) 1 (0.05) 2 (0.10) 2 (0.10) 4 (0.20) \n   Hazard Ratio \n(95% CI) vs \nplacebo \n\n0.29 (0.05, 1.70) 0.51 (0.10, 2.51) 0.50 (0.10, 2.48)  \n\nThrough end of study \nMACE, n (%) 3 (0.15) 9 (0.45) 6 (0.30) 8 (0.40) \n   Hazard Ratio \n(95% CI) vs \nplacebo \n\n0.39 (0.12, 1.27) 1.09 (0.42, 2.83) 0.75 (0.26, 2.13)  \n\n \nThe use of CHAMPIX, bupropion, and NRT was not associated with an increased risk of CV AEs in \nsmokers treated for up to 12 weeks and followed for up to 1 year compared to placebo, although \nbecause of the relatively low number of events overall, an association cannot be entirely ruled out.   \n \nSubjects with mild-moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \nThe efficacy and safety of CHAMPIX (1 mg twice daily) for smoking cessation in subjects with  \nmild-moderate COPD was demonstrated in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical \ntrial. In this 52-week duration study, patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a 40-week \nnon-treatment follow-up phase. The primary endpoint of the study was the CO-confirmed, 4-week \nContinuous Quit Rate (4W CQR) from week 9 through week 12 and a key secondary endpoint was the \nContinuous Abstinence (CA) from Week 9 through Week 52. The safety profile of varenicline was \ncomparable to what was reported in other trials in the general population, including pulmonary safety. \nThe results for the 4W CQR (weeks 9 through 12) and CA rate (weeks 9 through 52) are shown in the \nfollowing table: \n \n 4W CQR CA Wk 9-52 \n\nCHAMPIX, (n = 248)  42.3% 18.5% \n\nPlacebo, (n = 251)  8.8% 5.6% \n\nOdds ratio  \n(CHAMPIX vs. Placebo)  \n\n8.40 \np < 0.0001 \n\n4.04 \np < 0.0001 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\nStudy in subjects with a history of major depressive disorder \nThe efficacy of varenicline was confirmed in a randomised placebo-controlled trial in 525 subjects \nwith a history of major depression in the past two years or under current stable treatment. The \ncessation rates in this population were similar to those reported in the general population. Continuous \nabstinence rate between weeks 9-12 was 35.9% in the varenicline treatment group versus 15.6% in the \nplacebo group (OR 3.35 (95% CI 2.16-5.21)) and between weeks 9-52 was 20.3% versus 10.4% \nrespectively (OR 2.36 (95% CI 1.40-3.98)). The most common adverse events (≥ 10%) in subjects \ntaking varenicline were nausea (27.0% vs. 10.4% on placebo), headache (16.8% vs. 11.2%), abnormal \ndreams (11.3% vs. 8.2%), insomnia (10.9% vs. 4.8%) and irritability (10.9% vs. 8.2%). Psychiatric \nscales showed no differences between the varenicline and placebo groups and no overall worsening of \ndepression, or other psychiatric symptoms, during the study in either treatment group. \n \nStudy in subjects with stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder  \nVarenicline safety and tolerability was assessed in a double-blind study of 128 smokers with stable \nschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, on antipsychotic medication, randomised 2:1 to varenicline \n(1 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 weeks with 12-week non-drug follow-up. \n\nThe most common adverse events in subjects taking varenicline were nausea (23.8% vs. 14.0% on \nplacebo), headache (10.7% vs. 18.6% on placebo) and vomiting (10.7% vs. 9.3% on placebo). Among \nreported neuropsychiatric adverse events, insomnia was the only event reported in either treatment \ngroup in ≥ 5% of subjects at a rate higher in the varenicline group than in placebo (9.5% vs. 4.7%).  \n \nOverall, there was no worsening of schizophrenia in either treatment group as measured by psychiatric \nscales and there were no overall changes in extra-pyramidal signs. In the varenicline group compared \nto placebo, a higher proportion of subjects reported suicidal ideation or behaviour prior to enrolment \n(lifetime history) and after the end of active treatment period (on Days 33 to 85 after the last dose of \ntreatment). During the active treatment period, the incidence of suicide-related events was similar \nbetween the varenicline-treated and the placebo-treated subjects (11 vs. 9.3%, respectively). The \npercentage of subjects with suicide-related events in the active treatment phase compared to \npost-treatment phase was unchanged in the varenicline group; in the placebo group, this percentage \nwas lower in the post-treatment phase. Although there were no completed suicides, there was one \nsuicidal attempt in a varenicline-treated subject whose lifetime history included several similar \nattempts. The limited data available from this single smoking cessation study are not sufficient to \nallow for definitive conclusions to be drawn about the safety in patients with schizophrenia or \nschizoaffective disorder. \n \nNeuropsychiatric Safety Study in Subjects with and without a History of Psychiatric Disorder:  \nVarenicline was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled study that \nincluded subjects with a history of psychiatric disorder (psychiatric cohort, N=4074) and subjects \nwithout a history of psychiatric disorder (non-psychiatric cohort, N=3984). Subjects aged 18-75 years, \nsmoking 10 or more cigarettes per day were randomised 1:1:1:1 to varenicline 1 mg BID, bupropion \nSR 150 mg BID, nicotine replacement therapy patch (NRT) 21 mg/day with taper or placebo for a \ntreatment period of 12 weeks; they were then followed for another 12 weeks post-treatment.  \n\nThe primary safety endpoint was a composite of the following neuropsychiatric (NPS) adverse events: \nsevere events of anxiety, depression, feeling abnormal, or hostility, and/or moderate or severe events \nof agitation, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, homicidal ideation, mania, panic, paranoia, \npsychosis, suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviour or completed suicide. \n\nThe following table shows the rates of the composite NPS adverse event primary endpoint by \ntreatment group and the risk differences (RDs) (95% CI) vs placebo in the non-psychiatric cohort. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\nIn addition, the table shows the subset of the composite NPS AE endpoint of severe intensity: \n \n\n \n\nNon-psychiatric Cohort \nN=3984 \n\nVarenicline Bupropion NRT Placebo \nNumber of Patients Treated 990 989 1006 999 \nComposite NPS AE Primary \nEndpoint,  \nn (%) \n\n13 (1.3) \n \n\n22 (2.2) \n \n\n25 (2.5) \n \n\n24 (2.4) \n \n\nRD (95% CI) vs Placebo  -1.28 \n(-2.40, -0.15) \n\n-0.08 \n(-1.37, 1.21) \n\n-0.21           \n(-1.54,1.12) \n\n \n\nComposite NPS AE \nEndpoint of severe intensity \nn (%) \n\n1 (0.1) 4 (0.4) 3 (0.3) 5 (0.5) \n\nAE, adverse event; NRT=Nicotine replacement therapy patch \n\n \nThe rates of events in the composite endpoint were low across all treatment groups and were similar or \nlower for each of the active treatments compared to placebo.

In addition, independent observational studies have not \nsupported an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric events in patients treated with varenicline \ncompared to patients prescribed nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion.  \n\nTreatment discontinuation  \nThe treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 11.4% for varenicline compared with \n9.7% for placebo. In this group, the discontinuation rates for the most common adverse reactions in \nvarenicline treated patients were as follows: nausea (2.7% vs. 0.6% for placebo), headache (0.6% vs. \n1.0% for placebo), insomnia (1.3% vs. 1.2% for placebo), and abnormal dreams (0.2% vs. 0.2% for \nplacebo). \n \nAnalyses of Clinical Trials:  \n \nA meta-analysis of 5 randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trials, including 1907 patients \n(1130 varenicline, 777 placebo), was conducted to assess suicidal ideation and behaviour as reported \non the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). This meta-analysis included one trial \n(N=127) in patients with a history of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and another trial \n(N=525) in patients with a history of depression. The results showed no increase in the incidence of \nsuicidal ideation and/or behaviour in patients treated with varenicline compared to patients treated \nwith placebo, as shown in the table below. Of the 55 patients who reported suicidal ideation or \nbehaviour, 48 (24 varenicline, 24 placebo) were from the two trials that enrolled patients with a history \nof schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder, or of depression. Few patients reported these events in the \nother three trials (4 varenicline, 3 placebo). \n \nNumber of Patients and Risk Ratio for Suicidal Ideation and/or Behaviour Reported on C-SSRS \nfrom a Meta-Analysis of 5 Clinical Trials Comparing Varenicline to Placebo: \n \n\n Varenicline \n(N=1130) \n\nPlacebo \n(N=777) \n\nPatients with suicidal ideation and/or behaviour* [n (%)]** 28 (2.5) 27 (3.5) \n\nPatient-years of exposure 325 217 \nRisk Ratio # (RR; 95% CI) 0.79 (0.46, 1.36) \n* Of these, one patient in each treatment arm reported suicidal behaviour \n\n** Patients with events up to 30 days after treatment; % are not weighted by study \n\n# RR of incidence rates per 100 patient years \n\n \nA meta-analysis of 18 double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials was conducted to \nassess the neuropsychiatric safety of varenicline. These trials included the 5 trials described above that \nused the C-SSRS, and a total of 8521 patients (5072 varenicline, 3449 placebo), some of which had \npsychiatric conditions. The results showed a similar incidence of combined neuropsychiatric adverse \nevents, other than sleep disorders, in patients treated with varenicline compared to patients treated with \nplacebo, with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89-1.15). Pooled data from these 18 trials showed a \nsimilar incidence rate of individual categories of psychiatric events in patients treated with varenicline \ncompared to patients treated with placebo. The table below describes the most frequently (≥ 1%) \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\nreported categories of adverse events related to psychiatric safety other than sleep disorders and \ndisturbances. \n \nPsychiatric Adverse Events Occurring in ≥ 1% of Patients from Pooled Data from 18 Clinical \nTrials:  \n \n\n Varenicline \n(N=5072) \n\nPlacebo \n(N=3449) \n\nAnxiety disorders and symptoms 253 (5.0) 206 (6.0) \nDepressed mood disorders and disturbances 179 (3.5) 108 (3.1) \nMood disorders and disturbances NEC* 116 (2.3) 53 (1.5) \n* NEC = Not Elsewhere Classified \n\nCounts (percentages) corresponds to the number of patients reporting the event \n \nObservational Studies \n \nFour observational studies, each including 10,000 to 30,000 users of varenicline in the adjusted \nanalyses, compared the risk of serious neuropsychiatric events, including neuropsychiatric \nhospitalizations and fatal and non-fatal self-harm, in patients treated with varenicline versus patients \nprescribed NRT or bupropion. All studies were retrospective cohort studies and included patients with \nand without a psychiatric history. All studies used statistical methods to control for confounding \nfactors, including preferential prescribing of varenicline to healthier patients, although there is the \npossibility of residual confounding. \n\nTwo of the studies found no difference in risk of neuropsychiatric hospitalisations between varenicline \nusers and nicotine patch users (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.56–2.34 in \nthe first study, and 0.76; 95% CI: 0.40-1.46 in the second study). The power to detect differences in \nthese two studies was limited. The third study reported no difference in risk of psychiatric adverse \nevents diagnosed during an emergency department visit or inpatient admission between varenicline \nusers and bupropion users (HR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.55-1.30). Based on post marketing reports, bupropion \nmay be associated with neuropsychiatric adverse events. \n\nThe fourth study showed no evidence of a higher risk of fatal and non-fatal self- harm (HR of 0.88; \n95% CI: 0.52-1.49) in patients prescribed varenicline compared to patients prescribed NRT. The \noccurrence of detected suicide was rare during the three months after patients initiated any drug \ntreatment (two cases in 31,260 varenicline users and six cases in 81,545 NRT users). \n \nPregnancy Cohort Study \n \nA population-based cohort study compared infants exposed to CHAMPIX in utero (N=335) with \ninfants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy (N=78,412) and infants born to non-smoking \nmothers (N=806,438). In this study, infants exposed to CHAMPIX in utero as compared to infants \nborn to mothers who smoked during pregnancy had lower rates of congenital malformations \n(3.6% vs 4.3%), stillbirth (0.3% vs 0.5%), preterm birth (7.5% vs 7.9%), small for gestational age \n(12.5% vs 17.1%), and premature rupture of membrane (3.6% vs 5.4%).  \n \nPaediatric Population \n \nThe efficacy and safety of varenicline was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled study of 312 patients aged 12 to 19 years, who smoked an average of at least \n5 cigarettes per day during the 30 days prior to recruitment, and had a score of at least 4 on the \nFagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence scale. Patients were stratified by age (12-16 years of age \nand 17-19 years of age) and by body weight (≤55 kg and >55 kg). Following two-week titration, \npatients randomised to varenicline with a body weight >55 kg received 1 mg twice daily (high dose \ngroup) or 0.5 mg twice daily (low dose group), while patients with a body weight ≤55 kg received \n0.5 mg twice daily (high dose group) or 0.5 mg once daily (low dose group). Patients received \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\ntreatment for 12 weeks, followed by a non-treatment period of 40 weeks, along with age-appropriate \ncounseling throughout the study. \n \nThe following table from the above paediatric study shows a comparison of continuous abstinence \nrates (CAR) from weeks 9-12, confirmed by urine cotinine test, for the full analysis set overall study \npopulation and the 12-17 year old population. \n \nCAR 9-12 (%) Overall \n\nn/N (%) \n12-to-17-Year Olds \n\nn/N (%) \nHigh-Dose Varenicline 22/109 (20.2%) 15/80 (18.8%) \nLow-Dose Varenicline 28/103 (27.2%) 25/78 (32.1%) \nPlacebo 18/100 (18.0%) 13/76 (17.1%) \nTreatment Comparisons Odds ratio in CAR 9-12 (95% CI) [p-value]  \nHigh-Dose Varenicline vs Placebo 1.18 (0.59, 2.37) [0.6337] 1.13 (0.50, 2.56) [0.7753] \nLow-Dose Varenicline vs Placebo 1.73 (0.88, 3.39) [0.1114] 2.28 (1.06, 4.89) [0.0347]* \n* This p value is not considered statistically significant.

Following administration of multiple oral doses to healthy volunteers, steady-state \nconditions were reached within 4 days. Absorption is virtually complete after oral administration and \nsystemic availability is high. Oral bioavailability of varenicline is unaffected by food or time-of-day \ndosing. \n \nDistribution \n \nVarenicline distributes into tissues, including the brain. Apparent volume of distribution averaged \n415 litres (%CV= 50) at steady-state. Plasma protein binding of varenicline is low (< 20%) and \nindependent of both age and renal function. In rodents, varenicline is transferred through the placenta \nand excreted in milk.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nVarenicline undergoes minimal metabolism with 92% excreted unchanged in the urine and less than \n10% excreted as metabolites. Minor metabolites in urine include varenicline N-carbamoylglucuronide \nand hydroxyvarenicline. In circulation, varenicline comprises 91% of drug-related material. Minor \ncirculating metabolites include varenicline N-carbamoylglucuronide and N-glucosylvarenicline. \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes \n(IC50 > 6,400 ng/ml). The P450 enzymes tested for inhibition were: 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, \n2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline was shown to not induce the \nactivity of cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. Therefore, varenicline is unlikely to alter the \npharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\nElimination \n \nThe elimination half-life of varenicline is approximately 24 hours. Renal elimination of varenicline is \nprimarily through glomerular filtration along with active tubular secretion via the organic cationic \ntransporter, OCT2 (see section 4.5). \n \nLinearity/Non linearity \n \nVarenicline exhibits linear kinetics when given as single (0.1 to 3 mg) or repeated 1 to 3 mg/day \ndoses. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient populations \n \nThere are no clinically meaningful differences in varenicline pharmacokinetics due to age, race, \ngender, smoking status, or use of concomitant medicinal products, as demonstrated in specific \npharmacokinetic studies and in population pharmacokinetic analyses. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDue to the absence of significant hepatic metabolism, varenicline pharmacokinetics should be \nunaffected in patients with hepatic impairment. (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nVarenicline pharmacokinetics were unchanged in subjects with mild renal impairment (estimated \ncreatinine clearance > 50 ml/min and  80 ml/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment \n(estimated creatinine clearance  30 ml/min and  50 ml/min), varenicline exposure increased 1.5-fold \ncompared with subjects with normal renal function (estimated creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min). In \nsubjects with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), varenicline \nexposure was increased 2.1-fold. In subjects with end-stage-renal disease (ESRD), varenicline was \nefficiently removed by haemodialysis (see section 4.2).  \n \nElderly  \nThe pharmacokinetics of varenicline in elderly patients with normal renal function (aged 65-75 years) \nis similar to that of younger adult subjects (see section 4.2). For elderly patients with reduced renal \nfunction please refer to section 4.2. \n \nPaediatric population  \nSingle and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of varenicline have been investigated in paediatric patients \naged 12 to 17 years old (inclusive) and were approximately dose-proportional over the 0.5 mg to 2 mg \ndaily dose range studied. Steady-state systemic exposure in adolescent patients of bodyweight > 55 kg, \nas assessed by AUC (0-24), was comparable to that noted for the same doses in the adult population. \nWhen 0.5 mg twice daily was given, steady-state daily exposure of varenicline was, on average, higher \n(by approximately 40%) in adolescent patients with bodyweight ≤ 55 kg compared to that noted in the \nadult population. CHAMPIX is not recommended in paediatric patients because its efficacy in this \npopulation was not demonstrated (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, fertility and embryo-foetal development. In male \nrats dosed for 2 years with varenicline, there was a dose-related increase in the incidence of hibernoma \n(tumour of the brown fat). In the offspring of pregnant rats treated with varenicline there were \ndecreases in fertility and increases in the auditory startle response (see section 4.6). These effects were \nobserved only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure \nindicating little relevance to clinical use.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What CHAMPIX is and what it is used for \n \nCHAMPIX contains the active substance varenicline. CHAMPIX is a medicine which is used in adults \nto help them stop smoking. \n \nCHAMPIX can help to relieve the craving and withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping \nsmoking.  \n \nCHAMPIX can also reduce the enjoyment of cigarettes if you do smoke when on treatment. \n  \n \n2. What you need to know before you take CHAMPIX \n \nDo not take CHAMPIX: \n \n- If you are allergic to varenicline or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking CHAMPIX. \n \nThere have been reports of depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour and suicide attempts in patients \ntaking CHAMPIX. If you are taking CHAMPIX and develop agitation, depressed mood, changes in \nbehaviour that are of concern to you or your family or if you develop suicidal thoughts or behaviours \nyou should stop taking CHAMPIX and contact your doctor immediately for treatment assessment. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n122 \n\nThe effects of stopping smoking \nThe effects of changes in your body resulting from stopping smoking, with or without treatment with \nCHAMPIX, may alter the way other medicines work. Therefore, in some cases an adjustment of the \ndose may be necessary. See below under ‘Other medicines and CHAMPIX’ for further details. \n \nFor some people, stopping smoking with or without treatment has been associated with an increased \nrisk of experiencing changes in thinking or behaviour, feelings of depression and anxiety and can be \nassociated with a worsening of psychiatric disorder. If you have a history of psychiatric disorder you \nshould discuss this with your doctor.  \n \nHeart symptoms \nNew or worse heart or blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems have been reported primarily in people \nwho already have cardiovascular problems. Tell your doctor if you have any changes in symptoms \nduring treatment with CHAMPIX. Get emergency medical help right away if you have symptoms of a \nheart attack or stroke.  \n \nSeizures \nTell your doctor if you have experienced seizures or have epilepsy before your start CHAMPIX \ntreatment. Some people have reported seizures while taking CHAMPIX.  \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nStop taking CHAMPIX and tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following signs \nand symptoms that may indicate a serious allergic reaction: swelling of the face, lips, tongue, gums, \nthroat or body and/or difficulty breathing, wheezing.  \n \nSkin reactions \nPotentially life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Erythema Multiforme) have \nbeen reported with the use of CHAMPIX. If you develop a rash or if your skin starts to peel or blister \nyou should stop taking CHAMPIX and seek emergency medical help. \n  \nChildren and adolescents \nCHAMPIX is not recommended for use in paediatric patients as efficacy was not demonstrated. \n \nOther medicines and CHAMPIX \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIn some cases as a result of stopping smoking, with or without CHAMPIX, an adjustment of the dose \nof other medicines may be necessary. Examples include theophylline (a medicine to treat breathing \nproblems), warfarin (a medicine to reduce blood clotting), and insulin (a medicine to treat diabetes). If \nin doubt, you should consult your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you have severe kidney disease you should avoid taking cimetidine (a medicine used for gastric \nproblems) at the same time as CHAMPIX as this may cause increased blood levels of CHAMPIX.  \n \nUse of CHAMPIX with other therapies for smoking cessation \nConsult your doctor before using CHAMPIX in combination with other smoking cessation therapies. \n \nCHAMPIX with food and drink \nThere have been some reports of increased intoxicating effects of alcohol in patients taking \nCHAMPIX. However, it is not known if CHAMPIX actually increases alcohol intoxication.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nIt is preferable to avoid the use of CHAMPIX while you are pregnant. Talk to your doctor if you are \nintending to become pregnant. \n\n\n\n \n\n123 \n\n \nAlthough it was not studied, CHAMPIX may pass into breast milk. You should ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking CHAMPIX. \n \nDriving and using machines \nCHAMPIX may be linked with dizziness, sleepiness and transient loss of consciousness. You should \nnot drive, operate complex machinery or engage in any other potentially hazardous activities until you \nknow whether this medicine affects your ability to perform these activities. \n \n \n3. How to take CHAMPIX \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nYou are more likely to stop smoking if you are motivated to stop. Your doctor and pharmacist can \nprovide advice, support and sources of further information to help ensure your attempt to stop smoking \nis successful. \n \nBefore starting your course of CHAMPIX you should usually decide on a date in the second week of \ntreatment (between day 8 and day 14) when you will stop smoking. If you are not willing or able to set \na target quit date within 2 weeks, you may choose your own target quit date within 5 weeks after \nstarting treatment. You should write this date on the pack as a reminder.  \n \nCHAMPIX comes as a white tablet (0.5 mg) and a light blue tablet (1 mg). You start with the white \ntablet and then usually go to the light blue tablet. See the chart below for the usual dosing instructions \nwhich you should follow from Day 1. \n \n\nWeek 1 Dose \nDay 1 - 3 From day 1 to day 3, you should take one white CHAMPIX 0.5 mg film-coated tablet once \n\na day. \n \n\nDay 4 - 7 From day 4 to day 7, you should take one white CHAMPIX 0.5 mg film-coated tablet twice \ndaily, once in the morning and once in the evening, at about the same time each day. \n\n \nWeek 2  \nDay 8 – 14  From day 8 to day 14, you should take one light blue CHAMPIX 1 mg film-coated tablet \n\ntwice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, at about the same time each day. \n \n\n \nWeeks 3 - 12  \nDay 15 -  \nend of \ntreatment \n\nFrom day 15 until the end of treatment, you should take one light blue CHAMPIX 1 mg \nfilm-coated tablet twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, at about the \nsame time each day. \n \n\n \nAfter 12 weeks of treatment, if you have stopped smoking, your doctor may recommend an additional \n12 weeks of treatment with CHAMPIX 1 mg film-coated tablets twice daily to help avoid returning \nback to smoking. \n \nIf you are not able or willing to quit smoking straight away, you should reduce smoking during the \nfirst 12 weeks of treatment and quit by the end of that treatment period. You should then continue to \ntake CHAMPIX 1 mg film-coated tablets twice daily for a further 12 weeks resulting in a total of \n24 weeks of treatment. \n \nShould you experience adverse effects that you cannot tolerate your doctor may decide to reduce your \ndose temporarily or permanently to 0.5 mg twice daily.  \n\n\n\n \n\n124 \n\n \nIf you have problems with your kidneys, you should speak to your doctor before taking CHAMPIX. \nYou may need a lower dose. \n  \nChampix is for oral use. \nThe tablets should be swallowed whole with water and can be taken with or without food. \n \nIf you take more CHAMPIX than you should \nIf you accidentally take more CHAMPIX than your doctor prescribed, you must seek medical advice \nor go to the nearest hospital casualty department immediately. Take your box of tablets with you. \n \nIf you forget to take CHAMPIX  \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. It is important that you take CHAMPIX \nregularly at the same time each day. If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If, it \nis within 3-4 hours before your next dose, do not take the tablet that you have missed.  \n \nIf you stop taking CHAMPIX \nIt has been shown in clinical trials that taking all doses of your medicine at the appropriate times and \nfor the recommended duration of treatment described above will increase your chances of stopping \nsmoking. Therefore, unless your doctor instructs you to stop treatment, it is important to keep taking \nCHAMPIX, according to the instructions described in the table above. \n \nIn smoking cessation therapy, risk of returning to smoking may be elevated in the period immediately \nfollowing the end of treatment. You may temporarily experience increased irritability, urge to smoke, \ndepression and/or sleep disturbances when you stop taking CHAMPIX. Your doctor may decide to \ngradually lower your dose of CHAMPIX at the end of treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
