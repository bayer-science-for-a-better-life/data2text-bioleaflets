This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nBesremi 250 micrograms/0.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen \nBesremi 500 micrograms/0.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nBesremi 250 micrograms/0.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen \nEach pre-filled pen of 0.5 mL solution contains 250 micrograms of ropeginterferon alfa-2b as \nmeasured on a protein basis, corresponding to 500 micrograms/mL. \n \nBesremi 500 micrograms/0.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen \nEach pre-filled pen of 0.5 mL solution contains 500 micrograms of ropeginterferon alfa-2b as \nmeasured on a protein basis, corresponding to 1,000 micrograms/mL. \n \nThe strength indicates the quantity of the interferon alpha-2b moiety of ropeginterferon alfa-2b \nwithout consideration of the pegylation. \n \nRopeginterferon alfa-2b is a covalent conjugate of the protein interferon alpha-2b, produced in \nEscherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA technology, with a methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG) \nmoiety. \n \nThe potency of this medicinal product should not be compared to that of another pegylated or non-\npegylated protein of the same therapeutic class (see section 5.1). \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach pre-filled pen contains 10 mg benzyl alcohol per mL. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in pre-filled pen (injection). \n \nClear, colourless to pale yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBesremi is indicated as monotherapy in adults for the treatment of polycythaemia vera without \nsymptomatic splenomegaly. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the management of the \ndisease. \n \nPosology \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nTitration phase \nThe dose is titrated individually with a recommended starting dose of 100 micrograms (or \n50 micrograms in patients under another cytoreductive therapy). The dose should be gradually \nincreased by 50 micrograms every two weeks (in parallel, other cytoreductive therapy should be \ndecreased gradually, as appropriate) until stabilisation of the haematological parameters is achieved \n(haematocrit <45%, platelets <400 x 109/L and leukocytes <10 x 109/L). The maximum recommended \nsingle dose is 500 micrograms injected every two weeks.  \n \nMaintenance phase \nThe dose at which stabilisation of the haematological parameters is achieved should be maintained in a \ntwo week administration interval for at least 1.5 years. After that, the dose may be adapted and/or the \nadministration interval prolonged up to every four weeks, as appropriate for the patient. \n \nIf adverse events develop during therapy, the administered dose should be reduced or treatment \ndiscontinued temporarily until adverse events abate; further, treatment should be re-initiated with a \nlower dose than the dose that caused adverse events. \nIf an increase of haematological parameters (haematocrit, platelets, leukocytes) is observed, the dose \nand/or dosing interval needs to be adapted individually.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with compensated cirrhosis (i.e. Child-Pugh A), another pegylated interferon alfa medicinal \nproduct (pegylated interferon alfa-2a) has been shown to be safe. No ropeginterferon alfa-2b dose \nadjustment is required for adult patients with mild liver impairment. \nThe use of interferon alfa has not been evaluated in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e. Child-\nPugh B or C) and is contraindicated in these patients (see section 4.3). \nIncreased liver enzyme levels have been observed in patients treated with ropeginterferon alfa-2b. \nWhen the increase in liver enzyme levels is progressive and persistent, the dose should be reduced. If \nthe increase in liver enzymes is progressive and clinically significant despite dose reduction, or if there \nis evidence of hepatic decompensation, therapy should be discontinued (see section 4.4).  \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of other interferon alfa medicinal products (pegylated interferon alfa-2a \nand pegylated interferon alfa-2b) was evaluated in renal impaired patients (see section 5.2).  \nNo dose adjustment for ropeginterferon alfa-2b is required for adult patients with mild (GFR 60-\n89 mL/min) or moderate (GFR 30-59 mL/min) renal impairment. A reduced starting dose for \nropeginterferon alfa-2b of 50 micrograms is recommended for patients with severe (GFR 15-\n29 mL/min) renal impairment. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is contraindicated in patients with end stage \nrenal disease (GFR <15 mL/min) (see section 4.3). \n \nElderly \nAdjustments in the recommended dose for ropeginterferon alfa-2b are not necessary when starting \ntherapy in elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nObese or underweighted patients \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of ropeginterferon alfa-2b has not been determined in obese and \nunderweighted patients. No recommendation on dose adjustment for ropeginterferon alfa-2b can be \ngiven for these patients.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Besremi in children and adolescents has not been established. No data are \navailable (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration  \n\n\n\n4 \n\nFor subcutaneous use. The medicinal product is intended for long-term treatment and can be \nadministered by a physician, nurse, family member or patient when trained in the administration of \nsubcutaneous injections with the pre-filled pen. The instructions for use in the package leaflet should \nbe followed. \n \nThe recommended injection site is the abdominal skin around but not within 5 cm of the navel or the \nthigh. Do not inject into an area where the skin is irritated, reddened, bruised, infected or scarred. The \npen can be adjusted to administer doses in 50 microgram intervals in the range of 50 to \n250 micrograms or 50 to 500 micrograms.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment \n• Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric disorders, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicide attempt \n• Severe pre-existing cardiovascular disease, (i.e. uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart \n\nfailure (≥ NYHA class 2), serious cardiac arrhythmia, significant coronary artery stenosis, \nunstable angina) or recent stroke or myocardial infarction \n\n• History or presence of autoimmune disease \n• Immunosuppressed transplant recipients  \n• Combination with telbivudine (see section 4.5) \n• Decompensated cirrhosis of the liver (Child-Pugh B or C) \n• End stage renal disease (GFR <15 mL/min) \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDose titration phase \nThe recommended posology for the titration phase of ropeginterferon alfa-2b (see section 4.2) results \nin a prolonged time to reach the individual optimal dose compared to hydroxycarbamide. In a clinical \nstudy in polycythaemia vera, the end of the mean individual titration phase for ropeginterferon alfa-2b \nwas reached after approximately 3.7 months, for hydroxycarbamide after approximately 2.6 months of \ntreatment. Thus, other products (e.g. hydroxycarbamide) may be preferred in patients for whom an \nearly reduction in elevated blood counts is necessary to prevent thrombosis and bleeding. \n \nDuring the titration phase the efficacy to reduce the cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk of the \nunderlying disease may not be fully established. Patients should be closely monitored, in particular \nduring the titration phase; complete blood counts including determination of haematocrit level, \nleukocyte and platelet counts should be performed regularly also after the individual optimal dose has \nbeen established. Phlebotomy as rescue treatment to normalise blood hyperviscosity may be necessary.  \n \nEndocrine system \nBefore ropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy, any pre-existing thyroid disease needs to be treated and \ncontrolled with conventional therapy (see section 4.3). Patients who develop symptoms indicative of a \nthyroid dysfunction during ropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy, should evaluate their thyroid stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels. If TSH levels can be controlled within the normal range, the therapy can be \ncontinued. \n \nDiabetes mellitus have been observed with other interferon alfa medicinal products (see section 4.8). \nPatients with this condition who cannot be effectively controlled by medicinal products should not \nbegin ropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy. Patients who develop this condition during treatment and \ncannot be controlled by medicinal products should discontinue ropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy. \n \nCentral nervous system (CNS) \nCNS effects, in particular depression, have been observed in some patients treated with \nropeginterferon alfa-2b during the clinical development program (see section 4.8). Other CNS effects, \n\n\n\n5 \n\nincluding suicidal ideation, attempted suicide, aggression, bipolar disorder, mania and confusion have \nbeen observed with other interferon alfa medicinal products. Patients should be closely monitored for \nany symptoms of psychiatric disorders and therapeutic management should be considered by the \ntreating physician if such symptoms emerge. If psychiatric symptoms worsen, it is recommended to \ndiscontinue ropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b must not be administered in \npatients with existence of or history of severe psychiatric disorders, particularly severe depression, \nsuicidal ideation or suicide attempt (see section 4.3). \n \nCardiovascular system \nCardiac events including cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation and ischaemic \ncoronary artery disorders have been associated with interferon alfa treatment (see section 4.8). Patients \nwith pre-existing or a history of cardiovascular disorders should be closely monitored during \nropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy. This medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with severe pre-\nexisting cardiovascular disease or patients who had recently suffered from a stroke or myocardial \ninfarction (see section 4.3). \n \nRespiratory system \nRespiratory disorders such as lung infiltration, pneumonitis, pneumonia or pulmonary arterial \nhypertension have been observed rarely in patients treated with interferon alfa (see section 4.8). \nPatients who develop respiratory symptoms should be monitored closely and if necessary, \nropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy should be discontinued. \n \nVisual system \nSevere eye disorders such as retinopathy, retinal haemorrhage, retinal exudates, retinal detachment and \nretinal artery or vein occlusion which may result in blindness have been observed rarely in patients \ntreated with interferon alfa (see section 4.8). Patients should have eye examinations before and during \nropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy, specifically in those patients with retinopathy associated disease such \nas diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Any patient reporting a decrease or loss of vision or reporting \nother eye symptoms should have an immediate eye examination. Discontinuation of ropeginterferon \nalfa-2b should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening eye disorders. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity \nSerious, acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, \nanaphylaxis) have been rarely observed with other interferon alfa medicinal products. If this occurs, \nropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy must be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy instituted \nimmediately. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. \n \nLiver function \nInterferon alfa therapy has been associated with hepatotoxicity characterized by potentially significant \nincreases in liver enzymes. Hepatic failure in hepatitis C virus infected patients was reported with \nother interferon alfa medicinal products (see section 4.8).  \nIncreases in ALT (≥3 times the upper limit of normal), AST (≥3 times the upper limit of normal), \nGGT (≥3 times the upper limit of normal) and bilirubin (>2 times the upper limit of normal) levels \nhave been observed in patients treated with ropeginterferon alfa-2b. These elevations were mostly \ntransient and occurred during the first treatment year.  \nLiver disorders have been reported in patients after long-term ropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy (see \nsection 4.8). Liver enzymes and hepatic function should be regularly controlled in patients with long-\nterm ropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy. Treatment with ropeginterferon alfa-2b should be discontinued \nwhen, despite dose reduction, the increase in liver enzyme levels is progressive and clinically \nsignificant. In patients who develop evidence of hepatic decompensation during treatment, \nropeginterferon alfa-2b should be discontinued. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is contraindicated in patients \nwith decompensated cirrhosis of the liver (see section 4.3). \n \nRenal function \nRegardless of the starting dose or degree of renal impairment, patients should be monitored. If renal \nfunction decreases during treatment, ropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy should be discontinued. \nRopeginterferon alfa-2b is contraindicated in patients with end stage renal disease (see section 4.3). \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nDental and periodontal disorders \nDental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported with other \ninterferon alfa medicinal products (see section 4.8). In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging \neffect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with ropeginterferon \nalfa-2b. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. \n \nSkin disorders \nThe use of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is associated with skin disorders (pruritus, alopecia, rash, erythema, \npsoriasis, xeroderma, dermatitis acneiform, hyperkeratosis, hyperhydrosis). In case of appearance or \nworsening of this skin disorders, the stop of the treatment must be envisaged. \n \nExcipients \nBesremi contains benzyl alcohol. \nHigh volumes should be used with caution and only if necessary, especially in subjects with liver or \nkidney impairment because of the risk of accumulation and toxicity (metabolic acidosis).  \n \nBesremi contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEnzymes of the protein catabolism are considered to be involved in the metabolism of ropeginterferon \nalfa-2b. The involvement of transport proteins in absorption, distribution and elimination of \nropeginterferon alfa-2b is not known. Interferon alfa has shown to influence the activity of cytochrome \nP450 (CYP) isozymes CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.  \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with ropeginterferon alfa-2b. \n \nInteraction studies of other pegylated interferon alfa medicinal products \nCo-administration of pegylated interferon alfa-2a with telbivudine in patients with hepatitis B \nincreased the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. A combination therapy with telbivudine and \nropeginterferon alfa-2b is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  \n \nAdministration of 180 micrograms of pegylated interferon alfa-2a once weekly for 4 weeks in healthy \nmale subjects did not show any effect on mephenytoin, dapsone, debrisoquine and tolbutamide \npharmacokinetics profiles, suggesting that pegylated interferon alfa-2a has no effect on in vivo \nmetabolic activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 isozymes. In the same study, \na 25% increase in the AUC of theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate) was observed, demonstrating that \npegylated interferon alfa-2a is an inhibitor of CYP1A2 activity. \n \nCo-administration of pegylated interferon alfa-2b showed no significant interaction with tolbutamide \n(CYP2C9 substrate), midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), dapsone (N-acetyltransferase substrate) and \nmodestly increased the exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) and desipramine (CYP2D6 \nsubstrate). \n \nTherefore, care should be taken when ropeginterferon alfa-2b is co-administered with CYP1A2 \nsubstrates notably those having a narrow therapeutic margin such as theophylline or methadone. \nLikewise, caution is recommended with CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. vortioxetine, risperidone) combined \nwith ropeginterferon alfa-2b. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b may inhibit the activity of CYP1A2 and \nCYP2D6 and thus may increase the blood concentrations of these medicinal products.  \n \nNo dose adaptions for ropeginterferon alfa-2b should be necessary when concomitantly administered \nwith medicinal products metabolised via CYP2C9/19, CYP3A4 or by N-acetyltransferase.  \n \nCaution must be exercised when administering ropeginterferon alfa-2b in combination with other \npotentially myelosuppressive/chemotherapeutic agents. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nNarcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with \nropeginterferon alfa-2b. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in females \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during the treatment with \nropeginterferon alfa-2b, unless otherwise discussed with the physician. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of interferon alfa in pregnant women.  \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). An abortifacient effect was \nreported in primates receiving other interferon alfa medicinal products. \nAs ropeginterferon alfa-2b may have the same effect, this medicinal product is not recommended \nduring pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether the active substance of the medicinal product is excreted in human milk. A risk \nto the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-\nfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from ropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy taking into account the benefit \nof breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effect of ropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy on the fertility of females or males.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBesremi has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients who experience \ndizziness, somnolence or hallucination (see section 4.8) during Besremi therapy should avoid driving \nor using machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most common adverse reactions are leukopenia (19.1%), thrombocytopenia (18.5%), arthralgia \n(12.9%), fatigue (12.4%), increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (11.2%), influenza like illness \n(10.7%), myalgia (10.7%), pyrexia (8.4%), pruritus (8.4%), increased alanine aminotransferase \n(8.4%), anaemia (7.9%), pain in extremity (6.7%), alopecia (6.7%), neutropenia (6.7%), increased \naspartate aminotransferase (6.2%), headache (6.2%), diarrhoea (5.6%), chills (5.1%), dizziness (5.1%) \nand injection site reaction (5.1%).  \nSerious adverse reactions are depression (1.1%), atrial fibrillation (1.1%) and acute stress disorder \n(0.6%).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nFollowing treatment-related adverse reactions were reported with ropeginterferon alfa-2b in clinical \nstudies in 178 polycythaemia vera adult patients.

The most common \ngastrointestinal disorders reported in these studies were diarrhoea (5.1%; incidence rate: 2.8 \n[events/100 patients per year]) and nausea (4.5%; incidence rate: 1.6 events/100 patients per year]). \n \nCNS \nIn the clinical development program of ropeginterferon alfa-2b, two cases of serious depression (1.1%; \nincidence rate: 0.4 events/100 patients per year) occurred. The patients recovered completely after \npermanent medicinal product discontinuation. One patient who experienced serious acute stress \ndisorder (0.6%; incidence rate: 0.2 events/100 patients per year) with moderate intensity recovered \ncompletely after the dose of ropeginterferon alfa-2b was reduced. CNS effects including suicide \nattempt, suicidal ideation, aggression, bipolar disorder, mania and confusion have been reported with \ninterferon alfa (see section 4.4). \n \nCardiovascular system \nDuring ropeginterferon alfa-2b therapy, three cases of atrial fibrillation (1.1%; incidence rate: \n0.5 events/100 patients per year) with intensity grade 1 to 3 occurred in two patients. Ropeginterferon \nalfa-2b treatment was continued and the patients received appropriate medicinal products to treat these \nevents. Patients recovered from the two events, one event was ongoing at the time of assessment.  \n \nRespiratory system \nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa, notably in \npatients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV infection, cirrhosis). Events were \nreported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with interferon alfa. \n \nVisual system \nSerious eye disorders have been reported with interferon alfa such as retinopathy, retinal haemorrhage, \nretinal exudates, retinal detachment and retinal artery or vein occlusion (see section 4.4).  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDuring the clinical study program, one accidental case of overdose has been reported with \nropeginterferon alfa-2b. The patient received a 10-time higher starting dose as recommended and \ndeveloped flu-like symptoms for three days which were rated as non-serious. The patient recovered \ncompletely after paracetamol administration and temporary discontinuation of ropeginterferon alfa-2b \ntherapy.  \nThere is no antidote for the medicinal product available. In case of an overdose, close monitoring of \nthe patient and symptomatic treatment, if necessary, are recommended.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, interferons, ATC code: L03AB15 \n \nRopeginterferon alfa-2b is a recombinant interferon alfa-2b conjugated with a two-arm \nmethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG) at a degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. \nThe average molecular mass is approximately 60 kDa, of which the PEG moiety constitutes \napproximately 40 kDa . \n \nMechanism of action \nInterferon alfa belongs to the class of type I interferons which exhibit their cellular effects by binding \nto a transmembrane receptor termed interferon alfa receptor (IFNAR). Binding to IFNAR initiates a \ndownstream signalling cascade through the activation of kinases, in particular Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) \nand tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Nuclear translocation of \nSTAT proteins controls distinct gene-expression programs and exhibit various cellular effects. \nInterferon alfa was shown to have an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of hematopoietic and bone \nmarrow fibroblast progenitor cells and antagonised the action of growth factors and other cytokines \nthat have a role in the development of myelofibrosis. These actions may be involved in the therapeutic \neffects of interferon alfa in polycythaemia vera. \nFurther, it was demonstrated that interferon alfa is able to decrease the mutated JAK2V617F allele \nburden in patients with polycythaemia vera (a V617F point mutation in the JAK2 kinase is a hallmark \nof polycythaemia vera and is present in approximately 95% of patients).  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nAn open label, randomised phase III study (PROUD-PV) evaluated the efficacy and safety of \nropeginterferon alfa-2b in comparison to hydroxycarbamide in 254 adult polycythaemia vera patients \n(randomisation 1:1). Patients were stratified by previous exposure to hydroxycarbamide, age at \nscreening (≤60 or >60 years) and presence of thromboembolic events in the past. Characteristics of the \nstudy population are presented in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2.

The dose was gradually increased \ndepending on disease response and tolerability (for ropeginterferon alfa-2b, from 50 to \n\n\n\n12 \n\n500 micrograms administered subcutaneously every two weeks). The mean dose after 12 months of \ntreatment was 382 (±141) micrograms for ropeginterferon alfa-2b.  \nThe disease response (defined as haematocrit <45% without phlebotomy [at least 3 months since last \nphlebotomy], platelets <400 x 109/L and leukocytes <10 x 109/L after 12 months of treatment) was \n43.1% [53/123 of patients] in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm after 12 months of treatment. \n \nAn open-label, phase IIIb extension study (CONTINUATION-PV) enrolled 171 adult polycythaemia \nvera patients who previously completed the PROUD-PV Study to evaluate the long-term efficacy and \nsafety of ropeginterferon alfa-2b. Ninety-five patients continued to receive ropeginterferon alfa-2b \n(from 50 to 500 micrograms administered subcutaneously every two, three or four weeks). The mean \ndose after 36 months of treatment (12-month treatment duration in the PROUD-PV Study and 24-\nmonth treatment duration in the extension study) was 363 (±149) micrograms for ropeginterferon alfa-\n2b.  \nThe response to ropeginterferon alfa-2b treatment is presented in Table 3 and Table 4. After 36 \nmonths of treatment, the complete haematological response was 70.5%. Almost 50% of patients \nshowed a complete haematological response with an improvement in disease burden after 36 months \nof treatment. Patients showed a statistically significant difference in the JAK2V617F allele burden \n(19.7%) and JAK2V617F allele change from baseline (-22.9%).  \n \nTable 3.

Thus, no valid estimation of the absolute bioavailability could be done. Based \non data in monkeys, it is approx. 80%, similar to that seen for pegylated interferon alfa-2a. \n \nDistribution \nRopeginterferon alfa-2b is found mainly in the bloodstream and extracellular fluid as seen by the \nvolume of distribution at steady-state (Vd) of 6.6 to 17 litres in patients after subcutaneous \nadministration (dose range 50 – 450 micrograms). Mean Cmax was 2.4 ng/mL (with a dose of 50 – \n80 micrograms) to 49 ng/mL (with a dose of 450 micrograms) and AUC0-t ranged from 28.5 ng.h/mL \n(with a dose of 50 – 80 micrograms) to 552.6 ng.h/mL (with a dose of 450 micrograms) in patients \nafter subcutaneous multiple dose administration. Inter-subject variability was observed with 25% and \n35% for AUC and Cmax, respectively, in healthy volunteers. \n \nFrom mass balance, tissue distribution and whole body autoradioluminography studies performed in \nrats, it was shown that a similar interferon alfa medicinal product (pegylated interferon alfa-2a) was \ndistributed to the liver, kidney and bone marrow in addition to being highly concentrated in the blood. \n \nBiotransformation \nThe metabolism of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is not fully characterised. The attachment of interferon \nalfa-2b to a high molecular weight (40 kDa) branched polyethylene glycol moiety is considered as the \nmain reason for the differences in the elimination compared to unpegylated interferons. Studies in rats \nwith a similar interferon alfa medicinal product (pegylated interferon alfa-2a) showed a primarily \nelimination via hepatic metabolism. The same elimination route is considered for ropeginterferon \nalfa-2b. \n \nPharmacokinetic interaction studies in humans with pegylated interferon alfa-2a indicated a moderate \ninhibitory effect on substrates metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5). \n \nElimination \nThe elimination of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is not fully characterised. Studies with a similar interferon \nalfa medicinal product (pegylated interferon alfa-2a) indicated that the kidney is a major organ for \nexcretion of radiolabelled metabolic products (study in rats) and that the systemic clearance of \npegylated interferon alfa-2a in humans is about 100-fold lower compared to the native, unpegylated \ninterferon alfa-2a. \n \nAfter subcutaneous multiple dose administration (dose range 50 – 450 micrograms), the terminal half-\nlife of ropeginterferon alfa-2b in patients is approximately 6 to 10 days and the clearance of \nropeginterferon alfa-2b is 0.023 to 0.061 L/h.  \n \nThe involvement of transport proteins in absorption, distribution and elimination of ropeginterferon \nalfa-2b is not known. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nOver a dose range of 24 to 270 micrograms, ropeginterferon alfa-2b Cmax increased proportionally with \ndose in a pharmacokinetic study with healthy subjects. A higher than proportional increase in exposure \nwas observed. Inter-subject variability for ropeginterferon alfa-2b was 35% (Cmax) and 25% (AUC). \n \nHepatic impairment \nComparable exposure and pharmacokinetic profile was reported for another interferon alfa medicinal \nproduct (pegylated interferon alfa-2a) in cirrhotic (Child-Pugh A) and non-cirrhotic patients. \nPharmacokinetics were not evaluated in patients with increased severity of hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \n\n\n\n14 \n\nThe pharmacokinetic profile in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in patients with \nend stage renal disease (ESRD) has been evaluated only for other pegylated interferon alfa medicinal \nproducts.  \nPatients with moderate or severe renal impairment receiving 180 micrograms of pegylated interferon \nalfa-2a once weekly showed a comparable or 60% higher drug plasma exposure, respectively, \ncompared to subjects with normal renal function.  \nIn 13 patients with ESRD requiring chronic haemodialysis, administration of 135 micrograms \npegylated interferon alfa-2a once weekly resulted in a 34% lower drug exposure than in patients with \nnormal renal function.  \n \nPatients with renal impairment receiving a single dose of 1.0 micrograms/kg pegylated interferon \nalfa-2b showed an increased relation of Cmax, AUC, and half-life to the degree of renal impairment. \nFollowing multiple dosing of pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.0 micrograms/kg subcutaneously \nadministered every week for four weeks), the clearance of pegylated interferon alfa-2b was reduced by \na mean of 17% and 44% in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, respectively, compared \nto subjects with normal renal function. Based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients \nwith severe renal impairment not on haemodialysis and in patients who received haemodialysis. \n \nElderly \nOnly limited pharmacokinetic data are available from the use of ropeginterferon alfa-2b in the elderly. \nBased on the results from the PROUD-PV and CONTINUATION-PV Study on drug exposure, \npharmacodynamic response and tolerability, a dose adjustment for ropeginterferon alfa-2b is not \nconsidered necessary in the elderly population. \n \nObese or underweight patients \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of ropeginterferon alfa-2b has not been determined in obese and \nunderweight patients.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity.  \n \nReproductive and developmental studies were not performed with ropeginterferon alfa-2b. Interferon \nalfa was shown to be abortifacient in primates and ropeginterferon alfa-2b is expected to have a \nsimilar effect. Effects on fertility was not assessed.  \n \nIt is unknown if the active substance of the medicinal product is excreted into experimental animal or \nhuman milk (see section 4.6).  \n \n \n6.

Any medicine remaining in the pre-filled pen after \nthe second use and/or after 30 days must be discarded. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2 °C - 8 °C). \nDo not freeze. \nKeep the pre-filled pen in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nBesremi 250 micrograms/0.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen \nThe pre-filled pen is made of white polypropylene, with a grey push button and the strength \n“250 mcg/0.5 mL” highlighted in grey on the label. It delivers doses of 50 μg, 100 μg, 150 μg, 200 μg \nand 250 μg. \n \nBesremi 500 micrograms/0.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen \nThe pre-filled pen is made of white polypropylene, with a blue push button and the strength \n“500 mcg/0.5 mL” highlighted in blue on the label. It delivers doses of 50 μg, 100 μg, 150 μg, 200 μg, \n250 μg, 300 μg, 350 μg, 400 μg, 450 μg and 500 μg. \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains a cartridge (type 1 colourless glass) with a grey plunger (bromobutyl \nrubber) and a flanged cap (aluminium) with a stopper (bromobutyl rubber). The cartridge is sealed in a \npen injector. Each cartridge contains 0.5 mL of solution. \n \nEach pack contains 1 pre-filled pen and 2 injection needles. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nBefore use, the pre-filled pen should be brought to room temperature (15 °C - 25 °C) for up to 15 \nminutes. \nSince Besremi is a solution, it does not require resuspension before use. Inspect the solution before \nuse. It may only be used if the solution is clear, colourless to pale yellow, with no particles visible. \n \nThe pre-filled pen label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors \nbetween Besremi 250 micrograms/0.5 mL solution for injection and Besremi 500 micrograms/0.5 mL \nsolution for injection. The 250 micrograms/0.5 mL pre-filled pen has a grey push button. The \n500 micrograms/0.5 mL pre-filled pen has a blue push button. \n \nA new, sterile needle as provided with the pre-filled pen must be carefully attached onto the pre-filled \npen before each injection. Needles must be discarded immediately after use. \n \nIf the pre-filled pen is used for the first time, the pen is prepared for injection by turning the dose knob \nuntil the symbol of a “drop” in the display window is seen. While holding the pre-filled pen with the \nneedle pointing upwards, tap the pre-filled pen gently with the fingers so that any air bubbles rise up \n\n\n\n16 \n\ntowards the needle. Then press the push button until the display window shows “0”. This may be \nrepeated up to six times. Once a droplet of liquid appears at the needle tip, the pre-filled pen and the \nneedle are working properly.  \n \nThe dose can be set in steps of 50 micrograms by rotating the dose knob. If a certain dose cannot be \nset, an insufficient quantity of medicinal product may be left in the pen and a new pen must be used.  \n \nThe needle should be inserted into the skin. The push button should be pressed in completely and held \ndown for at least 10 seconds before removing the needle. \n \nTo prevent possible transmission of disease or any kind of contamination, the use of Besremi pre-filled \npen should remain strictly for a single patient, even when the needle is changed. The pre-filled pen \nmay not be used more than twice, and must be discarded 30 days after the first use, regardless of any \nmedicinal product remaining in the pre-filled pen. \n \nEmpty pens must never be reused and must be properly discarded. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

What you need to know before you use Besremi \n3. How to use Besremi \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Besremi \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Besremi is and what it is used for \n \nBesremi contains the active substance ropeginterferon alfa-2b, which belongs to the class of medicinal \nproducts called interferons. Interferons are produced by your immune system to block the growth of \ncancer cells. \n \nBesremi is used as monotherapy for the treatment of polycythaemia vera in adults. Polycythaemia vera \nis a type of cancer in which the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells, white blood cells and \nplatelets (cells that help the blood to clot). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Besremi \n \nDo not use Besremi: \n\n- if you are allergic to ropeginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n(listed in section 6). \n\n- if you have thyroid disease that is not controlled with medicines. \n- if you have or had severe mental disorders (such as depression or suicidal thoughts or if you \n\ntried to kill yourself). \n- if you have or had severe heart problems (such as heart attack or stroke). \n- if you have or had an autoimmune disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis or \n\ninflammatory bowel disease). \n- if you had an organ transplantation and you take medicines which suppress your immune \n\nsystem. \n- if you take telbivudine (a medicine used to treat hepatitis B infection). \n- if you have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease. \n- if you have severe kidney disease (with your kidneys working at less than 15% of their normal \n\nability). \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using Besremi: \n\n- if you have thyroid disease. \n- if you have diabetes or high blood pressure − your doctor may ask you to have an eye \n\nexamination. \n- if you have liver problems − you will have blood tests regularly to check how your liver is \n\nworking if you are on a long-term Besremi therapy. \n- if you have kidney problems. \n- if you have psoriasis or other skin problems because they may get worse during treatment with \n\nBesremi. \n \n\nOnce you have started Besremi treatment, talk to your doctor: \n- if you develop symptoms of depression (such as feelings of sadness, dejection, and suicidal \n\nthoughts). \n- if you develop signs of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing or \n\nhives) while using Besremi – if this is the case you will need to seek medical help immediately. \n- if you develop symptoms of a cold or other respiratory infection (such as difficulty in breathing, \n\ncough, fever and chest pain). \n- if you have changes in your vision − you must tell your doctor and have an immediate eye \n\nexamination. Severe eye problems may occur during Besremi therapy. Your doctor will usually \ncheck your vision before starting your treatment. If you have health problems which may lead to \neye problems such as diabetes or high blood pressure, you doctor should check your vision also \nduring treatment. If your vision worsens, your doctor may decide to discontinue your treatment. \n\n \nDental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, can occur with interferon medicines. In \naddition, dry mouth could damage teeth and the lining of the mouth during long-term treatment with \nBesremi. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental checks. \n \nIt will need a certain time to reach your individual optimal dose of Besremi. Your doctor will decide if \nit is necessary to treat you with another medicine for an early reduction of your blood cell number to \nprevent blood clots and bleeding. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents because no information is available on the use of \nBesremi in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Besremi \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nDo not use Besremi if you are taking telbivudine (for treating hepatitis B) since the combination of \nthese medicines increases the risk of peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, or burning sensations \nin the arms and legs). Tell your doctor if you are being treated with telbivudine. \n \nTell your doctor especially if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- theophylline (a medicine used to treat respiratory diseases such as asthma) \n- methadone (a medicine used to treat pain or opioid dependence) \n- vortioxetine or risperidone (medicines used to treat mental disorders) \n- anti-cancer medicines such as those stopping or slowing the growth of blood-forming cells in \n\nthe bone marrow (e.g. hydroxycarbamide) \n- medicines that work on the central nervous system to relieve pain, help you sleep, or have a \n\ncalming effect (e.g. morphine, midazolam) \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \nPregnancy \nThe effect of Besremi during pregnancy is not known. The use of Besremi is not recommended during \npregnancy. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, your doctor will discuss with you if effective \nbirth control should be used during your treatment with Besremi. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known if Besremi is present in breast milk. Your doctor will help you decide if you have to \nstop breast-feeding when you are using this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machines if you feel dizzy, sleepy or confused while using Besremi. \n \nBesremi contains benzyl alcohol \nThis medicine contains 5 mg benzyl alcohol in each 0.5 mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic \nreactions. \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice: \n\n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n- if you have a liver or kidney disease. \n\nThis is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects \n(called “metabolic acidosis”). \n \nBesremi contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How to use Besremi \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe dose will be set individually for you by your doctor for your condition.

Get a new \npen and start afresh. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDescription Besremi 250 micrograms pre-filled pen \n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n• Before you begin, check that the product has not \nexpired. \n\n• Wash your hands before you begin. \n• Remove the cap from the pen. \n\n \n\n \n\n• Check the solution through the inspection windows \nalong the sides of the cartridge holder. \n\n• Do not use the pen if the solution is cloudy, has \nparticles or flakes, or is any colour other than \ncolourless to slightly yellow. \n\n \n\n \n\n• Take a new needle and remove the protective foil. \n• Click the needle onto the pen and make sure that it is \n\nfirmly attached. \n \n\n \n\n• Remove the outer needle cap from the needle. \n• Do not put the outer needle cap back on the needle \n\nuntil after you have injected the medicine. \n• Do not touch the needle tip at any time. \n• If you have used your Besremi 250 microgram pre-\n\nfilled pen once before, continue directly with step 7. \n• If you are using this pen for the first time, continue \n\nwith preparation of the pen in step 5. \n\n \n\n• If you are using your pen for the first time, prepare the \npen for injection by turning the dose knob until you see \nthe symbol of a “drop”. \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n• Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \nDo not point towards your face or anyone else’s face. \nThen, tap the pen (cartridge holder) gently with your \nfingers to allow any air bubbles to rise to the top of the \ncartridge holder. \n\n• Press the push button with your thumb until the “0” \nmark is aligned with the dot in the display window. \nYou will see the figures in the window change, and \nyou will hear clicks when the button moves. You \nshould see a droplet of liquid appearing at the needle \ntip. \n\n• If you do not see a droplet at the needle tip, repeat \nsteps 5 and 6 up to six times until a droplet emerges. \n\n• If you do not see the droplet after the seventh time, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n\n \n\n• Set the dose your doctor told you by turning the dose \nknob. The selected dose must align with the dot and \ndose display window. Correct the dose if necessary by \nturning the dose knob. \n\n• If you are unable to reach the required dose setting by \nturning the dose knob, your pen may not have \nsufficient medicine left. Do not apply further force. \nInstead, get a new pen. \n \n\n \n\n• You have to inject the medicine subcutaneously (under \nthe skin). Your doctor will tell you where you have to \ninject it. Possible injection sites are the belly (more \nthan five centimeters away from the belly button) or \nthe thigh. \n\n• If you need two pens, use a different injection site for \neach pen (e. g., right and left side of belly or right and \nleft thigh). Do not inject into skin that is irritated, \nreddened, bruised, infected or scarred in any way. \n\n• Disinfect your skin in the injection area using an \nalcohol swab before the injection. \nLet the area dry before you inject the medicine. \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n• Hold the pen so that the display window and the label \nare visible during the injection. \n\n• Raise a fold of skin between the thumb and forefinger. \nInsert the needle at a 90 degrees angle until the blue \nprotective sleeve on the needle is no longer visible. \n\n \n\n \n\n• Press the push button all the way down until the “0” \nmark is aligned with the dot in the display window. \nThe clicking sounds will stop when the injection is \ncomplete. \n\n• Hold the push button down and wait for at least 10 \nseconds before removing the needle. \n\n• Do not lift or move the pen during injection. \n \n\n \n\n• Carefully remove the needle from the skin. \n• Note: The blue protective sleeve locks automatically \n\nand the now visible red locking indicator covers the \nneedle for your protection. \n\n• Keep the injection site clean until the small injection \nwound has closed. Apply an adhesive plaster if needed. \n\nNote: You may see a small droplet of liquid sitting on your \nskin after you remove the needle. This droplet is normal \nand does not mean that you underdosed. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n• Unscrew the needle and dispose of it appropriately. \n \n\n \n\n• Put the cap back on the pen securely. \n \n\nReuse of the pen: \n• Your doctor will tell you if you may use the pen for a \n\nsecond injection. In this case, place the pen back into \nthe outer carton and store it in the refrigerator for the \nnext use. Do not use the pen later than 30 days. \n\nDisposal of the pen: \n• Discard the pen after use as instructed by your doctor \n\nor pharmacist. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nBesremi 500 micrograms/0.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen \nropeginterferon alfa-2b \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring.

Interferons are produced by your immune system to block the growth of \ncancer cells. \n \nBesremi is used as monotherapy for the treatment of polycythaemia vera in adults. Polycythaemia vera \nis a type of cancer in which the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells, white blood cells and \nplatelets (cells that help the blood to clot). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Besremi \n \nDo not use Besremi: \n\n- if you are allergic to ropeginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n(listed in section 6). \n\n- if you have thyroid disease that is not controlled with medicines. \n- if you have or had severe mental disorders (such as depression or suicidal thoughts or if you \n\ntried to kill yourself). \n- if you have or had severe heart problems (such as heart attack or stroke). \n- if you have or had an autoimmune disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis or \n\ninflammatory bowel disease). \n- if you had an organ transplantation and you take medicines which suppress your immune \n\nsystem. \n- if you take telbivudine (a medicine used to treat hepatitis B infection). \n- if you have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease. \n- if you have severe kidney disease (with your kidneys working at less than 15% of their normal \n\nability). \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using Besremi: \n\n- if you have thyroid disease. \n- if you have diabetes or high blood pressure − your doctor may ask you to have an eye \n\nexamination. \n- if you have liver problems − you will have blood tests regularly to check how your liver is \n\nworking if you are on a long-term Besremi therapy. \n- if you have kidney problems. \n- if you have psoriasis or other skin problems because they may get worse during treatment with \n\nBesremi. \n \n\nOnce you have started Besremi treatment, talk to your doctor: \n- if you develop symptoms of depression (such as feelings of sadness, dejection, and suicidal \n\nthoughts). \n- if you develop signs of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing or \n\nhives) while using Besremi – if this is the case you will need to seek medical help immediately. \n- if you develop symptoms of a cold or other respiratory infection (such as difficulty in breathing, \n\ncough, fever and chest pain). \n- if you have changes in your vision − you must tell your doctor and have an immediate eye \n\nexamination.

In \naddition, dry mouth could damage teeth and the lining of the mouth during long-term treatment with \nBesremi. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental checks. \n \nIt will need a certain time to reach your individual optimal dose of Besremi. Your doctor will decide if \nit is necessary to treat you with another medicine for an early reduction of your blood cell number to \nprevent blood clots and bleeding. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents because no information is available on the use of \nBesremi in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Besremi \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nDo not use Besremi if you are taking telbivudine (for treating hepatitis B) since the combination of \nthese medicines increases the risk of peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, or burning sensations \nin the arms and legs).

Get a new \npen and start afresh. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDescription Besremi 500 micrograms pre-filled pen \n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n• Before you begin, check that the product has not \nexpired. \n\n• Wash your hands before you begin. \n• Remove the cap from the pen. \n\n \n\n \n\n• Check the solution through the inspection windows \nalong the sides of the cartridge holder. \n\n• Do not use the pen if the solution is cloudy, has particles \nor flakes, or is any colour other than colourless to \nslightly yellow. \n\n \n\n \n\n• Take a new needle and remove the protective foil. \n• Click the needle onto the pen and make sure that it is \n\nfirmly attached. \n \n\n \n\n• Remove the outer needle cap from the needle. \n• Do not put the outer needle cap back on the needle until \n\nafter you have injected the medicine. \n• Do not touch the needle tip at any time. \n• If you have used your Besremi 500 microgram pre-filled \n\npen once before, continue directly with step 7. \n• If you are using this pen for the first time, continue with \n\npreparation of the pen in step 5. \n\n \n\n• If you are using your pen for the first time, prepare the \npen for injection by turning the dose knob until you see \nthe symbol of a “drop”. \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n• Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \nDo not point towards your face or anyone else’s face. \nThen, tap the pen (cartridge holder) gently with your \nfingers to allow any air bubbles to rise to the top of the \ncartridge holder. \n\n• Press the push button with your thumb until the “0” \nmark is aligned with the dot in the display window. \nYou will see the figures in the window change, and you \nwill hear clicks when the button moves. You should see \na droplet of liquid appearing at the needle tip. \n\n• If you do not see a droplet at the needle tip, repeat steps \n5 and 6 up to six times until a droplet emerges. \n\n• If you do not see the droplet after the seventh time, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n\n \n\n• Set the dose your doctor told you by turning the dose \nknob. The selected dose must align with the dot and dose \ndisplay window. Correct the dose if necessary by turning \nthe dose knob. \n\n• If you are unable to reach the required dose setting by \nturning the dose knob, your pen may not have sufficient \nmedicine left. Do not apply further force. \nInstead, get a new pen. \n \n\n \n\n• You have to inject the medicine subcutaneously (under \nthe skin). Your doctor will tell you where you have to \ninject it. Possible injection sites are the belly (more than \nfive centimeters away from the belly button) or the \nthigh. \n\n• Do not inject into skin that is irritated, reddened, \nbruised, infected or scarred in any way. \n\n• Disinfect your skin in the injection area using an alcohol \nswab before the injection. \nLet the area dry before you inject the medicine. \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n• Hold the pen so that the display window and the label \nare visible during the injection. \n\n• Raise a fold of skin between the thumb and forefinger. \nInsert the needle at a 90 degrees angle until the blue \nprotective sleeve on the needle is no longer visible. \n\n \n\n \n\n• Press the push button all the way down until the “0” \nmark is aligned with the dot in the display window. \nThe clicking sounds will stop when the injection is \ncomplete. \n\n• Hold the push button down and wait for at least 10 \nseconds before removing the needle. \n\n• Do not lift or move the pen during injection. \n \n\n \n\n• Carefully remove the needle from the skin. \n• Note: The blue protective sleeve locks automatically and \n\nthe now visible red locking indicator covers the needle \nfor your protection. \n\n• Keep the injection site clean until the small injection \nwound has closed. Apply an adhesive plaster if needed. \n\nNote: You may see a small droplet of liquid sitting on your \nskin after you remove the needle. This droplet is normal \nand does not mean that you underdosed. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n• Unscrew the needle and dispose of it appropriately. \n\n \n\n \n\n• Put the cap back on the pen securely. \n \n\nReuse of the pen: \n• Your doctor will tell you if you may use the pen for a \n\nsecond injection. In this case, place the pen back into the \nouter carton and store it in the refrigerator for the next \nuse. Do not use the pen later than 30 days. \n\nDisposal of the pen: \n• Discard the pen after use as instructed by your doctor or \n\npharmacist. \n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
