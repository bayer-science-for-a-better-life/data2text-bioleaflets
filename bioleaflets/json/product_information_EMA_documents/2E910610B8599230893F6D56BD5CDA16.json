This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nZINPLAVA 25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach mL of concentrate contains 25 mg bezlotoxumab.\nOne 40 mL vial contains 1,000 mg of bezlotoxumab.\n\nBezlotoxumab is a human monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by \nrecombinant DNA technology. It binds to C. difficile toxin B.\n\nExcipient with known effect\n\nEach mL of concentrate contains 0.2 mmol sodium, which is 4.57 mg sodium.\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion.\nClear to moderately opalescent, colourless to pale yellow liquid.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nZINPLAVA is indicated for the prevention of recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in \nadults at high risk for recurrence of CDI (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nZINPLAVA should be administered during the course of antibacterial therapy for CDI (see sections \n4.4 and 5.1).\n\nZINPLAVA should be administered as a single intravenous infusion of 10 mg/kg (see below and \nsection 6.6).\n\nThe experience with ZINPLAVA in patients is limited to a single CDI episode and single \nadministration (see section 4.4).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of ZINPLAVA in patients below 18 years of age have not been established. \nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\n Administer the diluted solution for infusion intravenously over 60 minutes using a sterile, \nnon-pyrogenic, low-protein binding 0.2 micron to 5 micron in-line or add-on filter. ZINPLAVA \nshould not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus.\n\n The diluted solution can be infused via a central line or peripheral catheter. \n ZINPLAVA must not be co-administered with other medicinal products simultaneously through \n\nthe same infusion line.\n\nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nZINPLAVA is not a treatment for CDI and has no effect on the current CDI episode. ZINPLAVA \nshould be administered during the course of antibacterial therapy for CDI. There is no data regarding \nthe efficacy of ZINPLAVA if given after the initial 10- to 14-days of antibacterial therapy for CDI.\n\nZINPLAVA should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus.\n\nThere is no experience with repeat administration of ZINPLAVA in patients with CDI. In clinical \ntrials, patients with CDI were only administered a single dose of ZINPLAVA (see section 5.1).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo formal interactions studies with other medicinal products were conducted. Therapeutic monoclonal \nantibodies do not typically have significant drug-drug interaction potential, as they do not directly \naffect cytochrome P450 enzymes and are not substrates of hepatic or renal transporters.\n\nBezlotoxumab-mediated drug-drug interactions are unlikely as the target of bezlotoxumab is an \nexogenous toxin.\n\nConcomitant oral standard of care (SoC) antibacterial therapy for CDI was given together with \nZINPLAVA.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are limited data from the use of bezlotoxumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). ZINPLAVA should not be used during pregnancy \nunless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with bezlotoxumab.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether bezlotoxumab is secreted in human milk. Because monoclonal antibodies may \nbe excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to not \nadminister ZINPLAVA, taking into account the importance of ZINPLAVA to the mother.\n\nFertility\n\nNo clinical data are available on the possible effects of bezlotoxumab on fertility. Fertility studies have \nnot been conducted in animals. There was no binding of bezlotoxumab to reproductive tissue in tissue \ncross reactivity studies, and no notable effects in the male and female reproductive organs in repeat \ndose toxicity studies in mice (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nBezlotoxumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe safety profile of ZINPLAVA was assessed in two Phase 3 clinical studies. The most common \nadverse reactions following treatment with ZINPLAVA (reported in ≥ 4 % of patients within the first \n4 weeks of infusion) were nausea, diarrhoea, pyrexia and headache. These adverse reactions were \nreported at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients compared with ZINPLAVA treated patients.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nTable 1 presents the adverse reactions reported within 4 weeks of infusion in ZINPLAVA-treated \npatients and listed by System Organ Class. The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nfrequency.\n\nTable 1: Adverse Reactions with ZINPLAVA \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class Frequency Adverse Reaction(s)\n\nNervous system disorders Common Headache\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Nausea, diarrhoea\n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions\n\nCommon Pyrexia\n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications\n\nCommon Infusion related reactions†\n\n† See Description of selected adverse reactions below.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nSerious adverse reactions\nIn clinical studies, serious adverse reactions occurring within 12 weeks following infusion were \nreported in 29 % of ZINPLAVA-treated patients and 33 % in patients receiving placebo.\n\nInfusion related reactions\nOverall, 10 % of subjects in the ZINPLAVA group experienced one or more infusion specific adverse \nreactions on the day of, or the day after, the infusion compared to 8 % in the placebo group. Infusion \nspecific adverse reactions reported in ≥ 0.5 % of subjects receiving ZINPLAVA and at a frequency\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\ngreater than placebo were nausea (3 %), fatigue (1 %), pyrexia (1 %), dizziness (1 %), headache (2 %), \ndyspnoea (1 %) and hypertension (1 %). Of the patients who experienced an infusion specific adverse \nreaction, the majority reported a reaction with a maximum intensity of mild (78 %) or moderate \n(20 %), and the majority of reactions resolved within 24 hours following onset.\n\nImmune-related adverse reactions\nIn a Phase 1 clinical trial, healthy subjects received two consecutive doses of 10 mg/kg of \nbezlotoxumab separated by 12 weeks. The adverse reactions after the second dose were not markedly \ndifferent from those observed after the first dose, and are consistent with adverse reactions observed in \nthe two Phase 3 trials (MODIFY I and MODIFY II; see section 5.1) in which all patients received a \nsingle dose.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no clinical experience with overdosage of ZINPLAVA. In clinical trials, healthy subjects \nreceived up to 20 mg/kg, which was generally well tolerated. In case of overdose, patients should be \nclosely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment \nshould be instituted.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiinfectives for systemic use, specific immunoglobulins. ATC code: \nJ06BB21\n\nMechanism of action\n\nBezlotoxumab is a human monoclonal antitoxin antibody that binds with high affinity to C. difficile\ntoxin B and neutralizes its activity. Bezlotoxumab prevents CDI recurrence by providing passive \nimmunity against toxin produced by the outgrowth of persistent or newly-acquired C. difficile spores.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nMicrobiology\n\nActivity in vitro and in vivo\nThe toxin B epitope to which bezlotoxumab binds is conserved, though not identical, across all known \ntoxin sequences.\n\nClinical trials\n\nThe efficacy of ZINPLAVA (bezlotoxumab) was investigated in two randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, multicentre, Phase 3 studies (MODIFY I and MODIFY II) where 810 patients \nwere randomised to bezlotoxumab and 803 to placebo. The number of patients completing the studies \nand included in the full analysis set (FAS) was 781 in the ZINPLAVA group versus 773 in the placebo \ngroup. All patients received concomitant standard of care antibacterial therapy for CDI. \nRandomisation was stratified by the antibacterial agent and hospitalisation status (inpatient vs. \noutpatient) at the time of study entry. Adult patients had a confirmed diagnosis of CDI, which was \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6\n\ndefined as diarrhoea (passage of 3 or more loose bowel movements as defined in the Bristol stool chart \nas types 5 through 7 in 24 or fewer hours) and a positive stool test for toxigenic C. difficile from a \nstool sample collected no more than 7 days before study entry.\n\nPatients received a 10- to 14-day course of oral antibacterial therapy for CDI (metronidazole, \nvancomycin or fidaxomicin, chosen by the investigator). Patients on oral vancomycin or oral \nfidaxomicin could have also received IV metronidazole. \n\nA single infusion of ZINPLAVA or placebo was administered prior to completion of antibacterial \ntherapy and patients were followed for 12 weeks following the infusion. The day of the infusion of \nZINPLAVA or placebo ranged from prior to the start of antibacterial therapy up to day 14 of\ntreatment, with a median on day 3.\n\nThe baseline characteristics of the 781 patients receiving ZINPLAVA and 773 receiving placebo were \ngenerally similar across treatment groups. The median age was 65 years, 85 % were white, 57 % were \nfemale, and 68 % were inpatients. A similar proportion of patients were receiving oral metronidazole \n(48 %) or oral vancomycin (48 %) and only 4 % were receiving fidaxomicin as antibacterial treatment \nfor CDI.\n\nThe CDI recurrence rates are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: CDI Recurrence Rate Through 12 Weeks After Infusion\n(MODIFY I and MODIFY II, Full Analysis Set*)\n\nZINPLAVA with \nSoC†\n\nPercent (n/N)\n\nPlacebo with SoC†\n\nPercent (n/N)\nAdjusted Difference (95% CI)‡ p-value\n\n16.5 (129/781) 26.6 (206/773) -10.0 (-14.0, -6.0) <0.0001\n\nn = Number of patients in the analysis population meeting the criteria for endpoint\nN = Number of patients included in the analysis population\n* Full Analysis Set = a subset of all randomised patients with exclusions for: (i) did not receive infusion of study \n\nmedication, (ii) did not have a positive local stool test for toxigenic C. difficile; (iii) did not receive protocol defined \nstandard of care therapy within a 1 day window of the infusion; (iiii) GCP non-compliance\n\n† SoC = Standard of Care antibacterial (metronidazole or vancomycin or fidaxomicin) \n‡ One sided p-value based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method stratified by protocol (MODIFY I and MODIFY II), \n\nSoC antibacterial (metronidazole vs. vancomycin vs. fidaxomicin) and hospitalization status (inpatient vs. outpatient)\n\nTable 3 shows the results of a prospectively planned combined analysis of the CDI recurrence rates in \npre-specified subgroups of patients at high risk for CDI recurrence across the two Phase 3 Trials. \nOverall, 51 % were ≥ 65 years, 29% were ≥ 75 years and 39 % received one or more systemic \nantibacterial agents during the 12 week follow-up period. Of the total 28 % had one or more episodes \nof CDI within the six months prior to the episode under treatment (18 % of the patients had one, 7 % \nhad two and a few patients had 3 or more prior episodes). Twenty one (21) percent of the patients were \nimmunocompromised and 16 % presented with clinically severe CDI. Among the 976/1554 (62 %) \npatients who had a positive baseline stool culture for C. difficile a hypervirulent strain (ribotypes 027, \n078 or 244) was isolated in 22 % (217 of 976 patients), of which the majority (87 %, 189 of \n217 strains) were ribotype 027.\n\nThese patients presented with risk factors primarily but not exclusively associated with higher risk of \nCDI recurrence. Efficacy results did not point towards a benefit of ZINPLAVA in patients with no \nknown risk factors for CDI.\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nTable 3: CDI Recurrence Rate by Risk Factor Subgroup\n(MODIFY I and MODIFY II, Full Analysis Set*)\n\nCharacteristic at study entry\n\nZINPLAVA\nwith SoC†\n\nPercent (n/m)\n\nPlacebo with \nSoC†\n\nPercent (n/m) Difference (95% CI)‡\n\nAge ≥ 65 years 15.4 (60/390) 31.4 (127/405) -16.0 (-21.7, -10.2)\n\nHistory of one or more episodes of \nCDI in past 6 months \n\n25.0 (54/216) 41.1 (90/219) -16.1 (-24.7, -7.3)\n\nImmunocompromised§ 14.6 (26/178) 27.5 (42/153) -12.8 (-21.7, -4.1)\n\nSevere CDI¶ 10.7 (13/122) 22.4 (28/125) -11.7 (-21.1, -2.5)\n\nInfected with a hypervirulent \nstrain#\n\n21.6 (22/102) 32.2 (37/115) -10.6 (-22.1, 1.3)\n\nInfected with 027 ribotype 23.6 (21/89) 34.0 (34/100) -10.4 (-23.0, 2.6)\nn = Number of patients within subgroup that met the criteria for endpoint\nm = Number of patients within subgroup\n* Full Analysis Set = a subset of all randomised patients with exclusions for: (i) did not receive infusion of study \n\nmedication, (ii) did not have a positive local stool test for toxigenic C. difficile; (iii) did not receive protocol defined \nstandard of care therapy within a 1 day window of the infusion\n\n† SoC = Standard of Care antibacterial (metronidazole or vancomycin or fidaxomicin)\n‡ Based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method without stratification\n§ Based on medical conditions or medications received that may result in immunosuppression\n¶ Zar score ≥ 2\n# Hypervirulent strain included the following: 027, 078, or 244 ribotypes\n\nIn the studies, the clinical cure rates of the presenting CDI episode were comparable between the \ntreatment arms.\n\nImmunogenicity\n\nImmunogenicity of ZINPLAVA was evaluated using an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay in \nMODIFY I and MODIFY II.\n\nFollowing treatment with ZINPLAVA in MODIFY I and MODIFY II, none of the 710 evaluable \npatients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-bezlotoxumab antibodies. Although ZINPLAVA is \nintended for single dose administration, the immunogenicity of bezlotoxumab following a second \nadministration of 10 mg/kg, 12 weeks after the first dose, was assessed in 29 healthy subjects. No \nanti-bezlotoxumab antibodies were detected after the second dose.\n\nThere are no data on repeated administration of bezlotoxumab in patients with CDI.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with\nZINPLAVA in one or more subsets of the paediatric populations for the prevention of recurrence of\nClostridium difficile infection (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nBezlotoxumab is dosed via the IV route and therefore is immediately and completely bioavailable. \nAfter a single IV dose of 10 mg/kg bezlotoxumab, mean AUC(0-∞) and Cmax were 53,000 mcg.h/mL\nand 185 mcg/mL, respectively, in patients with CDI. Bezlotoxumab exposures in healthy subjects \nincreased in an approximately dose proportional manner across the 0.3 to 20 mg/kg dose range.\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nDistribution\n\nBezlotoxumab has limited extravascular distribution. The mean volume of distribution of \nbezlotoxumab was 7.33 L (CV: 16 %).\n\nBiotransformation\n\nBezlotoxumab is catabolized through protein degradation processes; metabolism does not contribute to \nits clearance.\n\nElimination\n\nBezlotoxumab is eliminated from the body primarily by protein degradation. The mean clearance of \nbezlotoxumab was 0.317 L/day (CV: 41 %) and the terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 19 days \n(28 %).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nThe effects of various covariates on the pharmacokinetics of bezlotoxumab were assessed in a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis. The clearance of bezlotoxumab increased with increasing body \nweight; the resulting exposure differences are adequately addressed by the administration of a \nweight-based dose.\n\nThe following factors had no clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of bezlotoxumab and no \ndose adjustment is required: age (range 18 to 100 years), gender, race, ethnicity, renal impairment, \nhepatic impairment, and presence of co-morbid conditions.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bezlotoxumab was evaluated in patients \nwith mild (eGFR 60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), or severe \n(eGFR 15 to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment, or with end stage renal disease \n(eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2), as compared to patients demonstrating normal (eGFR \n≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal function. No clinically meaningful differences in the exposure of \nbezlotoxumab were found between patients with renal impairment and patients with normal renal \nfunction.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bezlotoxumab was evaluated in patients \nwith hepatic impairment (defined as having two or more of the following: [1] albumin ≤ 3.1 g/dL; \n[2] ALT ≥ 2X ULN; [3] total bilirubin ≥ 1.3X ULN; or [4] mild, moderate or severe liver disease as \nreported by the Charlson Co-morbidity Index), as compared to patients with normal hepatic function. \nNo clinically meaningful differences in the exposure of bezlotoxumab were found between patients \nwith hepatic impairment and patients with normal hepatic function.\n\nElderly\n\nThe effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of bezlotoxumab was evaluated in patients ranging from 18 \nto 100 years of age. No clinically meaningful differences in the exposure of bezlotoxumab were found \nbetween elderly patients 65 years and older and patients under 65 years of age.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose \ntoxicity. Genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential have not been evaluated.\n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nAnimal reproduction or developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with bezlotoxumab. \nThere were no notable effects in the male and female reproductive organs in mice based on repeat \ndose toxicity studies and no binding to reproductive tissues was observed in tissue cross-reactivity \nstudies.\n\n6.

What you need to know before you are given ZINPLAVA\n3. How you are given ZINPLAVA\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store ZINPLAVA\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What ZINPLAVA is and what it is used for\n\nZINPLAVA contains the active substance bezlotoxumab.\n\nZINPLAVA is a medicine that is given together with an antibiotic to prevent Clostridium difficile \ninfection (CDI) from coming back in patients 18 years of age or older who have a high risk of CDI \ncoming back.\n\nHow ZINPLAVA works\n When people get CDI, they are usually given an antibiotic to get rid of the infection, but CDI \n\ncan often come back within weeks or months.\n The bacteria responsible for CDI produce a toxin that can inflame and damage your colon, \n\ncausing stomach pain and severe diarrhoea. ZINPLAVA acts by attaching to the toxin and \nblocking it, thereby preventing the symptoms of CDI from coming back.\n\n2. What you need to know before you are given ZINPLAVA\n\nTalk to your doctor before you are given ZINPLAVA.\n\nYou should not be given ZINPLAVA if:\n you are allergic to bezlotoxumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions \nZINPLAVA is not a treatment for CDI. ZINPLAVA has no effect on the CDI you have now. \n\nZINPLAVA is given with the antibiotic therapy you are taking for CDI.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nZINPLAVA should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.\n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\nOther medicines and ZINPLAVA\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n If you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant, tell your doctor.\n We don’t know if ZINPLAVA will harm your baby while you are pregnant. \n If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, check with your doctor first.\n We don’t know if ZINPLAVA gets in your breast milk and is passed to your baby.\n You and your doctor should decide together if you will use ZINPLAVA.\n\nDriving and using machines\nZINPLAVA has no or very little effect on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n3. How you are given ZINPLAVA\n You will get ZINPLAVA as an infusion (drip) into a vein.\n You will get ZINPLAVA in one dose and it will take about 1 hour. Your dose will be calculated \n\nusing your body weight.\n You should keep taking your antibiotic for CDI as directed by your doctor.\n\nIf you miss an appointment to get ZINPLAVA\n Call your doctor or health care professional right away to reschedule your appointment.\n It is very important that you do not miss the dose of this medicine.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nThe following side effects have been reported in clinical trials:\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n diarrhoea\n dizziness\n feeling sick (nausea)\n fever\n headache\n high blood pressure\n shortness of breath\n tiredness\n\nTell your doctor or health care professional if you notice any of the side effects above.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By \nreporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n22\n\n5. How to store ZINPLAVA\n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and vial label after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month.\n\nStore in a refrigerator 2 °C to 8 °C. Do not freeze. Keep vial in the outer carton in order to protect \nfrom light.\n\nThe diluted solution of ZINPLAVA may be stored either at room temperature for up to 16 hours or \nunder refrigeration at 2 °C to 8 °C for up to 24 hours. If refrigerated, allow the IV bag to come to room \ntemperature prior to use.\n\nDo not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. Any unused medicine or waste\nmaterial should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\n\n6.

Do not use the vial if the \nsolution is discoloured or contains visible particles.\n\n Do not shake the vial.\n Withdraw the required volume from the vial(s) based on the patient’s weight (in kg) and transfer \n\ninto an IV bag containing either 0.9 % Sodium Chloride Injection, or 5 % Dextrose Injection, to \nprepare a diluted solution with a final concentration ranging from 1 to 10 mg/mL. Mix diluted \nsolution by gentle inversion.\n\n Discard vial(s) and all unused contents.\n If the diluted solution is refrigerated, allow the IV bag to come to room temperature prior to use.\n Do not freeze the diluted solution.\n\nMethod of administration\n Administer the diluted solution for infusion intravenously over 60 minutes using a sterile, \n\nnon-pyrogenic, low-protein binding 0.2 micron to 5 micron in-line or add-on filter. ZINPLAVA \nshould not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus.\n\n The diluted solution can be infused via a central line or peripheral catheter. \n ZINPLAVA must not be co-administered with other medicinal products simultaneously through \n\nthe same infusion line.\n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
