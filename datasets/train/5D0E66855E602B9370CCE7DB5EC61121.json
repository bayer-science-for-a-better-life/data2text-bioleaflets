NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRapilysin 10 U powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 vial contains 10 U* reteplase ** in 0.56 g powder \n1 prefilled syringe contains 10 ml water for injections. \n \nThe reconstituted solution contains 1 U reteplase per ml. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n* Potency of reteplase is expressed in units (U) by using a reference standard which is specific for \nreteplase and is not comparable with units used for other thrombolytic agents. \n \n** Recombinant plasminogen activator produced in Escherichia coli by recombinant DNA technology. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nWhite powder and clear colourless liquid (water for injections).  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRapilysin is indicated for the thrombolytic treatment of suspected myocardial infarction with persistent \nST elevation or recent left Bundle Branch Block within 12 hours after the onset of acute myocardial \ninfarction AMI symptoms.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with reteplase should be initiated as soon as possible after the onset of AMI symptoms. \n \nRapilysin should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the use of thrombolytic treatment and \nwith the facilities to monitor its use. \n \nPosology \n \nDosage of Rapilysin \n \nRapilysin is administered as a 10 U bolus dose followed by a second 10 U bolus dose 30 minutes later \n(double bolus). \nEach bolus is administered as a slow intravenous injection within 2 minutes. Ensure that the injection \nis not mistakenly given paravenously. \nHeparin and acetylsalicylic acid should be administered before and following the administration of \nRapilysin to reduce the risk of re-thrombosis. \n \nDosage of Heparin \n \nThe recommended dose of heparin is 5000 I.U. given as a bolus injection prior to reteplase therapy \nfollowed by an infusion of 1000 I.U. per hour starting after the second reteplase bolus. Heparin should \n\n\n\n3 \n\nbe administered for at least 24 hours, preferably for 48 \u2013 72 hours, aiming to keep aPTT values 1.5 to \n2 times normal. \n \nDosage of Acetylsalicylic Acid \n \nThe initial dose of acetylsalicylic acid prior to thrombolysis should be at least 250 mg (250 \u2013 350 mg) \nfollowed by 75 \u2013 150 mg/day at least until discharge. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nReteplase is supplied as a freeze-dried substance in vials. The lyophilisate is reconstituted with the \ncontents of the accompanying syringe. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product \nbefore administration, see section 6.6. \n \nRapilysin should be injected preferably through an intravenous line whose sole purpose is the injection \nof Rapilysin. No other medicines should be injected through the line reserved for Rapilysin, neither at \nthe same time, nor prior to, nor following Rapilysin injection. This applies to all products including \nheparin, and acetylsalicylic acid, which should be administered before and following the \nadministration of reteplase to reduce the risk of re-thrombosis. \n \nIn those patients where the same line has to be used, this line (including Y-line) must be flushed \nthoroughly with 0.9 % sodium chloride or 5 % glucose solution prior to and following the Rapilysin \ninjection. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nBecause thrombolytic therapy increases the risk of bleeding, reteplase is contra-indicated in the \nfollowing situations: \n \n- known haemorrhagic diathesis \n \n- patients with current concomitant therapy with oral anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin sodium) \n \n- intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm \n \n- neoplasm with increased bleeding risk \n \n- history of cerebrovascular accident \n \n- recent (< 10 days) prolonged and vigorous external heart massage \n \n- severe uncontrolled hypertension \n \n- active peptic ulceration  \n \n- portal hypertension (oesophageal varices) \n \n- severe liver or renal dysfunction \n \n- acute pancreatitis, pericarditis, bacterial endocarditis \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n- within 3 months of severe bleeding, major trauma or major surgery (e.g. coronary artery bypass \ngraft, intracranial or intraspinal surgery or trauma), obstetrical delivery, organ biopsy, previous \npuncture of non-compressible vessels. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEach patient being considered for therapy with reteplase should be carefully evaluated. \nFor information on product incompatibilities see section 6.2. \n \nBleeding \n \nThe most common complication encountered during reteplase therapy is bleeding. In the following \nconditions the risks of reteplase therapy may be increased and should be weighed against the \nanticipated benefits: \n \n- cerebrovascular disease \n \n- systolic blood pressure at entry > 160 mmHg \n \n- recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding (within 10 days) \n \n- high likelihood of left heart thrombus, e.g. mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation \n \n- septic thrombophlebitis or occluded arteriovenous cannula at seriously infected site \n \n- age over 75 years \n \n- any other condition in which bleeding constitutes a significant hazard or would be  particularly \n\ndifficult because of its location \n \nThe concomitant use of heparin anticoagulation may contribute to bleeding. As fibrin is lysed during \nreteplase therapy, bleeding from recent puncture sites may occur. Therefore, thrombolytic therapy \nrequires careful attention to all possible bleeding sites (including catheter insertion sites, arterial and \nvenous puncture sites, cut down sites and needle puncture sites). The use of rigid catheter as well as \nintramuscular injections and nonessential handling of the patient should be avoided during treatment \nwith reteplase. \n \nCaution should be employed when used with other medicinal products affecting haemostasis such as \nheparin, low-molecular-weight heparins, heparinoids, oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents other \nthan acetylsalicylic acid, such as dipyridamole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa \nreceptor antagonists. \n \nShould serious bleeding, in particular cerebral haemorrhage, occur any concomitant heparin should be \nterminated immediately. In addition, the second bolus of reteplase should not be given if the serious \nbleeding occurs before it is administered. In general, however, it is not necessary to replace the \ncoagulation factors because of the relatively short half-life of reteplase. Most patients who have \nbleeding can be managed by interruption of thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapy, volume \nreplacement and manual pressure applied to an incompetent vessel. Protamine should be considered if \nheparin has been administered within 4 hours of the onset of bleeding. In the patients who fail to \nrespond to these conservative measures, judicious use of transfusion products may be indicated. \nTransfusions of cryoprecipitate, fibrinogen, fresh frozen plasma and platelets should be considered \nwith clinical and laboratory reassessment after each administration. A target fibrinogen level of 1 g/l is \ndesirable with cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen infusion. \n \nAt present, insufficient data in patients with a diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg prior to \nthrombolytic therapy are available for reteplase. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nArrhythmias \n \nCoronary thrombolysis may result in arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. It is strongly \nrecommended that antiarrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g. \nventricular tachycardia or fibrillation) be available when reteplase is administered. \n \nReadministration \n \nSince at present there is no experience with readministration of reteplase, the readministration is not \nrecommended. However, no antibody formation to the reteplase molecule has been observed. \nIf an anaphylactoid reaction occurs, the injection should be discontinued immediately and appropriate \ntherapy should be initiated. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. Retrospective analyses of clinical studies did not reveal \nany clinically relevant interactions with medicinal product used concomitantly with reteplase in \npatients with acute myocardial infarction. Heparin, vitamin K antagonists and medicinal product that \nalter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole and abciximab) may increase the risk \nof bleeding if administered prior to, during or after reteplase therapy. \n \nAttention should be paid to this effect especially during periods of low plasma fibrinogen (up to about \n2 days after fibrinolytic therapy of AMI). \n \nFor information on product incompatibilities see section 4.2. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data on the use of reteplase in pregnant women. The only relevant available \nanimal data refer to studies performed in rabbits, which showed vaginal bleedings associated with \nabortions (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nExcept in life-threatening situations, Rapilysin should not be used in pregnant women. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether reteplase is excreted into breast milk. Breast milk should be discarded within \nthe first 24 hours after thrombolytic therapy. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse drug reaction associated with reteplase treatment is \nhaemorrhage, predominantly at the injection site. Local reactions at injection site can also occur. \n \nAs with other thrombolytic agents, recurrent ischaemia/angina, hypotension and heart \nfailure/pulmonary oedema have been reported frequently as sequelae of myocardial infarction and/or \nthrombolytic administration. \n \nHaemorrhage \n \nThe most frequent adverse drug reaction associated with reteplase treatment is haemorrhage. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nReports of intracranial bleeding, many of which are fatal, are of particular concern. \n \nSystolic blood pressure over 160 mmHg before thrombolysis with reteplase was associated with \ngreater risk for cerebral bleeding. The risk of intracranial bleeding and fatal intracranial bleeding \nincreases with increasing age. Blood transfusions were rarely required. Death and permanent disability \nare not uncommonly reported in patients who have experienced stroke (including intracranial \nbleeding) and other serious bleeding episodes. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions reported is listed in the following table. Frequencies are defined as \nvery common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 \n1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions seen with reteplase \nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon \n \n \n\nVery rare \n\nHypersensitivity reactions (e.g. allergic \nreactions)1 \n \nSerious anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid \nreactions1 \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon \n \n\nVery rare \n\nCerebral haemorrhage2 \n \nEvents related to the nervous system \n(e.g. epileptic seizure, convulsion, \naphasia, speech disorder, delirium, \nacute brain syndrome, agitation, \nconfusion, depression, psychosis) \n\nCardiac disorders3 Very common \n \n \n \n\nCommon \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nUncommon \n\nRecurrent ischaemia/angina, \nhypotension and heart \nfailure/pulmonary oedema \n \nArrhythmias (e.g. AV block, atrial \nfibrillation/flutter, ventricular \ntachycardia/fibrillation, \nelectromechanical dissociation (EMD)), \ncardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock and \nreinfarction \n \nMitral regurgitation, pulmonary \nembolism, other systemic \nembolism/cerebral embolism and \nventricular septal defect \n\nVascular disorders Common \n \n \n \n\nUncommon \n\nGastrointestinal haemorrhage \n(haematemesis, melena), gingival or \ngenitourinary bleeding \n \nHaemopericardium, retroperitoneal \nbleeding, cerebral haemorrhage, \nepistaxis, haemoptysis, eye \nhaemorrhage and ecchymosis \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nVery common Haemorrhage at the injection site (e.g. \nhaematoma), a local reaction at \ninjection site, for example a burning \nsensation \n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural \n\nNot known Fat embolism, which may lead to \ncorresponding consequences in the \n\n\n\n7 \n\ncomplications organs concerned4 \n1. Available evidence on reteplase does not indicate an antibody-mediated origin of these \nhypersensitivity reactions. \n2. Ischaemic or haemorrhagic cerebrovascular events may be contributing or underlying conditions. \n3. As with other thrombolytic agents these cardiovascular events have been reported as sequelae of \nmyocardial infarction and/or thrombolytic administration. These events can be life-threatening and \nmay lead to death. \n4. This event has been reported for the therapeutic class of thrombolytic agents. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the event of overdosage one might expect depletion of fibrinogen and other blood coagulation \ncomponents (e.g. coagulation factor V) with a consequent risk of bleeding. \n \nFor further information see section 4.4, section bleeding. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antithrombotic agent, ATC Code: B01AD07 \n \nMechanism of action \nReteplase is a recombinant plasminogen activator that catalyzes the cleavage of endogenous \nplasminogen to generate plasmin. This plasminogenolysis occurs preferentially in the presence of \nfibrin. Plasmin in turn degrades fibrin, which is the main component of the matrix of thrombi, thereby \nexerting its thrombolytic action. \n \nReteplase (10+10 U) dose-dependently reduces plasma fibrinogen levels by about 60 to 80 %. The \nfibrinogen level normalises within 2 days. As with other plasminogen activators a rebound \nphenomenon then occurs during which fibrinogen levels reach a maximum within 9 days and remain \nelevated for up to 18 days. \n \nReductions of plasma levels of plasminogen and \u03b12-antiplasmin normalise within 1 to 3 days. \nCoagulation factor V, clotting factor VIII, \u03b12-macroglobulin, and C1-esterase inhibitor are only \nslightly reduced and normalise within 1 to 2 days. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) activity \ncan be reduced to around zero, but rapidly normalises within two hours showing a rebound \nphenomenon. Prothrombin activation fragment 1 levels and thrombin-antithrombin III-complexes \nincrease during thrombolysis indicating thrombin production of which the clinical relevance is \nunknown. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nA large comparative mortality trial (INJECT) in approx. 6000 patients showed that reteplase reduced \nthe incidence of heart failure (secondary efficacy criterion) in a significant manner and was at least \nequally effective in terms of reducing mortality (primary efficacy criterion) when compared to \nstreptokinase. In two clinical trials aiming primarily at coronary artery patency (RAPID I and II) \nreteplase was associated with higher early patency rates (primary efficacy criterion), as well as with a \nlower incidence of heart failure (secondary efficacy criterion) than alteplase (3 hour and \"accelerated\" \ndosage regimens). A clinical trial in approximately 15 000 patients comparing reteplase with the \n\n\n\n8 \n\naccelerated dose regimen of alteplase (GUSTO III) (2:1 randomisation reteplase: alteplase) did not \nshow statistically different results for the primary endpoint of 30-day mortality (reteplase: 7.47 %, \nalteplase 7.23 %, p = 0.61) or for the combined endpoint of 30-day mortality and non-fatal disabling \nstroke (reteplase: 7.89 %, alteplase 7.88 %, p = 0.99). Overall stroke rates were 1.64 % in the reteplase \nand 1.79 % in the alteplase group. In the reteplase group, 49.4 % of these strokes were fatal and \n27.1 % were disabling. In the alteplase group 33.0 % were fatal and 39.8 % were disabling. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nElimination \nFollowing intravenous bolus injection of 10 + 10 U in patients with acute myocardial infarction \nreteplase antigen is distributed in plasma with a dominant half-life (t1/2\u03b1) of 18\u00b15 min and eliminated \nwith a terminal half-life (t1/2\u00df) of 5.5 hours\u00b112.5 min at a clearance rate of 121\u00b125 ml/min. Reteplase \nactivity is cleared from the plasma at a rate of 283\u00b1101 ml/min, resulting in a dominant half-life \n(t1/2\u03b1) of 14.6\u00b16.7 min and a terminal half-life (t1/2\u00df) of 1.6 hours\u00b139 min. Only minor amounts of \nreteplase were immunologically detected in the urine. Exact data on the main elimination routes for \nreteplase in humans are not available and the consequences of hepatic or renal insufficiency are not \nknown. Experiments in rats indicate that the liver and the kidneys are the main organs of active uptake \nand lysosomal degradation. \nAdditional studies in human plasma samples in vitro suggest that complexation with C1-inactivator, \n\u03b12-antiplasmin and \u03b12-antitrypsin contributes to the inactivation of reteplase in plasma. The relative \ncontribution of the inhibitors to inactivation of reteplase decreases as follows: C1-inactivator > \u03b12-\nantiplasmin > \u03b12-antitrypsin. \n \nThe half-life of reteplase was increased in patients with AMI as compared to healthy volunteers. An \nadditional increase of half-life of activity in patients with myocardial infarction and severely impaired \nliver and renal function cannot be excluded, but no clinical data of pharmacokinetics of reteplase in \nthese patients are available. Animal data show that in case of severely impaired renal function with a \npronounced increase in serum creatinine and serum urea an increase in half-life of reteplase has to be \nexpected. Mild impairment of renal function did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic \nproperties of reteplase. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAcute toxicity studies were performed in rats, rabbits and monkeys Subacute toxicity studies were \nperformed in rats, dogs and monkeys. The predominant acute symptom after single high doses of \nreteplase in rats and rabbits was transient apathy shortly after injection. In cynomolgus monkeys, the \nsedative effect ranged from slight apathy to unconsciousness, caused by a reversible dose-related drop \nin blood pressure. There was increased local haemorrhage at the injection site. \n \nSubacute toxicity studies did not reveal any unexpected adverse events. In dogs repeated dosing of the \nhuman peptide reteplase led to immunologic-allergic reactions. Genotoxicity of reteplase was \nexcluded by a complete battery of tests at different genetic end points in vitro and in vivo. \n \nReproductive toxicity studies were performed in rats (fertility and embryo-foetotoxicity study \nincluding a littering phase) and in rabbits (embryo-foetotoxicity study, dose-range finding only). In \nrats, a species insensitive to the pharmacological effects of reteplase, there were no adverse effects on \nfertility, embryo-foetal development and offspring. In rabbits, vaginal bleedings and abortions \npossibly associated to prolonged haemostasis, but no foetal abnormalities were noted. A pre- and \npostnatal toxicity study was not performed with reteplase. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nPowder: \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTranexamic acid \ndi potassium-hydrogen phosphate \nphosphoric acid \nsucrose \nPolysorbate 80 \n \nSolvent: \nWater for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product should not be mixed with Heparin and/or acetylsalicylic acid. \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts. \n \nHeparin and Rapilysin are incompatible when combined in solution. Other incompatibilities may also \nexist. No other medicines should be added to the injection solution. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nShelf-life as package for sale: \n3 years. \n \nReconstituted product: \nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 8 hours between 2\u00b0 and 30 \u00b0C after \ndissolving with water for injection. \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nDo not store above 25 \u00b0C. \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nEach pack contains: \n \n2 colourless glass vials (type I) with a rubber (butyl) closure and an aluminium flip-off cap, containing \n0.56 mg of powder. \n2 pre-filled glass syringes (borosilicate, type I) for single use, with a bromobutyl plunger stopper and a \nbromobutyl rubber tip cap, containing 10 ml of solvent. \n2 reconstitution spikes \n2 needles 19 G1 \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nIncompatibility of some prefilled glass syringes (including Rapilysin) with certain needle free \nconnectors has been reported. Therefore, the compatibility of the glass syringe and intravenous access \nshould be ensured before use. In case of incompatibility an adaptor can be used and removed together \nwith the glass syringe immediately after administration \n \nUse aseptic technique throughout. \n \n1. Remove the protective flip-cap from the vial of Rapilysin 10 U and clean the rubber closure \n\nwith an alcohol wipe. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n2. Open the package containing the reconstitution spike, remove both protective caps from the \n\nreconstitution spike. \n \n3. Insert the spike through the rubber closure into the vial of Rapilysin 10 U. \n \n4. Take the 10 ml syringe out of the package. Remove the tip cap from the syringe. Connect the \n\nsyringe to the reconstitution spike and transfer the 10 ml of solvent into the vial of Rapilysin \n10 U. \n\n \n5. With the reconstitution spike and syringe still attached to the vial, swirl the vial gently to \n\ndissolve the Rapilysin 10 U powder. DO NOT SHAKE. \n \n6. The reconstituted preparation results in a clear, colourless solution. If the solution is not clear \n\nand colourless it should be discarded. \n \n7. Withdraw 10 ml of Rapilysin 10 U solution back into the syringe. A small amount of solution \n\nmay remain in the vial due to overfill. \n \n8. Disconnect the syringe from the reconstitution spike. The dose is now ready for intravenous \n\nadministration \n \n9. The reconstituted solution must be used immediately. Visual inspection of the solution is \n\nnecessary after reconstitution. Only clear, colourless solutions should be injected. If the solution \nis not clear and colourless it should be discarded. \n\n \n10. No other medicines should be injected through the line reserved for Rapilysin either at the same \n\ntime, or prior to, or following Rapilysin injection. This applies to all products including heparin \nand acetylsalicylic acid, which should be administered before and following the administration \nof reteplase to reduce the risk of re-thrombosis \n\n \n11. In those patients where the same line has to be used, this line (including Y-line) must be flushed \n\nthoroughly with a 0.9 % sodium chloride or 5 % glucose solution prior to and following the \nRapilysin injection (see section 4.2 Posology and method of administration). \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Rapilysin is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before Rapilysin is given to you \n3. How to use Rapilysin \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Rapilysin \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rapilysin is and what it is used for \n \nRapilysin contains the active substance reteplase(a recombinant plasminogen activator). It is a \nthrombolytic medicine used to dissolve blood clots that have formed in certain blood vessels and to \nrestore the blood flow in these blocked vessels (=thrombolysis). \n \nRapilysin is used after an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in order to dissolve the blood clot \ncausing the heart attack. It is given within 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before Rapilysin is given to you \n \nThe doctor will ask you questions before giving you Rapilysin, to find out if you have an increased \nrisk of bleeding. \n \nDo not use Rapilysin \n\u2022 if you are allergic to reteplase or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \n\u2022 if you have a bleeding disorder. \n\u2022 if you are taking medicine to thin your blood (oral anticoagulants, e.g. warfarin). \n\u2022 if you have a brain tumour or a malformed blood vessel or a vessel wall dilatation (aneurysm) in \n\nthe brain. \n\u2022 if you have other tumours associated with an increased risk of bleeding. \n\u2022 if you have had a stroke. \n\u2022 if you have had external heart massage within the past 10 days. \n\u2022 if you have severe uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension). \n\u2022 if you have an ulcer in the stomach or small intestine. \n\u2022 if you have enlarged blood vessels in the gullet (oesophagus) (frequently caused by liver \n\ndisease). \n\u2022 if you have severe liver or kidney disease. \n\u2022 if you have acute inflammation of the pancreas or pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart), \n\nor an infection of the heart muscle (bacterial endocarditis). \n\u2022 if you have in the past 3 months had severe bleeding, a major injury or major surgery (e.g. \n\ncoronary artery bypass graft, or surgery or injury to the head or spine), given birth, or had an \norgan biopsy or other medical / surgical procedure. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nBleeding \nThe most common side effect of Rapilysin is bleeding. Therefore Rapilysin must be given only in the \npresence and under the instructions of an emergency doctor. \n \nPay careful attention to all possible bleeding sites (e.g. injection sites). Heparin, which is given \ntogether with Rapilysin, may also increase bleeding. \n \nThe risks of Rapilysin treatment may be increased if you have any of the following conditions: \n\u2022 diseases of the blood vessels in the brain \n\u2022 systolic blood pressure higher than 160 mmHg \n\u2022 bleeding in the gastrointestinal, urinary or genital tract within the past 10 days \n\u2022 high likelihood of a blood clot in the heart (e.g. as a result of narrowing of a heart valve or atrial \n\nfibrillation) \n\u2022 septic inflammation of a vein with blood clotting (septic thrombophlebitis) or blocked blood \n\nvessels at an infected site \n\u2022 age over 75 years \n\u2022 any other condition in which bleeding might be especially dangerous or might occur at a site \n\nwhere it would be difficult to control \nAt present, little data are available on the use of Rapilysin in patients with diastolic blood pressure \nhigher than 100 mmHg. \n \nAbnormal heart beats (arrhythmias) \nThrombolytic treatment may cause the heart to beat irregularly. Therefore tell the medical staff \nimmediately if you \n \n\u2022 feel palpitations or an irregular heart beat \n \nRepeated use \nAt present there is no experience with repeated use of Rapilysin. Therefore, repeated use is not \nrecommended. Antibody formation to the reteplase molecule has not been seen. \n \nChildren \nSafety and effectiveness of Rapilysin in children have not been established. Treatment of children with \nRapilysin is not recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Rapilysin: \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nHeparin and other medicines that thin the blood (anticoagulants) and acetylsalicylic acid (a substance \nused in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever) may increase the risk of bleeding. \n \nFor information on medicines that should not be physically mixed with Rapilysin solution for \ninjection, see section 3. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nPregnancy \nThere is no experience with Rapilysin in pregnant women. Therefore it should not be used except in \nlife-threatening situations. You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or think you are pregnant. \nYour doctor can tell you the risks and benefits of using Rapilysin during pregnancy. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nBreast-feeding \nYou should not breast-feed your baby during treatment with Rapilysin as it is not known whether \nRapilysin is excreted into mother\u2019s milk. Mother\u2019s milk should be thrown away during the first 24 \nhours after thrombolytic treatment. Discuss with your doctor when you can take up breast-feeding \nagain. \n \n \n3. How to use Rapilysin  \n \nRapilysin is usually given in a hospital. The medicine is supplied in vials as a powder for injection. \nBefore use, the powder for injection must be dissolved in the water for injection supplied in the \nprefilled syringe that is in the package. Do not add any other medicines. The resulting solution must be \nused immediately. The solution must be examined to ensure that only clear, colourless solution is \ninjected. If the solution is not clear and colourless it should be thrown away. \n \nTreatment with Rapilysin 10 U should be started as soon as possible after the symptoms of heart attack \nbegin. \n \nHeparin and Rapilysin cannot be mixed in the same solution. Other medicines may also not mix well \nwith Rapilysin. No other medicines should be added to the injection solution (see below). Rapilysin \nshould be injected preferably through an intravenous line that is used only for the injection of \nRapilysin. No other medicines should be injected through the line reserved for Rapilysin, either at the \nsame time, or before or after Rapilysin injection. This applies to all medicines including heparin and \nacetylsalicylic acid, which are given before and after Rapilysin to reduce the risk of new blood clots \nforming. \nIf the same line has to be used, this line (including Y-line) must be flushed thoroughly with a 0.9 % \nsodium chloride or 5 % glucose solution before and after the Rapilysin injection.  \n \nDosage of Rapilysin \nRapilysin is given as a 10 U injection followed by a second 10 U injection 30 minutes later (double \nbolus).  \n \nEach injection should be given slowly within 2 minutes. The injection must not be given mistakenly \noutside the vein. Therefore, be sure to tell the medical staff if you experience pain during the injection. \n \nHeparin and acetylsalicylic acid are given before and after Rapilysin to reduce the risk of new blood \nclots forming. \n \nDosage of Heparin \nThe recommended dose of heparin is 5000 I.U. given as a single injection before Rapilysin, followed \nby an infusion of 1000 I.U. per hour starting after the second Rapilysin injection. Heparin should be \ngiven for at least 24 hours, preferably for 48-72 hours, in order to keep aPTT values 1.5 to 2 times \nnormal. \n \nDosage of Acetylsalicylic Acid  \nThe dose of acetylsalicylic acid given before Rapilysin should be at least 250 mg-350 mg and should \nbe followed by 75-150 mg/day, at least until discharge from hospital. \n \nIf more Rapilysin is used than recommended \nIn the event of overdosage there may be an increased risk of bleeding. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\n\n\n24 \n\n\u2022 Bleeding at the injection site, e.g. blood blister (haematoma) \n\u2022 Chest Pain / angina, low blood pressure and heart failure /shortness of breath may reappear \n\u2022 Burning sensation when Rapilysin is injected \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Bleeding in the digestive tract (e.g. bloody or black vomit, or stools) in the gums or in the \n\nurinary or genital tract  \n\u2022 Abnormal heart beats (arrhythmias), cardiac arrest, circulatory collapse or another heart attack \n\nmay occur \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Bleeding around the heart, in the abdomen, the brain or the eyes, under the skin, from the nose \n\nor as coughed up blood \n\u2022 Damage to the heart or heart valves, or a blood clot in the lung, brain or other part of body \n\nmayoccur \n\u2022 hypersensitivity (e.g. allergic reactions) \n \nVery rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) \n\u2022 Events related to the nervous system (e.g. epileptic seizure, convulsion, speech disorder, \n\ndelirium, agitation, confusion, depression, psychosis)  \n\u2022 severe allergic reaction, causing shock or collapse \n \nSide effects of frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Blockage of blood vessels due to cholesterol (fat) \n \nCardiovascular events can be life-threatening or cause death.  \n \nPatients with systolic blood pressure over 160 mmHg have a greater risk of bleeding in the brain. The \nrisk of intracranial bleeding and fatal intracranial bleeding increases with increasing age. Blood \ntransfusions were rarely required. Death or permanent disability are not uncommon in patients who \nhave a stroke (including bleeding in the brain) or other serious bleeding problem. \n \nBe sure to tell hospital staff immediately if any of these symptoms appear.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Rapilysin \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial \nafter EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nDo not store above 25 \u00b0C.  \n \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nAfter reconstitution (\u201cwhen dissolved\u201d), the solution must be used immediately. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n \n6.

Therefore, the compatibility of the glass syringe and intravenous access \nshould be ensured before use. In case of incompatibility an adaptor can be used and removed together \nwith the glass syringe immediately after administration \n \nUse aseptic technique throughout. \n \n1. Remove the protective flip-cap from the vial of Rapilysin 10 U and clean the rubber closure \n\nwith an alcohol wipe. \n \n2. Open the package containing the reconstitution spike, remove both protective caps from the \n\nreconstitution spike. \n \n3. Insert the spike through the rubber closure into the vial of Rapilysin 10 U. \n \n4. Take the 10 ml syringe out of the package. Remove the tip cap from the syringe. Connect the \n\nsyringe to the reconstitution spike and transfer the 10 ml of solvent into the vial of Rapilysin \n10 U. \n\n \n5. With the reconstitution spike and syringe still attached to the vial, swirl the vial gently to \n\ndissolve the Rapilysin 10 U powder. DO NOT SHAKE.  \n \n6. The reconstituted preparation results in a clear, colourless solution. If the solution is not clear \n\nand colourless it should be discarded. \n \n7. Withdraw 10 ml of Rapilysin 10 U solution back into the syringe. A small amount of solution \n\nmay remain in the vial due to overfill. \n \n8. Disconnect the syringe from the reconstitution spike. The dose is now ready for intravenous \n\nadministration. \n \n9. No other medicines should be injected through the line reserved for Rapilysin either at the same \n\ntime, or prior to, or following Rapilysin injection. This applies to all products including heparin \nand acetylsalicylic acid, which should be administered before and following the administration \nof reteplase to reduce the risk of re-thrombosis. \n\n \n10. In those patients where the same line has to be used, this line (including Y-line) must be flushed \n\nthoroughly with a 0.9 % sodium chloride or 5 % glucose solution prior to and following the \nRapilysin injection. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

that is in the package. do not add any other medicines. the resulting solution must be used immediately. the solution must be examined to ensure that only clear, colourless solution is injected. if the solution is not clear and colourless it should be thrown away. treatment with rapilysin 10 u should be started as soon as possible after the symptoms of heart attack begin. heparin and rapilysin cannot be mixed in the same solution. other medicines may also not mix well with rapilysin. no other medicines should be added to the injection solution (see below). rapilysin should be injected preferably through an intravenous line that is used only for the injection of rapilysin. no other medicines should be injected through the line reserved for rapilysin, either at the same time, or before or after rapilysin injection. this applies to all medicines including heparin and acetylsalicylic acid, which are given before and after rapilysin to reduce the risk of new blood clots forming. if the same line has to be used, this line (including y-line) must be flushed thoroughly with a 0.9 % sodium chloride or 5 % glucose solution before and after the rapilysin injection. dosage of rapilysin rapilysin is given as a 10 u injection followed by a second 10 u injection 30 minutes later (double bolus). each injection should be given slowly within 2 minutes. the injection must not be given mistakenly outside the vein. therefore, be sure to tell the medical staff if you experience pain during the injection. heparin and acetylsalicylic acid are given before and after rapilysin to reduce the risk of new blood clots forming. dosage of heparin the recommended dose of heparin is 5000 i.u. given as a single injection before rapilysin, followed by an infusion of 1000 i.u. per hour starting after the second rapilysin injection. heparin should be given for at least 24 hours, preferably for 48-72 hours, in order to keep aptt values 1.5 to 2 times normal. dosage of acetylsalicylic acid the dose of acetylsalicylic acid given before rapilysin should be at least 250 mg-350 mg and should be followed by 75-150 mg/day, at least until discharge from hospital. if more rapilysin is used than recommended in the event of overdosage there may be an increased risk of bleeding.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "rapilysin", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id":
