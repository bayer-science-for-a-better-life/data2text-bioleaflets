CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEncorafenib is indicated: \n \n- in combination with binimetinib for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic \nmelanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n- in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer \n(CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, who have received prior systemic therapy (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nEncorafenib treatment should be initiated and supervised under the responsibility of a physician \nexperienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n \nMelanoma \nThe recommended dose of encorafenib is 450 mg (six 75 mg capsules) once daily, when used in \ncombination with binimetinib. \n \nColorectal cancer  \nThe recommended dose of encorafenib is 300 mg (four 75 mg capsules) once daily, when used in \ncombination with cetuximab.  \n \nDose modification \n \nMelanoma \nThe management of adverse reactions may require dose reduction, temporary interruption or treatment \ndiscontinuation of encorafenib (see Tables 1, 3 and 4). \nFor information on the posology and recommended dose modifications of binimetinib, see section 4.2 \nof binimetinib SmPC.     \n \nDose reduction recommendations for encorafenib are presented in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Recommended dose modifications for encorafenib when used in combination \n\nwith binimetinib in melanoma indication \n\nDose level Encorafenib dose  when used in combination with binimetinib \nStarting dose 450 mg once daily \n1st dose reduction 300 mg once daily \n2nd dose reduction  200 mg once daily \n\nSubsequent \nmodification \n\nThere are limited data for dose reduction to 100 mg once daily.  \nEncorafenib should be permanently discontinued if patient is unable to \ntolerate 100 mg once daily.   \n\n \nAdministration of encorafenib at a dose of 450 mg once daily as a single agent is not recommended. If \nbinimetinib is temporarily interrupted, encorafenib should be reduced at 300 mg once daily during the \ntime of binimetinib dose interruption (see section 4.2 of binimetinib Summary of Product \nCharacteristics [SmPC]) as encorafenib is not well-tolerated at the dose of 450 mg as a single agent. If \nbinimetinib is permanently discontinued, encorafenib should be discontinued. \n \nIf encorafenib is temporarily interrupted (see Tables 3 and 4), binimetinib should be interrupted. If \nencorafenib is permanently discontinued, then binimetinib should be discontinued.  \n \nIf treatment-related toxicities occur, then encorafenib and binimetinib should be dose reduced, \ninterrupted or discontinued. Dose modifications are necessary for binimetinib only (adverse reactions \nprimarily related to binimetinib) for the following: retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED), \nretinal vein occlusion (RVO), interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis, cardiac dysfunction, creatine \nphosphokinase (CK) elevation and rhabdomyolysis, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). \nIf one of these toxicities occurs, see section 4.2 of binimetinib SmPC for dose modification \ninstructions for binimetinib. \n \nColorectal cancer \nThe management of adverse reactions may require dose reduction, temporary interruption or treatment \ndiscontinuation of encorafenib (see Tables 2, 3 and 4). \nFor information on the posology and recommended dose modifications of cetuximab, see section 4.2 \nof cetuximab SmPC. \n \nDose reduction recommendations for encorafenib are presented in Table 2. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 2: Recommended dose modifications for encorafenib when used in combination \nwith cetuximab in CRC indication \n\nDose level Encorafenib dose  when used in combination with cetuximab \nStarting dose 300 mg once daily \n1st dose reduction 225 mg once daily \n2nd dose reduction  150 mg once daily \n\n \nIf encorafenib is permanently discontinued, cetuximab should be discontinued. \nIf cetuximab is permanently discontinued, encorafenib should be discontinued.  \n \nMelanoma and colorectal cancer \nDose modifications in case of adverse reactions are provided below and in Tables 3 and 4. \n \nFor new primary cutaneous malignancies: No dose modifications are required for encorafenib. \n \nFor new primary non-cutaneous RAS mutation-positive malignancies: it should be considered to \ndiscontinue encorafenib permanently. \n \nTable 3: Recommended dose modifications for encorafenib when used in combination with \n\nbinimetinib or in combination with cetuximab for selected adverse reactions \nSeverity of adverse reactiona Encorafenib \n\nCutaneous reactions \n\n• Grade 2 Encorafenib

encorafenib should be \nconsidered. \n\n• Recurrent Grade 4 adverse \nreactions \n\nEncorafenib should be permanently discontinued. \n\n \nDuration of treatment \nTreatment should continue until the patient no longer derives benefit or the development of \nunacceptable toxicity. \n \nMissed doses \nIf a dose of encorafenib is missed, the patient should only take the missed dose if it is more than \n12 hours until the next scheduled dose.  \n \nVomiting \nIn case of vomiting after administration of encorafenib, the patient should not take an additional dose \nand should take the next scheduled dose. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients aged 65 years and older (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nPatients with mild to severe hepatic impairment may have increased encorafenib exposure (see \nsection 5.2).  \nAdministration of encorafenib should be undertaken with caution at a dose of 300 mg once daily in \npatients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). \nNo dosing recommendation can be made in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe \n(Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment based on a \npopulation pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis. There are no clinical data with encorafenib in patients \nwith severe renal impairment. Therefore, the potential need for dose adjustment cannot be determined. \nEncorafenib should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of encorafenib have not yet been established in children and adolescents. No \ndata are available. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nMethod of administration  \n \nBraftovi is for oral use. The capsules are to be swallowed whole with water. They may be taken with \nor without food. The concomitant administration of encorafenib with grapefruit juice should be \navoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.5)  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEncorafenib is to be given in combination with binimetinib (for patients with BRAF V600 mutant \nunresectable or metastatic melanoma), or in combination with cetuximab (for patients with BRAF \nV600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer). For additional information on warnings and \nprecautions associated with binimetinib or cetuximab treatment, see section 4.4 of binimetinib \nSmPC or cetuximab SmPC. \n \nBRAF mutation testing \n \nBefore taking encorafenib, patients must have unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 \nmutation or metastatic colorectal cancer with BRAF V600E mutation confirmed by a validated test. \nThe efficacy and safety of encorafenib have been established only in patients with melanoma tumours \nexpressing BRAF V600E and V600K mutations or colorectal tumours expressing BRAF V600E \nmutation. Encorafenib should not be used in patients with wild type BRAF malignant melanoma or \nwild type BRAF colorectal cancer. \n \nEncorafenib in combination with binimetinib in patients who have progressed on a BRAF inhibitor \n \nThere are limited data for the use of the combination of encorafenib with binimetinib in patients who \nhave progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor given for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic \nmelanoma with BRAF V600 mutation. These data show that the efficacy of the combination would be \nlower in these patients.  \n  \nEncorafenib in combination with binimetinib in patients with brain metastases \n \nThere are limited efficacy data with the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib in patients with a \nBRAF V600 mutant melanoma which have metastasised to the brain (see section 5.1). \n \nLeft ventricular dysfunction (LVD) \n \nLVD defined as symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction has been reported when \nencorafenib is used in combination with binimetinib. It is recommended that left ventricular ejection \nfraction (LVEF) is assessed by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan before \ninitiation of encorafenib and binimetinib, one month after initiation, and then at approximately 3-\nmonth intervals or more frequently as clinically indicated, while on treatment. If during treatment \nLVD occurs, see section 4.2 of binimetinib SmPC.  \nThe safety of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib has not been established in patients with a \nbaseline LVEF that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limits of normal. Therefore, in \nthese patients, binimetinib should be used with caution and for any symptomatic left ventricular \ndysfunction, Grade 3-4 LVEF decrease or for absolute decrease of LVEF from baseline of ≥ 10%, \nbinimetinib and encorafenib should be discontinued and LVEF should be evaluated every 2 weeks \nuntil recovery.  \n \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nHaemorrhages, including major haemorrhagic events, can occur with encorafenib (see section 4.8). \nThe risk of haemorrhage may be increased with concomitant use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet \ntherapy. The occurrence of Grade ≥3 haemorrhagic events should be managed with dose interruption \nor treatment discontinuation (see Table 4 in section 4.2) and as clinically indicated. \n \nOcular toxicities \n \nOcular toxicities including uveitis, iritis, and iridocyclitis can occur when encorafenib is administered. \nRPED has also been reported in patients treated with encorafenib in combination with binimetinib (see \nsection 4.8). \nPatients should be assessed at each visit for symptoms of new or worsening visual disturbance. If \nsymptoms of new or worsening visual disturbances including diminished central vision, blurred vision \nor loss of vision are identified, a prompt ophthalmologic examination is recommended.  \nIf uveitis including iridocyclitis and iritis occurs during treatment, see section 4.2.  \nIf during treatment patient develops RPED or RVO, see section 4.2 of binimetinib SmPC for guidance. \n \nQT prolongation \n \nQT Prolongation has been observed in patients treated with BRAF-inhibitors. A thorough QT study to \nevaluate the QT prolongation potential of encorafenib has not been conducted.  \nOverall, results suggest that single agent encorafenib has the potential to cause mild increases in heart \nrate. Across pooled combination studies of encorafenib and binimetinib at the recommended doses and \na single-agent encorafenib study, results suggest that encorafenib has the potential to result in small \nincreases in QTc interval (see section 5.1). \nThere are insufficient data to exclude a clinically significant exposure dependent QT prolongation. \nDue to the potential risk for QT prolongation, it is recommended that serum electrolytes abnormalities, \nincluding magnesium and potassium, are corrected and risk factors for QT prolongation controlled \n(e.g. congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias) before treatment initiation and during treatment. \nIt is recommended that an electrocardiogram (ECG) is assessed before initiation of encorafenib, one \nmonth after initiation, and then at approximately 3-month intervals or more frequently as clinically \nindicated, while on treatment. The occurrence of QTc prolongation can be managed with dose \nreduction, interruption or discontinuation with correction of abnormal electrolytes and control of risk \nfactors (see section 4.2). \n \nNew primary malignancies \n \nNew primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, have been observed in patients treated with \nBRAF inhibitors and can occur when encorafenib is administered (see section 4.8). \n \nCutaneous malignancies \nCutaneous malignancies such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) including \nkerathoacanthoma have been observed in patients treated with BRAF-inhibitors including encorafenib. \nNew primary melanoma has been observed in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors including \nencorafenib (see section 4.8). \nDermatologic evaluations should be performed prior to initiation of therapy with encorafenib, every \n2 months while on therapy and for up to 6 months following treatment discontinuation. Suspicious \nskin lesions should be managed with dermatological excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. \nPatients should be instructed to immediately inform their physicians if new skin lesions develop. \nEncorafenib should be continued without any dose modification.  \n \nNon-cutaneous malignancies \nBased on its mechanism of action, encorafenib may promote malignancies associated with activation \nof RAS through mutation or other mechanisms. Patients receiving encorafenib should undergo a head \nand neck examination, chest/abdomen computerised tomography (CT) scan, anal and pelvic \nexaminations (for women) and complete blood cell counts prior to initiation, during and at the end of \n\n\n\n9 \n\ntreatment as clinically appropriate. It should be considered to permanently discontinue encorafenib in \npatients who develop RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies. Benefits and risks should \nbe carefully considered before administering encorafenib to patients with a prior or concurrent cancer \nassociated with RAS mutation. \n \nLiver laboratory abnormalities \n \nLiver laboratory abnormalities including AST and ALT elevations have been observed with \nencorafenib (see section 4.8). Liver laboratory values should be monitored before initiation of \nencorafenib and monitored at least monthly during the 6 first months of treatment, then as clinically \nindicated. Liver laboratory abnormalities should be managed with dose interruption, reduction or \ntreatment discontinuation (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nAs encorafenib is primarily metabolised and eliminated via the liver, patients with mild to severe \nhepatic impairment may have increased encorafenib exposure over the range of inter-subject \nvariability exposure (see section 5.2).  \nIn the absence of clinical data, encorafenib is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe \nhepatic impairment.  \nAdministration of encorafenib should be undertaken with caution at a dose of 300 mg once daily in \npatients with mild hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).  \nCloser monitoring of encorafenib related toxicities in patients with mild hepatic impairment is \nrecommended, including clinical examination and liver function tests, with assessment of ECGs as \nclinically appropriate during treatment. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nThere are no data available in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nEncorafenib should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Creatinine \nelevation has been commonly reported with encorafenib as single agent or in combination with \nbinimetinib or cetuximab. Observed cases of renal failure including acute kidney injury and renal \nimpairment were generally associated with vomiting and dehydration. Other contributing factors \nincluded diabetes and hypertension. Blood creatinine should be monitored as clinically indicated and \ncreatinine elevation managed with dose modification or discontinuation (see Table 4 in section 4.2). \nPatients should ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on encorafenib. \n \nConcurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with encorafenib should be avoided. If \nconcomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor is necessary, patients should be carefully monitored \nfor safety (see section 4.5). \nCaution should be exercised if a moderate CYP3A inhibitor is co-administered with encorafenib. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on encorafenib \n \nEncorafenib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4. \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors  \nCo-administration of moderate (diltiazem) and strong (posaconazole) CYP3A4 inhibitors with single \ndoses of encorafenib in healthy volunteers resulted in a 2 and 3-fold increase in the area under the \nconcentration-time curve (AUC), respectively and in 44.6% and 68.3% increase in maximum \nencorafenib concentration (Cmax) respectively.  \nModel based predictions indicate that the effect of posaconazole after repeated administrations could \nbe similar for AUC (3-fold increase) and slightly greater for Cmax (2.7-fold increase). Model-based \n\n\n\n10 \n\npredictions for ketoconazole suggest an increase of approx. 5-fold for encorafenib AUC and 3 to 4-\nfold for encorafenib Cmax after administration of encorafenib 450 and 300 mg QD, respectively. \nTherefore, concomitant administration of encorafenib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be \navoided (due to increased encorafenib exposure and potential increase in toxicity, see section 5.2). \nExamples of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include, but are not limited to, ritonavir, itraconazole, \nclarithromycin, telithromycin, posaconazole and grapefruit juice. If concomitant use of a strong \nCYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, patients should be carefully monitored for safety. \nModerate CYP3A4 inhibitors should be co-administered with caution. Examples of moderate \nCYP3A4 inhibitors include, but are not limited to, amiodarone, erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, \namprenavir and imatinib. When encorafenib is co-administered with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, \npatients should be carefully monitored for safety. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \nCo-administration of encorafenib with a CYP3A4 inducer was not assessed in a clinical study; \nhowever, a reduction in encorafenib exposure is likely and may result in compromised efficacy. \nExamples of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers include, but are not limited to carbamazepine, \nrifampicin, phenytoin and St. John’s Wort. Alternative agents with no or minimal CYP3A induction \npotential should be considered.  \n \nEffects of encorafenib on other medicinal products \n \nCYP substrates \nEncorafenib is both an inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4. Concomitant use with agents that are \nsubstrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., hormonal contraceptives) may result in increased toxicity or loss of \nefficacy of these agents. Agents that are CYP3A4 substrates should be co-administered with caution.  \nEncorafenib is an inhibitor of UGT1A1. Concomitant agents that are substrates of UGT1A1 (e.g. \nraltegravir, atorvastatin, dolutegravir) may have increased exposure and should be therefore \nadministered with caution.  \n \nEffect of encorafenib on binimetinib \nWhile encorafenib is a relatively potent reversible inhibitor of UGT1A1, no differences in binimetinib \nexposure have been observed clinically when binimetinib was co-administered with encorafenib. \n \nTransporter substrates \nEncorafenib potentially inhibits a number of transporters. Agents that are substrates of renal \ntransporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 (such as furosemide, penicillin) or agents that are substrates of the \nhepatic transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1 (such as atorvastatin, bosentan) or substrates of \nBCRP (such as methotrexate, rosuvastatin) or substrates of P-gp (e.g. posaconazole) may have \nincreased exposure and should be therefore co-administered with caution. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in females  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with encorafenib \nand for at least 1 month following the last dose. Encorafenib may decrease the efficacy of hormonal \ncontraceptives (see section 4.5). Therefore, female patients using hormonal contraception are advised \nto use an additional or alternative method such as a barrier method (e.g. condom) during treatment \nwith encorafenib and for at least 1 month following the last dose. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of encorafenib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \nEncorafenib is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. If encorafenib is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking \nencorafenib, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus.  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether encorafenib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue encorafenib therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child \nand the benefit of therapy for the mother.  \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of encorafenib on fertility in humans. Based on findings in animals, \nthe use of encorafenib may impact fertility in males of reproductive potential (see section 5.3). As the \nclinical relevance of this is unknown, male patients should be informed of the potential risk for \nimpaired spermatogenesis. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEncorafenib has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Visual disturbances have \nbeen reported in some patients treated with encorafenib during clinical studies. Patients should be \nadvised not to drive or use machines if they experience visual disturbances or any other adverse \nreactions that may affect their ability to drive and use machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile  \n \nThe safety of encorafenib (450 mg orally once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg orally \ntwice daily) was evaluated in 274 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic \nmelanoma (hereafter referred to as the pooled Combo 450 population), based on two Phase II studies \n(CMEK162X2110 and CLGX818X2109) and one Phase III study (CMEK162B2301, Part 1).  \nAt the recommended dose (n = 274) in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, the most \ncommon adverse reactions (>25%) occurring in patients treated with encorafenib administered with \nbinimetinib were fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, retinal detachment, abdominal pain, arthralgia, \nblood CK increased and myalgia.  \n \nThe safety of encorafenib (300 mg orally once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg orally \ntwice daily) was evaluated in 257 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic \nmelanoma (hereafter referred to as the Combo 300 population), based on the Phase III study \n(CMEK162B2301, Part 2). The most common adverse reactions (>25%) occurring in patients treated \nwith encorafenib 300 mg administered with binimetinib were fatigue, nausea and diarrhoea. \n \nThe encorafenib single agent (300 mg orally once daily) safety profile is based on data from \n217 patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600-mutant melanoma (hereafter referred to as \nthe pooled encorafenib 300 population). The most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (>25%) \nreported with encorafenib 300 were hyperkeratosis, alopecia, PPES, fatigue, rash, arthralgia, dry skin, \nnausea, myalgia, headache, vomiting and pruritus. \n \nThe safety of encorafenib (300 mg orally once daily) in combination with cetuximab (dosed as per its \nSmPC) was evaluated in 216 patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer, based \non the phase III study ARRAY-818-302. The most common ADRs (>25%) reported in this population \nwere: fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, dermatitis acneiform, abdominal pain, arthralgia/musculoskeletal \npain, decreased appetite, rash and vomiting. \nThe rate of all study drug discontinuation due to any adverse reaction was 1.9 % in patients treated \nwith encorafenib 300 mg in combination with cetuximab. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class and the following frequency \nconvention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), \nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse

lower \ncompared to the pooled Combo 450 population for the following adverse reactions: anemia, peripheral \nneuropathy, haemorrhage, hypertension, pruritus (common); and colitis, increased amylase and \nincreased lipase (uncommon). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCutaneous malignancies \nCutaneous squamous cell carcinoma  \nMelanoma \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, cuSCC including keratoacanthomas was observed in 3.3% \n(9/274) of patients. The median time to onset of the first event of cuSCC (all grades) was 6.5 months \n(range 1.0 to 22.8 months).  \n \nIn the pooled encorafenib 300 population, cuSCC was reported in 7.4% (16/217) patients. For patients \nin the Phase III study (CMEK162B2301) who developed cuSCC, the median time to onset of the first \nevent of cuSCC (all grades) was 2.3 months (range 0.3 to 12.0 months).  \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nColorectal cancer \nIn patients treated with encorafenib 300 mg in combination with cetuximab, cuSCC including \nkeratoacanthoma was observed in 1.4% (3/216) of patients. The times to first event of cuSCC (all \ngrades) were 0.5, 0.6 and 3.6 months for these 3 patients. \n \nNew primary melanoma \nMelanoma \nIn the pooled encorafenib 300 population, new primary melanoma events occurred in 4.1% of patients \n(9 /217) and was reported as Grade 1 in 1.4% (3/217) of patients, Grade 2 in 2.1% (4/217) of patients, \nGrade 3 in 0.5% (1/217) of patients and Grade 4 in 0.5% (1/217) of patients.  \n \nColorectal cancer \nIn patients treated with encorafenib 300 mg in combination with cetuximab, new primary melanoma \nevents occurred in 1.9% of patients (4/216) and were reported as Grade 2 in 0.9% (2/216) of patients \nand Grade 3 in 0.9% (2/216) of patients.  \n \nOcular events \nMelanoma \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, uveitis was reported in 4.4% (12/274) of patients, and was \nGrade 1 in 0.4% (1/274), Grade 2 in 3.6% (10/274) and Grade 3 in 0.4% (1/274). Visual impairment, \nincluding blurred vision and reduced visual acuity, occurred in 21.5% (59/274) of patients. Uveitis and \nvisual impairment were generally reversible.  \nRPED occurred in 29.6% (81/274) of patients, most of them had Grade 1-2 and 1.8% (5/274) had \nGrade 3 events.  \n \nIn Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, RPED was observed in 12.5% (32/257) of \npatients with 0.4% (1/257) Grade 4 event. \n \nLeft ventricular dysfunction \nLVD was reported when encorafenib is used in combination with binimetinib in melanoma patients \n(see section 4.8 of binimetinib SmPC). \n \nHaemorrhage \nMelanoma \nHaemorrhagic events were observed in 17.9% (49/274) of patients in the pooled Combo \n450 population. Most events were Grade 1 or 2 (14.6%) and 3.3% were Grade 3-4 events. Few \npatients required dose interruptions or dose reductions (0.7% or 2/274). Haemorrhagic events led to \ndiscontinuation of treatment in 1.1% (3/274) of patients. The most frequent haemorrhagic events were \nhaematuria in 3.3% (9/274) of patients, rectal haemorrhage in 2.9% (8/274) and haematochezia in \n2.9% (8/274) of patients. Fatal gastric ulcer haemorrhage, with multiple organ failure as a concurrent \ncause of death, occurred in one patient.  \nCerebral haemorrhage was reported in 1.5% (4/274) of patients, with fatal outcome in 3 patients. All \nevents occurred in the setting of new or progressive brain metastases. \n \nIn Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, haemorrhagic events were observed in 6.6% \n(17/257) of patients and were Grade 3-4 in 1.6% (4/257) of patients.  \n \nColorectal cancer  \nHaemorrhagic events were observed in 21.3% (46/216) of patients treated with encorafenib  \n300 mg in combination with cetuximab; 1.4% (3/216) of patients were Grade 3 events and one fatal \ncase was reported. Dose interruptions or dose reductions were required in 1.9% (4/216) of patients. \nHaemorrhagic events led to treatment discontinuation in 1 patient (0.5%).  \nThe most frequent haemorrhagic events were epistaxis in 6.9% (15/216) of patients, haematochezia in \n2.8% (6/216), rectal haemorrhage in 2.8% (6/216) of patients and haematuria in 2.8% (6/216) of \npatients. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nHypertension  \nHypertension was reported when encorafenib was used in combination with binimetinib in melanoma \npatients (see section 4.8 of binimetinib SmPC). \n \nVenous thromboembolism \nVTE was reported when encorafenib is used in combination with binimetinib in melanoma patients \n(see section 4.8 of binimetinib SmPC).  \n \nPancreatitis \nMelanoma \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, pancreatic enzyme elevation, mostly asymptomatic, was \nreported. Amylase and lipase elevations were reported in 3.3% (9/274) and 5.1% (14/274) of patients, \nrespectively. Pancreatitis was reported in 0.7% (2/274) of patients. Both patients experienced Grade 3 \nevents. Pancreatitis led to dose interruption in (0.4 %) 1/274 of patients.  \n \nColorectal cancer \nIn the population treated with encorafenib 300 mg in combination with cetuximab, pancreatitis grade 3 \nwith lipase and amylase increased events were reported in 1 patient (0.5%) and led to dose \ninterruption. \n \nDermatologic reactions \nRash \nMelanoma \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, rash occurred in 19.7% (54/274) of patients. Most events were \nmild, with Grade 3 or 4 events reported in 0.7% (2/274) of patients. Rash led to discontinuation in \n0.4% (1/274) patients and to dose interruption or dose modification in 1.1% (3/274) of patients. \n \nIn the pooled encorafenib 300 population, rash was reported in 43.3% (94/217) of patients. Most \nevents were mild, with Grade 3 or 4 events reported in 4.6% (10/217) of patients. Rash led to \ndiscontinuation in 0.5% (1/217) of patients and to dose interruption or dose modification in 7.4% \n(16/217) of patients. \n \nColorectal cancer \nIn patients treated with encorafenib 300 mg in combination with cetuximab, rash occurred in 30.6% \n(66/216) of patients. Most events were mild, with Grade 3 event reported in 0.5% (1/216) of patients. \nRash led to dose interruption in 0.5% (1/216) of patients.  \n \nPalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES)  \nMelanoma \nPPES was reported in 6.2% (17/274) of patients in the pooled Combo 450 population. All the PPES \nadverse reactions were either Grade 1 (3.3%) or Grade 2 (2.9%). Dose interruption or dose \nmodification occurred in 1.1% (3/274) of patients.  \n \nIn the Combo 300 arm in Part 2 of the pivotal study, PPES was observed in 3.9% (10/257) of patients \nwith Grade 3 reported in 0.4% (1/257) of patients. \n  \nIn the pooled encorafenib 300 population, PPES was reported in 51.6% (112/217) of patients. Most \nevents were mild-moderate: Grade 1 in 12.4% (27/217) of patients, Grade 2 in 26.7% (58/217) and \nGrade 3 in 12.4% (27/217) of patients. PPES led to discontinuation in 4.1% (9/217) of patients and to \ndose interruption or dose modification in 23.0% (50/217) of patients. \n \nColorectal cancer \nIn the population treated with encorafenib 300 mg in combination with cetuximab, PPES was reported \nin 5.1% (11/216) of patients. Most of PPES adverse reactions were either Grade 1 in 3.7 % (8/216). \nGrade 2 events were reported in 0.9% (2/216) of patients, and Grade 3 in 0.5% (1/216) of patients. No \ndose interruption, dose modification or treatment discontinuation was required.  \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nDermatitis acneiform \nMelanoma \nDermatitis acneiform was reported when encorafenib is used in combination with binimetinib (see \nsection 4.8 of binimetinib SmPC). \n \nColorectal cancer \nIn patients treated with encorafenib 300 mg in combination with cetuximab, dermatitis acneiform \noccurred in 33.3% (72/216) of patients and was mostly Grade 1 (25.5% (55 /216) of patients), or 2 \n(6.9% (15 /216) of patients). Dose reduction or interruption was reported in 2.3 % (5/216) of patients. \nNo treatment discontinuation was reported. Dermatitis acneiform was generally reversible. \n \nPhotosensitivity \nMelanoma \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, photosensitivity was observed in 4.0% (11/274) of patients. \nMost events were Grade 1-2, with Grade 3 reported in 0.4% (1/274) of patients and no event led to \ndiscontinuation. Dose interruption or dose modification was reported in 0.4% (1/274) of patients.  \n \nIn the pooled encorafenib 300 population, photosensitivity was reported in 4.1% (9/217) of patients. \nAll events were Grade 1-2. No event required discontinuation, dose modification or interruption. \n \nFacial paresis \nMelanoma \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, facial paresis occurred in 0.7% (2/274) of patients including \nGrade 3 in 0.4% (1/274) of patients. The events were reversible, and no event led to treatment \ndiscontinuation. Dose interruption or modification was reported in 0.4% (1/274) of patients. \n \nIn the pooled encorafenib 300 population, facial paresis was observed in 7.4% (16/217) of patients. \nMost events were mild-moderate: Grade 1 in 2.3% (5/217); Grade 2 in 3.7% (8/217) and Grade 3 in \n1.4% (3/217) of patients. The median time to onset of the first event of facial paresis was 0.3 months \n(range 0.1 to 12.1 months). Facial paresis was generally reversible and led to treatment discontinuation \nin 0.9% (2/217). Dose interruption or modification was reported in 3.7% (8/217) and symptomatic \ntreatment including corticosteroids was reported in 5.1% (11/217) of patients. \n \nCK elevation and rhabdomyolysis \nCK elevation and rhabdomyolysis occurred when encorafenib is used in combination with binimetinib \nin melanoma patients (see section 4.8 of binimetinib SmPC). \n \nRenal dysfunction \nMelanoma \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, mild, mostly Grade 1, asymptomatic blood creatinine elevation \nwas noted in 6.2% (17/274) of patients treated with the Combo 450 mg. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 \nelevation was 0.7% (2/274). Renal failure events, including acute kidney injury and renal impairment, \nwere reported in 3.3% (9/274) patients treated with encorafenib and binimetinib with Grade 3 or 4 \nevents in 2.2% (6/274) of patients. Renal failure was generally reversible with dose interruption, \nrehydration and other general supportive measures.  \n \nColorectal cancer \nBlood creatinine elevation was reported in 2.8% (6/216) of patients treated with encorafenib 300 mg in \ncombination with cetuximab. All were mild except one event of Grade 4. Renal failure events were \nGrade 3 or 4 and reported as acute kidney injury in 1.9 % (4/216) of patients and renal failure in 0.5% \n(1/216) of patients. \n \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nLiver laboratory abnormality  \nMelanoma \nThe incidences of liver laboratory abnormalities reported in the pooled Combo 450 population are \nlisted below:  \n\n• Increased transaminases: 15.7% (43/274) overall – Grade 3-4: 5.5% (15/274) \n• Increased GGT: 14.6% (40/274) overall – Grade 3-4: 8.4% (23/274) \n\n \nIn Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, the incidence of liver laboratory \nabnormalities was:  \n\n• Increased transaminases: 13.2% (34/257) overall – Grade 3-4: 5.4% (14/257) \n• Increased GGT: 14.0% (36/257) overall – Grade 3-4: 4.7% (12/257) \n\n \nColorectal cancer \nThe incidence of increased transaminases in patients treated with encorafenib 300 mg in combination \nwith cetuximab was 8.8% (19/216) of patients, with Grade 3 in 1.4% (3/216) of patients. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders   \nMelanoma \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, diarrhoea was observed in 38% (104/274) of patients and was \nGrade 3-4 in 3.3% (9/274) patients. Diarrhoea led to treatment discontinuation in 0.4% of patients and \nto dose interruption or dose modification in 4.4% of patients.   \nConstipation occurred in 24.1% (66/274) of patients and was Grade 1 or 2. Abdominal pain was \nreported in 27.4% (75/274) of patients and was Grade 3 in 2.6% (7/274) patients. Nausea occurred in \n41.6% (114/274) with Grade 3 or 4 observed in 2.6% (7/274) of patients.

Diarrhoea led to treatment \ndiscontinuation in 0.5% (1/216) of patients and to dose interruption or dose modification in 3.7% \n(8/216) of patients.   \n \nAbdominal pain was reported in 36.6% (79/216) of patients and was Grade 3 in 5.1% (11/216) of \npatients. Nausea occurred in 38.0% (82/216) of patients with Grade 3 observed in 0.5% (1/216) of \npatients. Vomiting occurred in 27.3% (59/216) of patients with Grade 3 reported in 1.4 % (3/216) of \npatients. Constipation occurred in 18.1% (39/216) of patients and was Grade 1 or 2. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders were typically managed with standard therapy. \n \nAnaemia \nMelanoma \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, anaemia was reported in 19.7% (54/274) of patients; 4.7% \n(13/274) patients had a Grade 3 or 4. No patients discontinued treatment due to anaemia, 1.5% (4/274) \nrequired dose interruption or dose modification. \n \nIn Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, anaemia was observed in 9.7% (25/257) of \npatients with Grade 3-4 reported in 2.7% (7/257) patients.  \n \nHeadache \nMelanoma \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, headache occurred in 21.5% (59/274) of patients, including \nGrade 3 in 1.5% (4/274) of patients.  \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nIn Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, headache was reported in 12.1% (31/257) of \npatients and was Grade 3 in 0.4% (1/257) of patients. \n \nColorectal cancer \nIn patients treated with encorafenib 300 mg in combination with cetuximab, headache occurred in \n20.4% (44/216) of patients and was Grade 1 or 2. \n \nFatigue \nMelanoma \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, fatigue occurred in 43.8% (120/274) of patients including Grade \n3 in 2.9% (8/274) of patients.  \n \nIn Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, fatigue was observed in 33.5% (86/257) of \npatients with 1.6% (4/257) Grade 3-4 events. \n \nColorectal cancer \nIn patients treated with encorafenib 300 mg in combination with cetuximab, fatigue was reported in \n56.9% (123/216) of patients including Grade 3 in 7.9% (17/216) of patients. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nMelanoma \nIn patients treated with Combo 450 (n = 274), 194 patients (70.8%) were <65 years old, 65 patients \n(23.7%) were 65 -74 years old and 15 patients (5.5%) were aged > 75. No overall differences in safety \nor efficacy were observed between elderly patients (≥ 65) and younger patients. The proportions of \npatients experiencing adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) were similar in patients \naged <65 years and those aged ≥65 years. The most common AEs reported with a higher incidence in \npatients aged ≥ 65 years compared to patients aged < 65 years included diarrhoea, pruritus, GGT and \nblood phosphatase alkaline elevation.  \n \nColorectal cancer \nIn patients treated with encorafenib 300 mg in combination with cetuximab (n=216), 134 patients (62 \n%) were < 65 years old, 62 patients (28.7%) were 65-74 years old and 20 patients (9.3%) were aged  \n≥ 75. The most common AEs reported with a higher incidence in patients aged ≥ 65 years compared to \npatients aged < 65 years included, anaemia, asthenia, decreased appetite and dyspnoea.  \n \nIn both melanoma and colorectal cancer populations, due to a very small number of patients treated in \nthe age subgroup of patients aged ≥ 75 years, differences in the incidence of AEs compared to patients \naged < 75 years could not be assessed. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nAt doses of encorafenib between 600 to 800 mg once daily, renal dysfunction (Grade 3 \nhypercreatinaemia) was observed in 3 out of 14 patients. The highest administered dose occurred as a \ndosing error in one patient who took encorafenib at a dose of 600 mg twice daily for 1 day (total dose \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n20 \n\n1200 mg). Adverse reactions reported by this patient were Grade 1 events of nausea, vomiting and \nblurred vision; all subsequently resolved. \n \nManagement \n \nThere is no specific treatment for overdose.  \nSince encorafenib is moderately bound to plasma proteins, haemodialysis is likely to be ineffective in \nthe treatment of overdose with encorafenib. There is no known antidote for encorafenib. In the event \nof an overdose, encorafenib treatment should be interrupted and renal function must be monitored as \nwell as adverse reactions. Symptomatic treatment and supportive care should be provided as needed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agent, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01XE46 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nEncorafenib is a potent and highly selective ATP-competitive small molecule RAF kinase inhibitor. \nThe half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of encorafenib against BRAF V600E, BRAF and \nCRAF enzymes was determined to be 0.35, 0.47 and 0.30 nM, respectively. The encorafenib \ndissociation half-life was >30 hours and resulted in prolonged pERK inhibition. Encorafenib \nsuppresses the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in tumour cells expressing several mutated forms of BRAF \nkinase (V600E, D and K). Specifically, encorafenib inhibits in vitro and in vivo BRAF V600E, D and \nK mutant melanoma cell growth and BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer cell growth. Encorafenib \ndoes not inhibit RAF/MEK/ERK signalling in cells expressing wild-type BRAF. \n \nCombination with binimetinib  \nEncorafenib and binimetinib (a MEK inhibitor, see section 5.1 of binimetinib SmPC) both inhibit the \nMAPK pathway, resulting in higher anti-tumour activity. \nAdditionally, the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib prevented the emergence of resistance in \nBRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in vivo.  \n \nCombination with cetuximab \nOne of the main mechanisms of resistance of BRAF-mutant CRC to RAF inhibitors has been \nidentified as the re-activation of EGFR with bypassing signal transduction via BRAF. Combinations of \na BRAF inhibitor, e.g.encorafenib and agents targeting EGFR, e.g. cetuximab have shown to improve \nanti-tumour efficacy in non-clinical models.   \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nBRAF V600 Mutant Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma \nThe safety and efficacy of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib were evaluated in a 2-part \nPhase III, randomised (1:1:1) active-controlled, open-label, multicentre study in patients with \nunresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 E or K mutant melanoma (Study CMEK162B2301), as \ndetected using a BRAF assay. Patients had histologically confirmed cutaneous or unknown primary \nmelanoma but those with uveal or mucosal melanoma were excluded. Patients were permitted to \nreceive prior adjuvant therapy and one prior line of immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced \nor metastatic disease. Prior treatment with BRAF/ MEK inhibitors was not allowed.  \n \nStudy CMEK162B2301, Part 1 \nIn Part 1, patients in the study were randomised to receive encorafenib 450 mg orally daily and \nbinimetinib 45 mg orally twice daily (Combo 450, n = 192), encorafenib 300 mg orally daily \n(Enco 300, n = 194), or vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily (hereafter referred to as Vem, n = 191). \nTreatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was stratified \n\n\n\n21 \n\nby American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage (IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a or IVM1b, vs IVM1c) and \nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs 1) and prior immunotherapy \nfor unresectable or metastatic disease (yes vs no).  \n \nThe primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) of Combo 450 compared \nwith vemurafenib as assessed by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC). PFS as assessed by \ninvestigators (investigator assessment) was a supportive analysis. An additional secondary endpoint \nincluded PFS of Combo 450 compared with Enco 300. Other secondary efficacy comparisons between \nCombo 450 and either vemurafenib or Enco 300 included overall survival (OS), objective response \nrate (ORR), duration of response (DoR) and disease control rate (DCR) as assessed by BIRC and by \ninvestigator assessment. \n \nThe median age of patients was 56 years (range 20-89), 58% were male, 90% were Caucasian, and \n72% of patients had baseline ECOG performance status of 0. Most patients had metastatic disease \n(95%) and were Stage IVM1c (64%); 27% of patients had elevated baseline serum lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH), and 45% of patients had at least 3 organs with tumour involvement at baseline \nand 3.5% had brain metastases. 27 patients (5%) had received prior checkpoint inhibitors (anti-\nPD1/PDL1 or ipilimumab) (8 patients in Combo 450 arm (4%); 7 patients in vemurafenib arm (4%); \n12 patients in Enco 300 arm (6%) including 22 patients in the metastatic setting (6 patients in Combo \n450 arm; 5 patients in vemurafenib arm; 11 patients in Enco 300 arm) and 5 patients in the adjuvant \nsetting (2 patients in Combo 450 arm; 2 patients in vemurafenib arm; 1 patient in Enco 300 arm). \n \nThe median duration of exposure was 11.7 months in patients treated with Combo 450, 7.1 months in \npatients treated with Enco 300 and 6.2 months in patients treated with vemurafenib. The median \nrelative dose intensity (RDI) for Combo 450 was 100% for encorafenib and 99.6% for binimetinib; the \nmedian RDI was 86.2% for Enco 300 and 94.5% for vemurafenib. \n \nPart 1 of Study CMEK162B2301 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the \npatients treated with Combo 450 compared with patients treated with vemurafenib. Table 6 and \nFigure 1 summarise the PFS and other efficacy results based on central review of the data by a blinded \nindependent radiology committee.  \n \nThe efficacy results based on investigator assessment were consistent with the independent central \nassessment.

A definitive 10% deterioration in FACT-M and in EORTC QLQ-\nC30 was significantly delayed in patients treated with Combo 450 relative to other treatments. The \nmedian time to definitive 10% deterioration in the FACT-M score was not reached in the Combo 450 \narm and was 22.1 months (95% CI: 15.2, NE) in the vemurafenib arm with a HR for the difference of \n0.46 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.72). An analysis of time to definitive 10% deterioration in EORTC QLQ-C30 \nscore provided with similar results. \nPatients receiving Combo 450 reported no change or a slight improvement in the mean change from \nbaseline EQ-5D-5L index score at all visits, whilst patients receiving vemurafenib or encorafenib \nreported decreases at all visits (with statistical significant differences). An evaluation of change over \ntime in score yielded the same trend for EORTC QLQ-C30 and at all visit for FACT-M.  \n \nStudy CMEK162B2301, Part 2: \nPart 2 of Study CMEK162B2301 was designed to assess the contribution of binimetinib to the \nencorafenib and binimetinib combination. \nThe PFS for encorafenib 300 mg orally daily used in combination with binimetinib 45 mg orally twice \ndaily (Combo 300, n = 258) was compared to the PFS for Enco 300 (n = 280, including 194 patients \nfrom Part 1 and 86 patients from Part 2). Enrolment in Part 2 started after all Part 1 patients were \nrandomised.  \n \nPreliminary Part 2 data, at a cut-off date of 9 November 2016, demonstrated the contribution of \nbinimetinib with an improved median PFS estimate of 12.9 months (95% CI: 10.1, 14.0) for \nCombo 300 compared to 9.2 months (95% CI: 7.4, 11.0) for Enco 300 (Parts 1 and 2) per independent \ncentral review (BIRC). Similar results were observed per Investigator assessment.  \nThe confirmed ORR per BIRC was 65.9% (95% CI: 59.8, 71.7) for Combo 300 and 50.4% (95% CI: \n44.3, 56.4) for Enco 300 (Parts 1 and 2). Median DOR for confirmed responses per BIRC was \n12.7 months [95% CI: 9.3, 15.1] for Combo 300 and 12.9 months [95% CI: 8.9, 15.5] for Enco 300. \nThe median duration of treatment was longer for Combo 300 vs Enco 300, 52.1 weeks vs 31.5 weeks. \n \nCardiac Electrophysiology \nIn the safety analysis of pooled studies, the incidence of new QTcF prolongation >500 ms was \n0.7% (2/268) in the encorafenib 450 mg plus binimetinib group, and 2.5% (5/203) in the encorafenib \nsingle agent group. QTcF prolongation of >60 ms compared to pre-treatment values was observed in \n4.9% (13/268) patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, and in 3.4% (7/204) in the \nencorafenib single agent group (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nBRAF V600E Mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer - Study ARRAY-818-302 \nEncorafenib in combination with cetuximab was evaluated in a randomised, active-controlled, open-\nlabel, multicentre trial (ARRAY 818-302 BEACON CRC). Eligible patients were required to have \nBRAF V600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer that had progressed after 1 or 2 prior regimens. \nEnrolled patients were eligible to receive cetuximab per locally approved label with regards to tumour \nRAS status. Prior use of RAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors or EGFR inhibitors was prohibited. \nRandomisation was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, \nprior use of irinotecan and cetuximab source.  \n \nA total of 665 patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive encorafenib 300 mg orally daily in \ncombination with cetuximab dosed as per its approved SmPC (n=220), or encorafenib 300 mg orally \ndaily in combination with binimetinib 45 mg orally twice daily and cetuximab dosed as per its \napproved SmPC (n=224) or Control (irinotecan with cetuximab or irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic \nacid (FOLFIRI) with cetuximab, n= 221). Treatment continued until disease progression or \nunacceptable toxicity. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nThe efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR) as \nassessed by a blinded independent central review committee (BIRC), comparing encorafenib 300 mg \nin combination with cetuximab versus Control. Other efficacy measures are summarised in Table 8 \nbelow. \n \nThe median age of patients was 61 years (range 26-91), 47 % were male and 83% were white. 51% of \npatients had baseline ECOG performance status of 0, and 51% received prior irinotecan. 46.8% of \npatients had at least 3 organs with tumour involvement at baseline.  \nThe median duration of exposure was 3.2 months in patients treated with encorafenib 300 mg in \ncombination with cetuximab, and 1.4 months in patients treated with irinotecan/cetuximab or \nFOLFIRI/cetuximab (Control arm).  In patients treated with the combination of encorafenib 300 mg \nand cetuximab, the median relative dose intensity (RDI) was 98% for encorafenib and 93.5% for \ncetuximab. In the control arm, the median RDI was 85.4% for cetuximab, 75.7% for irinotecan and in \nthe subset of patients who received Folinic acid and 5-FU, the median RDI was 75.2% and 75% \nrespectively.  \n \nEncorafenib 300 mg in combination with cetuximab demonstrated a statistically significant \nimprovement in OS, ORR and PFS compared to Control. Efficacy results are summarised in Table 8 \nand Figures 3 and 4. \n \nThe efficacy results based on investigator assessment were consistent with the independent central \nassessment. \n \nTable 8: Study ARRAY-818-302: Efficacy Results \n\n \nEncorafenib with cetuximab  Irinotecan with cetuximab or \n\nFOLFIRI with cetuximab (Control) \n\nCut-off date: 11 February 2019 (Primary analysis) \n\nOS \n\nNumber of patientsa 220 221 \nNumber of events (%) 93 (42.3) 114 (51.6) \n\nMedian, months (95% \nCI) \n\n8.4 (7.5-11.0) 5.4 (4.8, 6.6) \n\nHR (95% CI)b,c  (vs \nControl) \np-valueb,c \n\n0.60 (0.41-0.88) \n \n0.0002 \n\n \n\nMedian duration of \nfollow-up, months \n  (95% CI) \n\n7.6  \n \n(6.4, 9.20) \n\n7.2  \n \n(6.1, 8.1) \n\nORR (per BIRC) \n\nNumber of patientse 113 107 \nORR n (%) \n(95% CI)f \n\n23 (20.4) \n(13.4, 29.0) \n\n2 (1.9) \n(0.2, 6.6) \n\nP-valueb,d,g <0.0001  \n\nCR, n (%) 6 (5.3) 0 \nPR, n (%) 17 (15.0) 2 (1.9) \nSD, n (%) 57 (50.4) 26 (24.3) \nDCR, n (%) \n(95% CI)f \n\n84 (74.3) \n(65.3, 82.1) \n\n33 (30.8) \n(22.3, 40.5) \n\n\n\n27 \n\nPFS (per BIRC) \n\nNumber of patientsa 220 221 \nNumber of events (%) 133 (60.5) 128 (57.9) \nMedian PFS, months \n(95% CI) \n\n4.2 (3.7, 5.4) 1.5 (1.5, 1.7) \n\nHR (95% CI)b,c \nP-valueb,d \n\n0.40 (0.30, 0.55 \n< 0.0001   \n\n \n\nUpdated analysis, cut-off date: 15 August 2019 \nOS \n\nNumber of patientsa 220 221 \n\nNumber of events (%) 128 (58.2) 157 (71.0) \n\nMedian, months (95% \nCI) \n\n9.3 (8.0, 11.3) 5.9 (5.1, 7.1) \n\nHR (95% CI)b  (vs \nControl) \np-valueb,d,h \n\n0.61 (0.48, 0.77) \n \n< 0.0001 \n\n \n\nMedian duration of \nfollow-up, months  \n(95% CI) \n\n12.3 \n \n(11.1, 14.1) \n\n12.9  \n \n(10.9, 14.6) \n\nORR (per BIRC) \n\nNumber of patientsa 220 221 \nORR n (%) \n(95% CI)f \n\n43 (19.5) \n(14.5, 25.4) \n\n4 (1.8) \n(0.5, 4.6) \n\np-valueb,d,g,h <0.0001  \nCR, n (%) 7 (3.2) 0 \nPR, n (%) 36 (16.4) 4 (1.8) \nSD, n (%) 117 (53.2) 59 (26.7) \nDCR, n (%) \n(95% CI)f \n\n167 (75.9) \n(69.7, 81.4) \n\n69 (31.2) \n(25.2, 37.8) \n\nPFS (per BIRC) \n\nNumber of patientsa 220 221 \nNumber of events (%) 167 (75.9) 147 (66.5) \nMedian PFS, months \n(95% CI) \n\n4.3 \n (4.1, 5.5) \n\n1.5 \n(1.5, 1.9) \n\nHR (95% CI)b \nP-valueb,d, h \n\n0.44 (0.35, 0.55) \n< 0.0001 \n\n \n\nCI = Confidence interval; CR = Complete response; HR = Hazard ratio; ORR = Overall response rate; OS = \nOverall survival; PR = Partial response; SD = Stable disease, DCR: Disease control rate (CR+PR+SD+Non-\nCR/Non-PD; Non-CR/Non-PD applies only to patients with a non-measurable disease who did not achieve CR \nor have PD) \na Randomised Phase 3, Full Analysis Set \nb Stratified by ECOG PS, source of cetuximab, and prior irinotecan use at randomization \nc Repeated CI derived using Lan DeMets O’Brien-Fleming boundaries associated with the observed \n\ninformation fraction at the interim analysis \nd 1-sided \ne Among the first 331 randomised patients \nf Clopper-Pearson’s method \ng Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test \nh Nominal p-value \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nFigure 3: Study ARRAY-818-302: Kaplan-Meier plot of Overall Survival (cut-off \ndate: 11 February 2019) \n\n \nFigure 4: Study ARRAY-818-302: Kaplan-Meier plot of Overall Survival (cut-off \n\ndate: 15 August 2019) \n\n \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nCardiac Electrophysiology \nIn the safety analysis of the Phase 3 (ARRAY-818-302) safety set in colorectal indication, the \nincidence of new QTcF prolongation >500 ms was 3.2% (7/216) and QTcF prolongation of >60 ms \ncompared to pre-treatment values was observed in 8.8% (19/216) of patients of the encorafenib + \ncetuximab arm (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nencorafenib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in melanoma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nencorafenib in all subsets of the paediatric population in colorectal carcinoma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of encorafenib were studied in healthy subjects and patients with solid tumours, \nincluding advanced and unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma harbouring a BRAF-V600E or \nK mutation, and in adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation. The \npharmacokinetics of encorafenib have been shown to be approximatively dose linear after single and \nmultiples doses. After repeat once-daily dosing, steady-state conditions were reached within 15 days. \nThe accumulation ratio of approximately 0.5 is likely due to auto-induction of CYP3A4. The \ninter-subject variability (CV%) of AUC is ranged from 12.3% to 68.9%.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration, encorafenib is rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax of 1.5 to 2 hours. \nFollowing a single oral dose of 100 mg [14C] encorafenib in healthy subjects, at least 86% of the \nencorafenib dose was absorbed. Administration of a single 100 mg dose of encorafenib with a high-\nfat, high-calorie meal decreased the Cmax by 36%, while the AUC was unchanged. A drug interaction \nstudy in healthy subjects indicated the extent of encorafenib exposure was not altered in the presence \nof a gastric pH-altering agent (rabeprazole). \n \nDistribution \n \nEncorafenib is moderately (86.1%) bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. Following a single oral \ndose of 100 mg [14C] encorafenib in healthy subjects, the mean (SD) blood-to-plasma concentration \nratio is 0.58 (0.02) and the mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of encorafenib is \n226 L (32.7%). \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing a single oral dose of 100 mg [14C] encorafenib in healthy subjects, metabolism was found to \nbe the major clearance pathway for encorafenib (approximately 88% of the recovered radioactive \ndose). The predominant biotransformation reaction of encorafenib was N-dealkylation. Other major \nmetabolic pathways involved hydroxylation, carbamate hydrolysis, indirect glucuronidation and \nglucose conjugate formation.  \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing a single oral dose of 100 mg [14C] encorafenib in healthy subjects, radioactivity was \neliminated equally in both the faeces and urine (mean of 47.2%). In urine, 1.8% of the radioactivity \nwas excreted as encorafenib. The mean (CV%) apparent clearance (CL/F) of encorafenib was 27.9 L/h \n(9.15%). The median (range) encorafenib terminal half-life (T1/2) was 6.32 h (3.74 to 8.09 h). \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nMedicinal product interactions \n \nNo drug drug interaction was evidenced between encorafenib and cetuximab. \n \nEffect of CYP enzymes on encorafenib  \nEncorafenib is metabolised by CYP3A4, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. In vitro, CYP3A4 was predicted to \nbe the major enzyme contributing to total oxidative clearance of encorafenib in human liver \nmicrosomes (~83.3%), followed by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 (~16.0% and 0.71%, respectively).  \n \nEffect of encorafenib on CYP substrates \nIn vitro experiments indicate encorafenib is a relatively potent reversible inhibitor of UGT1A1, \nCYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5, as well as a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Encorafenib \ninduced CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in human primary hepatocytes. Simulations of \n450 mg encorafenib co-administered with probe substrates for CYP2B6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19 and CYP2D6 on Day 1 and Day 15 all indicated no clinically relevant interactions are \nexpected. For co-administration with CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 substrates that undergo gut extraction, a \nminor to moderate interaction is expected. While binimetinib is a UGT1A1 substrate, it does not \nundergo gut extraction and therefore no DDI with encorafenib is expected. Additionally, no \ndifferences in exposure have been observed clinically when binimetinib is co-administered with \nencorafenib. \n \nEffect of transporters on encorafenib  \nEncorafenib was found to be a substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters. Inhibition of P-gp is \nunlikely to result in a clinically important increase in encorafenib concentrations as encorafenib \nexhibits high intrinsic permeability. The involvement of several uptake transporter families (OCT1, \nOATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATPB1) was investigated in vitro using relevant transporter inhibitors. \nThe data suggest that hepatic uptake transporters are not involved in encorafenib distribution into \nprimary human hepatocytes. \n \nEffect of encorafenib on transporters  \nIn vitro, encorafenib inhibited the hepatic transporter OCT1, but is unlikely to be an effective inhibitor \nclinically. Based on in vitro studies, there is potential for encorafenib to inhibit renal transporters \nOCT2, OAT1, OAT3 and hepatic transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 at clinical concentrations. In \naddition, encorafenib may inhibit P-gp in the gut and BCRP at the expected clinical concentrations. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge  \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age was found to be a significant covariate on \nencorafenib volume of distribution, but with high variability. Given the small magnitude of these \nchanges and high variability, these are unlikely to be clinically meaningful, and no dose adjustments \nare needed for elderly patients. \n \nGender \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis gender was not found to be a significant model \ncovariate on clearance or volume of distribution. As a result, no major changes in encorafenib \nexposure are expected based upon gender. \n \nBody weight \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, body weight was found to be a significant model \ncovariate on clearance and volume of distribution. However, given the small magnitude of change in \nclearance and the high variability in the predicted volume of distribution in the model, weight is \nunlikely to have a clinically relevant influence on the exposition of encorafenib.  \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nRace  \nThere are no clinically relevant differences in encorafenib PK between Asians and non Asians . There \nare insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the exposure of encorafenib in other races or \nethnicity.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nResults from a dedicated clinical study indicate a 25% higher total encorafenib exposures in patients \nwith mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) compared with subjects with normal liver \nfunction. This translates into a 55% increase of the unbound encorafenib exposure.  \nThe pharmacokinetics of encorafenib has not been evaluated clinically in patients with moderate \n(Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. As encorafenib is primarily \nmetabolised and eliminated via the liver, based on PBPK modelling, patients with moderate to severe \nhepatic impairment may have greater increases in exposure than patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment. No dosing recommendation can be made in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  \n \nRenal impairment \nEncorafenib undergoes minimal renal elimination. No formal clinical study has been conducted to \nevaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of encorafenib. \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clear trend in encorafenib CL/F was observed in patients \nwith mild (eGFR 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) or moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal \nimpairment compared with subjects with normal renal function (eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2). A small \ndecrease in CL/F (≤5%) was predicted for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, which is \nunlikely to be clinically relevant. The pharmacokinetics of encorafenib have not been studied in \npatients with severe renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn the 4-week and 13-week rat toxicity studies, clinical signs, reduced body weight reduced \nepididymides and prostate weights and microscopic findings in testes, epididymides, stomach and skin \nwere noted. Partial reversibility of these findings was noted after a 4-week recovery period. \nAdditionally, in the 13-week rat toxicity study, reversible clinical pathology changes were noted at \ndoses ≥ 100 mg/kg/d. No NOAEL could be established for the 4-week study. The NOAEL determined \nin the 13-week study was more than 10-times human therapeutic exposures. \n \nIn the 4-week and 13-week monkey toxicity study, isolated/sporadic episodes of emesis and diarrhoea \nas well as ophthalmic lesions were observed at slightly above human therapeutic exposures. \nOphthalmic lesions were partially reversible and consisted of a separation or detachment in the retina \nbetween the outer rods and cones layer and retinal pigmented epithelium at the central macula at the \nfovea. This observation was similar to that described in humans as central serous-like \nchorioretinopathy or central serous retinopathy. \n \nEncorafenib was not genotoxic. \nFertility studies were not conducted with encorafenib. In the 13-week rat toxicology studies, \nencorafenib treatment at 6 mg/kg/d (dose level more than 5 times the human exposure at the \ntherapeutic dose) resulted in decreased testes and epididymis weights with tubular degeneration and \noligospermia. In the 13-week study, partial reversibility was noted at the highest dose level \n(60 mg/kg/d).  \n \nThe embryo-foetal development study in rats indicated that encorafenib induced foetal toxicity with \nlower foetal weights and delays in skeletal development.  \nThe embryo-foetal development study in rabbits indicated that encorafenib induced foetal toxicity with \nlower foetal weights and transitory changes in skeletal development. Dilatation of the aortic arc was \nobserved in some foetuses.  \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nEncorafenib was phototoxic in an in vitro 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Test. Encorafenib was not a \nsensitiser in the in vivo mouse sensitization assay. Collectively, these data indicate that encorafenib \nhas a risk of phototoxic potential and minimal risk for sensitization at therapeutic doses in patients. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n45 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nBraftovi 50 mg hard capsules \nBraftovi 75 mg hard capsules \n\nencorafenib \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Braftovi is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Braftovi  \n3. How to take Braftovi  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Braftovi  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Braftovi is and what it is used for \n \nBraftovi is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance encorafenib. Changes \n(mutations) in the BRAF gene can produce proteins that cause the cancer to grow. Braftovi targets \nproteins made from this changed BRAF gene. \n \nIt is used in combination with another medicine containing binimetinib to treat adult patients with a \ntype of skin cancer called melanoma when it has \n- a particular change (mutation) in a gene responsible for producing a protein called BRAF, and \n- spread to other parts of the body, or cannot be removed by surgery \nWhen Braftovi is used in combination with binimetinib, which targets another protein that stimulates \ncancer cell growth, the combination slows down or stops the growth of your cancer. \n \nBraftovi is also used in combination with another medicine cetuximab, to treat adult patients with a \ntype of large intestine cancer when it has \n- a particular change (mutation) in a gene responsible for producing a protein called BRAF, and \n- spread to other parts of the body of patients who have been previously treated with other \n\nanticancer medicines \nWhen Braftovi is used in combination with cetuximab (which binds to the epidermal growth factor \nreceptor (EGFR)), a protein on the surface of certain cancer cells), the combination slows down or \nstops the growth of your cancer. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Braftovi  \n \nBefore starting treatment your doctor will check for the BRAF mutation. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nAs Braftovi is to be used in combination with binimetinib to treat melanoma, read the binimetinib \nleaflet carefully as well as this leaflet.   \n \nAs Braftovi is to be used in combination with cetuximab to treat large intestine cancer, read the \ncetuximab leaflet carefully as well as this leaflet.   \n \nDo not take Braftovi  \n-  if you are allergic to encorafenib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Braftovi, about all of your medical conditions, \nparticularly if you have any of the following: \n- heart problems including alteration of the electrical activity of your heart (QT interval \n\nprolongation) \n- bleeding problems or if you are taking medicines that may cause bleeding \n- eye problems  \n- liver or kidney problems \n \nTell your doctor if you have had a different type of cancer than melanoma or large intestine cancer, \nas Braftovi may worsen certain other types of cancers. \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you get the following while you are taking this \nmedicine: \n- Heart problems: Braftovi when taken with binimetinib can make your heart work less well, alter \n\nthe electrical activity of your heart called “QT interval prolongation” or make existing heart \nproblems worse. Your doctor will check that your heart is working properly before and during \nyour treatment with these medicines. Talk to your doctor immediately if you have any \nsymptoms of heart problems such as feeling dizzy, tired, lightheaded, if you have shortness of \nbreath, if you feel like your heart is pounding, racing, beating irregularly, or if you have \nswelling in the legs. \n \n\n- Bleeding problems: Braftovi may cause serious bleeding problems. Talk to your doctor \nimmediately if you have any symptoms of bleeding problems such as coughing up of blood, \nblood clots, vomit containing blood or that looks like “coffee grounds”, red or black stools that \nlook like tar, passing blood in the urine, stomach (abdominal) pain, unusual vaginal bleeding. \nAlso tell your doctor if you have headache, dizziness or weakness. \n \n\n- Eye problems: Braftovi, when taken with binimetinib , can cause serious eye problems. Talk to \nyour doctor immediately if you get blurred vision, loss of vision, or other vision changes (e.g. \ncoloured dots in your vision), halo (seeing blurred outline around objects). Your doctor will \nexamine your eyes for any problems with your sight while you are taking Braftovi. \n \n\n- Skin changes: Braftovi may cause other types of skin cancer such as cutaneous squamous cell \ncarcinoma. New melanomas may also occur while taking Braftovi. Your doctor will check your \nskin for any new skin cancers before treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 \nmonths after you stop taking Braftovi. Tell your doctor immediately if you detect skin changes \nduring and after treatment including: new wart, skin sore or reddish bump that bleeds or does \nnot heal, or a change in size or colour of a mole. Additionally, your doctor needs to check for \nsquamous cell carcinoma on your head, neck, mouth and lymph glands, and you will have CT \nscans regularly. This is a precaution in case a squamous cell carcinoma develops inside your \nbody. Genital examinations (for women) and anal examinations are also recommended before \nand at the end of your treatment. \n \n\n- Liver problems: Braftovi can cause abnormal blood tests related to how your liver works (raised \nlevels of liver enzymes). Your doctor will run blood tests to check your liver before and during \ntreatment. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n- Kidney problems: Braftovi can alter your kidney activity (often abnormal blood tests, more \n\nrarely dehydration and vomiting). Your doctor will run blood tests to monitor your kidneys \nbefore and during treatment. Drink plenty of fluids during treatment. Tell your doctor \nimmediately if you vomit and become dehydrated. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nBraftovi is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This medicine has \nnot been studied in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Braftovi \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \nSome medicines may affect how Braftovi works or make it more likely that you will have side effects. \nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are taking anything in this list or any other medicines: \n- some medicines to treat fungal infections (such as itraconazole, posaconazole, fluconazole)  \n- some medicines to treat bacterial infections (such as rifampicin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, \n\nerythromycin, penicillin) \n- medicines typically used to treat epilepsy (seizures) (such as phenytoin, carbamazepine)  \n- medicines typically used to treat cancer (such as methotrexate, imatinib) \n- medicines typically used to treat high cholesterol (such as rosuvastatin, atorvastatin) \n- an herbal treatment for depression: St. John’s wort  \n- some medicines for HIV treatment such as ritonavir, amprenavir, raltegravir, dolutegravir \n- birth control medicines containing hormones  \n- medicines typically used to treat high blood pressure (such as diltiazem, bosentan, furosemide)  \n- a medicine used to treat an uneven heartbeat: amiodarone. \n \nBraftovi with food and drink  \nDo not have grapefruit juice during your treatment with Braftovi. This is because it could increase \nBraftovi side effects. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nPregnancy \nBraftovi is not recommended during pregnancy. It may cause harm or birth defects to an unborn baby. \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before taking this medicine. \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use reliable contraception while you are \ntaking Braftovi, and you must continue to use reliable contraception for at least 1 month after taking \nyour last dose. Birth control medicines containing hormones (such as pills, injections, patches, \nimplants and certain intrauterine devices (IUDs) that release hormones) may not work as well as \nexpected while you are taking Braftovi. You should use another reliable method of birth control such \nas a barrier method (e.g. condom) so you do not become pregnant while you are taking this medicine. \nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice. \nContact your doctor straightaway if you become pregnant while taking Braftovi.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nBraftovi is not recommended while breast-feeding. It is not known if Braftovi passes into breast milk. \nIf you are breast-feeding, or planning to breast-feed, ask your doctor for advice before taking this \nmedicine.  \n \nFertility \nBraftovi may reduce sperm count in males. This could affect the ability to father a child. Talk to your \ndoctor if this is a concern for you.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nBraftovi can affect your ability to drive or use machines. Avoid driving or using machines if you have \nany problems with your vision, or have any other side effects that can affect your ability to drive or \n\n\n\n48 \n\nuse machines (see section 4), while taking Braftovi. Talk to your doctor if you are not sure you can \ndrive. \n \n \n3. How to take Braftovi \n \nHow much to take  \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nFor melanoma treatment \nThe recommended dose of Braftovi to treat melanoma is 6 capsules of 75 mg once daily \n(corresponding to a daily dose of 450 mg). You will also receive treatment with another medicine, \nbinimetinib. \n \nFor large intestine cancer treatment \nThe recommended dose of Braftovi to treat large intestine cancer is 4 capsules of 75 mg once daily \n(corresponding to a daily dose of 300 mg). You will also receive treatment with another medicine \ncetuximab. \n \nIf you have liver or kidney problems, your doctor may start you on a lower dose.  \nIf you get serious side effects (such as heart, eye or bleeding problems) your doctor may lower the \ndose or stop treatment temporarily or permanently. \n  \nHow to take Braftovi \nSwallow the capsules whole with water. Braftovi can be taken with food or between meals. \n \nIf you are sick  \nIf you vomit at any time after taking Braftovi, do not take an additional dose. Take the next dose as \nscheduled. \n \nIf you take more Braftovi than you should \nIf you take more capsules than you should, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse straightaway. Side \neffects of Braftovi such as nausea, vomiting, dehydration and blurred vision may appear or worsen. If \npossible, show them this leaflet and the medicine package. \n \nIf you forget to take Braftovi \nIf you miss a dose of Braftovi, take it as soon as you remember. However if the missed dose is more \nthan 12 hours late, skip that dose and take your next dose at the usual time. Then continue taking your \ncapsules at regular times as usual. \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Braftovi \nIt is important to take Braftovi for as long as your doctor prescribes it. Do not stop taking this \nmedicine unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nSerious side effects \n \nBraftovi may cause serious side effects. Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the \nfollowing serious side effects, either for the first time or if they get worse (see also section 2):  \n \nHeart problems: Braftovi when taken with binimetinib can affect how well your heart works (left \nventricular ejection fraction decrease); signs and symptoms can include:  \n- feeling dizzy, tired or lightheaded \n- shortness of breath \n- feeling like your heart is pounding, racing or beating irregularly \n- swelling in the legs \n \nEye problems: Braftovi, when taken with binimetinib can cause serious eye problems such as fluid to \nleak under the retina in the eye, leading to detachment of different layers in the eye (retinal epithelial \npigmental detachment). Call your doctor right away if you get these symptoms of eye problems: \n- blurred vision, loss of vision, or other vision changes (such as coloured dots in your vision) \n- halo (seeing blurred outline around objects) \n- eye pain, swellling or redness  \n \nBleeding problems: Braftovi can cause serious bleeding problems.
