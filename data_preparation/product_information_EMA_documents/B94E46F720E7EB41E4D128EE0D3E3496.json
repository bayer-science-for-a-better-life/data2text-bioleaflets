NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDovato 50 mg/300 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains dolutegravir sodium equivalent to 50 mg dolutegravir and 300 mg \nlamivudine. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nOval, biconvex, white, film coated tablet, approximately 18.5 x 9.5 mm, debossed with “SV 137” on one face. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDovato is indicated for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults \nand adolescents above 12 years of age weighing at least 40 kg, with no known or suspected resistance to the \nintegrase inhibitor class, or lamivudine (see section 5.1). \n \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nDovato should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents (above 12 years of age weighing at least 40 kg). \n \nThe recommended dose of Dovato in adults and adolescents is one 50 mg/300 mg tablet once daily. \n \nDose adjustments \nA separate preparation of dolutegravir is available where a dose adjustment is indicated due to drug-drug \ninteractions (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, St. John’s wort, \netravirine (without boosted protease inhibitors), efavirenz, nevirapine, or tipranavir/ritonavir, see sections 4.4 \nand 4.5). In these cases the physician should refer to the individual product information for dolutegravir. \n \nMissed doses \nIf the patient misses a dose of Dovato, the patient should take Dovato as soon as possible, providing the next \ndose is not due within 4 hours. If the next dose is due within 4 hours, the patient should not take the missed \ndose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. \n \nElderly \nThere are limited data available on the use of Dovato in patients aged 65 years and over. No dose adjustment \nis necessary (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDovato is not recommended for use in patients with a creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min (see section 5.2). No \ndose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grade A \nor B). No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grade C); therefore \nDovato should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Dovato in children aged less than 12 years or weighing less than 40 kg have not \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use.  \nDovato can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nCo-administration with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic windows, that are substrates of organic \ncation transporter (OCT) 2, including but not limited to fampridine (also known as dalfampridine; see section \n4.5). \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTransmission of HIV \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk \nof sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission should be \ntaken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have been reported with dolutegravir, and were characterized by rash, \nconstitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including severe liver reactions. Dovato and other \nsuspect medicinal products should be discontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity \nreactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by raised liver enzymes, \nfever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, \neosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases and bilirubin should be \nmonitored. Delay in stopping treatment with Dovato or other suspect active substances after the onset of \nhypersensitivity may result in a life-threatening allergic reaction. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such \nchanges may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in some cases evidence for \na treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any particular treatment. \nFor monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid \ndisorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nLiver disease \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased \nrisk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for \nhepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. \n \nDovato includes lamivudine, which is active against hepatitis B. Dolutegravir lacks such activity. \nLamivudine monotherapy is generally not considered an adequate treatment for hepatitis B, since the risk for \nhepatitis B resistance development is high. If Dovato is used in patients co-infected with hepatitis B an \nadditional antiviral is therefore generally needed. Reference should be made to treatment guidelines. \n \nIf Dovato is discontinued in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus, periodic monitoring of both liver \nfunction tests and markers of HBV replication is recommended, as withdrawal of lamivudine may result in \nan acute exacerbation of hepatitis. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of \nliver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy, and should be monitored according to \nstandard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or \ndiscontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such \nreactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples \nare Cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii \npneumonia (often referred to as PCP). Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment \ninstituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more \nvariable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nLiver chemistry elevations consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome were observed in some hepatitis \nB and/or C co-infected patients at the start of dolutegravir therapy. Monitoring of liver chemistries is \nrecommended in patients with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection. (See ‘Liver disease’ earlier in this section \nand also see section 4.8). \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \n \nNucleoside and nucleotide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV-negative infants exposed in utero and/or post-natally to nucleoside analogues, these have \npredominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse reactions \nreported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia), and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, \nhyperlipasemia). These reactions have often been transitory. Some late-onset neurological disorders have \nbeen reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether such neurological disorders are \ntransient or permanent is currently unknown. These findings should be considered for any child exposed in \nutero to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, who presents with severe clinical findings of unknown \naetiology, particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect current national recommendations to \nuse antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV. \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, biphosphonates, \nalcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. Patients should be \nadvised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in \nmovement. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nOpportunistic infections \n \nPatients should be advised that dolutegravir, lamivudine or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cure \nHIV infection and that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV \ninfection. Therefore, patients should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the \ntreatment of these associated HIV diseases. \n \nDrug interactions \n \nThe recommended dose of dolutegravir is 50 mg twice daily when co-administered with rifampicin, \ncarbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, St. John’s wort, etravirine (without boosted \nprotease inhibitors), efavirenz, nevirapine, or tipranavir/ritonavir (see section 4.5). \n \nDovato should not be co-administered with polyvalent cation-containing antacids. Polyvalent cation-\ncontaining antacids are recommended to be taken 2 hours after or 6 hours before Dovato (see section 4.5). \n \nWhen taken with food, Dovato and supplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or magnesium can \nbe taken at the same time. If Dovato is administered under fasting conditions, supplements or multivitamins \ncontaining calcium, iron or magnesium are recommended to be taken 2 hours after or 6 hours before Dovato \n(see section 4.5). \n \nDolutegravir increased metformin concentrations. A dose adjustment of metformin should be considered \nwhen starting and stopping coadministration of Dovato with metformin, to maintain glycaemic control (see \nsection 4.5). Metformin is eliminated renally and, therefore, it is of importance to monitor renal function \nwhen co-treated with Dovato. This combination may increase the risk for lactic acidosis in patients with \nmoderate renal impairment (stage 3a creatinine clearance 45– 59 mL/min) and a cautious approach is \nrecommended. Reduction of the metformin dose should be highly considered. \n \nThe combination of Dovato with cladribine is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nDovato should not be taken with any other medicinal product containing dolutegravir, lamivudine or \nemtricitabine, except where a dose adjustment of dolutegravir is indicated due to drug-drug interactions (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo drug interaction studies have been conducted using Dovato. Dovato contains dolutegravir and \nlamivudine, therefore any interactions identified for these individually are relevant to Dovato. No clinically \nsignificant drug interactions are expected between dolutegravir and lamivudine. \n \nEffect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir and lamivudine \n \nDolutegravir is eliminated mainly through metabolism by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase \n(UGT) 1A1. Dolutegravir is also a substrate of UGT1A3, UGT1A9, CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and \nbreast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Co-administration of Dovato and other medicinal products that \ninhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, CYP3A4, and/or P-gp may, therefore, increase dolutegravir plasma \nconcentration. Medicinal products that induce those enzymes or transporters may decrease dolutegravir \nplasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic effect of dolutegravir. \n \nThe absorption of dolutegravir is reduced by certain metal cation-containing anti-acid substances and \nsupplements (see Table 1). \n \nLamivudine is cleared renally. Active renal secretion of lamivudine in the urine is mediated through the \nOCT2 and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporters (MATE1 and MATE2-K). Trimethoprim (an inhibitor \n\n\n\n6 \n\nof these transporters) has been shown to increase lamivudine plasma concentrations, however the resulting \nincrease was not clinically significant (see Table 1). Dolutegravir is an OCT2 and MATE1 inhibitor; \nhowever, lamivudine concentrations were similar with or without co-administration of dolutegravir based on \na cross study analysis, indicating that dolutegravir has no relevant effect on lamivudine exposure in vivo. \nLamivudine is also substrate of the hepatic uptake transporter OCT1. As hepatic elimination plays a minor \nrole in the clearance of lamivudine, drug interactions due to inhibition of OCT1 are unlikely to be of clinical \nsignificance. \n \nAlthough lamivudine is a substrate of BCRP and P-gp in vitro, given its high absolute bioavailability, (see \nsection 5.2), inhibitors of these efflux transporters are unlikely to result in a clinically relevant impact on \nlamivudine concentrations. \n \nEffect of dolutegravir and lamivudine on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n \nIn vivo, dolutegravir did not have an effect on midazolam, a CYP3A4 probe. Based on in vivo and/or in vitro \ndata, dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of \nany major enzyme or transporter such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and P-gp (for more information see section 5.2). \n \nIn vitro, dolutegravir inhibited the renal transporters OCT2 and MATE1. In vivo, a 10-14% decrease of \ncreatinine clearance (secretory fraction is dependent on OCT2 and MATE1 transport) was observed in \npatients. In vivo, dolutegravir may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products in which excretion \nis dependent upon OCT2 and/or MATE1 (e.g. fampridine [also known as dalfampridine], metformin) (see \nTable 1 and section 4.3). \n \nIn vitro, dolutegravir inhibited the renal uptake organic anion transporters (OAT)1 and OAT3. Based on the \nlack of effect on the in vivo pharmacokinetics of the OAT substrate tenofovir, in vivo inhibition of OAT1 is \nunlikely. Inhibition of OAT3 has not been studied in vivo. Dolutegravir may increase plasma concentrations \nof medicinal products in which excretion is dependent upon OAT3. \n \nIn vitro, lamivudine was an inhibitor of OCT1 and OCT2; the clinical consequences are not known. \n \nEstablished and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non-antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts are listed in Table 1. \n \nInteraction table \n \nInteractions between dolutegravir, lamivudine and co-administered medical products are listed in Table 1 \n(increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, area under the concentration versus time \ncurve as “AUC”, maximum observed concentration as “Cmax”, concentration at end of dosing interval as \n“Cτ”).

No dose adjustment of \noral contraceptives is necessary when \nco-administered with Dovato. \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential (WOCBP) should be counselled about the potential risk of neural tube \ndefects with dolutegravir (a component of Dovato, see below), including consideration of effective \ncontraceptive measures. \n \nIf a woman plans pregnancy, the benefits and the risks of continuing treatment with Dovato should be \ndiscussed with the patient. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe safety and efficacy of a dual regimen has not been studied in pregnancy. \n \nHuman experience from a birth outcome surveillance study in Botswana shows a small increase of neural \ntube defects; 7 cases in 3,591 deliveries (0.19%; 95% CI 0.09%, 0.40%) to mothers taking dolutegravir-\ncontaining regimens at the time of conception compared to 21 cases in 19,361 deliveries (0.11%: 95% CI \n0.07%, 0.17%) to women exposed to non-dolutegravir regimens at the time of conception. \n \nThe incidence of neural tube defects in the general population ranges from 0.5-1 case per 1,000 live births \n(0.05-0.1%). Most neural tube defects occur within the first 4 weeks of embryonic development after \nconception (approximately 6 weeks after the last menstrual period). If a pregnancy is confirmed in the first \ntrimester while on Dovato, the benefits and risks of continuing Dovato versus switching to another \nantiretroviral regimen should be discussed with the patient taking the gestational age and the critical time \nperiod of neural tube defect development into account. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nData analysed from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry do not indicate an increased risk of major birth \ndefects in over 600 women exposed to dolutegravir during pregnancy but are currently insufficient to address \nthe risk of neural tube defects.  \n \nIn animal reproductive toxicology studies with dolutegravir, no adverse development outcomes, including \nneural tube defects, were identified (see section 5.3). Dolutegravir was shown to cross the placenta in \nanimals. \n \nMore than 1000 outcomes from exposure to dolutegravir during second and third trimester pregnancy \nindicate no evidence of increased risk of foeto/neonatal toxicity. Dovato may be used during the second and \nthird trimester of pregnancy when the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nA large amount of data on the use of lamivudine in pregnant women (more than 5200 outcomes from first \ntrimester) indicates no malformative toxicity.  \n \nAnimal studies showed lamivudine may inhibit cellular DNA replication (see section 5.3). The clinical \nrelevance of these findings is unknown. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction  \nNucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to cause a variable degree \nof mitochondrial damage. There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-negative infants \nexposed in utero and/or post-natally to nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nIt is unknown whether dolutegravir is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological data in animals has \nshown excretion of dolutegravir in milk. In lactating rats that received a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg at \n10 days postpartum, dolutegravir was detected in milk at concentrations typically higher than blood.  \n \nBased on more than 200 mother/child pairs treated for HIV, serum concentrations of lamivudine in breastfed \ninfants of mothers treated for HIV are very low (< 4% of maternal serum concentrations) and progressively \ndecrease to undetectable levels when breastfed infants reach 24 weeks of age. There are no data available on \nthe safety of lamivudine when administered to babies less than three months old. \n \nIt is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in \norder to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \nFertility  \n \nThere are no data on the effects of dolutegravir or lamivudine on human male or female fertility. Animal \nstudies indicate no effects of dolutegravir or lamivudine on male or female fertility (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nDovato has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed \nthat dizziness and somnolence has been reported during treatment with dolutegravir. The clinical status of \nthe patient and the adverse reaction profile of Dovato should be borne in mind when considering the patient’s \nability to drive or operate machinery.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions are headache (3%), diarrhoea (2%), nausea (2%) and \ninsomnia (2%).  \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nThe most severe adverse reaction reported with dolutegravir was a hypersensitivity reaction that included \nrash and severe liver effects (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions from clinical study and post-marketing experience are listed in Table 2 by body \nsystem, organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 2: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions to Dovato based on clinical study and post-\n\nmarketing experience with Dovato and its individual components  \nFrequency Adverse reaction \n\nBlood and lymphatic systems disorders: \n\nUncommon: neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia \n\nVery rare: pure red cell aplasia \n\nImmune system disorders: \n\nUncommon: hypersensitivity (see section 4.4), immune reconstitution \nsyndrome (see section 4.4) \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \n\nVery rare: lactic acidosis \n\nPsychiatric disorders:  \n\nCommon: depression, anxiety, insomnia, abnormal dreams \n\nUncommon suicidal ideation*, suicide attempt* \n \n*particularly in patients with a pre-existing history of \ndepression or psychiatric illness. \n\nNervous system disorders:  \n\nVery common: headache \n\nCommon: dizziness, somnolence \n\nVery rare: peripheral neuropathy, paraesthesia \n\nGastrointestinal disorders:  \n\nVery common: nausea, diarrhoea \n\nCommon: vomiting, flatulence, abdominal pain/ discomfort \n\nRare: pancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: \n\nUncommon: hepatitis \n\nRare acute hepatic failure1 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:  \n\nCommon: rash, pruritus, alopecia \n\nRare: angioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \n\n\n\n15 \n\nCommon: arthralgia, muscle disorders (including myalgia) \n\nRare: rhabdomyolysis \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:  \n\nCommon: fatigue \n\nInvestigations: \n\nCommon: creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations \nalanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) elevations \n\nRare: amylase elevations \n1 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for \ndolutegravir in combination with other ARVs. The frequency category of rare was \nestimated based on post-marketing reports. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nChanges in laboratory biochemistries \nDolutegravir has been associated with an increase in serum creatinine occuring in the first week of treatment \nwhen administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products. Increases in serum creatinine occurred \nwithin the first four weeks of treatment with dolutegravir plus lamivudine and remained stable through \n48 weeks. In the pooled GEMINI studies a mean change from baseline of 10.3 µmol/L (range: -36.3 µmol/L \nto 55.7 µmol/L) was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. These changes are linked to the inhibiting effect \nof dolutegravir on renal tubular transporters of creatinine. The changes are not considered to be clinically \nrelevant and do not reflect a change in glomerular filtration rate. \n \nCo-infection with Hepatitis B or C \nIn the Phase III studies for the dolutegravir single agent, patients with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection were \npermitted to enrol provided that baseline liver chemistry tests did not exceed 5 times the upper limit of \nnormal (ULN). Overall, the safety profile in patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or C was similar to that \nobserved in patients without hepatitis B or C co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities \nwere higher in the subgroup with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection for all treatment groups. Liver chemistry \nelevations consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome were observed in some subjects with hepatitis B \nand/or C co-infection at the start of dolutegravir therapy, particularly in those whose anti-hepatitis B therapy \nwas withdrawn (see section 4.4). \n \nMetabolic parameters  \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis  \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, \nadvanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nImmune response syndrome \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral \ntherapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; \nhowever, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation \nof treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nThere are no clinical study data on the effects of Dovato in the paediatric population. Individual components \nhave been investigated in adolescents (12 to 17 years). \n \nBased on limited available data with the dolutegravir single entity or lamivudine single entity used in \ncombination with other antiretroviral agents to treat adolescents (12 to 17 years), there were no additional \ntypes of adverse reactions beyond those observed in the adult population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific symptoms or signs have been identified following acute overdose with dolutegravir or \nlamivudine, apart from those listed as adverse reactions. \n \nThere is no specific treatment for an overdose of Dovato. If overdose occurs, the patient should be treated \nsupportively with appropriate monitoring, as necessary. Since lamivudine is dialysable, continuous \nhaemodialysis could be used in the treatment of overdose, although this has not been studied. As dolutegravir \nis highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations. ATC code: J05AR25 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDolutegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer \nstep of retroviral Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. \n \nLamivudine, via its active metabolite 5'-triphosphates (TP) (an analogue for cytidine), inhibits reverse \ntranscriptase of HIV-1 and HIV-2 through incorporation of the monophosphate form into the viral DNA \nchain, resulting in chain termination. Lamivudine triphosphate shows significantly less affinity for host cell \nDNA polymerases. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nAntiviral activity in cell culture  \nDolutegravir and lamivudine have been shown to inhibit replication of lab-strains and clinical isolates of \nHIV in a number of cell types, including transformed T cell lines, monocyte/macrophage derived lines and \nprimary cultures of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) and monocyte/macrophages. The \nconcentration of active substance necessary to effect viral replication by 50% (IC50 - half maximal inhibitory \nconcentration) varied according to virus and host cell type. \n \nThe IC50 for dolutegravir in various lab-strains using PBMC was 0.5 nM, and when using MT-4 cells it \nranged from 0.7-2 nM. Similar IC50s were seen for clinical isolates without any major difference between \nsubtypes; in a panel of 24 HIV-1 isolates of clades A, B, C, D, E, F and G and group O the mean IC50 value \nwas 0.2 nM (range 0.02-2.14). The mean IC50 for 3 HIV-2 isolates was 0.18 nM (range 0.09-0.61). \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n17 \n\nThe median or mean IC50 values for lamivudine against lab-strains of HIV-1 ranged from 0.007 to 2.3 µM. \nThe mean IC50 against lab-strains of HIV-2 (LAV2 and EHO) ranged from 0.16 to 0.51 µM for lamivudine. \nThe IC50 values of lamivudine against HIV-1 subtypes (A-G) ranged from 0.001 to 0.170 µM, against Group \nO from 0.030 to 0.160 µM and against HIV-2 isolates from 0.002 to 0.120 µM in peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells. \n \nHIV-1 isolates (CRF01_AE, n=12; CRF02_AG, n=12; and Subtype C or CRF_AC, n=13) from 37 untreated \npatients in Africa and Asia were susceptible to lamivudine (IC50 fold changes < 3.0). Group O isolates from \nantiviral naïve patients tested for lamivudine activity were highly sensitive. \n \nEffect of human serum  \nIn 100% human serum, the mean fold shift for dolutegravir activity was 75 fold, resulting in protein adjusted \nIC90 of 0.064 µg/mL. Lamivudine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and \ndisplays low plasma protein binding (less than 36%).  \n \nResistance \n \nDovato is indicated in the absence of documented or suspected resistance to the integrase inhibitor class and \nto lamivudine (see section 4.1). For information around in vitro resistance, and cross resistance to other \nagents of the integrase- and NRTI class, please refer to the SmPCs of dolutegravir and lamivudine.  \n \nNone of the eleven subjects in the dolutegravir plus lamivudine group or the seven subjects in the \ndolutegravir plus tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine FDC group that met virological withdrawal criteria \nthrough Week 96 across the GEMINI-1 (204861) and GEMINI-2 (205543) studies had treatment emergent \nintegrase inhibitor or NRTI class resistance. \n \nIn previously untreated patients receiving dolutegravir + 2 NRTIs in Phase IIb and Phase III, no development \nof resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, or to the NRTI class was seen (n=1118 follow-up of \n48-96 weeks).  \n \nEffects on electrocardiogram \n \nNo relevant effects were seen with dolutegravir on the QTc interval, with doses exceeding the clinical dose \nby approximately three fold. A similar study was not conducted with lamivudine. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \n\nAntiretroviral naïve subjects  \n\nThe efficacy of Dovato is supported by data from 2 identical 148-week, Phase III, randomised, double-blind, \nmulticentre, parallel-group, non-inferiority controlled trials GEMINI-1 (204861) and GEMINI-2 (205543). A \ntotal of 1433 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral treatment-naïve adult subjects received treatment in the trials. \nSubjects were enrolled with a screening plasma HIV-1 RNA of 1000 c/mL to ≤500,000 c/mL. Subjects were \nrandomised to a two-drug regimen of dolutegravir 50 mg plus lamivudine 300 mg once daily or dolutegravir \n50 mg plus tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine 245/200 mg once daily. The primary efficacy endpoint for \neach GEMINI trial was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48 \n(Snapshot algorithm for the ITT-E population). Double blind therapy will continue up to week 96, followed \nby open label therapy up to week 148. \n \nAt baseline, in the pooled analysis, the median age of subjects was 33 years, 15% were female, 69% were \nwhite, 9% were CDC Stage 3 (AIDS), 20% had HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL, and 8% had CD4+ cell \ncount less than 200 cells per mm3; these characteristics were similar between studies and treatment arms.  \n \nIn the primary week 48 analysis, dolutegravir plus lamivudine was non-inferior to dolutegravir plus tenofovir \ndisoproxil/emtricitabine FDC in GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 studies. This was supported by the pooled \nanalysis, see Table 3. \n\n\n\n18 \n\nTable 3 Virologic Outcomes of Randomised Treatment of GEMINI at Week 48 (Snapshot \nalgorithm) \n\n GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 Pooled \nData* \n\nDTG + 3TC \nN=716 \n\nDTG + TDF/FTC \nN=717 \n\nHIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL 91% 93% \n Treatment Difference† (95% confidence intervals) -1.7 (-4.4, 1.1) \nVirologic non response 3% 2% \nReasons   \n\nData in window and ≥50 copies/mL  1% <1% \nDiscontinued for lack of efficacy <1% <1% \nDiscontinued for other reasons and ≥50 copies/mL <1% <1% \nChange in ART <1% <1% \n\nNo virologic data at Week 48 window 6% 5%  \nReasons   \n\nDiscontinued study due to adverse event or death  1% 2% \nDiscontinued study for other reasons 4% 3%  \nMissing data during window but on study <1% 0% \n\nHIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL by baseline covariates \n n/N (%) n/N (%) \nBaseline Plasma Viral Load (copies/mL) \n≤100,000 \n>100,000 \n\n \n526 / 576 (91%) \n129 / 140 (92%) \n\n \n531 / 564 (94%) \n138 / 153 (90%) \n\nBaseline CD4+ (cells/ mm3)   \n≤200  50 / 63 (79%) 51 / 55 (93%) \n >200 605 / 653 (93%) 618 / 662 (93%) \nHIV-1 subtype   \n B 424 / 467 (91%) 452 / 488 (93%) \n A 84 / 86 (98%) 74 / 78 (95%) \n Other 147 / 163 (90%) 143 / 151 (95%) \nGender   \n Male  555 / 603 (92%) 580 / 619 (94%) \n Female  100 / 113 (88%) 89 / 98 (91%) \nRace    \n White  451 / 484 (93%) 473 / 499 (95%) \n African-American/African Heritage/Other 204 / 232 (88%) 196 / 218 (90%) \n* The results of the pooled analysis are in line with those of the individual studies, for which the primary \nendpoint (difference in proportion <50 copies/mL plasma HIV-1 RNA at Week 48 based on the \nSnapshot algorithm for dolutegravir plus lamivudine versus dolutegravir plus tenofovir disoproxil \n/emtricitabine FDC) was met.

A total of 741 adult HIV-1 infected subjects, without any \nevidence of resistance to the NRTI or integrase inhibitor (INSTI) class and who were on a stable suppressive \ntenofovir alafenamide based regimen (TBR) received treatment in the studies. Subjects were randomised in a \n1:1 ratio to receive dolutegravir/lamivudine FDC or continue with TBR for up to 200 weeks. Randomisation \nwas stratified by baseline core agent class (protease inhibitor [PI], INSTI, or non-nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with plasma \nHIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL (virologic non-response) as per the FDA Snapshot category at Week 48 (adjusted for \nrandomisation stratification factor). \n \nAt baseline the median age of subjects was 39 years, 8% were female and 21% non-white, 5% were CDC \nClass C (AIDS) and 98% subjects had Baseline CD4+ cell count ≥200 cells/mm3; these characteristics were \nsimilar between treatment arms. Subjects had been on ART for a median of around 3 years prior to Day 1 \nAround 80% were on INSTI-based TBR (mainly elvitegravir/c) at baseline. \n \nThe primary analysis demonstrated that dolutegravir/lamivudine is non-inferior to TBR, with <1% of \nsubjects in both arms experiencing virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL) at Week 48 (Table 4). \n \nTable 4 Virologic Outcomes of Randomised Treatment of TANGO at Week 48 (Snapshot \n\nalgorithm) \n DTG/3TC \n\nN=369 \nTBR \n\nN=372 \nHIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL* 93% 93% \nVirologic non response (≥50 copies/mL)** <1% <1% \nTreatment Difference† (95% confidence intervals) -0.3 (-1.2, 0.7) \nReasons for virologic non response:   \n\nData in window and ≥50 copies/mL  0% 0% \nDiscontinued for lack of efficacy 0% <1% \nDiscontinued for other reasons and ≥50 copies/mL <1% 0% \nChange in ART 0% 0% \n\nNo virologic data at Week 48 window 7% 6%  \nReasons   \n\nDiscontinued study due to adverse event or death  3% <1% \nDiscontinued study for other reasons 3% 6%  \nMissing data during window but on study 0% <1% \n\n*Based on an 8% non-inferiority margin, DTG/3TC is non-inferior to TBR at Week 48 in the secondary \nanalysis (proportion of subjects achieving <50 copies/mL plasma HIV-1 RNA). \n**Based on a 4% non-inferiority margin, DTG/3TC is non-inferior to TBR at Week 48 in the primary \nanalysis (proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL).  \n†Based on CMH-stratified analysis adjusting for Baseline third agent class (PI, NNRTI, INSTI).  \nN = Number of subjects in each treatment group; TBR = tenofovir alafenamide based regimen.  \n \n\nTreatment outcomes between treatment arms at week 48 were similar across the stratification factor, baseline \nthird agent class and across subgroups by age, sex, race, baseline CD4+ cell count, CDC HIV disease stage, \nand countries. The median change from baseline in CD4+ count at Week 48 was 22.5 cells per mm3 in \nsubjects who switched to dolutegravir/lamivudine and 11.0 cells per mm3 in subjects who stayed on TBR. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe efficacy of Dovato, or the dual combination of dolutegravir plus lamivudine (as single entities) has not \nbeen studied in children or adolescents. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Dovato in \none or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of HIV infection. \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nWhen administered in fasted state, bioequivalence regarding Cmax was achieved for dolutegravir, when \ncomparing Dovato to dolutegravir 50 mg co-administered with lamivudine 300 mg. Dolutegravir AUC0-t was \n16% higher for Dovato than for dolutegravir 50 mg co-administered with lamivudine 300 mg. This increase \nis not considered clinically relevant. \n \nWhen administered in fasted state, bioequivalence was achieved for lamivudine AUC, when comparing \nDovato to lamivudine 300 mg co-administered with dolutegravir 50 mg. Lamivudine Cmax for Dovato was \n32% higher than lamivudine 300 mg co-administered with dolutegravir 50 mg. The higher lamivudine Cmax, \nis not considered clinically relevant. \n \nAbsorption  \n \nDolutegravir and lamivudine are rapidly absorbed following oral administration. The absolute bioavailability \nof dolutegravir has not been established. The absolute bioavailability of oral lamivudine in adults is \napproximately 80-85%. For Dovato, the median time to maximal plasma concentration (tmax) is 2.5 hours for \ndolutegravir and 1.0 hour for lamivudine, when dosed under fasted conditions. \n \nExposure to dolutegravir was generally similar between healthy subjects and HIV-1–infected subjects. In \nHIV-1–infected adult subjects following dolutegravir 50 mg once daily, the steady-state pharmacokinetic \nparameters (geometric mean [%CV]) based on population pharmacokinetic analyses were \nAUC(0-24) = 53.6 (27) µg.h/mL, Cmax = 3.67 (20) µg/mL, and Cmin = 1.11 (46) µg/mL. Following multiple-\ndose oral administration of lamivudine 300 mg once daily for seven days, the mean (CV) steady-state Cmax is \n2.04 µg/mL (26%) and the mean (CV) AUC(0-24) is 8.87 µg.h/mL (21%). \n \nAdministration of a single Dovato tablet with a high fat meal increased dolutegravir AUC(0-∞) and Cmax by \n33% and 21%, respectively, and decreased the lamivudine Cmax by 30% compared to fasted conditions. The \nlamivudine AUC(0-∞) was not affected by a high fat meal. These changes are not clinically significant. Dovato \nmay be administered with or without food. \n \nDistribution  \n \nThe apparent volume of distribution of dolutegravir (Vd/F) is 17-20 L. Intravenous studies with lamivudine \nshowed that the mean apparent volume of distribution is 1.3 L/kg. \n \nDolutegravir is highly bound (> 99%) to human plasma proteins based on in vitro data. Binding of \ndolutegravir to plasma proteins is independent of dolutegravir concentration. Total blood and plasma drug-\nrelated radioactivity concentration ratios averaged between 0.441 to 0.535, indicating minimal association of \nradioactivity with blood cellular components. The unbound fraction of dolutegravir in plasma is increased at \nlow levels of serum albumin (<35 g/L) as seen in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Lamivudine \nexhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and displays limited plasma protein binding \nin vitro (< 16%- 36% to serum albumin). \n \nDolutegravir and lamivudine are present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In 13 treatment-naïve subjects on a \nstable dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine regimen, dolutegravir concentration in CSF averaged 18 ng/mL \n(comparable to unbound plasma concentration, and above the IC50). The mean ratio of CSF/serum \n\n\n\n21 \n\nlamivudine concentrations 2-4 hours after oral administration was approximately 12%. The true extent of \nCNS penetration of lamivudine and its relationship with any clinical efficacy is unknown. \n \nDolutegravir is present in the female and male genital tract. AUC in cervicovaginal fluid, cervical tissue and \nvaginal tissue were 6-10% of those in corresponding plasma at steady state. AUC in semen was 7% and 17% \nin rectal tissue of those in corresponding plasma at steady state. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nDolutegravir is primarily metabolized via UGT1A1 with a minor CYP3A component (9.7% of total dose \nadministered in a human mass balance study). Dolutegravir is the predominant circulating compound in \nplasma; renal elimination of unchanged active substance is low (< 1% of the dose). Fifty-three percent of \ntotal oral dose is excreted unchanged in the faeces. It is unknown if all or part of this is due to unabsorbed \nactive substance or biliary excretion of the glucuronidate conjugate, which can be further degraded to form \nthe parent compound in the gut lumen. Thirty-two percent of the total oral dose is excreted in the urine, \nrepresented by ether glucuronide of dolutegravir (18.9% of total dose), N-dealkylation metabolite (3.6% of \ntotal dose), and a metabolite formed by oxidation at the benzylic carbon (3.0% of total dose). \n \nMetabolism of lamivudine is a minor route of elimination. Lamivudine is predominately cleared by renal \nexcretion of unchanged lamivudine. The likelihood of metabolic drug interactions with lamivudine is low \ndue to the small extent of hepatic metabolism (5-10%). \n \nDrug interactions \n \nIn vitro, dolutegravir demonstrated no direct, or weak inhibition (IC50>50 μM) of the enzymes cytochrome \nP450 (CYP)1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 CYP3A, UGT1A1 or \nUGT2B7, or the transporters Pgp, BCRP, BSEP, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, \nOATP1B3, OCT1, MATE2-K, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2 or MRP4. In vitro, \ndolutegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. Based on this data, dolutegravir is not expected \nto affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of major enzymes or transporters (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nIn vitro, dolutegravir was not a substrate of human OATP 1B1, OATP 1B3 or OCT 1. \n \nIn vitro, lamivudine did not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes (such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2D6) and \ndemonstrated no or weak inhibition of OATP1B1, OAT1B3, OCT3, BCRP, P-gp, MATE1 or MATE2-K. \nLamivudine is therefore not expected to affect the plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are \nsubstrates of these enzymes or transporters. \n \nLamivudine was not significantly metabolised by CYP enzymes. \n \nElimination  \n \nDolutegravir has a terminal half-life of ~14 hours. The apparent oral clearance (CL/F) is approximately \n1 L/hr in HIV-infected patients based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. \n \nThe observed lamivudine half-life of elimination is 18 to 19 hours. For patients receiving lamivudine 300 mg \nonce daily, the terminal intracellular half-life of lamivudine-TP was 16 to 19 hours. The mean systemic \nclearance of lamivudine is approximately 0.32 L/h/kg, predominantly by renal clearance (> 70%) via the \norganic cationic transport system. Studies in patients with renal impairment show lamivudine elimination is \naffected by renal dysfunction. Dose reduction is required for patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min \n(see section 4.2). \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nIn a randomized, dose-ranging trial, HIV-1–infected subjects treated with dolutegravir monotherapy \n(ING111521) demonstrated rapid and dose-dependent antiviral activity, with mean decline in HIV-1 RNA of \n2.5 log10 at day 11 for 50 mg dose. This antiviral response was maintained for 3 to 4 days after the last dose \nin the 50 mg group. \n \nSpecial patient populations \n \nChildren \nThe pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir in 10 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adolescents \n(12 to 17 years) showed that dolutegravir 50 mg once daily dosage resulted in dolutegravir exposure \ncomparable to that observed in adults who received dolutegravir 50 mg once daily.  \n \nLimited data are available in adolescents receiving a daily dose of 300 mg of lamivudine. Pharmacokinetic \nparameters are comparable to those reported in adults. \n \nElderly \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of dolutegravir using data in HIV-1 infected adults showed that there \nwas no clinically relevant effect of age on dolutegravir exposure. \n \nPharmacokinetic data for dolutegravir and lamivudine in subjects >65 years of age are limited. \n \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetic data have been obtained for dolutegravir and lamivudine separately. \n \nRenal clearance of unchanged active substance is a minor pathway of elimination for dolutegravir. A study \nof the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir was performed in subjects with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min). No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with severe renal \nimpairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) and matching healthy subjects were observed. Dolutegravir has not been \nstudied in patients on dialysis, though differences in exposure are not expected. \n \nStudies with lamivudine show that plasma concentrations (AUC) are increased in patients with renal \ndysfunction due to decreased clearance.  \n \nBased on the lamivudine data, Dovato is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance of \n< 50 mL/min. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetic data has been obtained for dolutegravir and lamivudine separately.  \n \nDolutegravir is primarily metabolized and eliminated by the liver. A single dose of 50 mg of dolutegravir \nwas administered to 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) and to 8 matched \nhealthy adult controls. While the total dolutegravir concentration in plasma was similar, a 1.5 to 2 fold \nincrease in unbound exposure to dolutegravir was observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \ncompared to healthy controls. No dosage adjustment is considered necessary for patients with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \ndolutegravir has not been studied. \n \nData obtained in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment show that lamivudine \npharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by hepatic dysfunction. \n \nPolymorphisms in drug metabolising enzymes \nThere is no evidence that common polymorphisms in drug metabolising enzymes alter dolutegravir \npharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful extent. In a meta-analysis using pharmacogenomics samples \ncollected in clinical studies in healthy subjects, subjects with UGT1A1 (n=7) genotypes conferring poor \ndolutegravir metabolism had a 32% lower clearance of dolutegravir and 46% higher AUC compared with \nsubjects with genotypes associated with normal metabolism via UGT1A1 (n=41). \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \nGender \nPopulation PK analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from clinical studies where dolutegravir or \nlamivudine was administered to adults in combination with other ARVs revealed no clinically relevant effect \nof gender on the exposure of dolutegravir or lamivudine. There is no evidence that a dose adjustment of \ndolutegravir or lamivudine would be required based on the effects of gender on PK parameters. \n \nRace  \nPopulation PK analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from clinical studies where dolutegravir was \nadministered to adults in combination with other ARVs revealed no clinically relevant effect of race on the \nexposure of dolutegravir. The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir following single dose oral administration to \nJapanese subjects appear similar to observed parameters in Western (US) subjects. There is no evidence that \na dose adjustment of dolutegravir or lamivudine would be required based on the effects of race on PK \nparameters.  \n \nCo-infection with Hepatitis B or C  \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that hepatitis C virus co-infection had no clinically relevant \neffect on the exposure to dolutegravir. There are limited pharmacokinetic data on subjects with hepatitis B \nco-infection (see section 4.4). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere are no data available on the effects of the combination of dolutegravir and lamivudine in animals. \n \nCarcinogenesis and mutagenesis \n \nDolutegravir was not mutagenic or clastogenic using in vitro tests in bacteria and cultured mammalian cells, \nand an in vivo rodent micronucleus assay. Lamivudine was not mutagenic in bacterial tests, but consistent \nwith other nucleoside analogues, inhibits cellular DNA replication in in vitro mammalian tests such as the \nmouse lymphoma assay. The results from two in vivo rat micronucleus tests with lamivudine were negative. \nLamivudine has not shown any genotoxic activity in the in vivo studies.  \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of a combination of dolutegravir and lamivudine has not been tested. Dolutegravir \nwas not carcinogenic in long term studies in the mouse and rat. In long-term oral carcinogenicity studies in \nrats and mice, lamivudine did not show any carcinogenic potential.  \n \nReproductive toxicology studies \n \nIn reproductive toxicity studies in animals, dolutegravir and lamivudine were shown to cross the placenta. \n \nOral administration of dolutegravir to pregnant rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg daily from days 6 to 17 of \ngestation did not elicit maternal toxicity, developmental toxicity or teratogenicity (37.2 times the 50 mg \nhuman clinical exposure, based on AUC following single dose in the fasted state). Oral administration of \ndolutegravir to pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1000 mg/kg daily from days 6 to 18 of gestation did not elicit \ndevelopmental toxicity or teratogenicity (0.55 times the 50 mg human clinical exposure, based on AUC \nfollowing single dose in the fasted state). In rabbits, maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption, scant/no \nfaeces/urine, suppressed body weight gain) was observed at 1000 mg/kg (0.55 times the 50 mg human \nclinical exposure, based on AUC following single dose in the fasted state). \n \nLamivudine was not teratogenic in animal studies but there were indications of an increase in early \nembryonic deaths in rabbits at relatively low systemic exposures, comparable to those achieved in humans. A \nsimilar effect was not seen in rats even at very high systemic exposure. \n \nFertility studies in rats have shown that dolutegravir or lamivudine have no effect on male or female fertility. \n \nRepeated dose toxicity \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nThe effect of prolonged daily treatment with high doses of dolutegravir has been evaluated in repeat oral \ndose toxicity studies in rats (up to 26 weeks) and in monkeys (up to 38 weeks). The primary effect of \ndolutegravir was gastrointestinal intolerance or irritation in rats and monkeys at doses that produce systemic \nexposures approximately 28.5 and 1.1 times the 50 mg human clinical exposure following single dose in the \nfasted state based on AUC, respectively. Because gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance is considered to be due to \nlocal active substance administration, mg/kg or mg/m2 metrics are appropriate determinates of safety cover \nfor this toxicity. GI intolerance in monkeys occurred at 30 times the human mg/kg equivalent dose (based on \n50 kg human), and 11 times the human mg/m2 equivalent dose for a total daily clinical dose of 50 mg. \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n39 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nDovato 50 mg/300 mg film-coated tablets \ndolutegravir/lamivudine \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if \n\ntheir signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Dovato is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Dovato  \n3. How to take Dovato \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Dovato  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Dovato is and what it is used for \n \nDovato is a medicine that contains two active ingredients used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) \ninfection: dolutegravir and lamivudine. Dolutegravir belongs to a group of anti-retroviral medicines called \nintegrase inhibitors (INIs), and lamivudine belongs to a group of anti-retroviral medicines called nucleoside \nanalogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). \n \nDovato is used to treat HIV in adults and adolescents over 12 years old who weigh at least 40 kg. \n \nDovato does not cure HIV infection; it keeps the amount of virus in your body at a low level. This helps \nmaintain the number of CD4 cells in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood cells that are important \nin helping your body to fight infection. \n \nNot everyone responds to treatment with Dovato in the same way. Your doctor will monitor the effectiveness \nof your treatment. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Dovato \n \nDo not take Dovato: \n\n• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to dolutegravir or lamivudine or any of the other ingredients of \nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n• If you are taking a medicine called fampridine (also known as dalfampridine; used in multiple \nsclerosis). \n\n \n→ If you think any of these apply to you, tell your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nSome people taking Dovato or other combination treatments for HIV are more at risk of serious side effects \nthan others. You need to be aware of the extra risks: \n\n• if you have moderate or severe liver disease \n\n\n\n40 \n\n• if you have ever had liver disease, including hepatitis B or C (if you have hepatitis B infection, don’t \nstop Dovato without your doctor’s advice, as your hepatitis may come back) \n\n• if you have a kidney problem. \n→ Talk to your doctor before using Dovato if any of these apply to you. You may need extra check-\nups, including blood tests, while you’re taking your medicine. See section 4 for more information. \n\n \nAllergic reactions \nDovato contains dolutegravir. Dolutegravir can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity \nreaction. You need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you’re taking Dovato. \n\n→ Read the information ‘Allergic reactions’ in section 4 of this leaflet. \n \nLook out for important symptoms \nSome people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. These \ninclude: \n\n• symptoms of infections and inflammation \n• joint pain, stiffness and bone problems. \n\nYou need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you’re taking Dovato. \n→ Read the information ‘Other possible side effects’ in section 4 of this leaflet. \n \n\nProtect other people \nHIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who has the infection or by transfer of infected \nblood (for example, by sharing injection needles). You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions \nneeded to avoid infecting other people. \n \nChildren \nThis medicine is not for use in children under 12 years of age, because it has not been studied in these \npatients. \n \nOther medicines and Dovato \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nDon't take Dovato with the following medicine: \n\n• fampridine (also known as dalfampridine), used in multiple sclerosis. \n \nSome medicines can affect how Dovato works or make it more likely that you will have side effects. Dovato \ncan also affect how some other medicines work. \nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines in the following list: \n\n• metformin, to treat diabetes \n• medicines called antacids, to treat indigestion and heartburn. Do not take an antacid during the \n\n6 hours before you take Dovato, or for at least 2 hours after you take it (see also section 3, ‘How to \ntake Dovato’) \n\n• supplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or magnesium. If you take Dovato with \nfood, you can take supplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or magnesium at the same \ntime as Dovato. If you do not take Dovato with food, do not take a supplement or multivitamin \ncontaining calcium, iron or magnesium during the 6 hours before you take Dovato, or for at least \n2 hours after you take it (see also section 3, ‘How to take Dovato’) \n\n• emtricitabine, etravirine, efavirenz, nevirapine or tipranavir/ritonavir, to treat HIV infection \n• medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol, mannitol, \n\nlactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly \n• cladribine, to treat leukaemia or multiple sclerosis  \n• rifampicin, to treat tuberculosis (TB) and other bacterial infections \n• phenytoin and phenobarbital, to treat epilepsy \n• oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine, to treat epilepsy or bipolar disorder \n• St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy to treat depression. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n → Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your doctor may decide to adjust \nyour dose or that you need extra check ups. \n\n \nPregnancy \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or if you are planning to have a baby: \n → Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Dovato. \n \nTaking Dovato at the time of becoming pregnant or during the first six weeks of pregnancy, may increase the \nrisk of a birth defect, called neural tube defect, such as spina bifida (malformed spinal cord). \n \nIf you could get pregnant while taking Dovato: \n → Talk to your doctor and discuss whether there is a need for contraception, such as condom or \npills. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. Your doctor will \nreview your treatment. Do not stop taking Dovato without consulting your doctor, as this may harm you and \nyour unborn child.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nWomen who are HIV-positive must not breast feed because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in \nbreast milk.  \n \nA small amount of the ingredients in Dovato can also pass into your breast milk. \n \nIf you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding: \n → Talk to your doctor immediately.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nDovato can make you dizzy, and have other side effects that make you less alert. \n → Don’t drive or operate machinery unless you are sure you’re not affected. \n \n \n3. How to take Dovato \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure. \n \n\n• The recommended dose of Dovato is one tablet once a day. \n \nSwallow the tablet with some liquid. Dovato can be taken with or without food. \n \nUse in adolescents \nAdolescents aged between 12 and 17 years and weighing at least 40 kg can take the adult dose of one tablet \nonce a day. \n \nAntacid medicines \nAntacids, to treat indigestion and heartburn, can stop Dovato being absorbed into your body and make it less \neffective. \nDo not take an antacid during the 6 hours before you take Dovato, or for at least 2 hours after you take it. \nYou can take other acid-lowering medicines like ranitidine and omeprazole at the same time as Dovato. \n → Talk to your doctor for further advice on taking acid-lowering medicines with Dovato. \n \nSupplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or magnesium \nSupplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or magnesium can stop Dovato being absorbed into \nyour body and make it less effective. \n\n\n\n42 \n\nIf you take Dovato with food, you can take supplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or \nmagnesium at the same time as Dovato. If you do not take Dovato with food, do not take a supplement or \nmultivitamin containing calcium, iron or magnesium during the 6 hours before you take Dovato, or for at \nleast 2 hours after you take it. \n → Talk to your doctor for further advice on taking supplements or multivitamins containing calcium, \niron or magnesium with Dovato. \n \nIf you take more Dovato than you should \nIf you take too many tablets of Dovato contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice. If possible, show \nthem the Dovato pack. \n \nIf you forget to take Dovato \nIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. But if your next dose is due within 4 hours, skip the \ndose you missed and take the next one at the usual time. Then continue your treatment as before. \n →Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nDon’t stop taking Dovato without advice from your doctor \nTake Dovato for as long as your doctor recommends. Don’t stop unless your doctor tells you to. Stopping \nDovato can affect your health and how future treatment works. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects   \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them, so it is very \nimportant to talk to your doctor about any changes in your health. \n \nAllergic reactions \nDovato contains dolutegravir. Dolutegravir can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity \nreaction. This is an uncommon reaction (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) in people taking dolutegravir. If \nyou get any of the following symptoms: \n\n• skin rash \n• a high temperature (fever) \n• lack of energy (fatigue) \n• swelling, sometimes of the face or mouth (angioedema), causing difficulty in breathing \n• muscle or joint aches. \n→ See a doctor straight away. Your doctor may decide to carry out tests to check your liver, kidneys or \nblood, and may tell you to stop taking Dovato. \n\n \nVery common side effects  \nThese may affect more than 1 in 10 people: \n\n• headache \n• diarrhoea \n• feeling sick (nausea).  \n\n \nCommon side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people: \n\n• depression (feelings of deep sadness and unworthiness) \n• rash \n• itching (pruritus) \n• being sick (vomiting) \n• stomach (abdominal) pain or discomfort \n• wind (flatulence) \n• dizziness \n• feeling drowsy \n\n\n\n43 \n\n• difficulty sleeping (insomnia) \n• abnormal dreams \n• lack of energy (fatigue) \n• hair loss \n• anxiety \n• joint pain \n• muscle pain. \n\n \nCommon side effects that may show up in blood tests are: \n\n• increase in the level of liver enzymes (aminotransferases) \n• increase in the level of enzymes produced in the muscles (creatine phosphokinase). \n\n \nUncommon side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 100 people: \n\n• inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) \n• suicidal attempt (particularly in patients who have had depression or mental health problems before) \n• suicidal thoughts (particularly in patients who have had depression or mental health problems before). \n\n \nUncommon side effects that may show up in blood tests are: \n\n• a decreased number of cells involved in blood clotting (thrombocytopenia) \n• a low red blood cell count (anaemia) or low white blood cell count (neutropenia). \n\n \nRare side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 1000 people: \n\n• liver failure (signs may include yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes or unusually dark \nurine) \n\n• swelling, sometimes of the face or mouth (angioedema), causing difficulty in breathing \n• inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) \n• breakdown of muscle tissue. \n\n \nRare side effects that may show up in blood tests are: \n\n• increase in an enzyme called amylase. \n \nVery rare side effects \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people: \n\n• lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) \n• numbness, tingly feelings in the skin (pins and needles) \n• sensation of weakness in the limbs. \n\n \nVery rare side effects that may show up in blood tests are: \n\n• a failure of the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells (pure red cell aplasia). \n \nOther possible side effects \n\nPeople taking combination therapy for HIV may get other side effects. \n \nSymptoms of infection and inflammation  \n\nPeople with advanced HIV infection or AIDS have weak immune systems, and are more likely to develop \nserious infections (opportunistic infections). Such infections may have been “silent” and not detected by the \nweak immune system before treatment was started. After starting treatment, the immune system becomes \n\n\n\n44 \n\nstronger, and may attack the infections, which can cause symptoms of infection or inflammation. Symptoms \nusually include fever, plus some of the following: \n\n• headache \n• stomach ache \n• difficulty breathing. \n\nIn rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue (autoimmune \ndisorders). The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking \nmedicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: \n\n• palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor \n• hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement) \n• weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body. \n\n \nIf you get any symptoms of infection or if you notice any of the symptoms above: \n → Tell your doctor immediately. Don’t take other medicines for the infection without your doctor’s \nadvice. \n \nJoint pain, stiffness and bone problems \n\nSome people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this \ncondition, parts of the bone tissue are permanently damaged because of reduced blood supply to the bone. \nPeople may be more likely to get this condition: \n\n• if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time \n• if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids \n• if they drink alcohol \n• if their immune systems are very weak \n• if they are overweight. \n\n \nSigns of osteonecrosis include: \n\n• stiffness in the joints \n• aches and pains in the joints (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) \n• difficulty moving. \n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms: \n → Tell your doctor. \n \nWeight, blood lipid and blood glucose effects:  \n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is \npartly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV medicines \nthemselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed \nin this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n5.
