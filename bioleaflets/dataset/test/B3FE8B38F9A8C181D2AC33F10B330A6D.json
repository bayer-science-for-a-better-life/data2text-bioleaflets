NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nEDURANT 25 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains rilpivirine hydrochloride equivalent to 25 mg rilpivirine.\n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach film-coated tablet contains 56 mg lactose monohydrate.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet\nWhite to off-white, round, biconvex, film-coated tablet with a diameter of 6.4 mm, debossed with \n\u201cTMC\u201d on one side and \u201c25\u201d on the other side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nEDURANT, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, is indicated for the treatment \nof human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve patients \n12 years of age and older with a viral load \u2264 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml.\n\nGenotypic resistance testing should guide the use of EDURANT (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose of EDURANT is one 25 mg tablet taken once daily. EDURANT must be \ntaken with a meal (see section 5.2).\n\nDose adjustment\nFor patients concomitantly receiving rifabutin, the EDURANT dose should be increased to 50 mg (two \ntablets of 25 mg each) taken once daily. When rifabutin co-administration is stopped, the EDURANT \ndose should be decreased to 25 mg once daily (see section 4.5).\n\nMissed dose\nIf the patient misses a dose of EDURANT within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient \nmust take the medicine with a meal as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If a \npatient misses a dose of EDURANT by more than 12 hours, the patient should not take the missed \ndose, but resume the usual dosing schedule.\n\nIf a patient vomits within 4 hours of taking the medicine, another EDURANT tablet should be taken \nwith a meal. If a patient vomits more than 4 hours after taking the medicine, the patient does not need \nto take another dose of EDURANT until the next regularly scheduled dose.\n\n\n\n3\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nThere is limited information regarding the use of EDURANT in patients > 65 years of age. No dose \nadjustment of EDURANT is required in older patients (see section 5.2). EDURANT should be used\nwith caution in this population.\n\nRenal impairment\nEDURANT has mainly been studied in patients with normal renal function. No dose adjustment of \nrilpivirine is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal \nimpairment or end-stage renal disease, rilpivirine should be used with caution. In patients with severe \nrenal impairment or end-stage renal disease, the combination of rilpivirine with a strong CYP3A \ninhibitor (e.g., ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitor) should only be used if the benefit outweighs \nthe risk (see section 5.2).\n\nTreatment with rilpivirine resulted in an early small increase of mean serum creatinine levels which \nremained stable over time and is not considered clinically relevant (see section 4.8).\n\nHepatic impairment\nThere is limited information regarding the use of EDURANT in patients with mild or moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh score A or B). No dose adjustment of EDURANT is required in patients with \nmild or moderate hepatic impairment. EDURANT should be used with caution in patients with \nmoderate hepatic impairment. EDURANT has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh score C). Therefore, EDURANT is not recommended in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of EDURANT in children aged < 12 years have not yet been established.\nNo data are available.\n\nPregnancy\nLower exposures of rilpivirine were observed during pregnancy, therefore viral load should be \nmonitored closely. Alternatively, switching to another ART regimen could be considered (see \nsections 4.4, 4.6, 5.1 and 5.2).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nEDURANT must be taken orally, once daily with a meal (see section 5.2). It is recommended that the \nfilm-coated tablet be swallowed whole with water and not be chewed or crushed.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nEDURANT should not be co-administered with the following medicinal products, as significant \ndecreases in rilpivirine plasma concentrations may occur (due to CYP3A enzyme induction or gastric \npH increase), which may result in loss of therapeutic effect of EDURANT (see section 4.5):\n- the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- the antimycobacterials rifampicin, rifapentine\n- proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, \n\nrabeprazole\n- the systemic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, except as a single dose treatment\n- St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum).\n\n\n\n4\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nVirologic failure and development of resistance\n\nEDURANT has not been evaluated in patients with previous virologic failure to any other \nantiretroviral therapy. The list of rilpivirine resistance-associated mutations presented in section 5.1 \nshould only guide the use of EDURANT in the treatment-na\u00efve population.\n\nIn the pooled efficacy analysis from the Phase III trials in adults through 96 weeks, patients treated \nwith rilpivirine with a baseline viral load > 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml had a greater risk of \nvirologic failure (18.2% with rilpivirine versus 7.9% with efavirenz) compared to patients with a \nbaseline viral load \u2264 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml (5.7% with rilpivirine versus 3.6% with \nefavirenz). The greater risk of virologic failure for patients in the rilpivirine arm was observed in the \nfirst 48 weeks of these trials (see section 5.1). Patients with a baseline viral load \n> 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml who experienced virologic failure exhibited a higher rate of \ntreatment-emergent resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class. \nMore patients who failed virologically on rilpivirine than who failed virologically on efavirenz \ndeveloped lamivudine/emtricitabine associated resistance (see section 5.1).\n\nFindings in adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age) in trial TMC278-C213 were generally in line \nwith these data (for details see section 5.1).\n\nOnly adolescents deemed likely to have good adherence to antiretroviral therapy should be treated \nwith rilpivirine, as suboptimal adherence can lead to development of resistance and the loss of future \ntreatment options.\n\nAs with other antiretroviral medicinal products, resistance testing should guide the use of rilpivirine\n(see section 5.1).\n\nCardiovascular\n\nAt supra-therapeutic doses (75 and 300 mg once daily), rilpivirine has been associated with \nprolongation of the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) (see sections 4.5, 4.8 and 5.2). \nEDURANT at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily is not associated with a clinically relevant \neffect on QTc. EDURANT should be used with caution when co-administered with medicinal \nproducts with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.\n\nImmune reactivation syndrome\n\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus \nretinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Any \ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).\n\nPregnancy\nEdurant should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. \nLower exposures of rilpivirine were observed when rilpivirine 25 mg once daily was taken during \n\n\n\n5\n\npregnancy. In the Phase III studies, lower rilpivirine exposure, similar to that seen during pregnancy, \nhas been associated with an increased risk of virological failure, therefore viral load should be \nmonitored closely (see sections 4.6, 5.1 and 5.2). Alternatively, switching to another ART regimen \ncould be considered.\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of EDURANT\nEDURANT contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nMedicinal products that affect rilpivirine exposure\nRilpivirine is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A. Medicinal products that induce or \ninhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine (see section 5.2). Co-administration of \nrilpivirine and medicinal products that induce CYP3A has been observed to decrease the plasma \nconcentrations of rilpivirine, which could reduce the therapeutic effect of rilpivirine.\nCo-administration of rilpivirine and medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A has been observed to\nincrease the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine.\nCo-administration of rilpivirine with medicinal products that increase gastric pH may result in\ndecreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine which could potentially reduce the therapeutic effect of \nEDURANT.\n\nMedicinal products that are affected by the use of rilpivirine\nRilpivirine at a dose of 25 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the \nexposure of medicinal products metabolised by CYP enzymes.\nRilpivirine inhibits P-glycoprotein in vitro (IC50 is 9.2 \u03bcM). In a clinical study, rilpivirine did not \nsignificantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. However, it may not be completely excluded that \nrilpivirine can increase the exposure to other medicines transported by P-glycoprotein that are more \nsensitive to intestinal P-gp inhibition, e.g. dabigatran etexilate.\n\nRilpivirine is an in vitro inhibitor of the transporter MATE-2K with an IC50 of < 2.7 nM. The clinical \nimplications of this finding are currently unknown.\n\nEstablished and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non-antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts are listed in table 1.\n\nInteraction table\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nInteractions between rilpivirine and co-administered medicinal products are listed in table 1 (increase \nis indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d, not applicable as \u201cNA\u201d, confidence interval as \n\u201cCI\u201d).\n\nTable 1: INTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL \nPRODUCTS\n\nMedicinal products by \ntherapeutic areas\n\nInteraction\nGeometric mean change (%)\n\nRecommendations concerning \nco-administration\n\nANTI-INFECTIVES\nAntiretrovirals\nHIV NRTIs/N[t]RTIs\n\nDidanosine*#\n\n400 mg once daily\ndidanosine AUC \u2191 12%\ndidanosine Cmin NA\ndidanosine Cmax \u2194\nrilpivirine AUC \u2194\nrilpivirine Cmin \u2194\nrilpivirine Cmax \u2194\n\nNo dose adjustment is required. \nDidanosine should be administered at \nleast two hours before or at least four \nhours after rilpivirine.\n\n\n\n6\n\nTenofovir disoproxil \nfumarate*#\n\n300 mg once daily\n\ntenofovir AUC \u2191 23%\ntenofovir Cmin \u2191 24%\ntenofovir Cmax \u2191 19%\nrilpivirine AUC \u2194\nrilpivirine Cmin \u2194\nrilpivirine Cmax \u2194\n\nNo dose adjustment is required.\n\nOther NRTIs\n(abacavir, emtricitabine, \nlamivudine, stavudine \nand zidovudine)\n\nNot studied.

All other drug-drug interactions \nshown are predicted.\n\n#\nThis interaction study has been performed with a dose higher than the recommended dose for rilpivirine assessing the maximal effect \non the co-administered medicinal product. The dosing recommendation is applicable to the recommended dose of rilpivirine of 25 mg \nonce daily.\n\n\u2020\nThis interaction study has been performed with a dose higher than the recommended dose for rilpivirine.\n\nQT prolonging medicinal products\n\nThere is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between \nrilpivirine and medicinal products that prolong the QTc interval of the ECG. In a study of healthy \nsubjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been \nshown to prolong the QTc interval of the ECG (see section 5.1). EDURANT should be used with \ncaution when co-administered with a medicinal product with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of rilpivirine in \npregnant women (see sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2). Lower exposures of rilpivirine were observed during \npregnancy, therefore viral load should be monitored closely.\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3).\n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of EDURANT during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether rilpivirine is excreted in human milk. Rilpivirine is excreted in the milk of \nrats. Because of both the potential for HIV transmission and the potential for adverse reactions in \nbreastfed infants, mothers should be instructed not to breast-feed if they are receiving rilpivirine.\n\nFertility\n\nNo human data on the effect of rilpivirine on fertility are available. No clinically relevant effects on \nfertility were seen in animal studies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nEDURANT has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, fatigue, \ndizziness and somnolence have been reported in some patients taking EDURANT and should be \nconsidered when assessing a patient\u2019s ability to drive or operate machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nDuring the clinical development program (1,368 patients in the Phase III controlled trials \nTMC278-C209 (ECHO) and TMC278-C215 (THRIVE)), 55.7% of subjects experienced at least one \nadverse drug reaction (see section 5.1). The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) \n(\u2265 2%) that were at least of moderate intensity were depression (4.1%), headache (3.5%), insomnia \n(3.5%), rash (2.3%), and abdominal pain (2.0%). The most frequent serious treatment-related ADRs\nwere reported in 7 (1.0%) patients receiving rilpivirine. The median duration of exposure for patients \nin the rilpivirine arm and efavirenz arm was 104.3 and 104.1 weeks, respectively. Most ADRs \noccurred in the first 48 weeks of treatment.\n\n\n\n11\n\nSelected treatment emergent clinical laboratory abnormalities (grade 3 or grade 4), considered as \nADRs, reported in EDURANT treated patients were increased pancreatic amylase (3.8%), increased \nAST (2.3%), increased ALT (1.6%), increased LDL cholesterol (fasted, 1.5%), decreased white blood \ncell count (1.2%), increased lipase (0.9%), increased bilirubin (0.7%), increased triglycerides (fasted, \n0.6%), decreased haemoglobin (0.1%), decreased platelet count (0.1%), and increased total cholesterol \n(fasted, 0.1%).\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nADRs reported in adult patients treated with rilpivirine are summarised in Table 2. The ADRs are \nlisted by system organ class (SOC) and frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, \nADRs are presented in order of decreasing frequency.\n\nTable 2: ADRs reported in antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adult patients \ntreated with Rilpivirine\n\n(pooled data from the week 96 analysis of the Phase III ECHO and THRIVE trials) N=686\nSystem Organ Class (SOC) Frequency Category ADRs\n\n(Rilpivirine + BR)\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\n\ncommon decreased white blood cell count\ndecreased haemoglobin\ndecreased platelet count\n\nImmune system disorders uncommon immune reactivation syndrome\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\nvery common increased total cholesterol (fasted)\nincreased LDL cholesterol (fasted)\n\ncommon decreased appetite\nincreased triglycerides (fasted)\n\nPsychiatric disorders very common insomnia\ncommon abnormal dreams\n\ndepression\nsleep disorders\ndepressed mood\n\nNervous system disorders very common headache\ndizziness\n\ncommon somnolence\nGastrointestinal disorders very common nausea\n\nincreased pancreatic amylase\ncommon abdominal pain\n\nvomiting\nincreased lipase\nabdominal discomfort\ndry mouth\n\nHepatobiliary disorders very common increased transaminases\ncommon increased bilirubin\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\ncommon rash\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\ncommon fatigue\n\nBR=background regimen\nN=number of subjects\n\nLaboratory abnormalities\nIn the rilpivirine arm in the week 96 analysis of the Phase III ECHO and THRIVE trials, mean change \nfrom baseline in total cholesterol (fasted) was 5 mg/dl, in HDL cholesterol (fasted) 4 mg/dl, in LDL\ncholesterol (fasted) 1 mg/dl, and in triglycerides (fasted) -7 mg/dl.\n\n\n\n12\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nImmune reactivation syndrome\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population (12 to less than 18 years of age)\n\nThe safety assessment is based on the week 48 analysis of the single-arm, open-label, Phase II trial, \nTMC278-C213, in which 36 antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adolescent patients\nweighing at least 32 kg received rilpivirine (25 mg once daily) in combination with other antiretroviral \nagents (see section 5.1). The median duration of exposure for patients was 63.5 weeks. There were no \npatients who discontinued treatment due to ADRs. No new ADRs were identified compared to those \nseen in adults.\n\nMost ADRs were Grade 1 or 2. The most common ADRs (all grades, greater than or equal to 10%) \nwere headache (19.4%), depression (19.4%), somnolence (13.9%), and nausea (11.1%). No grade 3-4 \nlaboratory abnormalities for AST/ALT or grade 3-4 ADRs of transaminase increased were reported.\n\nThere were no new safety concerns identified in the Week 240 analysis of the TMC278-C213 trial in \nadolescents.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of rilpivirine in children aged < 12 years have not yet been established. No \ndata are available.\n\nOther special populations\n\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus\nIn patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C virus receiving rilpivirine, the incidence of hepatic \nenzyme elevation was higher than in patients receiving rilpivirine who were not co-infected. This \nobservation was the same in the efavirenz arm. The pharmacokinetic exposure of rilpivirine in \nco-infected patients was comparable to that in patients without co-infection.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with EDURANT. Human experience of overdose with \nrilpivirine is limited. Symptoms of overdose may include headache, nausea, dizziness and/or abnormal \ndreams. Treatment of overdose with rilpivirine consists of general supportive measures including \nmonitoring of vital signs and ECG (QT interval) as well as observation of the clinical status of the \npatient. Further management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national \npoisons centre, where available. Since rilpivirine is highly bound to plasma protein, dialysis is unlikely \nto result in significant removal of the active substance.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors, ATC code: J05AG05.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nRilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine NNRTI of HIV-1. Rilpivirine activity is mediated by non-competitive \ninhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Rilpivirine does not inhibit the human cellular DNA \npolymerases \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3.\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\n\nRilpivirine exhibited activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 in an acutely infected \nT-cell line with a median EC50 value for HIV-1/IIIB of 0.73 nM (0.27 ng/ml). Although rilpivirine\ndemonstrated limited in vitro activity against HIV-2 with EC50 values ranging from 2,510 to \n10,830 nM (920 to 3,970 ng/ml), treatment of HIV-2 infection with rilpivirine is not recommended in \nthe absence of clinical data.\n\nRilpivirine also demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M (subtype A, B, \nC, D, F, G, H) primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from 0.07 to 1.01 nM (0.03 to 0.37 ng/ml) \nand group O primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from 2.88 to 8.45 nM (1.06 to 3.10 ng/ml).\n\nResistance\n\nIn cell culture\nRilpivirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different \norigins and subtypes as well as NNRTI resistant HIV-1. The most commonly observed \nresistance-associated mutations that emerged included L100I, K101E, V108I, E138K, V179F, Y181C, \nH221Y, F227C and M230I.\n\nResistance to rilpivirine was determined as a fold change in EC50 value (FC) above the biological \ncut-off (BCO) of the assay.\n\nIn treatment-na\u00efve adult subjects\nFor the resistance analysis, a broader definition of virologic failure was used than in the primary \nefficacy analysis. In the week 48 pooled resistance analysis from the Phase III trials, 62 (of a total of\n72) virologic failures in the rilpivirine arm had resistance data at baseline and time of failure. In this \nanalysis, the resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) associated with NNRTI resistance that \ndeveloped in at least 2 rilpivirine virologic failures were: V90I, K101E, E138K, E138Q, V179I, \nY181C, V189I, H221Y, and F227C. In the trials, the presence of the mutations V90I and V189I, at \nbaseline, did not affect response. The E138K substitution emerged most frequently during rilpivirine \ntreatment, commonly in combination with the M184I substitution. In the week 48 analysis, 31 out of \n62 of rilpivirine virologic failures had concomitant NNRTI and NRTI RAMs; 17 of those 31 had the \ncombination of E138K and M184I. The most common mutations were the same in the week 48 and\nweek 96 analyses.\n\nIn the week 96 pooled resistance analysis, lower rates of virologic failure were observed in the second \n48 weeks than in the first 48 weeks of treatment. From the week 48 to the week 96 analysis, 24 (3.5%) \nand 14 (2.1%) additional virologic failures occurred in the rilpivirine and efavirenz arm, respectively. \nOf these virologic failures, 9 out of 24 and 4 out of 14 were in subjects with a baseline viral load \n< 100,000 copies/ml, respectively.\n\n\n\n14\n\nIn treatment-na\u00efve adolescent subjects\nIn the week 240 resistance analysis of the TMC278-C213 trial, rilpivirine resistance-associated \nmutations (RAMs) were observed in 46.7% (7/15) of subjects with virologic failure and post-baseline \ngenotypic data. All subjects with rilpivirine RAMs also had at least 1 treatment-emergent NRTI RAM \nat the last post-baseline time point with genotypic data.\n\nConsidering all of the available in vitro and in vivo data in treatment-na\u00efve subjects, the following \nresistance-associated mutations, when present at baseline, may affect the activity of rilpivirine: \nK101E, K101P, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138R, E138Q, V179L, Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, Y188L, \nH221Y, F227C, M230I, and M230L. These rilpivirine resistance-associated mutations should only \nguide the use of EDURANT in the treatment-na\u00efve population. These resistance-associated mutations \nwere derived from in vivo data involving treatment-na\u00efve subjects only and therefore cannot be used to \npredict the activity of rilpivirine in subjects who have virologically failed an antiretroviral-containing \nregimen.\n\nAs with other antiretroviral medicinal products, resistance testing should guide the use of EDURANT.\n\nCross-resistance\n\nSite-directed NNRTI mutant virus\nIn a panel of 67 HIV-1 recombinant laboratory strains with one resistance-associated mutation at RT \npositions associated with NNRTI resistance, including the most commonly found K103N and Y181C, \nrilpivirine showed antiviral activity against 64 (96%) of these strains. The single resistance-associated \nmutations associated with a loss of susceptibility to rilpivirine were: K101P, Y181I and Y181V. The \nK103N substitution did not result in reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine by itself, but the combination \nof K103N and L100I resulted in a 7-fold reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine.\n\nRecombinant clinical isolates\nRilpivirine retained sensitivity (FC \u2264 BCO) against 62% of 4,786 HIV-1 recombinant clinical isolates \nresistant to efavirenz and/or nevirapine.\n\nTreatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adult patients\nIn the week 96 pooled resistance analysis of the Phase III trials (ECHO and THRIVE), 42 out of \n86 subjects with virologic failure on rilpivirine showed treatment-emergent resistance to rilpivirine \n(genotypic analysis). In these patients, phenotypic cross-resistance to other NNRTIs was noted as \nfollows: etravirine 32/42, efavirenz 30/42, and nevirapine 16/42. In patients with a baseline viral load \n\u2264 100,000 copies/ml, 9 out of 27 patients with virologic failure on rilpivirine showed \ntreatment-emergent resistance to rilpivirine (genotypic analysis), with the following frequency of \nphenotypic cross-resistance: etravirine 4/9, efavirenz 3/9, and nevirapine 1/9.\n\nEffects on electrocardiogram\n\nThe effect of rilpivirine at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily on the QTcF interval was \nevaluated in a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) controlled crossover \nstudy in 60 healthy adults, with 13 measurements over 24 hours at steady-state. EDURANT at the \nrecommended dose of 25 mg once daily is not associated with a clinically relevant effect on QTc.\n\nWhen supratherapeutic doses of 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily of rilpivirine were studied in \nhealthy adults, the maximum mean time-matched (95% upper confidence bound) differences in QTcF \ninterval from placebo after baseline correction were 10.7 (15.3) and 23.3 (28.4) ms, respectively. \nSteady-state administration of rilpivirine 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily resulted in a mean \nCmax approximately 2.6-fold and 6.7-fold, respectively, higher than the mean steady-state Cmax\nobserved with the recommended 25 mg once daily dose of rilpivirine.\n\n\n\n15\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nTreatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adult patients\nThe evidence of efficacy of rilpivirine is based on the analyses of 96 week data from 2 randomised, \ndouble-blinded, active-controlled, Phase III trials TMC278-C209 (ECHO) and TMC278-C215 \n(THRIVE). The trials were identical in design, with the exception of the background regimen (BR). In \nthe week 96 efficacy analysis, the virologic response rate [confirmed undetectable viral load \n(< 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml)] was evaluated in patients receiving rilpivirine 25 mg once daily in \naddition to a BR versus patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg once daily in addition to a BR. Similar \nefficacy for rilpivirine was seen in each trial demonstrating non-inferiority to efavirenz.\n\nAntiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected patients were enrolled who had a plasma \nHIV-1 RNA \u2265 5,000 copies/ml and were screened for susceptibility to N(t)RTIs and for absence of \nspecific NNRTI resistance-associated mutations. In ECHO, the BR was fixed to the N(t)RTIs, \ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine. In THRIVE, the BR consisted of \n2 investigator-selected N(t)RTIs: tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine or zidovudine plus \nlamivudine or abacavir plus lamivudine. In ECHO, randomisation was stratified by screening viral \nload. In THRIVE, randomisation was stratified by screening viral load and by N(t)RTI BR.\n\nThis analysis included 690 patients in ECHO and 678 patients in THRIVE who had completed \n96 weeks of treatment or discontinued earlier.\n\nIn the pooled analysis for ECHO and THRIVE, demographics and baseline characteristics were \nbalanced between the rilpivirine arm and the efavirenz arm. Table 3 displays selected baseline disease \ncharacteristics of the patients in the rilpivirine and efavirenz arms.\n\nTable 3: Baseline disease characteristics of antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adult \nsubjects in the ECHO and THRIVE trials (pooled analysis)\n\nPooled data from the ECHO and THRIVE trials\nRilpivirine + BR\n\nN=686\nEfavirenz + BR\n\nN=682\nBaseline disease characteristics\nMedian baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA (range), \nlog10 copies/ml\n\n5.0\n(2-7)\n\n5.0\n(3-7)\n\nMedian baseline CD4+ cell count (range), \nx 106 cells/l\n\n249\n(1-888)\n\n260\n(1-1,137)\n\nPercentage of subjects with:\nhepatitis B/C virus co-infection 7.3% 9.5%\n\nPercentage of patients with the following \nbackground regimens:\n\ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus \nemtricitabine\nzidovudine plus lamivudine\nabacavir plus lamivudine\n\n80.2%\n\n14.7%\n5.1%\n\n80.1%\n\n15.1%\n4.8%\n\nBR=background regimen\n\nTable 4 below shows the results of the week 48 and the week 96 efficacy analysis for patients treated \nwith rilpivirine and patients treated with efavirenz from the pooled data from the ECHO and THRIVE \ntrials.

In the open label part of the trial, patients originally randomised to one of the three doses of \nrilpivirine were all treated with rilpivirine 25 mg once daily in addition to a BR, once the dose for the \nPhase III studies was selected. Patients in the control arm received efavirenz 600 mg once daily in \naddition to a BR in both parts of the study. The BR consisted of 2 investigator-selected N(t)RTIs: \nzidovudine plus lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine.\n\nStudy TMC278-C204 enrolled 368 HIV-1 infected treatment-na\u00efve adult patients who had a plasma \nHIV-1 RNA \u2265 5,000 copies/ml, previously received \u2264 2 weeks of treatment with an N(t)RTI or \nprotease inhibitor, had no prior use of NNRTIs and were screened for susceptibility to N(t)RTI and for \nabsence of specific NNRTI resistance-associated mutations.\n\nAt 96 weeks, the proportion of patients with < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml receiving rilpivirine 25 mg \n(N=93) compared to patients receiving efavirenz (N=89) was 76% and 71%, respectively. The mean \nincrease from baseline in CD4+ counts was 146 \u00d7 106 cells/l in patients receiving rilpivirine 25 mg \nand 160 \u00d7 106 cells/l in patients receiving efavirenz.\n\nOf those patients who were responders at week 96, 74% of patients receiving rilpivirine remained with \nundetectable viral load (< 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml) at week 240 compared to 81% of patients \nreceiving efavirenz. There were no safety concerns identified in the week 240 analyses.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and efficacy of rilpivirine 25 mg once daily, in combination \nwith an investigator-selected BR containing two NRTIs, was evaluated in trial TMC278-C213, a \nsingle-arm, open-label Phase II trial in antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adolescent\nsubjects weighing at least 32 kg. This analysis included 36 patients who had completed at least\n48 weeks of treatment or discontinued earlier.\n\n\n\n18\n\nThe 36 subjects had a median age of 14.5 years (range: 12 to 17 years), and were 55.6% female, \n88.9% Black and 11.1% Asian. The median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.8 log10 copies per ml, \nand the median baseline CD4+ cell count was 414 \u00d7 106 cells/l (range: 25 to 983 \u00d7 106 cells/l).\n\nTable 6 summarizes the week 48 and week 240 virologic outcome results for trial TMC278-C213.

The pharmacokinetic data demonstrate \nthat total exposure (AUC) to rilpivirine as a part of an antiretroviral regimen was approximately 30%\nlower during pregnancy compared with postpartum (6-12 weeks). The virologic response was \ngenerally preserved throughout the study: of the 12 subjects that completed the study, 10 subjects were \nsuppressed at the end of the study; in the other 2 subjects an increase in viral load was observed only \npostpartum, for at least 1 subject due to suspected suboptimal adherence. No mother to child \ntransmission occurred in all 10 infants born to the mothers who completed the trial and for whom the \nHIV status was available. Rilpivirine was well tolerated during pregnancy and postpartum. There were \nno new safety findings compared with the known safety profile of rilpivirine in HIV-1 infected adults \n(see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of rilpivirine have been evaluated in adult healthy subjects and in \nantiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected patients 12 years of age and older. Exposure to \nrilpivirine was generally lower in HIV-1 infected patients than in healthy subjects.\n\n\n\n19\n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter oral administration, the maximum plasma concentration of rilpivirine is generally achieved \nwithin 4-5 hours. The absolute bioavailability of EDURANT is unknown.\n\nEffect of food on absorption\n\nThe exposure to rilpivirine was approximately 40% lower when EDURANT was taken in a fasted \ncondition as compared to a normal caloric meal (533 kcal) or high-fat high-caloric meal (928 kcal). \nWhen EDURANT was taken with only a protein-rich nutritional drink, exposures were 50% lower \nthan when taken with a meal. EDURANT must be taken with a meal to obtain optimal absorption. \nTaking EDURANT in fasted condition or with only a nutritional drink may result in decreased plasma \nconcentrations of rilpivirine, which could potentially reduce the therapeutic effect of EDURANT (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nDistribution\n\nRilpivirine is approximately 99.7% bound to plasma proteins in vitro, primarily to albumin. The \ndistribution of rilpivirine into compartments other than plasma (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, genital tract \nsecretions) has not been evaluated in humans.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nIn vitro experiments indicate that rilpivirine primarily undergoes oxidative metabolism mediated by \nthe cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A system.\n\nElimination\n\nThe terminal elimination half-life of rilpivirine is approximately 45 hours. After single dose oral \nadministration of 14C-rilpivirine, on average 85% and 6.1% of the radioactivity could be retrieved in \nfaeces and urine, respectively. In faeces, unchanged rilpivirine accounted for on average 25% of the \nadministered dose. Only trace amounts of unchanged rilpivirine (< 1% of dose) were detected in urine.\n\nAdditional information on special populations\n\nPaediatric population (less than 18 years of age)\nThe pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine in antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adolescent\nsubjects receiving EDURANT 25 mg once daily were comparable to those in treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1\ninfected adults receiving EDURANT 25 mg once daily. There was no impact of body weight on \nrilpivirine pharmacokinetics in paediatric subjects in trial TMC278-C213 (33 to 93 kg), similar to \nwhat was observed in adults.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine in paediatric patients less than 12 years of age are under \ninvestigation. Dosing recommendations for paediatric patients less than 12 years of age cannot be \nmade due to insufficient data (see section 4.2).\n\nOlder people\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV infected patients showed that rilpivirine pharmacokinetics \nare not different across the age range (18 to 78 years) evaluated, with only 3 subjects aged 65 years or \nolder. No dose adjustment of EDURANT is required in older patients. EDURANT should be used \nwith caution in this population (see section 4.2).\n\nGender\nNo clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine have been observed between \nmen and women.\n\n\n\n20\n\nRace\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of rilpivirine in HIV infected patients indicated that race had no \nclinically relevant effect on the exposure to rilpivirine.\n\nHepatic impairment\nRilpivirine is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. In a study comparing 8 patients with\nmild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score A) to 8 matched controls, and 8 patients with moderate \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score B) to 8 matched controls, the multiple dose exposure of \nrilpivirine was 47% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 5% higher in patients with \nmoderate hepatic impairment. However, it may not be excluded that the pharmacologically active, \nunbound, rilpivirine exposure is significantly increased in moderate hepatic impairment.\n\nNo dose adjustment is suggested but caution is advised in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. \nEDURANT has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score C).\nTherefore, EDURANT is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nHepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection had no \nclinically relevant effect on the exposure to rilpivirine.\n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency. Renal \nelimination of rilpivirine is negligible. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or \nmoderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, \nEDURANT should be used with caution, as plasma concentrations may be increased due to alteration \nof drug absorption, distribution and/or metabolism secondary to renal dysfunction. In patients with \nsevere renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, the combination of EDURANT with a strong \nCYP3A inhibitor should only be used if the benefit outweighs the risk. As rilpivirine is highly bound\nto plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal \ndialysis (see section 4.2).\n\nPregnancy and Postpartum\nThe exposure to total rilpivirine after intake of rilpivirine 25 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral \nregimen was lower during pregnancy (similar for the 2nd and 3rd trimester) compared with postpartum \n(see table 7). The decrease in unbound (ie, active) rilpivirine pharmacokinetic parameters during \npregnancy compared to postpartum was less pronounced than for total rilpivirine.\n\nIn women receiving rilpivirine 25 mg once daily during the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, mean intra-\nindividual values for total rilpivirine Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were, respectively, 21%, 29% and \n35% lower as compared to postpartum; during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin\nvalues were, respectively, 20%, 31% and 42% lower as compared to postpartum.\n\nTable 7: Pharmacokinetic Results of Total Rilpivirine After Administration of Rilpivirine 25 mg \nOnce Daily as Part of an Antiretroviral Regimen, During the 2nd Trimester of Pregnancy, the 3rd\n\nTrimester of Pregnancy and Postpartum\nPharmacokinetics of total \nrilpivirine\n(mean \u00b1 SD, tmax: median [range])\n\nPostpartum\n(6-12 Weeks)\n\n(n=11)\n\n2nd Trimester\nof pregnancy\n\n(n=15)\n\n3rd Trimester\nof pregnancy\n\n(n=13)\nCmin, ng/ml 84.0 \u00b1 58.8 54.3 \u00b1 25.8 52.9 \u00b1 24.4\nCmax, ng/ml 167 \u00b1 101 121 \u00b1 45.9 123 \u00b1 47.5\ntmax, h 4.00 (2.03-25.08) 4.00 (1.00-9.00) 4.00 (2.00-24.93)\nAUC24h, ng.h/ml 2714 \u00b1 1535 1792 \u00b1 711 1762 \u00b1 662\n\n\n\n21\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRepeated dose toxicity\n\nLiver toxicity associated with liver enzyme induction was observed in rodents. In dogs, \ncholestasis-like effects were noted.\n\nReproductive toxicology studies\n\nStudies in animals have shown no evidence of relevant embryonic or foetal toxicity or an effect on \nreproductive function. There was no teratogenicity with rilpivirine in rats and rabbits. The exposures at \nthe embryo-foetal No Observed Adverse Effects Levels (NOAELs) in rats and rabbits were \nrespectively 15 and 70 times higher than the exposure in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg \nonce daily.\n\nCarcinogenesis and mutagenesis\n\nRilpivirine was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats up \nto 104 weeks. At the lowest tested doses in the carcinogenicity studies, the systemic exposures (based \non AUC) to rilpivirine were 21-fold (mice) and 3-fold (rats), relative to those observed in humans at \nthe recommended dose (25 mg once daily). In rats, there were no drug-related neoplasms. In mice, \nrilpivirine was positive for hepatocellular neoplasms in both males and females. The observed \nhepatocellular findings in mice may be rodent-specific.\n\nRilpivirine has tested negative in the absence and presence of a metabolic activation system in the \nin vitro Ames reverse mutation assay and the in vitro clastogenicity mouse lymphoma assay. \nRilpivirine did not induce chromosomal damage in the in vivo micronucleus test in mice.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What EDURANT is and what it is used for\n2.

What EDURANT is and what it is used for\n\nEDURANT contains rilpivirine that is used for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus \n(HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of HIV medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors (NNRTIs). EDURANT works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body.\n\nEDURANT is used in combination with other HIV medicines to treat adolescents and adults \n12 years of age and older who are infected with HIV and who have never been treated before with \nHIV medicines.\n\nYour doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take EDURANT\n\nDo not take EDURANT if you are allergic to rilpivirine or any of the other ingredients of this \nmedicine (listed in section 6).\n\nDo not take EDURANT in combination with any of the following medicines as they may affect the \nway EDURANT or the other medicine works:\n- carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines to treat epilepsy and \n\nprevent seizures)\n- rifampicin, rifapentine (medicines to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis)\n- omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, (proton pump inhibitors \n\nthat are medicines to prevent and treat stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid reflux disease)\n- dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used in a variety of conditions such as inflammation and \n\nallergic reactions) when taken by mouth or injected, except as a single dose treatment\n- products that contain St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal product used for \n\ndepression).\n\nIf you are taking any of the above, ask your doctor about alternatives.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking EDURANT.\n\n\n\n33\n\nEDURANT is not a cure for HIV infection. It is part of a treatment reducing the amount of virus in the \nblood. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople.\n\nEDURANT has only been used in a limited number of patients of 65 years or older. If you belong to \nthis age group, please discuss the use of EDURANT with your doctor.\n\nTell your doctor about your situation\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.\n- Tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your liver, including \n\nhepatitis B and/or C, and/or problems with your kidneys. Your doctor may evaluate how \nsevere your liver or kidney disease is before deciding if you can take EDURANT.\n\n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infections (for example, fever, \nchills, sweats). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic\ninfection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after \nHIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the \nbody\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with \nno obvious symptoms.\n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines that may cause a life-threatening irregular \nheartbeat (Torsade de Pointes).\n\nChildren\nEDURANT is not for use in children less than 12 years of age, because it has not been sufficiently \nstudied in these patients.\n\nOther medicines and EDURANT\nYou must take EDURANT together with other HIV medicines. Your doctor will advise on which HIV \nmedicines can be combined with EDURANT and together you will decide which combination fits \nyour needs best. Follow your doctor\u2019s instruction carefully.\n\nSome medicines may affect the levels of EDURANT in the blood when they are taken at the same \ntime as EDURANT.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nIt is not recommended to combine EDURANT with other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors (NNRTIs) such as delavirdine, efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine.\n\nThe effects of EDURANT or other medicines might be influenced if you take EDURANT together \nwith any of the following medicines. Tell your doctor if you take:\n- rifabutin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections). If you take this medicine while taking \n\nEDURANT, please carefully read how to take EDURANT in section 3 \u201cInstructions for proper \nuse in adults and adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age)\u201d.\n\n- clarithromycin, erythromycin (antibiotics)\n- cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, ranitidine (H2-receptor antagonists used to treat stomach or \n\nintestinal ulcers or used to relieve heartburn due to acid reflux). If you take these medicines, \n\n\n\n34\n\nplease carefully read how to take them in section 3 \u201cInstructions for proper use in adults and \nadolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age)\u201d.\n\n- antacids (used to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach; for example, \naluminium / magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate). If you take these medicines, please \ncarefully read how to take them in section 3 \u201cInstructions for proper use in adults and \nadolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age)\u201d.\n\n- methadone (used to treat narcotic withdrawal and dependence)\n- dabigatran etexilate (anticoagulant).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant. Pregnant women \nshould discuss the use of EDURANT with their doctor.\nHIV infected mothers must not breastfeed, as there is a possibility of infecting the baby with HIV via \nbreast milk.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSome patients may experience tiredness, dizziness or drowsiness during treatment with EDURANT. \nDo not drive or operate machinery if you feel tired, dizzy or drowsy while taking EDURANT.\n\nEDURANT contains lactose\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine.\n\n3. How to take EDURANT\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nInstructions for proper use in adults and adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age)\nThe recommended dose of EDURANT is one tablet once a day.\nEDURANT must be taken with a meal. A meal is important to get the right levels of active \nsubstance in your body. A nutritional drink (e.g. protein-rich) alone does not replace a meal.\n\nThere are four situations that require special attention:\n1. If you take rifabutin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections), take two tablets of \n\nEDURANT once a day. When you stop taking rifabutin, take one tablet of EDURANT once a \nday. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\n2. If you take an antacid (a medicine to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach such as \naluminium / magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate). Take the antacid either at least 2 hours \nbefore or at least 4 hours after EDURANT (see section 2 \u201cOther medicines and EDURANT\u201d).\n\n3. If you take an H2-receptor antagonist (medicines used to treat stomach or intestinal ulcers or \nused to relieve heartburn due to acid reflux (such as cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine or \nranitidine). Take the H2-receptor antagonist at least 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after \nEDURANT (see section 2 \u201cOther medicines and EDURANT\u201d). H2-receptor antagonists should \nnot be taken in a twice a day regimen. Talk to your doctor about an alternative regimen.\n\n4. If you take didanosine (a medicine to treat HIV infection), no dose adjustment is required. \nDidanosine should be administered on an empty stomach at least two hours before or at least \nfour hours after EDURANT (which must be taken with a meal).\n\n\n\n35\n\nRemoving the child resistant cap\n\nThe bottle comes with a child resistant cap. It can be opened by pushing the screw \ncap down while turning it anti-clockwise.\n\nIf you take more EDURANT than you should\nContact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. In case of overdose, you may have a headache, \nnausea, dizziness, and/or abnormal dreams.\n\nIf you forget to take EDURANT\nIf you notice within 12 hours of the time you usually take EDURANT, you must take the tablet as \nsoon as possible. The EDURANT tablet must be taken with a meal. Then take the next dose as usual. \nIf you notice after 12 hours, then skip that dose and take the next doses as usual.\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you vomit less than 4 hours after taking EDURANT, take another tablet with a meal. If you vomit \nmore than 4 hours after taking EDURANT you do not need to take another tablet until your next \nregularly scheduled tablet.\n\nContact your doctor if uncertain about what to do if you miss a dose or vomit.\n\nDo not stop using EDURANT\nHIV treatment does not cure HIV infection! Do not stop using EDURANT without talking to your \ndoctor first. Even if you feel better, do not stop taking EDURANT or your other HIV medicines. \nDoing so could increase the risk of the virus developing resistance. Talk to your doctor first.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nVery common:\n- headache\n- nausea\n- difficulty falling asleep (insomnia)\n- dizziness\n- changes in one of your routine liver tests (transaminase)\n- increase in cholesterol and/or pancreatic amylase in your blood\n\nCommon:\n- abnormal dreams\n- rash\n- stomach pain\n- depression\n- tiredness\n- vomiting\n- drowsiness\n- decreased appetite\n- sleep disorders\n- stomach discomfort\n- depressed mood\n- dry mouth\n\n\n\n36\n\n- low white blood cell and/or platelet count, decrease in haemoglobin in your blood, increase in \ntriglycerides, lipase and/or bilirubin in your blood\n\nUncommon:\n- signs or symptoms of inflammation or infection, for example fever, chills, sweats (immune \n\nreactivation syndrome)\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

attention: 1. if you take rifabutin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections), take two tablets of edurant once a day. when you stop taking rifabutin, take one tablet of edurant once a day. talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. 2. if you take an antacid (a medicine to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach such as aluminium / magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate). take the antacid either at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after edurant (see section 2 \"other medicines and edurant\"). 3. if you take an h2-receptor antagonist (medicines used to treat stomach or intestinal ulcers or used to relieve heartburn due to acid reflux (such as cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine or ranitidine). take the h2-receptor antagonist at least 12 hours
