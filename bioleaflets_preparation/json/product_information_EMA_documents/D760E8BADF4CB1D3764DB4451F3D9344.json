NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nHBVAXPRO 5 micrograms, suspension for injection\nHepatitis B vaccine (recombinant DNA)\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nOne dose (0.5 ml) contains:\nHepatitis B virus surface antigen, recombinant (HBsAg) * ................... 5 micrograms\nAdsorbed on amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate (0.25 milligram Al+)\n\n* produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain 2150-2-3) yeast by recombinant DNA technology.\n\nThis vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate, which are used during the \nmanufacturing process. See sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8.\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect:\nSodium less than 1 mmol (23 mg) per dose.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSuspension for injection\nSlightly opaque white suspension.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nHBVAXPRO is indicated for active immunisation against hepatitis B virus infection caused by all known \nsubtypes in individuals from birth through 15 years of age considered at risk of exposure to hepatitis B \nvirus.\n\nThe specific at risk categories to be immunised are to be determined on the basis of the official \nrecommendations.\n\nIt can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immunisation with HBVAXPRO as \nhepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nIndividuals from birth through 15 years of age: 1 dose (0.5 ml) at each injection:\n\nPrimary vaccination:\n\nA course of vaccination should include at least three injections.\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nTwo primary immunisation schedules can be recommended:\n\n0, 1, 6 months: two injections with an interval of one month; a third injection 6 months after the first \nadministration.\n\n0, 1, 2, 12 months: three injections with an interval of one month; a fourth dose should be administered at \n12 months.\n\nIt is recommended that the vaccine be administered in the schedules indicated. Infants receiving the \ncompressed regimen (0, 1, 2 months dosing schedule) must receive the 12 month booster to induce higher \nantibody titres.\n\nBooster:\n\nImmunocompetent vaccinees\n\nThe need for a booster dose in healthy individuals who have received a full primary vaccination course \nhas not been established. However, some local vaccination schedules currently include a recommendation \nfor a booster dose and these should be respected.\n\nImmunocompromised vaccinees (e.g. dialysis patients, transplant patients, AIDS Patients)\n\nIn vaccinees with an impaired immune system, administration of additional doses of vaccine should be \nconsidered if the antibody level against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) is less than 10 IU/l.\n\nRevaccination of nonresponders\n\nWhen persons who do not respond to the primary vaccine series are revaccinated, 15-25 % produce an \nadequate antibody response after one additional dose and 30-50 % after three additional doses. However, \nbecause data are insufficient concerning the safety of hepatitis B vaccine when additional doses in excess \nof the recommended series are administered, revaccination following completion of the primary series is \nnot routinely recommended. Revaccination should be considered for high-risk individuals, after weighing \nthe benefits of vaccination against the potential risk of experiencing increased local or systemic adverse \nreactions.\n\nSpecial dosage recommendations:\n\nDosage recommendation for neonates of mothers who are hepatitis B virus carriers\n\n- At birth, one dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (within 24 hours).\n- The first dose of the vaccine should be given within 7 days of birth and can be administered \n\nsimultaneously with hepatitis B immunoglobulin but at a separate injection site.\n- Subsequent doses of vaccine should be given according to the locally recommended vaccination \n\nschedule.\n\nDosage recommendation for known or presumed exposure to hepatitis B virus (e.g. needlestick with \ncontaminated needle)\n\n- Hepatitis B immunoglobulin should be given as soon as possible after exposure (within 24 hours).\n- The first dose of the vaccine should be given within 7 days of exposure and can be administered \n\nsimultaneously with hepatitis B immunoglobulin but at a separate injection site.\n- Serologic testing is also recommended, with the administration of subsequent doses of vaccine, if \n\nnecessary, (i.e. according to the serologic status of the patient) for short and long term protection.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\n- In the case of unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals, additional doses should be \ngiven as in the recommended immunisation schedule. The accelerated schedule including the \n12 month booster dose can be proposed.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThis vaccine should be administered intramuscularly.\n\nThe anterolateral thigh is the preferred site for injection in neonates and infants. The deltoid muscle is the \npreferred site for injection in children and adolescents.\n\nDo not inject intravascularly.\n\nExceptionally, the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopaenia or \nbleeding disorders.\n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the product: see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- History of hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients, or trace residuals \n(e.g. formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate), see sections 6.1 and 2.\n\n- Vaccination should be postponed in individuals with a severe febrile illness or acute infection.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case \nof rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine (see section 4.8).\n\nThis vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate, which are used during the \nmanufacturing process. Therefore, hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see sections 2 and 4.8).\n\nUse caution when vaccinating latex-sensitive individuals since the vial stopper contains dry natural latex \nrubber that may cause allergic reactions.\n\nFor clinical or laboratory monitoring regarding immunocompromised individuals or individuals with \nknown or presumed exposure to hepatitis B virus, see section 4.2\n\nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48 to 72 hours should be \nconsidered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born \n≤ 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity (see \nsection 4.8). As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be \nwithheld or delayed.\n\nBecause of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognised hepatitis B infection to \nbe present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in such cases. \n\nThe vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis \nE and other pathogens known to infect the liver. \n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant or breast-feeding women. (see section 4.6).\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect:\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and is considered to be \nessentially sodium free.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThis vaccine can be administered:\n- with hepatitis B immunoglobulin, at a separate injection site.\n- to complete a primary immunisation course or as a booster dose in subjects who have previously \n\nreceived another hepatitis B vaccine.\n- concomitantly with other vaccines, using separate sites and syringes.\n\nThe concomitant administration of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PREVENAR) given with hepatitis B\nvaccine using the 0, 1 and 6 and 0, 1, 2 and 12 month schedules has not been sufficiently studied.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nFertility:\nHBVAXPRO has not been evaluated in fertility studies.\n\nPregnancy:\nThere is no clinical data on the use of HBVAXPRO on pregnant women.\n\nThe vaccine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the \nfoetus.\n\nBreast-feeding:\nThere is no clinical data on the use of HBVAXPRO on breast-feeding women.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However,\nHBVAXPRO is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\na. Summary of the safety profile\n\nThe most common side effects seen are injection-site reactions: transient soreness, erythema, induration.\n\nb. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nThe following undesirable effects have been reported following the widespread use of the vaccine.\n\nAs with other hepatitis B vaccines, in many instances, the causal relationship to the vaccine has not been \nestablished.\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nAdverse reactions Frequency\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\n\nLocal reactions (injection site): Transient soreness, Erythema, Induration\nCommon \n\n(≥1/100 to, <1/10)\nFatigue, Fever, Malaise, Influenza-like symptoms Very rare (<1/10,000)\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders\nThrombocytopaenia, Lymphadenopathy Very rare (<1/10,000)\nImmune system disorders\nSerum sickness, Anaphylaxis, Polyarteritis nodosa Very rare (<1/10,000)\nNervous system disorders\nParesthesia, Paralysis (including Bell's palsy, facial paralysis), Peripheral \nneuropathies (polyradiculoneuritis, Guillain Barre Syndrome), Neuritis \n(including optical neuritis), Myelitis (including transverse Myelitis), \nEncephalitis, Demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, Exacerbation \nof multiple sclerosis, Multiple sclerosis, Seizure, Headache, Dizziness, Syncope\n\nVery rare (<1/10,000)\n\nEye Disorders\nUveitis Very rare (<1/10,000)\nVascular disorders\nHypotension, Vasculitis Very rare (<1/10,000)\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nBronchospasm-like symptoms Very rare (<1/10,000)\nGastrointestinal disorders\nVomiting, Nausea, Diarrhoea, Abdominal pain Very rare (<1/10,000)\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nRash, Alopecia, Pruritus, Urticaria, Erythema multiforme, Angioedema, Eczema Very rare (<1/10,000)\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders\nArthralgia, Arthritis, Myalgia, Pain in extremity Very rare (<1/10,000)\nInvestigations\nElevation of liver enzymes Very rare (<1/10,000)\n\nc. Other special population\n\nApnoea in very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere have been reports of administration of higher than recommended doses of HBVAXPRO.\nIn general, the adverse event profile reported with overdose was comparable to that observed with the \nrecommended dose of HBVAXPRO.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: anti-infectious, ATC code: J07BC01\n\nThe vaccine induces specific humoral antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg). \nDevelopment of an antibody titre against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) equal to or \ngreater than 10 IU/l measured 1 to 2 months after the last injection correlates with protection to hepatitis B \nvirus infection.\n\nIn clinical trials, 96 % of 1,497 healthy infants, children, adolescents and adults given a 3 dose course of a \nprevious formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine developed a protective level of \nantibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( 10 IU/l). In two infant trials using different dosing \nschedules and concomitant vaccines, the proportion of infants with protective levels of antibodies were \n97.5 % and 97.2 % with geometric mean titres of 214 and 297 IU/l, respectively.\n\nThe protective efficacy of a dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin at birth followed by 3 doses of a previous \nformulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine has been demonstrated for neonates born to \nmothers positive for both hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B virus e antigen \n(HBeAg). Among 130 vaccinated infants, the estimated efficacy in prevention of chronic hepatitis B \ninfection was 95 % as compared to the infection rate in untreated historical controls.\n\nAlthough the duration of the protective effect of a previous formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis \nB vaccine in healthy vaccinees is unknown, follow-up over 5-9 years of approximately 3,000 high-risk\nsubjects given a similar plasma-derived vaccine has revealed no cases of clinically apparent hepatitis B \ninfection.\n\nIn addition, persistence of vaccine-induced immunologic memory for hepatitis B virus surface antigen \n(HBsAg) has been demonstrated through an anamnestic antibody response to a booster dose of a previous \nformulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. As with other hepatitis B vaccines, the duration \nof the protective effect in healthy vaccinees is unknown at present. The need for a booster dose of \nHBVAXPRO is not yet defined beyond the 12 month booster dose required for the 0, 1, 2 compressed \nschedule.\n\nReduced risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma\nHepatocellular carcinoma is a serious complication of hepatitis B virus infection. Studies have\ndemonstrated the link between chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma and 80 % of \nhepatocellular carcinomas are caused by hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B vaccine has been \nrecognized as the first anti-cancer vaccine because it can prevent primary liver cancer.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted.\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS\n\n6.1 List of excipients\n\nSodium chloride\nBorax\nWater for injections\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities\n\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts.\n\n6.3 Shelf life\n\n3 years.\n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage\n\nStore in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C).\nDo not freeze. Store in the original package in order to protect from light.\n\nHBVAXPRO should be administered as soon as possible after being removed from refrigeration. \nHBVAXPRO can be administered provided total (cumulative multiple excursion) time out of refrigeration \n(at temperatures between 8°C and 25°C) does not exceed 72 hours. Cumulative multiple excursions \nbetween 0°C and 2°C are also permitted as long as the total time between 0°C and 2°C does not exceed \n72 hours. These are not, however, recommendations for storage.\n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container\n\n0.5 ml of suspension in vial (glass) with stopper (gray butyl rubber) and aluminum seals with plastic flip \ncaps. Pack size of 1, 10.\n0.5 ml of suspension in vial (glass) with stopper (gray butyl rubber) and aluminum seals with plastic flip \ncaps with an empty sterile injection syringe with needle.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nHBVAXPRO 5 micrograms, suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe\nHepatitis B vaccine (recombinant DNA)\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nOne dose (0.5 ml) contains:\nHepatitis B virus surface antigen, recombinant (HBsAg) * ................... 5 micrograms\nAdsorbed on amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate (0.25 milligram Al+)\n\n* produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain 2150-2-3) yeast by recombinant DNA technology.\n\nThis vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate, which are used during the \nmanufacturing process. See sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8.\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect:\nSodium less than 1mmol (23 mg) per dose.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSuspension for injection in pre-filled syringe\nSlightly opaque white suspension.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nHBVAXPRO is indicated for active immunisation against hepatitis B virus infection caused by all known \nsubtypes in individuals from birth through 15 years of age considered at risk of exposure to hepatitis B \nvirus.\n\nThe specific at risk categories to be immunised are to be determined on the basis of the official \nrecommendations.\n\nIt can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immunisation with HBVAXPRO as \nhepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nIndividuals from birth through 15 years of age: 1 dose (0.5 ml) at each injection.\n\nPrimary vaccination:\n\nA course of vaccination should include at least three injections.\n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\nTwo primary immunisation schedules can be recommended:\n\n0, 1, 6 months: two injections with an interval of one month; a third injection 6 months after the first \nadministration.\n\n0, 1, 2, 12 months: three injections with an interval of one month; a fourth dose should be administered at \n12 months.\n\nIt is recommended that the vaccine be administered in the schedules indicated. Infants receiving the \ncompressed regimen (0, 1, 2 months dosing schedule) must receive the 12 month booster to induce higher \nantibody titres.\n\nBooster: \n\nImmunocompetent vaccinees\n\nThe need for a booster dose in healthy individuals who have received a full primary vaccination course \nhas not been established. However, some local vaccination schedules currently include a recommendation \nfor a booster dose and these should be respected.\n\nImmunocompromised vaccinees (e.g. dialysis patients, transplant patients, AIDS Patients)\n\nIn vaccinees with an impaired immune system, administration of additional doses of vaccine should be \nconsidered if the antibody level against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) is less than 10 IU/l.\n\nRevaccination of nonresponders\n\nWhen persons who do not respond to the primary vaccine series are revaccinated, 15-25 % produce an \nadequate antibody response after one additional dose and 30-50 % after three additional doses. However, \nbecause data are insufficient concerning the safety of hepatitis B vaccine when additional doses in excess \nof the recommended series are administered, revaccination following completion of the primary series is \nnot routinely recommended. Revaccination should be considered for high-risk individuals, after weighing \nthe benefits of vaccination against the potential risk of experiencing increased local or systemic adverse \nreactions.\n\nSpecial dosage recommendations:\n\nDosage recommendations for neonates born to mothers who are hepatitis B virus carriers\n\n- At birth, one dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (within 24 hours).\n- The first dose of the vaccine should be given within 7 days of birth and can be administered \n\nsimultaneously with hepatitis B immunoglobulin at birth, but at a separate injection site.\n- Subsequent doses of vaccine should be given according to the locally recommended vaccination \n\nschedule.\n\nDosage recommendation for known or presumed exposure to hepatitis B virus (e.g. needlestick with \ncontaminated needle)\n\n- Hepatitis B immunoglobulin should be given as soon as possible after exposure (within 24 hours).\n- The first dose of the vaccine should be given within 7 days of exposure and can be administered \n\nsimultaneously with hepatitis B immunoglobulin but at a separate injection site.\n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\n- Serologic testing is also recommended, with the administration of subsequent doses of vaccine, if \nnecessary, (i.e. according to the serologic status of the patient) for short and long term protection.\n\n- In the case of unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals, additional doses should be \ngiven as in the recommended immunisation schedule. The accelerated schedule including the \n12 month booster dose can be proposed.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThis vaccine should be administered intramuscularly.\n\nThe anterolateral thigh is the preferred site for injection in neonates and infants. The deltoid muscle is the \npreferred site for injection in children and adolescents.\n\nDo not inject intravascularly.\n\nExceptionally, the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopaenia or \nbleeding disorders.\n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the product: see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- History of hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients, or trace residuals \n(e.g. formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate), see sections 6.1 and 2.\n\n- Vaccination should be postponed in individuals with a severe febrile illness or acute infection.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case \nof rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine (see section 4.8).\n\nThis vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate which are used during the \nmanufacturing process. Therefore, hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see sections 2 and 4.8).\n\nUse caution when vaccinating latex-sensitive individuals since the syringe plunger stopper and tip cap \ncontain dry natural latex rubber that may cause allergic reactions.\n\nFor clinical or laboratory monitoring regarding immunocompromised individuals or individuals with \nknown or presumed exposure to hepatitis B virus, see section 4.2.\n\nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48 to 72 hours should be \nconsidered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born \n≤ 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity (see \nsection 4.8). As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be \nwithheld or delayed.\n\nBecause of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognised hepatitis B infection to \nbe present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in such cases. \n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\nThe vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis \nE and other pathogens known to infect the liver. \n\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant or breast-feeding women. (see section 4.6).\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect:\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and is considered to be \nessentially sodium free.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThis vaccine can be administered:\n- with hepatitis B immunoglobulin, at a separate injection site.\n- to complete a primary immunisation course or as a booster dose in subjects who have previously \n\nreceived another hepatitis B vaccine.\n- concomitantly with other vaccines, using separate sites and syringes.\n\nThe concomitant administration of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PREVENAR) given with hepatitis B \nvaccine using the 0, 1 and 6 and 0, 1, 2 and 12 month schedules has not been sufficiently studied.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nFertility:\nHBVAXPRO has not been evaluated in fertility studies.\n\nPregnancy:\nThere is no clinical data on the use of HBVAXPRO on pregnant women.\nThe vaccine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the \nfoetus.\n\nBreast-feeding:\nThere is no clinical data on the use of HBVAXPRO on breast-feeding women.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However,\nHBVAXPRO is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\na. Summary of the safety profile\n\nThe most common side effects seen are injection-site reactions: transient soreness, erythema, induration.\n\nb. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nThe following undesirable effects have been reported following the widespread use of the vaccine.\n\nAs with other hepatitis B vaccines, in many instances, the causal relationship to the vaccine has not been \nestablished.\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nAdverse reactions Frequency\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\n\nLocal reactions (injection site): Transient soreness, Erythema, Induration\nCommon \n\n(≥1/100 to, <1/10)\nFatigue, Fever, Malaise, Influenza-like symptoms Very rare (<1/10,000)\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders\nThrombocytopaenia, Lymphadenopathy Very rare (<1/10,000)\nImmune system disorders\nSerum sickness, Anaphylaxis, Polyarteritis nodosa Very rare (<1/10,000)\nNervous system disorders\nParesthesia, Paralysis (including Bell's palsy, facial paralysis), Peripheral \nneuropathies (polyradiculoneuritis, Guillain Barre Syndrome), Neuritis \n(including optical neuritis), Myelitis (including transverse Myelitis), \nEncephalitis, Demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, \nExacerbation of multiple sclerosis, Multiple sclerosis, Seizure, Headache, \nDizziness, Syncope\n\nVery rare (<1/10,000)\n\nEye disorders\nUveitis Very rare (<1/10,000)\nVascular disorders\nHypotension, Vasculitis Very rare (<1/10,000)\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nBronchospasm-like symptoms Very rare (<1/10,000)\nGastrointestinal disorders\nVomiting, Nausea, Diarrhoea, Abdominal pain Very rare (<1/10,000)\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nRash, Alopecia, Pruritus, Urticaria, Erythema multiforme, Angioedema, \nEczema\n\nVery rare (<1/10,000)\n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders\nArthralgia, Arthritis, Myalgia, Pain in extremity Very rare (<1/10,000)\nInvestigations\nElevation of liver enzymes Very rare (<1/10,000)\n\nc. Other special population\n\nApnoea in very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere have been reports of administration of higher than recommended doses of HBVAXPRO. \nIn general, the adverse event profile reported with overdose was comparable to that observed with the \nrecommended dose of HBVAXPRO.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: anti-infectious, ATC code: J07BC01\n\nThe vaccine induces specific humoral antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg). \nDevelopment of an antibody titre against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) equal to or \ngreater than 10 IU/l measured 1 to 2 months after the last injection correlates with protection to hepatitis B \nvirus infection.\n\nIn clinical trials, 96 % of 1,497 healthy infants, children, adolescents and adults given a 3 dose course of a \nprevious formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine developed a protective level of \nantibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( 10 IU/l). In two infant trials using different dosing \nschedules and concomitant vaccines, the proportion of infants with protective levels of antibodies were \n97.5 % and 97.2 % with geometric mean titres of 214 and 297 IU/l, respectively.\n\nThe protective efficacy of a dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin at birth followed by 3 doses of a previous \nformulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine has been demonstrated for neonates born to \nmothers positive for both hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B virus e antigen \n(HBeAg). Among 130 vaccinated infants, the estimated efficacy in prevention of chronic hepatitis B \ninfection was 95 % as compared to the infection rate in untreated historical controls.\n\nAlthough the duration of the protective effect of a previous formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis \nB vaccine in healthy vaccinees is unknown, follow-up over 5-9 years of approximately 3,000 high-risk \nsubjects given a similar plasma-derived vaccine has revealed no cases of clinically apparent hepatitis B \ninfection.\n\nIn addition, persistence of vaccine-induced immunologic memory for hepatitis B virus surface antigen \n(HBsAg) has been demonstrated through an anamnestic antibody response to a booster dose of a previous \nformulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. As with other hepatitis B vaccines, the duration \nof the protective effect in healthy vaccinees is unknown at present. The need for a booster dose of \nHBVAXPRO is not yet defined beyond the 12 month booster dose required for the 0, 1, 2 compressed \nschedule.\n\nReduced risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma\nHepatocellular carcinoma is a serious complication of hepatitis B virus infection. Studies have\ndemonstrated the link between chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma and 80 % of \nhepatocellular carcinomas are caused by hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B vaccine has been \nrecognized as the first anti-cancer vaccine because it can prevent primary liver cancer.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted.\n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\n6.

These \nfactors include older age, male gender, obesity, smoking, route of administration and some chronic \nunderlying diseases. Consideration should be given to serological testing of those subjects who may be at \nrisk of not achieving seroprotection following a complete course of HBVAXPRO.

In two trials conducted in older \nadolescents and adults, 95.6-97.5 % of vaccinees developed a protective level of antibodies, with \ngeometric mean titres in these trials ranging from 535 – 793 IU/l.\n\nAlthough the duration of the protective effect of a previous formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis \nB vaccine in healthy vaccinees is unknown, follow-up over 5-9 years of approximately 3,000 high-risk \nsubjects given a similar plasma-derived vaccine has revealed no cases of clinically apparent hepatitis B \ninfection.\n\nIn addition, persistence of vaccine-induced immunologic memory for hepatitis B virus surface antigen \n(HBsAg) has been demonstrated through an anamnestic antibody response to a booster dose of a previous \nformulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine in healthy adults. As with other hepatitis B \nvaccines, the duration of the protective effect in healthy vaccinees is unknown at present. The need for a \nbooster dose of HBVAXPRO is not yet defined beyond the 12 month booster dose required for the 0, 1, \n2 compressed schedule.\n\nReduced risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma\nHepatocellular carcinoma is a serious complication of hepatitis B virus infection.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nOne dose (1 ml) contains:\nHepatitis B virus surface antigen, recombinant (HBsAg) * ................... 10 micrograms\nAdsorbed on amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate (0.50 milligram Al+)\n\n* produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain 2150-2-3) yeast by recombinant DNA technology.\n\nThis vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate which are used during the \nmanufacturing process. See sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8.\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect:\nSodium less than 1mmol (23 mg) per dose.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSuspension for injection in pre-filled syringe\nSlightly opaque white suspension.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nHBVAXPRO is indicated for active immunisation against hepatitis B virus infection caused by all known \nsubtypes in individuals 16 years of age or more considered at risk of exposure to hepatitis B virus.\n\nThe specific at risk categories to be immunised are to be determined on the basis of the official\nrecommendations.\n\nIt can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immunisation with HBVAXPRO as \nhepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nIndividuals 16 years of age or more: 1 dose (1 ml) at each injection.\n\nPrimary vaccination:\n\nA course of vaccination should include at least three injections.\n\nTwo primary immunisation schedules can be recommended:\n\n \n\n\n\n27\n\n0, 1, 6 months: two injections with an interval of one month; a third injection 6 months after the first \nadministration. \n0, 1, 2, 12 months: three injections with an interval of one month; a fourth dose should be administered at \n12 months.\n\nIt is recommended that the vaccine be administered in the schedules indicated. Those receiving the \ncompressed regimen (0, 1, 2 months dosing schedule) must receive the 12 month booster to induce higher \nantibody titres.\n\nBooster:\n\nImmunocompetent vaccinees\n\nThe need for a booster dose in healthy individuals who have received a full primary vaccination course \nhas not been established. However, some local vaccination schedules currently include a recommendation \nfor a booster dose and these should be respected.\n\nImmunocompromised vaccinees (e.g. dialysis patients, transplant patients, AIDS Patients)\n\nIn vaccinees with an impaired immune system, administration of additional doses of vaccine should be \nconsidered if the antibody level against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) is less than 10 IU/l.\n\nRevaccination of nonresponders\n\nWhen persons who do not respond to the primary vaccine series are revaccinated, 15-25 % produce an \nadequate antibody response after one additional dose and 30-50 % after three additional doses. However, \nbecause data are insufficient concerning the safety of hepatitis B vaccine when additional doses in excess \nof the recommended series are administered, revaccination following completion of the primary series is \nnot routinely recommended. Revaccination should be considered for high-risk individuals, after weighing \nthe benefits of vaccination against the potential risk of experiencing increased local or systemic adverse \nreactions.\n\nSpecial dosage recommendations for known or presumed exposure to hepatitis B virus (e.g. needlestick \nwith contaminated needle):\n\n- Hepatitis B immunoglobulin should be given as soon as possible after exposure (within 24 hours).\n- The first dose of the vaccine should be given within 7 days of exposure and can be administered \n\nsimultaneously with hepatitis B immunoglobulin but at a separate injection site.\n- Serologic testing is also recommended, with the administration of subsequent doses of vaccine, if \n\nnecessary, (i.e. according to the serologic status of the patient) for short and long term protection.\n- In the case of unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinates individuals, additional doses should be given \n\nas in the recommended immunisation schedules. The accelerated schedule including the 12 month \nbooster dose can be proposed.\n\nIndividuals less than 16 years of age:\n\nHBVAXPRO 10 micrograms is not indicated in this subset of paediatric population. \n\nThe appropriate strength for administration to individuals from birth through 15 years of age is \nHBVAXPRO 5 micrograms.\n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThis vaccine should be administered intramuscularly.\n\nThe deltoid muscle is the preferred site for injection in adults and adolescents.\n\nDo not inject intravascularly.\n\nExceptionally, the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopaenia or \nbleeding disorders.\n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the product: see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- History of hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients, or trace residuals \n(e.g. formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate), see sections 6.1 and 2.\n\n- Vaccination should be postponed in individuals with a severe febrile illness or acute infection.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case \nof rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine (see section 4.8).\n\nThis vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate which are used during the \nmanufacturing process. Therefore, hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see sections 2 and 4.8).\n\nUse caution when vaccinating latex-sensitive individuals since the syringe plunger stopper and tip cap\ncontain dry natural latex rubber that may cause allergic reactions.\n\nFor clinical or laboratory monitoring regarding immunocompromised individuals or individuals with \nknown or presumed exposure to hepatitis B virus, see section 4.2.\n\nA number of factors have been observed to reduce the immune response to hepatitis B vaccines. These \nfactors include older age, male gender, obesity, smoking, route of administration and some chronic \nunderlying diseases. Consideration should be given to serological testing of those subjects who may be at \nrisk of not achieving seroprotection following a complete course of HBVAXPRO. Additional doses may \nneed to be considered for persons who do not respond or have a sub-optimal response to a course of \nvaccinations.\n\nBecause of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognised hepatitis B infection to \nbe present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in such cases.\n\nThe vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis \nE and other pathogens known to infect the liver. \n\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant or breast-feeding women. (see section 4.6).\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect:\n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and is considered to be \nessentially sodium free.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThis vaccine can be administered:\n- with hepatitis B immunoglobulin, at a separate injection site.\n- to complete a primary immunisation course or as a booster dose in subjects who have previously \n\nreceived another hepatitis B vaccine.\n- concomitantly with other vaccines, using separate sites and syringes.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nFertility:\nHBVAXPRO has not been evaluated in fertility studies.\n\nPregnancy:\nThere is no clinical data on the use of HBVAXPRO on pregnant women.\nThe vaccine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the \nfoetus.\n\nBreast-feeding:\nThere is no clinical data on the use of HBVAXPRO on breast-feeding women.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \nHBVAXPRO is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\na. Summary of the safety profile\n\nThe most common side effects seen are injection-site reactions: transient soreness, erythema, induration.\n\nb.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: anti-infectious, ATC code: J07BC01\n\nThe vaccine induces specific humoral antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg). \nDevelopment of an antibody titre against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) equal to or \ngreater than 10 IU/l measured 1 to 2 months after the last injection correlates with protection to hepatitis B \nvirus infection.\n\nIn clinical trials, 96 % of 1,497 healthy infants, children, adolescents and adults given a 3 dose course of a \nprevious formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine developed a protective level of \nantibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( 10 IU/l).\n\nAlthough the duration of the protective effect of a previous formulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis \nB vaccine in healthy vaccinees is unknown, follow-up over 5-9 years of approximately 3,000 high-risk \nsubjects given a similar plasma-derived vaccine has revealed no cases of clinically apparent hepatitis B \ninfection.\n\nIn addition, persistence of vaccine-induced immunologic memory for hepatitis B virus surface antigen \n(HBsAg) has been demonstrated through an anamnestic antibody response to a booster dose of a previous \nformulation of Merck’s recombinant hepatitis B vaccine in healthy adults.\n\nIn accordance with standard medical practice for hepatitis B vaccine administration, regular antibody \ntesting should be done in hemodialysis patients. A booster dose should be given when antibody levels \ndecline below 10 IU/l. In subjects in whom insufficient antibody titres are achieved after boosting, the use \nof alternative hepatitis B vaccines should be considered.\n\nReduced risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma\nHepatocellular carcinoma is a serious complication of hepatitis B virus infection. Studies have \ndemonstrated the link between chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma and 80 % of \nhepatocellular carcinomas are caused by hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B vaccine has been \nrecognized as the first anti-cancer vaccine because it can prevent primary liver cancer.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted.\n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS\n\n6.1 List of excipients\n\nSodium chloride\nBorax\nWater for injections.\n\n \n\n\n\n39\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities\n\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts.\n\n6.3 Shelf life\n\n3 years.\n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage\n\nStore in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C).\nDo not freeze. Store in the original package in order to protect from light.\n\nHBVAXPRO should be administered as soon as possible after being removed from refrigeration. \nHBVAXPRO can be administered provided total (cumulative multiple excursion) time out of refrigeration \n(at temperatures between 8°C and 25°C) does not exceed 72 hours. Cumulative multiple excursions \nbetween 0°C and 2°C are also permitted as long as the total time between 0°C and 2°C does not exceed 72 \nhours. These are not, however, recommendations for storage.\n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container\n\n1 ml of suspension in vial (glass) with stopper (gray butyl rubber) and aluminum seals with plastic flip \ncaps. Pack size of 1.\n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling\n\nThe vaccine should be inspected visually in order to detect any appearance of precipitate or discolouring \nof the content prior to administration. If these conditions exist, the product should not be administered.\nBefore use, the vial should be well shaken.\nOnce the vial has been penetrated, the withdrawn vaccine should be used promptly, and the vial must be \ndiscarded.\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.\n\n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n \n\n\n\n65\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nHBVAXPRO 5 micrograms, suspension for injection\nHepatitis B vaccine (recombinant DNA)\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you or your child is vaccinated because it contains important \ninformation.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- If you or your child get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you or your child receive HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms\n3. How HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms is given\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms is and what it is used for\n\nThis vaccine is indicated for active immunisation against hepatitis B virus infection caused by all known \nsubtypes in individuals from birth through 15 years of age considered at risk of exposure to hepatitis B \nvirus.\n\nIt can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immunisation with HBVAXPRO as hepatitis \nD does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection.\n\nThe vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis \nE and other pathogens known to infect the liver. \n\n2. What you need to know before you or your child receive HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms\n\nDo not use HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms\n- if you or your child is allergic to hepatitis B surface antigen or to any of the other ingredients of \n\nHBVAXPRO (see section 6.)\n- if you or your child has a severe illness with fever\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nThe container of this vaccine contains latex rubber. Latex rubber may cause severe allergic reactions.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you or your child receives HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms.\n\nOthers vaccines and HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms\nHBVAXPRO can be administered at the same time as with hepatitis B immunoglobulin, at a separate \ninjection site.\nHBVAXPRO can be used to complete a primary immunisation course or as a booster dose in subjects who \nhave previously received another hepatitis B vaccine.\n\n \n\n\n\n66\n\nHBVAXPRO may be administered at the same time as with some other vaccines, using separate sites and \nsyringes.\n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you or your child is taking, or has recently taken, any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing the vaccine to pregnant or breast-feeding women.\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines \nHBVAXPRO is expected to have no, or negligible, influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nHBVAXPRO 5 micrograms contains sodium: This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol \nsodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium- free’.\n\n3. How HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms is given\n\nDosage\n\nThe recommended dose for each injection (0.5 ml) is 5 micrograms for individuals from birth through\n15 years of age.\n\nA course of vaccination should include at least three injections.\n\nTwo immunisation schedules can be recommended:\n- two injections with an interval of one month followed by a third injection 6 months after the first \n\nadministration (0, 1, 6 months).\n- if immunity is needed quickly: three injections with an interval of one month and a fourth dose 1 \n\nyear later (0, 1, 2, 12 months).\n\nIn case of a recent exposure to the hepatitis B virus, a first dose of HBVAXPRO together with the \nappropriate dose of immunoglobulin can be given.\n\nSome local vaccination schedules currently include recommendations for a booster dose. Your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse will inform you if a booster dose should be given.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe vial should be well shaken until a slightly opaque white suspension is obtained.\nOnce the vial has been penetrated, the withdrawn vaccine should be used promptly, and the vial must be \ndiscarded.\nThe doctor or nurse will give the vaccine as an injection into muscle.
