NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan 2.5 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach tablet contains 2.5 mg tadalafil. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect: \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 29.74 mg of lactose. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n\n \n\nA light yellow, film-coated, round, biconvex tablet (5.1 ± 0.3 mm) debossed with ‘M’ on one side of the \n\ntablet and ‘TL over 1’ on the other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males. \n\n \n\nIn order for tadalafil to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan is not indicated for use by women. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdult men \n\nIn general, the recommended dose is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or without \n\nfood. \n\nIn those patients in whom tadalafil 10 mg does not produce an adequate effect, 20 mg might be tried. \n\nIt may be taken at least 30 minutes prior to sexual activity. \n\n \n\nThe maximum dose frequency is once per day. \n\n \n\nTadalafil 10 and 20 mg is intended for use prior to anticipated sexual activity and it is not recommended for \n\ncontinuous daily use. \n\n \n\nIn patients who anticipate a frequent use of tadalafil (i.e., at least twice weekly) a once daily regimen with \n\nthe lowest doses of tadalafil might be considered suitable, based on patient choice and the physician’s \n\njudgement. \n\n \n\nIn these patients the recommended dose is 5 mg taken once a day at approximately the same time of day. The \n\ndose may be decreased to 2.5 mg once a day based on individual tolerability. \n\n \n\nThe appropriateness of continued use of the daily regimen should be reassessed periodically. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly men \n\nDose adjustments are not required in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nMen with renal impairment \n\nDose adjustments are not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. For patients with \n\nsevere renal impairment 10 mg is the maximum recommended dose. Once-a-day dosing of tadalafil is not \n\nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nMen with hepatic impairment \n\nThe recommended dose of tadalafil is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or without \n\nfood. There is limited clinical data on the safety of tadalafil in patients with severe hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh Class C); if prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the \n\nprescribing physician. There are no available data about the administration of doses higher than 10 mg of \n\ntadalafil to patients with hepatic impairment. Once-a-day dosing has not been evaluated in patients with \n\nhepatic impairment; therefore, if prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken \n\nby the prescribing physician (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nMen with diabetes \n\nDose adjustments are not required in diabetic patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of tadalafil in the paediatric population with regard to the treatment of erectile \n\ndysfunction. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan is available as 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg film-coated tablets for oral use. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, tadalafil was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. This is thought to \n\nresult from the combined effects of nitrates and tadalafil on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway. \n\nTherefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nTadalafil must not be used in men with cardiac disease for whom sexual activity is inadvisable. \n\nPhysicians should consider the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with pre-existing \n\ncardiovascular disease. \n\n \n\nThe following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical trials and the use \n\nof tadalafil is therefore contraindicated: \n\n- patients with myocardial infarction within the last 90 days, \n\n- patients with unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse, \n\n- patients with New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months, \n\n- patients with uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (< 90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension, \n\n- patients with a stroke within the last 6 months. \n\n \n\nTadalafil is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of non-arteritic anterior \n\nischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in connection or not with \n\nprevious PDE5 inhibitor exposure (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nThe co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as \n\nriociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nBefore treatment with Tadalafil Mylan \n\n \n\nA medical history and physical examination should be undertaken to diagnose erectile dysfunction and \n\ndetermine potential underlying causes, before pharmacological treatment is considered. \n\n \n\nPrior to initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction, physicians should consider the cardiovascular status \n\nof their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Tadalafil has \n\nvasodilator properties, resulting in mild and transient decreases in blood pressure (see section 5.1) and as \n\nsuch potentiates the hypotensive effect of nitrates (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the \n\nidentification of appropriate treatment following an appropriate medical assessment. It is not known if \n\ntadalafil is effective in patients who have undergone pelvic surgery or radical non-nerve sparing \n\nprostatectomy. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular \n\n \n\nSerious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, unstable angina \n\npectoris, ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, chest pain, palpitations and tachycardia, \n\nhave been reported either post marketing and/or in clinical trials. Most of the patients in whom these events \n\nhave been reported had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. However, it is not possible to definitively \n\ndetermine whether these events are related directly to these risk factors, to tadalafil, to sexual activity, or to a \n\ncombination of these or other factors. \n\n \n\nIn patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil may induce a blood pressure \n\ndecrease. When initiating daily treatment with tadalafil, appropriate clinical considerations should be given \n\nto a possible dose adjustment of the antihypertensive therapy. \n\n \n\nIn patients who are taking alpha1 blockers, concomitant administration of tadalafil may lead to symptomatic \n\nhypotension in some patients (see section 4.5). The combination of tadalafil and doxazosin is not \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nVision \n\n \n\nVisual defects and cases of NAION have been reported in connection with the intake of tadalafil and other \n\nPDE5 inhibitors. Analyses of observational data suggest an increased risk of acute NAION in men with \n\nerectile dysfunction following exposure to tadalafil or other PDE5 inhibitors. As this may be relevant for all \n\npatients exposed to tadalafil, the patient should be advised that in case of sudden visual defect, he should \n\nstop taking Tadalafil Mylan and consult a physician immediately (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nDecreased or sudden hearing loss \n\n \n\nCases of sudden hearing loss have been reported after the use of tadalafil. Although other risk factors were \n\npresent in some cases (such as age, diabetes, hypertension and previous hearing loss history) patients should \n\nbe advised to stop taking tadalafil and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss \n\nof hearing. \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\n \n\nDue to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience and the lack of ability to influence \n\nclearance by dialysis, once-a-day dosing of tadalafil is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nThere is limited clinical data on the safety of single-dose administration of tadalafil in patients with severe \n\nhepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). Once-a-day administration has not been evaluated in patients \n\nwith hepatic insufficiency. If Tadalafil Mylan is prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation \n\nshould be undertaken by the prescribing physician. \n\n \n\nPriapism and anatomical deformation of the penis \n\n \n\nPatients who experience erections lasting 4 hours or more should be instructed to seek immediate medical \n\nassistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may \n\nresult. \n\n \n\nTadalafil should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as \n\nangulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may \n\npredispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia). \n\n \n\nUse with CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing tadalafil to patients using potent CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\n(ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and erythromycin) as increased tadalafil exposure (AUC) \n\nhas been observed if the medicinal products are combined (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nTadalafil and other treatments for erectile dysfunction \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of combinations of tadalafil and other PDE5 inhibitors or other treatments for \n\nerectile dysfunction have not been studied. The patients should be informed not to take Tadalafil Mylan in \n\nsuch combinations. \n\n \n\nLactose content \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \n\nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nSodium content \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInteraction studies were conducted with 10 mg and/or 20 mg tadalafil, as indicated below. With regard to \n\nthose interaction studies where only the 10 mg tadalafil dose was used, clinically relevant interactions at \n\nhigher doses cannot be completely ruled out. \n\n \n\nEffects of other substances on tadalafil \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 inhibitors \n\nTadalafil is principally metabolised by CYP3A4. A selective inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole (200 mg \n\ndaily), increased tadalafil (10 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold and Cmax by 15%, relative to the AUC and Cmax \nvalues for tadalafil alone. Ketoconazole (400 mg daily) increased tadalafil (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 4-fold \n\nand Cmax by 22%. Ritonavir, a protease inhibitor (200 mg twice daily), which is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, \n\nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold with no change in \n\nCmax. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other protease inhibitors, such as saquinavir, and \n\nother CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, itraconazole and grapefruit juice should be \n\nco-administered with caution as they would be expected to increase plasma concentrations of tadalafil (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\nConsequently the incidence of the adverse reactions listed in section 4.8 might be increased. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTransporters \n\nThe role of transporters (for example p-glycoprotein) in the disposition of tadalafil is not known. \n\nTherefore there is the potential of drug interactions mediated by inhibition of transporters. \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 inducers \n\nA CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, reduced tadalafil AUC by 88%, relative to the AUC values for tadalafil \n\nalone (10 mg). This reduced exposure can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of tadalafil; the magnitude \n\nof decreased efficacy is unknown. Other inducers of CYP3A4 such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and \n\ncarbamazepine, may also decrease plasma concentrations of tadalafil. \n\n \n\nEffects of tadalafil on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nNitrates \n\nIn clinical studies, tadalafil (5, 10 and 20 mg) was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. \n\nTherefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated \n\n(see section 4.3). Based on the results of a clinical study in which 150 subjects receiving daily doses of \n\ntadalafil 20 mg for 7 days and 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin at various times, this interaction lasted for \n\nmore than 24 hours and was no longer detectable when 48 hours had elapsed after the last tadalafil dose. \n\nThus, in a patient prescribed any dose of tadalafil (2.5 mg-20 mg), where nitrate administration is deemed \n\nmedically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of \n\ntadalafil before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should only be \n\nadministered under close medical supervision with appropriate haemodynamic monitoring. \n\n \n\nAnti-hypertensives (including calcium channel blockers) \n\nThe co-administration of doxazosin (4 and 8 mg daily) and tadalafil (5 mg daily dose and 20 mg as a single \n\ndose) increases the blood pressure-lowering effect of this alpha-blocker in a significant manner. This effect \n\nlasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore this combination is not \n\nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n\nIn interaction studies performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, these effects were not reported \n\nwith alfuzosin or tamsulosin. However, caution should be exercised when using tadalafil in patients treated \n\nwith any alpha-blockers, and notably in the elderly. Treatments should be initiated at minimal dosage and \n\nprogressively adjusted. \n\n \n\nIn clinical pharmacology studies, the potential for tadalafil to augment the hypotensive effects of \n\nantihypertensive medicinal products was examined. Major classes of antihypertensive medicinal products \n\nwere studied, including calcium channel blockers (amlodipine), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \n\ninhibitors (enalapril), beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (metoprolol), thiazide diuretics \n\n(bendroflumethiazide), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (various types and doses, alone or in \n\ncombination with thiazides, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and/or alpha-blockers). Tadalafil \n\n(10 mg except for studies with angiotensin II receptor blockers and amlodipine in which a 20 mg dose was \n\napplied) had no clinically significant interaction with any of these classes. In another clinical pharmacology \n\nstudy tadalafil (20 mg) was studied in combination with up to 4 classes of antihypertensives. In subjects \n\ntaking multiple antihypertensives, the ambulatory-blood-pressure changes appeared to relate to the degree of \n\nblood-pressure control. In this regard, study subjects whose blood pressure was well controlled, the reduction \n\nwas minimal and similar to that seen in healthy subjects. In study subjects whose blood pressure was not \n\ncontrolled, the reduction was greater although this reduction was not associated with hypotensive symptoms \n\nin the majority of subjects. In patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil \n\n20 mg may induce a blood pressure decrease, which (with the exception of alpha blockers -see above-) is, in \n\ngeneral, minor and not likely to be clinically relevant. Analysis of phase 3 clinical trial data showed no \n\ndifference in adverse events in patients taking tadalafil with or without antihypertensive medicinal products. \n\nHowever, appropriate clinical advice should be given to patients regarding a possible decrease in blood \n\npressure when they are treated with antihypertensive medicinal products. \n\n \n\nRiociguat \n\nPreclinical studies showed an additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors were \n\ncombined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the hypotensive effects of \n\nPDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the combination in the population \n\n\n\n7 \n\nstudied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, is contraindicated (see \n\nsection 4.3).   \n\n \n\n5-alpha reductase inhibitors \n\nIn a clinical trial that compared tadalafil 5 mg coadministered with finasteride 5 mg to placebo plus \n\nfinasteride 5 mg in the relief of BPH symptoms, no new adverse reactions were identified. However, as a \n\nformal drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effects of tadalafil and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors \n\n(5-ARIs) has not been performed, caution should be exercised when tadalafil is co-administered with \n\n5-ARIs. \n\n \n\nCYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline) \n\nWhen tadalafil 10 mg was administered with theophylline (a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor) in a \n\nclinical pharmacology study, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction. The only pharmacodynamic effect \n\nwas a small (3.5 bpm) increase in heart rate. Although this effect is minor and was of no clinical significance \n\nin this study, it should be considered when co-administering these medicinal products. \n\n \n\nEthinylestradiol and terbutaline \n\nTadalafil has been demonstrated to produce an increase in the oral bioavailability of ethinylestradiol; a \n\nsimilar increase may be expected with oral administration of terbutaline, although the clinical consequence \n\nof this is uncertain. \n\n \n\nAlcohol \n\nAlcohol concentrations (mean maximum blood concentration 0.08%) were not affected by co-administration \n\nwith tadalafil (10 mg or 20 mg). In addition, no changes in tadalafil concentrations were seen 3 hours after \n\nco-administration with alcohol. Alcohol was administered in a manner to maximise the rate of alcohol \n\nabsorption (overnight fast with no food until 2 hours after alcohol). \n\nTadalafil (20 mg) did not augment the mean blood pressure decrease produced by alcohol (0.7 g/kg or \n\napproximately 180 ml of 40% alcohol [vodka] in an 80-kg male) but in some subjects, postural dizziness and \n\northostatic hypotension were observed. When tadalafil was administered with lower doses of alcohol \n\n(0.6 g/kg), hypotension was not observed and dizziness occurred with similar frequency to alcohol alone. \n\nThe effect of alcohol on cognitive function was not augmented by tadalafil (10 mg). \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 metabolised medicinal products \n\nTadalafil is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of medicinal \n\nproducts metabolised by CYP450 isoforms. Studies have confirmed that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce \n\nCYP450 isoforms, including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. \n\n \n\nCYP2C9 substrates (e.g. R-warfarin) \n\nTadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) had no clinically significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or \n\nR-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. \n\n \n\nAspirin \n\nTadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl salicylic acid. \n\n \n\nAntidiabetic medicinal products \n\nSpecific interaction studies with antidiabetic medicinal products were not conducted. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan is not indicated for use by women. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are limited data from the use of tadalafil in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or \n\nindirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal \n\ndevelopment (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Tadalafil \n\nMylan during pregnancy. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nBreastfeeding \n\n \n\nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of tadalafil in milk. \n\nA risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Tadalafil Mylan should not be used during breast feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nEffects were seen in dogs that might indicate impairment of fertility. Two subsequent clinical studies suggest \n\nthat this effect is unlikely in humans, although a decrease in sperm concentration was seen in some men (see \n\nsections 5.1 and 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nTadalafil has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Although the frequency of reports \n\nof dizziness in placebo and tadalafil arms in clinical trials was similar, patients should be aware of how they \n\nreact to tadalafil before driving or using machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients taking tadalafil for the treatment of erectile \n\ndysfunction or benign prostatic hyperplasia were headache, dyspepsia, back pain and myalgia, in which the \n\nincidences increase with increasing dose of tadalafil. The adverse reactions reported were transient, and \n\ngenerally mild or moderate. The majority of headaches reported with tadalafil once-a-day dosing are \n\nexperienced within the first 10 to 30 days of starting treatment. \n\n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe table below lists the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo controlled \n\nclinical trials (comprising a total of 8022 patients on tadalafil and 4422 patients on placebo) for on-demand \n\nand once-a-day treatment of erectile dysfunction and the once-a-day treatment of benign prostatic \n\nhyperplasia. \n\n \n\nFrequency convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), \n\nrare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata). \n\nVery common Common  Uncommon  Rare  \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity reactions Angioedema2 \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Headache Dizziness  Stroke1 \n\n(including haemorrhagic \n\nevents), \n\nSyncope, \n\nTransient ischaemic attacks1, \n\nMigraine2, \n\nSeizures2, \n\nTransient amnesia  \n\nEye disorders \n\n\n\n9 \n\n  Blurred vision, \n\nSensations described as \n\neye pain \n\nVisual field defect,  \n\nSwelling of eyelids, \n\nConjunctival hyperaemia, \n\nNon-arteritic anterior ischemic \n\noptic neuropathy (NAION)2, \n\nRetinal vascular occlusion2 \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\n  Tinnitus Sudden hearing loss \n\nCardiac disorders1 \n\n  Tachycardia, \n\nPalpitations \n\nMyocardial infarction, \n\nUnstable angina pectoris2, \n\nVentricular arrhythmia2 \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Flushing Hypotension3, \n\nHypertension  \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Nasal \n\ncongestion \n\nDyspnoea, \n\nEpistaxis  \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Dyspepsia \n\n \n\nAbdominal pain, \n\nVomiting, Nausea, \n\nGastro-oesophageal reflux  \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n  Rash Urticaria, \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome2, \n\nExfoliative dermatitis2, \n\nHyperhydrosis (sweating) \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Back pain, \n\nMyalgia,  \n\nPain in \n\nextremity \n\n  \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n  Haematuria  \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\n  Prolonged erections \n\n \n\nPriapism, Penile haemorrhage, \n\nHaematospermia  \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n\n\n10 \n\n  Chest pain1, Peripheral \n\noedema, Fatigue \n\nFacial oedema2, \n\nSudden cardiac death1, 2 \n\n (1) Most of the patients had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.4). \n\n(2) Postmarketing surveillance reported adverse reactions not observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials. \n\n(3) More commonly reported when tadalafil is given to patients who are already taking antihypertensive \n\nmedicinal products. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nA slightly higher incidence of ECG abnormalities, primarily sinus bradycardia, has been reported in patients \n\ntreated with tadalafil once a day as compared with placebo. Most of these ECG abnormalities were not \n\nassociated with adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nOther special populations \n\n \n\nData in patients over 65 years of age receiving tadalafil in clinical trials, either for the treatment of erectile \n\ndysfunction or the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, are limited. In clinical trials with tadalafil taken \n\non demand for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, diarrhoea was reported more frequently in patients over \n\n65 years of age. In clinical trials with tadalafil 5 mg taken once a day for the treatment of benign prostatic \n\nhyperplasia, dizziness and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in patients over 75 years of age. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSingle doses of up to 500 mg have been given to healthy subjects, and multiple daily doses up to 100 mg \n\nhave been given to patients. Adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses. \n\nIn cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Haemodialysis contributes \n\nnegligibly to tadalafil elimination. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, Drugs used in erectile dysfunction, ATC Code: G04BE08. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nTadalafil is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific \n\nphosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide, inhibition \n\nof PDE5 by tadalafil produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This results in smooth \n\nmuscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an erection. Tadalafil has no \n\neffect in the absence of sexual stimulation. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nStudies in vitro have shown that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is an enzyme found in \n\ncorpus cavernosum smooth muscle, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, platelets, kidney, \n\nlung, and cerebellum. The effect of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other phosphodiesterases. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\nTadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE1, PDE2, and PDE4 enzymes which are found \n\nin the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, and other organs. Tadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 \n\nthan for PDE3, an enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels. \n\nThis selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3 is important because PDE3 is an enzyme involved in cardiac \n\ncontractility. Additionally, tadalafil is approximately 700-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE6, an \n\nenzyme which is found in the retina and is responsible for phototransduction. Tadalafil is also > 10,000-fold \n\nmore potent for PDE5 than for PDE7 through PDE10. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThree clinical studies were conducted in 1054 patients in an at-home setting to define the period of \n\nresponsiveness to tadalafil on demand. Tadalafil demonstrated statistically significant improvement in \n\nerectile function and the ability to have successful sexual intercourse up to 36 hours following dosing, as \n\nwell as patients’ ability to attain and maintain erections for successful intercourse compared to placebo as \n\nearly as 16 minutes following dosing. \n\n \n\nTadalafil administered to healthy subjects produced no significant difference compared to placebo in supine \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg, respectively), in standing \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 0.2/4.6 mm Hg, respectively), and no \n\nsignificant change in heart rate. \n\n \n\nIn a study to assess the effects of tadalafil on vision, no impairment of colour discrimination (blue/green) \n\nwas detected using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test. This finding is consistent with the low affinity of \n\ntadalafil for PDE6 compared to PDE5. Across all clinical studies, reports of changes in colour vision were \n\nrare (< 0.1%). \n\n \n\nThree studies were conducted in men to assess the potential effect on spermatogenesis of tadalafil 10 mg \n\n(one 6-month study) and 20 mg (one 6-month and one 9-month study) administered daily. In two of these \n\nstudies decreases were observed in sperm count and concentration related to tadalafil treatment of unlikely \n\nclinical relevance. These effects were not associated with changes in other parameters such as motility, \n\nmorphology and FSH. \n\n \n\nTadalafil at doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg taken once a day was initially evaluated in 3 clinical studies involving \n\n853 patients of various ages (range 21-82 years) and ethnicities, with erectile dysfunction of various \n\nseverities (mild, moderate, severe) and etiologies. In the two primary efficacy studies of general populations, \n\nthe mean per-subject proportion of successful intercourse attempts were 57 and 67% on tadalafil 5 mg, 50% \n\non tadalafil 2.5 mg as compared to 31 and 37% with placebo. In the study in patients with erectile \n\ndysfunction secondary to diabetes, the mean per-subject proportion of successful attempts were 41 and 46% \n\non tadalafil 5 mg and 2.5 mg, respectively, as compared to 28% with placebo. Most patients in these three \n\nstudies were responders to previous on-demand treatment with PDE5 inhibitors. In a subsequent study, \n\n217 patients who were treatment-naïve to PDE5 inhibitors were randomised to tadalafil 5 mg once a day vs. \n\nplacebo. The mean per-subject proportion of successful sexual intercourse attempts was 68% for tadalafil \n\npatients compared to 52% for patients on placebo. \n\n \n\nIn a 12-week study performed in 186 patients (142 tadalafil, 44 placebo) with erectile dysfunction secondary \n\nto spinal cord injury, tadalafil significantly improved the erectile function leading to a mean per-subject \n\nproportion of successful attempts in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg (flexible-dose, on demand) of \n\n48% as compared to 17% with placebo. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nA single study has been performed in paediatric patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in \n\nwhich no evidence of efficacy was seen. The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, 3-arm \n\nstudy of tadalafil was conducted in 331 boys aged 7-14 years with DMD receiving concurrent corticosteroid \n\ntherapy. The study included a 48-week double-blind period where patients were randomised to tadalafil \n\n0.3 mg/kg, tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg, or placebo daily. Tadalafil did not show efficacy in slowing the decline in \n\nambulation as measured by the primary 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) endpoint: least squares (LS) mean \n\n\n\n12 \n\nchange in 6MWD at 48 weeks was -51.0 meters (m) in the placebo group, compared with -64.7 m in the \n\ntadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (p = 0.307) and -59.1 m in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group (p = 0.538). In addition, \n\nthere was no evidence of efficacy from any of the secondary analyses performed in this study. The overall \n\nsafety results from this study were generally consistent with the known safety profile of tadalafil and with \n\nadverse events (AEs) expected in a paediatric DMD population receiving corticosteroids. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in all subsets of \n\nthe paediatric population in the treatment of the erectile dysfunction. See section 4.2 for information on \n\npaediatric use. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nTadalafil is readily absorbed after oral administration and the mean maximum observed plasma \n\nconcentration (Cmax) is achieved at a median time of 2 hours after dosing. Absolute bioavailability of tadalafil \n\nfollowing oral dosing has not been determined. \n\nThe rate and extent of absorption of tadalafil are not influenced by food, thus tadalafil may be taken with or \n\nwithout food. The time of dosing (morning versus evening) had no clinically relevant effects on the rate and \n\nextent of absorption. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe mean volume of distribution is approximately 63 l, indicating that tadalafil is distributed into tissues. At \n\ntherapeutic concentrations, 94% of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins. Protein binding is not affected by \n\nimpaired renal function. \n\nLess than 0.0005% of the administered dose appeared in the semen of healthy subjects. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nTadalafil is predominantly metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoform. The major circulating \n\nmetabolite is the methylcatechol glucuronide. This metabolite is at least 13,000-fold less potent than tadalafil \n\nfor PDE5. Consequently, it is not expected to be clinically active at observed metabolite concentrations. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe mean oral clearance for tadalafil is 2.5 l/h and the mean half-life is 17.5 hours in healthy subjects. \n\nTadalafil is excreted predominantly as inactive metabolites, mainly in the faeces (approximately 61% of the \n\ndose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 36% of the dose). \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nTadalafil pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects are linear with respect to time and dose. Over a dose range of \n\n2.5 to 20 mg, exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose. Steady-state plasma concentrations are \n\nattained within 5 days of once-daily dosing. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics determined with a population approach in patients with erectile dysfunction are similar to \n\npharmacokinetics in subjects without erectile dysfunction. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nHealthy elderly subjects (65 years or over), had a lower oral clearance of tadalafil, resulting in 25% higher \n\nexposure (AUC) relative to healthy subjects aged 19 to 45 years. This effect of age is not clinically \n\nsignificant and does not warrant a dose adjustment. \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nRenal insufficiency \n\nIn clinical pharmacology studies using single-dose tadalafil (5 to 20 mg), tadalafil exposure (AUC) \n\napproximately doubled in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min) or moderate (creatinine \n\nclearance 31 to 50 ml/min) renal impairment and in subjects with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. In \n\nhaemodialysis patients, Cmax was 41% higher than that observed in healthy subjects. Haemodialysis \n\ncontributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination. \n\n \n\nHepatic insufficiency \n\nTadalafil exposure (AUC) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and \n\nB) is comparable to exposure in healthy subjects when a dose of 10 mg is administered. There is limited \n\nclinical data on the safety of tadalafil in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). \n\nThere are no available data about the administration of once-a-day dosing of tadalafil to patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. If tadalafil is prescribed once-a-day, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be \n\nundertaken by the prescribing physician. \n\n \n\nPatients with diabetes \n\nTadalafil exposure (AUC) in patients with diabetes was approximately 19% lower than the AUC value for \n\nhealthy subjects. This difference in exposure does not warrant a dose adjustment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, \n\nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction. \n\nThere was no evidence of teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or foetotoxicity in rats or mice that received up to \n\n1000 mg/kg/day tadalafil. In a rat prenatal and postnatal development study, the no observed effect dose was \n\n30 mg/kg/day. In the pregnant rat the AUC for calculated free drug at this dose was approximately 18 times \n\nthe human AUC at a 20 mg dose. \n\nThere was no impairment of fertility in male and female rats. In dogs given tadalafil daily for 6 to 12 months \n\nat doses of 25 mg/kg/day (resulting in at least a 3-fold greater exposure [range 3.7 – 18.6] than seen in \n\nhumans given a single 20 mg dose) and above, there was regression of the seminiferous tubular epithelium \n\nthat resulted in a decrease in spermatogenesis in some dogs.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan 5 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach tablet contains 5 mg tadalafil. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect: \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 59.48 mg of lactose. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n\n \n\nA light yellow, film-coated, round, biconvex tablet (6.3 ± 0.3 mm) debossed with ‘M’ on one side of the \n\ntablet and ‘TL over 2’ on the other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males. \n\n \n\nIn order for tadalafil to be effective for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation is required. \n\n \n\nTreatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia in adult males. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan is not indicated for use by women. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nErectile dysfunction in adult men \n\nIn general, the recommended dose is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or without \n\nfood. \n\nIn those patients in whom tadalafil 10 mg does not produce an adequate effect, 20 mg might be tried. \n\nIt may be taken at least 30 minutes prior to sexual activity. \n\n \n\nThe maximum dose frequency is once per day. \n\n \n\nTadalafil 10 and 20 mg is intended for use prior to anticipated sexual activity and it is not recommended for \n\ncontinuous daily use. \n\n \n\nIn patients who anticipate a frequent use of tadalafil (i.e., at least twice weekly) a once daily regimen with \n\nthe lowest doses of tadalafil might be considered suitable, based on patient choice and the physician’s \n\njudgement. \n\n \n\nIn these patients the recommended dose is 5 mg taken once a day at approximately the same time of day. The \n\ndose may be decreased to 2.5 mg once a day based on individual tolerability. \n\n\n\n16 \n\nThe appropriateness of continued use of the daily regimen should be reassessed periodically. \n\n \n\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia in adult men \n\nThe recommended dose is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day with or without food. For \n\nadult men being treated for both benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction the recommended dose \n\nis also 5 mg taken at approximately the same time every day. Patients who are unable to tolerate tadalafil \n\n5 mg for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia should consider an alternative therapy as the efficacy \n\nof tadalafil 2.5 mg for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia has not been demonstrated. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly men \n\nDose adjustments are not required in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nMen with renal impairment \n\nDose adjustments are not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. For patients with \n\nsevere renal impairment 10 mg is the maximum recommended dose for on-demand treatment. \n\n \n\nOnce-a-day dosing of 2.5 or 5 mg tadalafil both for the treatment of erectile dysfunction or benign prostatic \n\nhyperplasia is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nMen with hepatic impairment \n\nFor the treatment of erectile dysfunction using on-demand tadalafil the recommended dose of tadalafil is \n\n10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or without food. There is limited clinical data on the \n\nsafety of tadalafil in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); if prescribed, a careful \n\nindividual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing physician. There are no available \n\ndata about the administration of doses higher than 10 mg of tadalafil to patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nOnce-a-day dosing of tadalafil both for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia \n\nhas not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment; therefore, if prescribed, a careful individual \n\nbenefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing physician (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nMen with diabetes \n\nDose adjustments are not required in diabetic patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of tadalafil in the paediatric population with regard to the treatment of erectile \n\ndysfunction. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan is available as 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg film-coated tablets for oral use. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, tadalafil was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. This is thought to \n\nresult from the combined effects of nitrates and tadalafil on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway. \n\nTherefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nTadalafil must not be used in men with cardiac disease for whom sexual activity is inadvisable. \n\nPhysicians should consider the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with pre-existing \n\ncardiovascular disease. \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nThe following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical trials and the use \n\nof tadalafil is therefore contraindicated: \n\n- patients with myocardial infarction within the last 90 days, \n\n- patients with unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse, \n\n- patients with New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months, \n\n- patients with uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (< 90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension, \n\n- patients with a stroke within the last 6 months. \n\n \n\nTadalafil is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of non-arteritic anterior \n\nischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in connection or not with \n\nprevious PDE5 inhibitor exposure (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as \n\nriociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nBefore treatment with Tadalafil Mylan \n\n \n\nA medical history and physical examination should be undertaken to diagnose erectile dysfunction or benign \n\nprostatic hyperplasia and determine potential underlying causes, before pharmacological treatment is \n\nconsidered. \n\n \n\nPrior to initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction, physicians should consider the cardiovascular status \n\nof their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Tadalafil has \n\nvasodilator properties, resulting in mild and transient decreases in blood pressure (see section 5.1) and as \n\nsuch potentiates the hypotensive effect of nitrates (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nPrior to initiating treatment with tadalafil for benign prostatic hyperplasia patients should be examined to \n\nrule out the presence of carcinoma of the prostate and carefully assessed for cardiovascular conditions (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the \n\nidentification of appropriate treatment following an appropriate medical assessment. It is not known if \n\ntadalafil is effective in patients who have undergone pelvic surgery or radical non-nerve sparing \n\nprostatectomy. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular \n\n \n\nSerious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, unstable angina \n\npectoris, ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, chest pain, palpitations and tachycardia, \n\nhave been reported either post marketing and/or in clinical trials. Most of the patients in whom these events \n\nhave been reported had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. However, it is not possible to definitively \n\ndetermine whether these events are related directly to these risk factors, to tadalafil, to sexual activity, or to a \n\ncombination of these or other factors. \n\n \n\nIn patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil may induce a blood pressure \n\ndecrease. When initiating daily treatment with tadalafil, appropriate clinical considerations should be given \n\nto a possible dose adjustment of the antihypertensive therapy. \n\n \n\nIn patients who are taking alpha1 blockers, concomitant administration of tadalafil may lead to symptomatic \n\nhypotension in some patients (see section 4.5). The combination of tadalafil and doxazosin is not \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nVision \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nVisual defects and cases of NAION have been reported in connection with the intake of tadalafil and other \n\nPDE5 inhibitors. Analyses of observational data suggest an increased risk of acute NAION in men with \n\nerectile dysfunction following exposure to tadalafil or other PDE5 inhibitors. As this may be relevant for all \n\npatients exposed to tadalafil, the patient should be advised that in case of sudden visual defect, he should \n\nstop taking Tadalafil Mylan and consult a physician immediately (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nDecreased or sudden hearing loss \n\n \n\nCases of sudden hearing loss have been reported after the use of tadalafil. Although other risk factors were \n\npresent in some cases (such as age, diabetes, hypertension and previous hearing loss history) patients should \n\nbe advised to stop taking tadalafil and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss \n\nof hearing. \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\n \n\nDue to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience and the lack of ability to influence \n\nclearance by dialysis, once-a-day dosing of tadalafil is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment. \n\n \n\nThere is limited clinical data on the safety of single-dose administration of tadalafil in patients with severe \n\nhepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). Once-a-day administration either for the treatment of erectile \n\ndysfunction or benign prostatic hyperplasia has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic insufficiency. If \n\nTadalafil Mylan is prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the \n\nprescribing physician. \n\n \n\nPriapism and anatomical deformation of the penis \n\n \n\nPatients who experience erections lasting 4 hours or more should be instructed to seek immediate medical \n\nassistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may \n\nresult. \n\n \n\nTadalafil should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as \n\nangulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may \n\npredispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia). \n\n \n\nUse with CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing tadalafil to patients using potent CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\n(ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and erythromycin) as increased tadalafil exposure (AUC) \n\nhas been observed if the medicinal products are combined (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nTadalafil and other treatments for erectile dysfunction \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of combinations of tadalafil and other PDE5 inhibitors or other treatments for \n\nerectile dysfunction have not been studied. The patients should be informed not to take Tadalafil Mylan in \n\nsuch combinations. \n\n \n\nLactose content \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \n\nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nSodium content \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInteraction studies were conducted with 10 mg and/or 20 mg tadalafil, as indicated below. With regard to \n\nthose interaction studies where only the 10 mg tadalafil dose was used, clinically relevant interactions at \n\nhigher doses cannot be completely ruled out. \n\n \n\nEffects of other substances on tadalafil \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 inhibitors \n\nTadalafil is principally metabolised by CYP3A4. A selective inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole (200 mg \n\ndaily), increased tadalafil (10 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold and Cmax by 15%, relative to the AUC and Cmax \n\nvalues for tadalafil alone. Ketoconazole (400 mg daily) increased tadalafil (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 4-fold \n\nand Cmax by 22%. Ritonavir, a protease inhibitor (200 mg twice daily), which is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, \n\nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold with no change in \n\nCmax. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other protease inhibitors, such as saquinavir, and \n\nother CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, itraconazole and grapefruit juice should be \n\nco-administered with caution as they would be expected to increase plasma concentrations of tadalafil (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\nConsequently the incidence of the adverse reactions listed in section 4.8 might be increased. \n\n \n\nTransporters \n\nThe role of transporters (for example p-glycoprotein) in the disposition of tadalafil is not known. \n\nTherefore there is the potential of drug interactions mediated by inhibition of transporters. \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 inducers \n\nA CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, reduced tadalafil AUC by 88%, relative to the AUC values for tadalafil \n\nalone (10 mg). This reduced exposure can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of tadalafil; the magnitude \n\nof decreased efficacy is unknown. Other inducers of CYP3A4 such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and \n\ncarbamazepine, may also decrease plasma concentrations of tadalafil. \n\n \n\nEffects of tadalafil on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nNitrates \n\nIn clinical studies, tadalafil (5, 10 and 20 mg) was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. \n\nTherefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated \n\n(see section 4.3). Based on the results of a clinical study in which 150 subjects receiving daily doses of \n\ntadalafil 20 mg for 7 days and 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin at various times, this interaction lasted for \n\nmore than 24 hours and was no longer detectable when 48 hours had elapsed after the last tadalafil dose. \n\nThus, in a patient prescribed any dose of tadalafil (2.5 mg-20 mg), where nitrate administration is deemed \n\nmedically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of \n\ntadalafil before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should only be \n\nadministered under close medical supervision with appropriate haemodynamic monitoring. \n\n \n\nAnti-hypertensives (including calcium channel blockers) \n\nThe co-administration of doxazosin (4 and 8 mg daily) and tadalafil (5 mg daily dose and 20 mg as a single \n\ndose) increases the blood pressure-lowering effect of this alpha-blocker in a significant manner. This effect \n\nlasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore this combination is not \n\nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n\nIn interaction studies performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, these effects were not reported \n\nwith alfuzosin or tamsulosin. However, caution should be exercised when using tadalafil in patients treated \n\nwith any alpha-blockers, and notably in the elderly. Treatments should be initiated at minimal dosage and \n\nprogressively adjusted. \n\n \n\nIn clinical pharmacology studies, the potential for tadalafil to augment the hypotensive effects of \n\nantihypertensive medicinal products was examined. Major classes of antihypertensive medicinal products \n\nwere studied, including calcium channel blockers (amlodipine), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \n\n\n\n20 \n\ninhibitors (enalapril), beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (metoprolol), thiazide diuretics (bendrofluazide), and \n\nangiotensin II receptor blockers (various types and doses, alone or in combination with thiazides, calcium \n\nchannel blockers, beta-blockers, and/or alpha-blockers). Tadalafil (10 mg except for studies with angiotensin \n\nII receptor blockers and amlodipine in which a 20 mg dose was applied) had no clinically significant \n\ninteraction with any of these classes. In another clinical pharmacology study tadalafil (20 mg) was studied in \n\ncombination with up to 4 classes of antihypertensives. In subjects taking multiple antihypertensives, the \n\nambulatory-blood-pressure changes appeared to relate to the degree of blood-pressure control. In this regard, \n\nstudy subjects whose blood pressure was well controlled, the reduction was minimal and similar to that seen \n\nin healthy subjects. In study subjects whose blood pressure was not controlled, the reduction was greater \n\nalthough this reduction was not associated with hypotensive symptoms in the majority of subjects. In patients \n\nreceiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil 20 mg may induce a blood pressure \n\ndecrease, which (with the exception of alpha blockers -see above-) is, in general, minor and not likely to be \n\nclinically relevant. Analysis of phase 3 clinical trial data showed no difference in adverse events in patients \n\ntaking tadalafil with or without antihypertensive medicinal products. However, appropriate clinical advice \n\nshould be given to patients regarding a possible decrease in blood pressure when they are treated with \n\nantihypertensive medicinal products. \n\n \n\nRiociguat \n\nPreclinical studies showed an additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors were \n\ncombined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the hypotensive effects of \n\nPDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the combination in the population \n\nstudied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, is contraindicated (see \n\nsection 4.3).   \n\n \n\n5-alpha reductase inhibitors \n\nIn a clinical trial that compared tadalafil 5 mg coadministered with finasteride 5 mg to placebo plus \n\nfinasteride 5 mg in the relief of BPH symptoms, no new adverse reactions were identified. However, as a \n\nformal drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effects of tadalafil and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors \n\n(5-ARIs) has not been performed, caution should be exercised when tadalafil is co-administered with \n\n5-ARIs. \n\n \n\nCYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline) \n\nWhen tadalafil 10 mg was administered with theophylline (a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor) in a \n\nclinical pharmacology study, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction. The only pharmacodynamic effect \n\nwas a small (3.5 bpm) increase in heart rate. Although this effect is minor and was of no clinical significance \n\nin this study, it should be considered when co-administering these medicinal products. \n\n \n\nEthinylestradiol and terbutaline \n\nTadalafil has been demonstrated to produce an increase in the oral bioavailability of ethinylestradiol; a \n\nsimilar increase may be expected with oral administration of terbutaline, although the clinical consequence \n\nof this is uncertain. \n\n \n\nAlcohol \n\nAlcohol concentrations (mean maximum blood concentration 0.08%) were not affected by co-administration \n\nwith tadalafil (10 mg or 20 mg). In addition, no changes in tadalafil concentrations were seen 3 hours after \n\nco-administration with alcohol. Alcohol was administered in a manner to maximise the rate of alcohol \n\nabsorption (overnight fast with no food until 2 hours after alcohol). \n\nTadalafil (20 mg) did not augment the mean blood pressure decrease produced by alcohol (0.7 g/kg or \n\napproximately 180 ml of 40% alcohol [vodka] in an 80-kg male) but in some subjects, postural dizziness and \n\northostatic hypotension were observed. When tadalafil was administered with lower doses of alcohol \n\n(0.6 g/kg), hypotension was not observed and dizziness occurred with similar frequency to alcohol alone. \n\nThe effect of alcohol on cognitive function was not augmented by tadalafil (10 mg). \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 metabolised medicinal products \n\nTadalafil is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of medicinal \n\nproducts metabolised by CYP450 isoforms. Studies have confirmed that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce \n\nCYP450 isoforms, including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nCYP2C9 substrates (e.g. R-warfarin) \n\nTadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) had no clinically significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or \n\nR-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. \n\n \n\nAspirin \n\nTadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl salicylic acid. \n\n \n\nAntidiabetic medicinal products \n\nSpecific interaction studies with antidiabetic medicinal products were not conducted. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan is not indicated for use by women. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are limited data from the use of tadalafil in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or \n\nindirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal \n\ndevelopment (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Tadalafil \n\nMylan during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreastfeeding \n\n \n\nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of tadalafil in milk. \n\nA risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Tadalafil Mylan should not be used during breast feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nEffects were seen in dogs that might indicate impairment of fertility. Two subsequent clinical studies suggest \n\nthat this effect is unlikely in humans, although a decrease in sperm concentration was seen in some men (see \n\nsections 5.1 and 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nTadalafil has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Although the frequency of reports \n\nof dizziness in placebo and tadalafil arms in clinical trials was similar, patients should be aware of how they \n\nreact to tadalafil before driving or using machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients taking tadalafil for the treatment of erectile \n\ndysfunction or benign prostatic hyperplasia were headache, dyspepsia, back pain and myalgia, in which the \n\nincidences increase with increasing dose of tadalafil. The adverse reactions reported were transient, and \n\ngenerally mild or moderate. The majority of headaches reported with tadalafil once-a-day dosing are \n\nexperienced within the first 10 to 30 days of starting treatment. \n\n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe table below lists the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo controlled \n\nclinical trials (comprising a total of 8022 patients on tadalafil and 4422 patients on placebo) for on-demand \n\nand once-a-day treatment of erectile dysfunction and the once-a-day treatment of benign prostatic \n\nhyperplasia. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nFrequency convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), \n\nrare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata). \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare  \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity \n\nreactions \n\nAngioedema2 \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Headache Dizziness  Stroke1 \n\n(including haemorrhagic \n\nevents), \n\nSyncope, \n\nTransient ischaemic attacks1, \n\nMigraine2, \n\nSeizures2, \n\nTransient amnesia  \n\nEye disorders \n\n  Blurred vision, \n\nSensations described \n\nas eye pain \n\nVisual field defect, \n\nSwelling of eyelids, \n\nConjunctival hyperaemia, \n\nNon-arteritic anterior ischemic \n\noptic neuropathy (NAION)2, \n\nRetinal vascular occlusion2 \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\n  Tinnitus Sudden hearing loss  \n\nCardiac disorders1 \n\n  Tachycardia, \n\nPalpitations \n\nMyocardial infarction, \n\nUnstable angina pectoris2, \n\nVentricular arrhythmia2 \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Flushing Hypotension3, \n\nHypertension  \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Nasal congestion Dyspnoea, \n\nEpistaxis  \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Dyspepsia \n\n \n\nAbdominal pain, \n\nVomiting, Nausea, \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nGastro-oesophageal \n\nreflux,  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n  Rash  Urticaria, \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome2, \n\nExfoliative dermatitis2 \n\nHyperhydrosis (sweating) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Back pain, \n\nMyalgia, \n\nPain in extremity \n\n  \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n  Haematuria  \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\n  Prolonged erections \n\n \n\nPriapism, Penile haemorrhage, \n\nHaematospermia  \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n  Chest pain1, \n\nPeripheral oedema, \n\nFatigue \n\nFacial oedema2, \n\nSudden cardiac death1, 2 \n\n (1) Most of the patients had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.4). \n\n(2) Postmarketing surveillance reported adverse reactions not observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials. \n\n(3) More commonly reported when tadalafil is given to patients who are already taking antihypertensive \n\nmedicinal products. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nA slightly higher incidence of ECG abnormalities, primarily sinus bradycardia, has been reported in patients \n\ntreated with tadalafil once a day as compared with placebo. Most of these ECG abnormalities were not \n\nassociated with adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nOther special populations \n\n \n\nData in patients over 65 years of age receiving tadalafil in clinical trials, either for the treatment of erectile \n\ndysfunction or the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, are limited. In clinical trials with tadalafil taken \n\non demand for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, diarrhoea was reported more frequently in patients over \n\n65 years of age. In clinical trials with tadalafil 5 mg taken once a day for the treatment of benign prostatic \n\nhyperplasia, dizziness and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in patients over 75 years of age. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n24 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSingle doses of up to 500 mg have been given to healthy subjects, and multiple daily doses up to 100 mg \n\nhave been given to patients. Adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses. \n\nIn cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Haemodialysis contributes \n\nnegligibly to tadalafil elimination. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, Drugs used in erectile dysfunction, ATC Code: G04BE08. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nTadalafil is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific \n\nphosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide, inhibition \n\nof PDE5 by tadalafil produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This results in smooth \n\nmuscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an erection. Tadalafil has no \n\neffect in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in the absence of sexual stimulation. \n\n \n\nThe effect of PDE5 inhibition on cGMP concentration in the corpus cavernosum is also observed in the \n\nsmooth muscle of the prostate, the bladder and their vascular supply. The resulting vascular relaxation \n\nincreases blood perfusion which may be the mechanism by which symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia \n\nare reduced. These vascular effects may be complemented by inhibition of bladder afferent nerve activity \n\nand smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate and bladder. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nStudies in vitro have shown that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is an enzyme found in \n\ncorpus cavernosum smooth muscle, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, platelets, kidney, \n\nlung, and cerebellum. The effect of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other phosphodiesterases. \n\nTadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE1, PDE2, and PDE4 enzymes which are found \n\nin the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, and other organs. Tadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 \n\nthan for PDE3, an enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels. \n\nThis selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3 is important because PDE3 is an enzyme involved in cardiac \n\ncontractility. Additionally, tadalafil is approximately 700-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE6, an \n\nenzyme which is found in the retina and is responsible for phototransduction. Tadalafil is also > 10,000-fold \n\nmore potent for PDE5 than for PDE7 through PDE10. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nTadalafil administered to healthy subjects produced no significant difference compared to placebo in supine \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg, respectively), in standing \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 0.2/4.6 mm Hg, respectively), and no \n\nsignificant change in heart rate. \n\n \n\nIn a study to assess the effects of tadalafil on vision, no impairment of colour discrimination (blue/green) \n\nwas detected using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test. This finding is consistent with the low affinity of \n\ntadalafil for PDE6 compared to PDE5. Across all clinical studies, reports of changes in colour vision were \n\nrare (< 0.1%). \n\n \n\nThree studies were conducted in men to assess the potential effect on spermatogenesis of tadalafil 10 mg \n\n(one 6-month study) and 20 mg (one 6-month and one 9-month study) administered daily. In two of these \n\nstudies decreases were observed in sperm count and concentration related to tadalafil treatment of unlikely \n\n\n\n25 \n\nclinical relevance. These effects were not associated with changes in other parameters such as motility, \n\nmorphology and FSH. \n\n \n\nErectile dysfunction \n\nFor tadalafil on demand, three clinical studies were conducted in 1054 patients in an at-home setting to \n\ndefine the period of responsiveness. Tadalafil demonstrated statistically significant improvement in erectile \n\nfunction and the ability to have successful sexual intercourse up to 36 hours following dosing, as well as \n\npatients’ ability to attain and maintain erections for successful intercourse compared to placebo as early as \n\n16 minutes following dosing. \n\n \n\nIn a 12-week study performed in 186 patients (142 tadalafil, 44 placebo) with erectile dysfunction secondary \n\nto spinal cord injury, tadalafil significantly improved the erectile function leading to a mean per-subject \n\nproportion of successful attempts in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg (flexible-dose, on demand) of \n\n48% as compared to 17% with placebo. \n\n \n\nFor once-a-day evaluation of tadalafil at doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg 3 clinical studies were initially conducted \n\ninvolving 853 patients of various ages (range 21-82 years) and ethnicities, with erectile dysfunction of \n\nvarious severities (mild, moderate, severe) and etiologies. In the two primary efficacy studies of general \n\npopulations, the mean per-subject proportion of successful intercourse attempts were 57 and 67% on tadalafil \n\n5 mg, 50% on tadalafil 2.5 mg as compared to 31 and 37% with placebo. In the study in patients with erectile \n\ndysfunction secondary to diabetes, the mean per-subject proportion of successful attempts were 41 and 46% \n\non tadalafil 5 mg and 2.5 mg, respectively, as compared to 28% with placebo. Most patients in these three \n\nstudies were responders to previous on-demand treatment with PDE5 inhibitors. In a subsequent study, \n\n217 patients who were treatment-naïve to PDE5 inhibitors were randomised to tadalafil 5 mg once a day vs. \n\nplacebo. The mean per-subject proportion of successful sexual intercourse attempts was 68% for tadalafil \n\npatients compared to 52% for patients on placebo. \n\n \n\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia \n\nTadalafil was studied in 4 clinical studies of 12 weeks duration enrolling over 1500 patients with signs and \n\nsymptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The improvement in the total international prostate symptom \n\nscore with tadalafil 5 mg in the four studies were -4.8, -5.6, -6.1 and -6.3 compared to -2.2, -3.6, -3.8 \n\nand -4.2 with placebo. The improvements in total international prostate symptom score occurred as early as \n\n1 week. In one of the studies, which also included tamsulosin 0.4 mg as an active comparator, the \n\nimprovement in total international prostate symptom score with tadalafil 5 mg, tamsulosin and placebo were \n\n-6.3, -5.7 and -4.2 respectively. \n\n \n\nOne of these studies assessed improvements in erectile dysfunction and signs and symptoms of benign \n\nprostatic hyperplasia in patients with both conditions. The improvements in the erectile function domain of \n\nthe international index of erectile function and the total international prostate symptom score in this study \n\nwere 6.5 and -6.1 with tadalafil 5 mg compared to 1.8 and -3.8 with placebo, respectively. The mean per-\n\nsubject proportion of successful sexual intercourse attempts was 71.9% with tadalafil 5 mg compared to \n\n48.3% with placebo. \n\n \n\nThe maintenance of the effect was evaluated in an open-label extension to one of the studies, which showed \n\nthat the improvement in total international prostate symptom score seen at 12 weeks was maintained for up \n\nto 1 additional year of treatment with tadalafil 5 mg. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nA single study has been performed in paediatric patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in \n\nwhich no evidence of efficacy was seen. The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, 3-arm \n\nstudy of tadalafil was conducted in 331 boys aged 7-14 years with DMD receiving concurrent corticosteroid \n\ntherapy. The study included a 48-week double-blind period where patients were randomised to tadalafil \n\n0.3 mg/kg, tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg, or placebo daily. Tadalafil did not show efficacy in slowing the decline in \n\nambulation as measured by the primary 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) endpoint: least squares (LS) mean \n\nchange in 6MWD at 48 weeks was -51.0 meters (m) in the placebo group, compared with -64.7 m in the \n\ntadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (p = 0.307) and -59.1 m in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group (p = 0.538). In addition, \n\n\n\n26 \n\nthere was no evidence of efficacy from any of the secondary analyses performed in this study. The overall \n\nsafety results from this study were generally consistent with the known safety profile of tadalafil and with \n\nadverse events (AEs) expected in a paediatric DMD population receiving corticosteroids. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in all subsets of \n\nthe paediatric population in the treatment of the erectile dysfunction. See section 4.2 for information on \n\npaediatric use. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nTadalafil is readily absorbed after oral administration and the mean maximum observed plasma \n\nconcentration (Cmax) is achieved at a median time of 2 hours after dosing. Absolute bioavailability of tadalafil \n\nfollowing oral dosing has not been determined. \n\nThe rate and extent of absorption of tadalafil are not influenced by food, thus Tadalafil may be taken with or \n\nwithout food. The time of dosing (morning versus evening) had no clinically relevant effects on the rate and \n\nextent of absorption. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe mean volume of distribution is approximately 63 l, indicating that tadalafil is distributed into tissues. At \n\ntherapeutic concentrations, 94% of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins. Protein binding is not affected by \n\nimpaired renal function. \n\nLess than 0.0005% of the administered dose appeared in the semen of healthy subjects. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nTadalafil is predominantly metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoform. The major circulating \n\nmetabolite is the methylcatechol glucuronide. This metabolite is at least 13,000-fold less potent than tadalafil \n\nfor PDE5. Consequently, it is not expected to be clinically active at observed metabolite concentrations. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe mean oral clearance for tadalafil is 2.5 l/h and the mean half-life is 17.5 hours in healthy subjects. \n\nTadalafil is excreted predominantly as inactive metabolites, mainly in the faeces (approximately 61% of the \n\ndose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 36% of the dose). \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nTadalafil pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects are linear with respect to time and dose. Over a dose range of \n\n2.5 to 20 mg, exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose. Steady-state plasma concentrations are \n\nattained within 5 days of once-daily dosing. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics determined with a population approach in patients with erectile dysfunction are similar to \n\npharmacokinetics in subjects without erectile dysfunction. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nHealthy elderly subjects (65 years or over), had a lower oral clearance of tadalafil, resulting in 25% higher \n\nexposure (AUC) relative to healthy subjects aged 19 to 45 years. This effect of age is not clinically \n\nsignificant and does not warrant a dose adjustment. \n\n \n\nRenal insufficiency \n\nIn clinical pharmacology studies using single-dose tadalafil (5 to 20 mg), tadalafil exposure (AUC) \n\napproximately doubled in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min) or moderate (creatinine \n\n\n\n27 \n\nclearance 31 to 50 ml/min) renal impairment and in subjects with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. In \n\nhaemodialysis patients, Cmax was 41% higher than that observed in healthy subjects. \n\nHaemodialysis contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination. \n\n \n\nHepatic insufficiency \n\nTadalafil exposure (AUC) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and \n\nB) is comparable to exposure in healthy subjects when a dose of 10 mg is administered. There is limited \n\nclinical data on the safety of tadalafil in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). \n\nThere are no available data about the administration of once-a-day dosing of tadalafil to patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. If tadalafil is prescribed once-a-day, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be \n\nundertaken by the prescribing physician. \n\n \n\nPatients with diabetes \n\nTadalafil exposure (AUC) in patients with diabetes was approximately 19% lower than the AUC value for \n\nhealthy subjects. This difference in exposure does not warrant a dose adjustment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, \n\nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction. \n\n \n\nThere was no evidence of teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or foetotoxicity in rats or mice that received up to \n\n1000 mg/kg/day tadalafil. In a rat prenatal and postnatal development study, the no observed effect dose was \n\n30 mg/kg/day. In the pregnant rat the AUC for calculated free drug at this dose was approximately 18 times \n\nthe human AUC at a 20 mg dose. \n\n \n\nThere was no impairment of fertility in male and female rats. In dogs given tadalafil daily for 6 to 12 months \n\nat doses of 25 mg/kg/day (resulting in at least a 3-fold greater exposure [range 3.7 – 18.6] than seen in \n\nhumans given a single 20 mg dose) and above, there was regression of the seminiferous tubular epithelium \n\nthat resulted in a decrease in spermatogenesis in some dogs.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males. \n\n \n\nIn order for tadalafil to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan is not indicated for use by women. \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdult men \n\nIn general, the recommended dose is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or without \n\nfood. \n\nIn those patients in whom tadalafil 10 mg does not produce an adequate effect, 20 mg might be tried. \n\nIt may be taken at least 30 minutes prior to sexual activity. \n\n \n\nThe maximum dose frequency is once per day. \n\n \n\nTadalafil 10 and 20 mg is intended for use prior to anticipated sexual activity and it is not recommended for \n\ncontinuous daily use. \n\n \n\nIn patients who anticipate a frequent use of tadalafil (i.e., at least twice weekly) a once daily regimen with \n\nthe lowest doses of tadalafil might be considered suitable, based on patient choice and the physician’s \n\njudgement. \n\n \n\nIn these patients the recommended dose is 5 mg taken once a day at approximately the same time of day. The \n\ndose may be decreased to 2.5 mg once a day based on individual tolerability. \n\n \n\nThe appropriateness of continued use of the daily regimen should be reassessed periodically. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly men \n\nDose adjustments are not required in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nMen with renal impairment \n\nDose adjustments are not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. For patients with \n\nsevere renal impairment 10 mg is the maximum recommended dose. Once-a-day dosing of tadalafil is not \n\nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nMen with hepatic impairment \n\nThe recommended dose of tadalafil is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or without \n\nfood. There is limited clinical data on the safety of tadalafil in patients with severe hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh Class C); if prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the \n\nprescribing physician. There are no available data about the administration of doses higher than 10 mg of \n\ntadalafil to patients with hepatic impairment. Once-a-day dosing has not been evaluated in patients with \n\nhepatic impairment; therefore, if prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken \n\nby the prescribing physician (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nMen with diabetes \n\nDose adjustments are not required in diabetic patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of tadalafil in the paediatric population with regard to the treatment of erectile \n\ndysfunction. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets cannot be divided and should be swallowed whole.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, tadalafil was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. This is thought to \n\nresult from the combined effects of nitrates and tadalafil on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway. \n\nTherefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nTadalafil must not be used in men with cardiac disease for whom sexual activity is inadvisable. \n\nPhysicians should consider the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with pre-existing \n\ncardiovascular disease. \n\n \n\nThe following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical trials and the use \n\nof tadalafil is therefore contraindicated: \n\n- patients with myocardial infarction within the last 90 days, \n\n- patients with unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse, \n\n- patients with New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months, \n\n- patients with uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (< 90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension, \n\n- patients with a stroke within the last 6 months. \n\n \n\nTadalafil is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of non-arteritic anterior \n\nischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in connection or not with \n\nprevious PDE5 inhibitor exposure (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as \n\nriociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nBefore treatment with Tadalafil Mylan \n\n \n\nA medical history and physical examination should be undertaken to diagnose erectile dysfunction and \n\ndetermine potential underlying causes, before pharmacological treatment is considered. \n\n \n\nPrior to initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction, physicians should consider the cardiovascular status \n\nof their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Tadalafil has \n\nvasodilator properties, resulting in mild and transient decreases in blood pressure (see section 5.1) and as \n\nsuch potentiates the hypotensive effect of nitrates (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the \n\nidentification of appropriate treatment following an appropriate medical assessment. It is not known if \n\ntadalafil is effective in patients who have undergone pelvic surgery or radical non-nerve sparing \n\nprostatectomy. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular \n\n \n\nSerious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, unstable angina \n\npectoris, ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, chest pain, palpitations and tachycardia, \n\nhave been reported either post marketing and/or in clinical trials. Most of the patients in whom these events \n\nhave been reported had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. However, it is not possible to definitively \n\ndetermine whether these events are related directly to these risk factors, to tadalafil, to sexual activity, or to a \n\ncombination of these or other factors. \n\n \n\nIn patients who are taking alpha1 blockers, concomitant administration of tadalafil may lead to symptomatic \n\nhypotension in some patients (see section 4.5). The combination of tadalafil and doxazosin is not \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nVision \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nVisual defects and cases of NAION have been reported in connection with the intake of tadalafil and other \n\nPDE5 inhibitors. Analyses of observational data suggest an increased risk of acute NAION in men with \n\nerectile dysfunction following exposure to tadalafil or other PDE5 inhibitors. As this may be relevant for all \n\npatients exposed to tadalafil, the patient should be advised that in case of sudden visual defect, he should \n\nstop taking Tadalafil Mylan and consult a physician immediately (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nDecreased or sudden hearing loss \n\n \n\nCases of sudden hearing loss have been reported after the use of tadalafil. Although other risk factors were \n\npresent in some cases (such as age, diabetes, hypertension and previous hearing loss history) patients should \n\nbe advised to stop taking tadalafil and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss \n\nof hearing. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nThere is limited clinical data on the safety of single-dose administration of tadalafil in patients with severe \n\nhepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). If Tadalafil Mylan is prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk \n\nevaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing physician. \n\n \n\nPriapism and anatomical deformation of the penis \n\n \n\nPatients who experience erections lasting 4 hours or more should be instructed to seek immediate medical \n\nassistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may \n\nresult. \n\n \n\nTadalafil should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as \n\nangulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may \n\npredispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia). \n\n \n\nUse with CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing tadalafil to patients using potent CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\n(ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and erythromycin) as increased tadalafil exposure (AUC) \n\nhas been observed if the medicinal products are combined (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nTadalafil and other treatments for erectile dysfunction \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of combinations of tadalafil and other PDE5 inhibitors or other treatments for \n\nerectile dysfunction have not been studied. The patients should be informed not to take Tadalafil Mylan in \n\nsuch combinations. \n\n \n\nLactose content \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \n\nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nSodium content \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInteraction studies were conducted with 10 mg and/or 20 mg tadalafil, as indicated below. With regard to \n\nthose interaction studies where only the 10 mg tadalafil dose was used, clinically relevant interactions at \n\nhigher doses cannot be completely ruled out. \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nEffects of other substances on tadalafil \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 inhibitors \n\nTadalafil is principally metabolised by CYP3A4. A selective inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole (200 mg \n\ndaily), increased tadalafil (10 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold and Cmax by 15%, relative to the AUC and Cmax \n\nvalues for tadalafil alone. Ketoconazole (400 mg daily) increased tadalafil (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 4-fold \n\nand Cmax by 22%. Ritonavir, a protease inhibitor (200 mg twice daily), which is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, \n\nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold with no change in \n\nCmax. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other protease inhibitors, such as saquinavir, and \n\nother CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, itraconazole and grapefruit juice should be \n\nco-administered with caution as they would be expected to increase plasma concentrations of tadalafil (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\nConsequently the incidence of the adverse reactions listed in section 4.8 might be increased. \n\n \n\nTransporters \n\nThe role of transporters (for example p-glycoprotein) in the disposition of tadalafil is not known. \n\nTherefore there is the potential of drug interactions mediated by inhibition of transporters. \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 inducers \n\nA CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, reduced tadalafil AUC by 88%, relative to the AUC values for tadalafil \n\nalone (10 mg). This reduced exposure can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of tadalafil; the magnitude \n\nof decreased efficacy is unknown. Other inducers of CYP3A4 such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and \n\ncarbamazepine, may also decrease plasma concentrations of tadalafil. \n\n \n\nEffects of tadalafil on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nNitrates \n\nIn clinical studies, tadalafil (5, 10 and 20 mg) was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. \n\nTherefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated \n\n(see section 4.3). Based on the results of a clinical study in which 150 subjects receiving daily doses of \n\ntadalafil 20 mg for 7 days and 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin at various times, this interaction lasted for \n\nmore than 24 hours and was no longer detectable when 48 hours had elapsed after the last tadalafil dose. \n\nThus, in a patient prescribed any dose of tadalafil (2.5 mg-20 mg), where nitrate administration is deemed \n\nmedically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of \n\ntadalafil before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should only be \n\nadministered under close medical supervision with appropriate haemodynamic monitoring. \n\n \n\nAnti-hypertensives (including calcium channel blockers) \n\nThe co-administration of doxazosin (4 and 8 mg daily) and tadalafil (5 mg daily dose and 20 mg as a single \n\ndose) increases the blood pressure-lowering effect of this alpha-blocker in a significant manner. This effect \n\nlasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore this combination is not \n\nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n\nIn interaction studies performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, these effects were not reported \n\nwith alfuzosin or tamsulosin. However, caution should be exercised when using tadalafil in patients treated \n\nwith any alpha-blockers, and notably in the elderly. Treatments should be initiated at minimal dosage and \n\nprogressively adjusted. \n\n \n\nIn clinical pharmacology studies, the potential for tadalafil to augment the hypotensive effects of \n\nantihypertensive medicinal products was examined. Major classes of antihypertensive medicinal products \n\nwere studied, including calcium channel blockers (amlodipine), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \n\ninhibitors (enalapril), beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (metoprolol), thiazide diuretics \n\n(bendroflumethiazide), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (various types and doses, alone or in \n\ncombination with thiazides, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and/or alpha-blockers). Tadalafil \n\n(10 mg except for studies with angiotensin II receptor blockers and amlodipine in which a 20 mg dose was \n\napplied) had no clinically significant interaction with any of these classes. In another clinical pharmacology \n\nstudy tadalafil (20 mg) was studied in combination with up to 4 classes of antihypertensives. In subjects \n\ntaking multiple antihypertensives, the ambulatory-blood-pressure changes appeared to relate to the degree of \n\n\n\n34 \n\nblood-pressure control. In this regard, study subjects whose blood pressure was well controlled, the reduction \n\nwas minimal and similar to that seen in healthy subjects. In study subjects whose blood pressure was not \n\ncontrolled, the reduction was greater although this reduction was not associated with hypotensive symptoms \n\nin the majority of subjects. In patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil \n\n20 mg may induce a blood pressure decrease, which (with the exception of alpha blockers -see above-) is, in \n\ngeneral, minor and not likely to be clinically relevant. Analysis of phase 3 clinical trial data showed no \n\ndifference in adverse events in patients taking tadalafil with or without antihypertensive medicinal products. \n\nHowever, appropriate clinical advice should be given to patients regarding a possible decrease in blood \n\npressure when they are treated with antihypertensive medicinal products. \n\n \n\nRiociguat \n\nPreclinical studies showed an additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors were \n\ncombined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the hypotensive effects of \n\nPDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the combination in the population \n\nstudied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, is contraindicated (see \n\nsection 4.3).   \n\n \n\n5- alpha reductase inhibitors \n\nIn a clinical trial that compared tadalafil 5 mg coadministered with finasteride 5 mg to placebo plus \n\nfinasteride 5 mg in the relief of BPH symptoms, no new adverse reactions were identified. However, as a \n\nformal drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effects of tadalafil and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors \n\n(5-ARIs) has not been performed, caution should be exercised when tadalafil is co-administered with \n\n5-ARIs. \n\n \n\nCYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline) \n\nWhen tadalafil 10 mg was administered with theophylline (a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor) in a \n\nclinical pharmacology study, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction. The only pharmacodynamic effect \n\nwas a small (3.5 bpm) increase in heart rate. Although this effect is minor and was of no clinical significance \n\nin this study, it should be considered when co-administering these medicinal products. \n\n \n\nEthinylestradiol and terbutaline \n\nTadalafil has been demonstrated to produce an increase in the oral bioavailability of ethinylestradiol; a \n\nsimilar increase may be expected with oral administration of terbutaline, although the clinical consequence \n\nof this is uncertain. \n\n \n\nAlcohol \n\nAlcohol concentrations (mean maximum blood concentration 0.08%) were not affected by co-administration \n\nwith tadalafil (10 mg or 20 mg). In addition, no changes in tadalafil concentrations were seen 3 hours after \n\nco-administration with alcohol. Alcohol was administered in a manner to maximise the rate of alcohol \n\nabsorption (overnight fast with no food until 2 hours after alcohol). \n\nTadalafil (20 mg) did not augment the mean blood pressure decrease produced by alcohol (0.7 g/kg or \n\napproximately 180 ml of 40% alcohol [vodka] in an 80-kg male) but in some subjects, postural dizziness and \n\northostatic hypotension were observed. When tadalafil was administered with lower doses of alcohol \n\n(0.6 g/kg), hypotension was not observed and dizziness occurred with similar frequency to alcohol alone. \n\nThe effect of alcohol on cognitive function was not augmented by tadalafil (10 mg). \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 metabolised medicinal products \n\nTadalafil is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of medicinal \n\nproducts metabolised by CYP450 isoforms. Studies have confirmed that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce \n\nCYP450 isoforms, including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. \n\n \n\nCYP2C9 substrates (e.g. R-warfarin) \n\nTadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) had no clinically significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or \n\nR-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. \n\n \n\nAspirin \n\nTadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl salicylic acid. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nAntidiabetic medicinal products \n\nSpecific interaction studies with antidiabetic medicinal products were not conducted. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan is not indicated for use by women. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are limited data from the use of tadalafil in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or \n\nindirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal \n\ndevelopment (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Tadalafil \n\nMylan during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreastfeeding \n\n \n\nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of tadalafil in milk. \n\nA risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Tadalafil Mylan should not be used during breast feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nEffects were seen in dogs that might indicate impairment of fertility. Two subsequent clinical studies suggest \n\nthat this effect is unlikely in humans, although a decrease in sperm concentration was seen in some men (see \n\nsections 5.1 and 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nTadalafil has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Although the frequency of reports \n\nof dizziness in placebo and tadalafil arms in clinical trials was similar, patients should be aware of how they \n\nreact to tadalafil before driving or using machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients taking tadalafil for the treatment of erectile \n\ndysfunction or benign prostatic hyperplasia were headache, dyspepsia, back pain and myalgia, in which the \n\nincidences increase with increasing dose of tadalafil. The adverse reactions reported were transient, and \n\ngenerally mild or moderate. The majority of headaches reported with tadalafil once-a-day dosing are \n\nexperienced within the first 10 to 30 days of starting treatment. \n\n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe table below lists the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo controlled \n\nclinical trials (comprising a total of 8022 patients on tadalafil and 4422 patients on placebo) for on-demand \n\nand once-a-day treatment of erectile dysfunction and the once-a-day treatment of benign prostatic \n\nhyperplasia. \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nFrequency convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), \n\nrare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata). \n\nVery common Common  Uncommon  Rare  \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity reactions Angioedema2 \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Headache Dizziness  Stroke1 \n\n(including haemorrhagic \n\nevents), \n\nSyncope, \n\nTransient ischaemic attacks1, \n\nMigraine2, \n\nSeizures2, \n\nTransient amnesia  \n\nEye disorders \n\n  Blurred vision, \n\nSensations described as \n\neye pain \n\nVisual field defect,  \n\nSwelling of eyelids, \n\nConjunctival hyperaemia, \n\nNon-arteritic anterior  \n\nischemic optic neuropathy \n\n(NAION)2, \n\nRetinal vascular occlusion2 \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\n  Tinnitus Sudden hearing loss  \n\nCardiac disorders1 \n\n  Tachycardia, \n\nPalpitations \n\nMyocardial infarction, \n\nUnstable angina pectoris2, \n\nVentricular arrhythmia2 \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Flushing Hypotension3, \n\nHypertension  \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Nasal \n\ncongestion \n\nDyspnoea, \n\nEpistaxis  \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Dyspepsia \n\n \n\nAbdominal pain, \n\nVomiting, Nausea, \n\nGastro-oesophageal \n\nreflux,  \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n  Rash Urticaria, \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome2, \n\nExfoliative dermatitis2, \n\nHyperhydrosis (sweating) \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Back pain, \n\nMyalgia, \n\nPain in \n\nextremity \n\n  \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n  Haematuria  \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\n  Prolonged erections Priapism ,Penile haemorrhage, \n\nHaematospermia \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n  Chest pain1, Peripheral \n\noedema, Fatigue \n\nFacial oedema2, \n\nSudden cardiac death1, 2 \n\n (1) Most of the patients had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.4). \n\n(2) Postmarketing surveillance reported adverse reactions not observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials. \n\n(3) More commonly reported when tadalafil is given to patients who are already taking antihypertensive \n\nmedicinal products. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nA slightly higher incidence of ECG abnormalities, primarily sinus bradycardia, has been reported in patients \n\ntreated with tadalafil once a day as compared with placebo. Most of these ECG abnormalities were not \n\nassociated with adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nOther special populations \n\n \n\nData in patients over 65 years of age receiving tadalafil in clinical trials, either for the treatment of erectile \n\ndysfunction or the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, are limited. In clinical trials with tadalafil taken \n\non demand for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, diarrhoea was reported more frequently in patients over \n\n65 years of age. In clinical trials with tadalafil 5 mg taken once a day for the treatment of benign prostatic \n\nhyperplasia, dizziness and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in patients over 75 years of age. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n38 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSingle doses of up to 500 mg have been given to healthy subjects, and multiple daily doses up to 100 mg \n\nhave been given to patients. Adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses. \n\nIn cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Haemodialysis contributes \n\nnegligibly to tadalafil elimination. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, Drugs used in erectile dysfunction, ATC Code: G04BE08. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nTadalafil is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific \n\nphosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide, inhibition \n\nof PDE5 by tadalafil produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This results in smooth \n\nmuscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an erection. Tadalafil has no \n\neffect in the absence of sexual stimulation. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nStudies in vitro have shown that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is an enzyme found in \n\ncorpus cavernosum smooth muscle, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, platelets, kidney, \n\nlung, and cerebellum. The effect of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other phosphodiesterases. \n\nTadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE1, PDE2, and PDE4 enzymes which are found \n\nin the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, and other organs. Tadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 \n\nthan for PDE3, an enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels.  \n\nThis selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3 is important because PDE3 is an enzyme involved in cardiac \n\ncontractility. Additionally, tadalafil is approximately 700-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE6, an \n\nenzyme which is found in the retina and is responsible for phototransduction. Tadalafil is also > 10,000-fold \n\nmore potent for PDE5 than for PDE7 through PDE10. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThree clinical studies were conducted in 1054 patients in an at-home setting to define the period of \n\nresponsiveness to tadalafil. Tadalafil demonstrated statistically significant improvement in erectile function \n\nand the ability to have successful sexual intercourse up to 36 hours following dosing, as well as patients’ \n\nability to attain and maintain erections for successful intercourse compared to placebo as early as 16 minutes \n\nfollowing dosing. \n\n \n\nTadalafil administered to healthy subjects produced no significant difference compared to placebo in supine \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg, respectively), in standing \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 0.2/4.6 mm Hg, respectively), and no \n\nsignificant change in heart rate. \n\n \n\nIn a study to assess the effects of tadalafil on vision, no impairment of colour discrimination (blue/green) \n\nwas detected using the Farnsworth Munsell 100 hue test. This finding is consistent with the low affinity of \n\ntadalafil for PDE6 compared to PDE5. Across all clinical studies, reports of changes in colour vision were \n\nrare (< 0.1%). \n\n \n\nThree studies were conducted in men to assess the potential effect on spermatogenesis of tadalafil 10 mg \n\n(one 6-month study) and 20 mg (one 6-month and one 9-month study) administered daily. In two of these \n\nstudies decreases were observed in sperm count and concentration related to tadalafil treatment of unlikely \n\n\n\n39 \n\nclinical relevance. These effects were not associated with changes in other parameters such as motility, \n\nmorphology and FSH. \n\n \n\nTadalafil at doses of 2 to 100 mg has been evaluated in 16 clinical studies involving 3250 patients, including \n\npatients with erectile dysfunction of various severities (mild, moderate, severe), etiologies, ages (range 21-86 \n\nyears), and ethnicities. Most patients reported erectile dysfunction of at least 1 year in duration. In the \n\nprimary efficacy studies of general populations, 81% of patients reported that tadalafil improved their \n\nerections as compared to 35% with placebo. Also, patients with erectile dysfunction in all severity categories \n\nreported improved erections whilst taking tadalafil (86%, 83% and 72% for mild, moderate, and severe, \n\nrespectively, as compared to 45%, 42% and 19% with placebo). In the primary efficacy studies, 75% of \n\nintercourse attempts were successful in tadalafil treated patients as compared to 32% with placebo. \n\n \n\nIn a 12-week study performed in 186 patients (142 tadalafil, 44 placebo) with erectile dysfunction secondary \n\nto spinal cord injury, tadalafil significantly improved the erectile function leading to a mean per-subject \n\nproportion of successful attempts in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg (flexible-dose, on demand) of \n\n48% as compared to 17% with placebo. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nA single study has been performed in paediatric patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in \n\nwhich no evidence of efficacy was seen. The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, 3-arm \n\nstudy of tadalafil was conducted in 331 boys aged 7-14 years with DMD receiving concurrent corticosteroid \n\ntherapy. The study included a 48-week double-blind period where patients were randomised to tadalafil \n\n0.3 mg/kg, tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg, or placebo daily. Tadalafil did not show efficacy in slowing the decline in \n\nambulation as measured by the primary 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) endpoint: least squares (LS) mean \n\nchange in 6MWD at 48 weeks was -51.0 meters (m) in the placebo group, compared with -64.7 m in the \n\ntadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (p = 0.307) and -59.1 m in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group (p = 0.538). In addition, \n\nthere was no evidence of efficacy from any of the secondary analyses performed in this study. The overall \n\nsafety results from this study were generally consistent with the known safety profile of tadalafil and with \n\nadverse events (AEs) expected in a paediatric DMD population receiving corticosteroids. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in all subsets of \n\nthe paediatric population in the treatment of the erectile dysfunction. See section 4.2 for information on \n\npaediatric use. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nTadalafil is readily absorbed after oral administration and the mean maximum observed plasma \n\nconcentration (Cmax) is achieved at a median time of 2 hours after dosing. Absolute bioavailability of tadalafil \n\nfollowing oral dosing has not been determined. \n\nThe rate and extent of absorption of tadalafil are not influenced by food, thus tadalafil may be taken with or \n\nwithout food. The time of dosing (morning versus evening) had no clinically relevant effects on the rate and \n\nextent of absorption. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe mean volume of distribution is approximately 63 l, indicating that tadalafil is distributed into tissues. At \n\ntherapeutic concentrations, 94% of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins. Protein binding is not affected by \n\nimpaired renal function. \n\nLess than 0.0005% of the administered dose appeared in the semen of healthy subjects. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nTadalafil is predominantly metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoform. The major circulating \n\nmetabolite is the methylcatechol glucuronide. This metabolite is at least 13,000-fold less potent than tadalafil \n\nfor PDE5. Consequently, it is not expected to be clinically active at observed metabolite concentrations. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe mean oral clearance for tadalafil is 2.5 l/h and the mean half-life is 17.5 hours in healthy subjects. \n\nTadalafil is excreted predominantly as inactive metabolites, mainly in the faeces (approximately 61% of the \n\ndose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 36% of the dose). \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nTadalafil pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects is linear with respect to time and dose. Over a dose range of \n\n2.5 to 20 mg, exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose. Steady-state plasma concentrations are \n\nattained within 5 days of once-daily dosing. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics determined with a population approach in patients with erectile dysfunction is similar to \n\npharmacokinetics in subjects without erectile dysfunction. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nHealthy elderly subjects (65 years or over), had a lower oral clearance of tadalafil, resulting in 25% higher \n\nexposure (AUC) relative to healthy subjects aged 19 to 45 years. This effect of age is not clinically \n\nsignificant and does not warrant a dose adjustment. \n\n \n\nRenal insufficiency \n\nIn clinical pharmacology studies using single-dose tadalafil (5 to 20 mg), tadalafil exposure (AUC) \n\napproximately doubled in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min) or moderate (creatinine \n\nclearance 31 to 50 ml/min) renal impairment and in subjects with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. In \n\nhaemodialysis patients, Cmax was 41% higher than that observed in healthy subjects. \n\nHaemodialysis contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination. \n\n \n\nHepatic insufficiency \n\nTadalafil exposure (AUC) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and \n\nB) is comparable to exposure in healthy subjects when a dose of 10 mg is administered. There is limited \n\nclinical data on the safety of tadalafil in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). If \n\ntadalafil is prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing \n\nphysician. There are no available data about the administration of doses higher than 10 mg of tadalafil to \n\npatients with hepatic impairment.  \n\n \n\nPatients with diabetes \n\nTadalafil exposure (AUC) in patients with diabetes was approximately 19% lower than the AUC value for \n\nhealthy subjects. This difference in exposure does not warrant a dose adjustment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, \n\nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction. \n\nThere was no evidence of teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or foetotoxicity in rats or mice that received up to \n\n1000 mg/kg/day tadalafil. In a rat prenatal and postnatal development study, the no observed effect dose was \n\n30 mg/kg/day. In the pregnant rat the AUC for calculated free drug at this dose was approximately 18 times \n\nthe human AUC at a 20 mg dose. \n\nThere was no impairment of fertility in male and female rats. In dogs given tadalafil daily for 6 to 12 months \n\nat doses of 25 mg/kg/day (resulting in at least a 3-fold greater exposure [range 3.7-–-18.6] than seen in \n\nhumans given a single 20 mg dose) and above, there was regression of the seminiferous tubular epithelium \n\nthat resulted in a decrease in spermatogenesis in some dogs.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Tadalafil Mylan is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan is a treatment for adult men with erectile dysfunction. This is when a man cannot get, or \n\nkeep a hard, erect penis suitable for sexual activity. Tadalafil has been shown to significantly improve the \n\nability of obtaining a hard erect penis suitable for sexual activity. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains the active substance tadalafil which belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nphosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Following sexual stimulation Tadalafil Mylan works by helping the \n\nblood vessels in your penis to relax, allowing the flow of blood into your penis. The result of this is \n\nimproved erectile function. Tadalafil Mylan will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction. \n\n \n\nIt is important to note that tadalafil does not work if there is no sexual stimulation. You and your partner will \n\nneed to engage in foreplay, just as you would if you were not taking a medicine for erectile dysfunction. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Tadalafil Mylan  \n\n \n\nDo not take Tadalafil Mylan \n\n- if you are allergic to tadalafil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n- if you are taking any form of organic nitrate or nitric oxide donors such as amyl nitrite. This is a group \n\nof medicines (“nitrates”) used in the treatment of angina pectoris (“chest pain”). Tadalafil has been \n\nshown to increase the effects of these medicines. If you are taking any form of nitrate or are unsure tell \n\nyour doctor. \n\n- if you have serious heart disease or recently had a heart attack within the last 90 days. \n\n- if you had a stroke within the last 6 months. \n\n- if you have low blood pressure or uncontrolled high blood pressure. \n\n- if you ever had loss of vision because of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a \n\ncondition described as “stroke of the eye”. \n\n- if you are taking riociguat. This drug is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., high blood \n\npressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high blood pressure \n\nin the lungs secondary to blood clots). PDE5 inhibitors, such as Tadalafil Mylan, have been shown to \n\n\n\n62 \n\nincrease the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If you are taking riociguat or are unsure tell your \n\ndoctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Tadalafil Mylan. \n\n \n\nBe aware that sexual activity carries a possible risk to patients with heart disease because it puts an extra \n\nstrain on your heart. If you have a heart problem you should tell your doctor. \n\n \n\nBefore taking the tablets, tell your doctor if you have: \n\n- sickle cell anaemia (an abnormality of red blood cells). \n\n- multiple myeloma (cancer of the bone marrow). \n\n- leukaemia (cancer of the blood cells). \n\n- any deformation of your penis. \n\n- a serious liver problem. \n\n- a severe kidney problem. \n\n \n\nIt is not known if tadalafil is effective in patients who have had: \n\n- pelvic surgery. \n\n- removal of all or part of the prostate gland in which nerves of the prostate are cut (radical non -nerve-\n\nsparing prostatectomy). \n\n \n\nIf you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision, stop taking Tadalafil Mylan and contact your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nDecreased or sudden hearing loss has been noted in some patients taking tadalafil. Although it is not known \n\nif the event is directly related to tadalafil, if you experience decreased or sudden hearing loss, stop taking \n\nTadalafil Mylan and contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan is not intended for use by women. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nTadalafil Mylan is not intended for use by children and adolescents under the age of 18. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Tadalafil Mylan \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n\n \n\nDo not take Tadalafil Mylan if you are already taking nitrates. \n\n \n\nSome medicines may be affected by Tadalafil Mylan or they may affect how well Tadalafil Mylan will work. \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are already taking: \n\n- an alpha blocker (used to treat high blood pressure or urinary symptoms associated with benign \n\nprostatic hyperplasia). \n\n- other medicines to treat high blood pressure. \n\n- riociguat. \n- a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia). \n\n- medicines such as ketoconazole tablets (to treat fungal infections) and protease inhibitors for treatment \n\nof AIDS or HIV infection. \n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine (anticonvulsant medicines). \n\n- rifampicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin or itraconazole. \n\n- other treatments for erectile dysfunction. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan with drink and alcohol \n\nGrapefruit juice may affect how well Tadalafil Mylan will work and should be taken with caution. Talk to \n\nyour doctor for further information. \n\n \n\n\n\n63 \n\nDrinking alcohol may temporarily lower your blood pressure. If you have taken or are planning to take \n\nTadalafil Mylan, avoid excessive drinking (blood alcohol level of 0.08% or greater), since this may increase \n\nthe risk of dizziness when standing up. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nWhen dogs were treated there was reduced sperm development in the testes. A reduction in sperm was seen \n\nin some men. These effects are unlikely to lead to a lack of fertility. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nSome men taking tadalafil in clinical studies have reported dizziness. Check carefully how you react to the \n\ntablets before driving or using machines. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains lactose \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before \n\ntaking this medicine. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Tadalafil Mylan \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \n\nare not sure. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is one 5 mg tablet taken once a day at approximately the same time of the day. Your \n\ndoctor may adjust the dose to 2.5 mg based on your response to Tadalafil Mylan. This will be given as a \n\n2.5 mg tablet. \n\nDo not take Tadalafil Mylan more than once a day. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan tablets are for oral use in men only. Swallow the tablet whole with some water. The tablets \n\ncan be taken with or without food. \n\n \n\nOnce a day dosing of Tadalafil Mylan may be useful to men who anticipate having sexual activity two or \n\nmore times per week. \n\n \n\nWhen taken once a day Tadalafil Mylan allows you to obtain an erection, when sexually stimulated, at any \n\ntime point during the 24 hours of the day. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Tadalafil Mylan than you should \n\nContact your doctor. You may experience side effects described in section 4. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Tadalafil Mylan \n\nTake your dose as soon as you remember but do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n\nYou should not take Tadalafil Mylan more than once a day. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. These effects are \n\nnormally mild to moderate in nature. \n\n \n\nIf you experience any of the following side effects stop using the medicine and seek medical help \n\nimmediately: \n\n- allergic reactions including rashes (frequency uncommon). \n\n\n\n64 \n\n-  chest pain - do not use nitrates but seek immediate medical assistance (frequency uncommon). \n\n- priapism, a prolonged and possibly painful erection after taking tadalafil (frequency rare). If you have \n\nsuch an erection, which lasts continuously for more than 4 hours you should contact a doctor \n\nimmediately. \n\n- sudden loss of vision (frequency rare). \n\n \n\nOther side effects have been reported: \n\n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n- headache, back pain, muscle aches, pain in arms and legs, facial flushing, nasal congestion and \n\nindigestion. \n\n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n- dizziness, stomach ache, feeling sick, being sick (vomiting), reflux, blurred vision, eye pain, difficulty \n\nin breathing, presence of blood in urine, prolonged erection, pounding heartbeat sensation, a fast heart \n\nrate, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, nose bleeds, ringing in the ears, swelling of the hands, \n\nfeet or ankles and feeling tired. \n\n \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\n- fainting, seizures and passing memory loss, swelling of the eyelids, red eyes, sudden decrease or loss \n\nof hearing, hives (itchy red welts on the surface of the skin), penile bleeding, presence of blood in \n\nsemen and increased sweating.  \n\n \n\nHeart attack and stroke have also been reported rarely in men taking tadalafil. Most of these men had known \n\nheart problems before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nPartial, temporary, or permanent decrease or loss of vision in one or both eyes has been rarely reported. \n\n \n\nSome additional rare side effects have been reported in men taking tadalafil that were not seen in clinical \n\ntrials. These include: \n\n- migraine, swelling of the face, serious allergic reaction which causes swelling of the face or throat, \n\nserious skin rashes, some disorders affecting blood flow to the eyes, irregular heartbeats, angina and \n\nsudden cardiac death. \n\n \n\nThe side effect dizziness has been reported more frequently in men over 75 years of age taking tadalafil. \n\nDiarrhoea has been reported more frequently in men over the age of 65 taking tadalafil. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Tadalafil Mylan is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains the active substance tadalafil which belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nphosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan is used to treat adult men with: \n\n- erectile dysfunction. This is when a man cannot get, or keep a hard, erect penis suitable for sexual \n\nactivity. Tadalafil has been shown to significantly improve the ability of obtaining a hard erect penis \n\nsuitable for sexual activity. Following sexual stimulation Tadalafil Mylan works by helping the blood \n\nvessels in your penis to relax, allowing the flow of blood into your penis. The result of this is \n\nimproved erectile function. Tadalafil Mylan will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction. \n\nIt is important to note that Tadalafil Mylan for the treatment of erectile dysfunction does not work if \n\nthere is no sexual stimulation. You and your partner will need to engage in foreplay, just as you would \n\nif you were not taking a medicine for erectile dysfunction. \n\n \n\n- urinary symptoms associated with a common condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia. This is \n\nwhen the prostate gland gets bigger with the age. Symptoms include difficulty in starting to pass \n\nwater, a feeling of not completely emptying the bladder and a more frequent need to pass water even at \n\nnight. Tadalafil improves blood flow to, and relaxes the muscles of, the prostate and bladder which \n\nmay reduce symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Tadalafil has been shown to improve these \n\nurinary symptoms as early as 1-2 weeks after starting treatment. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Tadalafil Mylan \n\n \n\nDo not take Tadalafil Mylan \n\n- if you are allergic to tadalafil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n- if you are taking any form of organic nitrate or nitric oxide donors such as amyl nitrite. This is a group \n\nof medicines (“nitrates”) used in the treatment of angina pectoris (“chest pain”). Tadalafil has been \n\nshown to increase the effects of these medicines. If you are taking any form of nitrate or are unsure tell \n\nyour doctor. \n\n- if you have serious heart disease or recently had a heart attack within the last 90 days. \n\n\n\n69 \n\n- if you had a stroke within the last 6 months. \n\n- if you have low blood pressure or uncontrolled high blood pressure. \n\n- if you ever had loss of vision because of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a \n\ncondition described as “stroke of the eye”. \n\n- if you are taking riociguat. This drug is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., high blood \n\npressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high blood pressure \n\nin the lungs secondary to blood clots). PDE5 inhibitors, such as Tadalafil Mylan, have been shown to \n\nincrease the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If you are taking riociguat or are unsure tell your \n\ndoctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Tadalafil Mylan. \n\n \n\nBe aware that sexual activity carries a possible risk to patients with heart disease because it puts an extra \n\nstrain on your heart. If you have a heart problem you should tell your doctor. \n\n \n\nSince benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer may have the same symptoms, your doctor will check \n\nyou for prostate cancer before starting treatment with tadalafil for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Tadalafil \n\ndoes not treat prostate cancer. \n\n \n\nBefore taking the tablets, tell your doctor if you have: \n\n- sickle cell anaemia (an abnormality of red blood cells). \n\n- multiple myeloma (cancer of the bone marrow). \n\n- leukaemia (cancer of the blood cells). \n\n- any deformation of your penis. \n\n- a serious liver problem. \n\n- a severe kidney problem. \n\n \n\nIt is not known if tadalafil is effective in patients who have had: \n\n- pelvic surgery. \n\n- removal of all or part of the prostate gland in which nerves of the prostate are cut (radical non nerve-\n\nsparing prostatectomy). \n\n \n\nIf you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision, stop taking Tadalafil Mylan and contact your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nDecreased or sudden hearing loss has been noted in some patients taking tadalafil. Although it is not known \n\nif the event is directly related to tadalafil, if you experience decreased or sudden hearing loss, stop taking \n\nTadalafil Mylan and contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan is not intended for use by women. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nTadalafil Mylan is not intended for use by children and adolescents under the age of 18. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Tadalafil Mylan \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n\n \n\nDo not take Tadalafil Mylan if you are already taking nitrates. \n\n \n\nSome medicines may be affected by Tadalafil Mylan or they may affect how well Tadalafil Mylan will work. \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are already taking: \n\n- an alpha blocker (used to treat high blood pressure or urinary symptoms associated with benign \n\nprostatic hyperplasia). \n\n- other medicines to treat high blood pressure. \n\n- riociguat. \n\n- a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia). \n\n\n\n70 \n\n- medicines such as ketoconazole tablets (to treat fungal infections) and protease inhibitors for treatment \n\nof AIDS or HIV infection. \n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine (anticonvulsant medicines). \n\n- rifampicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin or itraconazole. \n\n- other treatments for erectile dysfunction. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan with drink and alcohol \n\nGrapefruit juice may affect how well Tadalafil Mylan will work and should be taken with caution. Talk to \n\nyour doctor for further information. \n\n \n\nDrinking alcohol may temporarily lower your blood pressure. If you have taken or are planning to take \n\nTadalafil Mylan, avoid excessive drinking (blood alcohol level of 0.08% or greater), since this may increase \n\nthe risk of dizziness when standing up. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nWhen dogs were treated there was reduced sperm development in the testes. A reduction in sperm was seen \n\nin some men. These effects are unlikely to lead to a lack of fertility. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nSome men taking tadalafil in clinical studies have reported dizziness. Check carefully how you react to the \n\ntablets before driving or using machines. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains lactose \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before \n\ntaking this medicine. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Tadalafil Mylan \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \n\nare not sure.  \n\n \n\nFor the treatment of erectile dysfunction \n\nThe recommended dose is one 5 mg tablet taken once a day at approximately the same time of the day. Your \n\ndoctor may adjust the dose to 2.5 mg based on your response to Tadalafil Mylan. This will be given as a \n\n2.5 mg tablet. \n\nDo not take Tadalafil Mylan more than once a day. \n\n \n\nWhen taken once a day Tadalafil Mylan allows you to obtain an erection, when sexually stimulated, at any \n\ntime point during the 24 hours of the day. Once a day dosing of Tadalafil Mylan may be useful to men who \n\nanticipate having sexual activity two or more times per week. \n\n \n\nFor the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia \n\nThe dose is one 5 mg tablet taken once a day at approximately the same time of the day. \n\nIf you have benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction, the dose remains one 5 mg tablet taken \n\nonce a day. \n\nDo not take Tadalafil Mylan more than once a day. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan tablets are for oral use in men only. Swallow the tablet whole with some water. The tablets \n\ncan be taken with or without food. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Tadalafil Mylan than you should \n\nContact your doctor. You may experience side effects described in section 4. \n\n \n\n\n\n71 \n\nIf you forget to take Tadalafil Mylan \n\nTake your dose as soon as you remember but do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n\nYou should not take Tadalafil Mylan more than once a day. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. These effects are \n\nnormally mild to moderate in nature. \n\n \n\nIf you experience any of the following side effects stop using the medicine and seek medical help \n\nimmediately: \n\n- allergic reactions including rashes (frequency uncommon). \n\n-  chest pain - do not use nitrates but seek immediate medical assistance (frequency uncommon). \n\n- priapism, a prolonged and possibly painful erection after taking tadalafil (frequency rare). If you have \n\nsuch an erection, which lasts continuously for more than 4 hours you should contact a doctor \n\nimmediately. \n\n- sudden loss of vision (frequency rare). \n\n \n\nOther side effects have been reported: \n\n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n- headache, back pain, muscle aches, pain in arms and legs, facial flushing, nasal congestion, and \n\nindigestion. \n\n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n- dizziness, stomach ache, feeling sick, being sick (vomiting), reflux, blurred vision, eye pain, difficulty \n\nin breathing, presence of blood in urine, prolonged erection, pounding heartbeat sensation, a fast heart \n\nrate, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, nose bleeds, ringing in the ears, swelling of the hands, \n\nfeet or ankles and feeling tired. \n\n \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\n- fainting, seizures and passing memory loss, swelling of the eyelids, red eyes, sudden decrease or loss \n\nof hearing and hives (itchy red welts on the surface of the skin), penile bleeding, presence of blood in \n\nthe semen and increased sweating.  \n\n \n\nHeart attack and stroke have also been reported rarely in men taking tadalafil. Most of these men had known \n\nheart problems before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nPartial, temporary, or permanent decrease or loss of vision in one or both eyes has been rarely reported. \n\n \n\nSome additional rare side effects have been reported in men taking tadalafil that were not seen in clinical \n\ntrials. These include: \n\n- migraine, swelling of the face, serious allergic reaction which causes swelling of the face or throat, \n\nserious skin rashes, some disorders affecting blood flow to the eyes, irregular heartbeats, angina and \n\nsudden cardiac death. \n\n \n\nThe side effect dizziness has been reported more frequently in men over 75 years of age taking tadalafil. \n\nDiarrhoea has been reported more frequently in men over 65 years of age taking tadalafil. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Tadalafil Mylan is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan is a treatment for adult men with erectile dysfunction. This is when a man cannot get, or \n\nkeep a hard, erect penis suitable for sexual activity. Tadalafil has been shown to significantly improve the \n\nability of obtaining a hard erect penis suitable for sexual activity. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains the active substance tadalafil which belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nphosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Following sexual stimulation Tadalafil Mylan works by helping the \n\nblood vessels in your penis to relax, allowing the flow of blood into your penis. The result of this is \n\nimproved erectile function. Tadalafil Mylan will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction. \n\n \n\nIt is important to note that tadalafil does not work if there is no sexual stimulation. You and your partner will \n\nneed to engage in foreplay, just as you would if you were not taking a medicine for erectile dysfunction. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Tadalafil Mylan \n\n \n\nDo not take Tadalafil Mylan \n\n- if you are allergic to tadalafil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n- if you are taking any form of organic nitrate or nitric oxide donors such as amyl nitrite. This is a group \n\nof medicines (“nitrates”) used in the treatment of angina pectoris (“chest pain”). Tadalafil has been \n\nshown to increase the effects of these medicines. If you are taking any form of nitrate or are unsure tell \n\nyour doctor. \n\n- if you have serious heart disease or recently had a heart attack within the last 90 days. \n\n- if you had a stroke within the last 6 months. \n\n- if you have low blood pressure or uncontrolled high blood pressure. \n\n- if you ever had loss of vision because of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a \n\ncondition described as “stroke of the eye”. \n\n- if you are taking riociguat. This drug is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., high blood \n\npressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high blood pressure \n\nin the lungs secondary to blood clots). PDE5 inhibitors, such as Tadalafil Mylan, have been shown to \n\n\n\n76 \n\nincrease the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If you are taking riociguat or are unsure tell your \n\ndoctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Tadalafil Mylan. \n\n \n\nBe aware that sexual activity carries a possible risk to patients with heart disease because it puts an extra \n\nstrain on your heart. If you have a heart problem you should tell your doctor. \n\n \n\nBefore taking the tablets, tell your doctor if you have: \n\n- sickle cell anaemia (an abnormality of red blood cells). \n\n- multiple myeloma (cancer of the bone marrow). \n\n- leukaemia (cancer of the blood cells). \n\n- any deformation of your penis. \n\n- a serious liver problem. \n\n- a severe kidney problem. \n\n \n\nIt is not known if tadalafil is effective in patients who have had: \n\n- pelvic surgery. \n\n- removal of all or part of the prostate gland in which nerves of the prostate are cut (radical non nerve-\n\nsparing prostatectomy). \n\n \n\nIf you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision, stop taking Tadalafil Mylan and contact your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nDecreased or sudden hearing loss has been noted in some patients taking tadalafil. Although it is not known \n\nif the event is directly related to tadalafil, if you experience decreased or sudden hearing loss, stop taking \n\nTadalafil Mylan and contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan is not intended for use by women. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nTadalafil Mylan is not intended for use by children and adolescents under the age of 18. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Tadalafil Mylan \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n\n \n\nDo not take Tadalafil Mylan if you are already taking nitrates. \n\n \n\nSome medicines may be affected by Tadalafil Mylan or they may affect how well Tadalafil Mylan will work. \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are already taking: \n\n- an alpha blocker (used to treat high blood pressure or urinary symptoms associated with benign \n\nprostatic hyperplasia). \n\n- other medicines to treat high blood pressure. \n\n- riociguat. \n\n- a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia). \n\n- medicines such as ketoconazole tablets (to treat fungal infections) and protease inhibitors for treatment \n\nof AIDS or HIV infection. \n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine (anticonvulsant medicines). \n\n- rifampicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin or itraconazole. \n\n- other treatments for erectile dysfunction. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan with drink and alcohol \n\nGrapefruit juice may affect how well Tadalafil Mylan will work and should be taken with caution. Talk to \n\nyour doctor for further information. \n\n \n\n\n\n77 \n\nDrinking alcohol may temporarily lower your blood pressure. If you have taken or are planning to take \n\nTadalafil Mylan, avoid excessive drinking (blood alcohol level of 0.08% or greater), since this may increase \n\nthe risk of dizziness when standing up. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nWhen dogs were treated there was reduced sperm development in the testes. A reduction in sperm was seen \n\nin some men. These effects are unlikely to lead to a lack of fertility. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nSome men taking tadalafil in clinical studies have reported dizziness. Check carefully how you react to the \n\ntablets before driving or using machines. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains lactose \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before \n\ntaking this medicine. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n3. How to take Tadalafil Mylan \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \n\nare not sure.  \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose is one 10 mg tablet before sexual activity. If the effect of this dose is too \n\nweak your doctor may increase the dose to 20 mg. Tadalafil Mylan is for oral use. \n\n \n\nYou may take tadalafil at least 30 minutes before sexual activity. \n\nTadalafil may still be effective up to 36 hours after taking the tablet. \n\n \n\nDo not take Tadalafil Mylan more than once a day. Tadalafil Mylan 10 mg and 20 mg is intended for use \n\nprior to anticipated sexual activity and is not recommended for continuous daily use. \n\n \n\nTadalafil Mylan tablets are for oral use in men only. Swallow the tablet whole with some water. The tablets \n\ncan be taken with or without food. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Tadalafil Mylan than you should \n\nContact your doctor. You may experience side effects described in section 4. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. These effects are \n\nnormally mild to moderate in nature. \n\n \n\nIf you experience any of the following side effects stop using the medicine and seek medical help \n\nimmediately: \n\n- allergic reactions including rashes (frequency uncommon). \n\n-  chest pain - do not use nitrates but seek immediate medical assistance (frequency uncommon). \n\n- priapism, a prolonged and possibly painful erection after taking tadalafil (frequency rare).
