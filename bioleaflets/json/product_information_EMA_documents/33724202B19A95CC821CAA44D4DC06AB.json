NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nApixaban Accord 2.5 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 2.5 mg apixaban. \n \nExcipients with known effect \nEach 2.5 mg film-coated tablet contains 51.97  mg lactose (see section 4.4). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet) \nYellow, round shaped, approximate 6.00 mm in diameter, biconvex, film-coated tablet debossed with \n“IU1” on one side and plain on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who have undergone elective hip \nor knee replacement surgery. \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \n(NVAF), with one or more risk factors, such as prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA); age \n≥ 75 years; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II). \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults (see section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPrevention of VTE (VTEp): elective hip or knee replacement surgery \nThe recommended dose of apixaban is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily. The initial dose should be \ntaken 12 to 24 hours after surgery. \n \nPhysicians may consider the potential benefits of earlier anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis as well \nas the risks of post-surgical bleeding in deciding on the time of administration within this time \nwindow. \n \nIn patients undergoing hip replacement surgery \nThe recommended duration of treatment is 32 to 38 days. \n \nIn patients undergoing knee replacement surgery \nThe recommended duration of treatment is 10 to 14 days. \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) \nThe recommended dose of apixaban is 5 mg taken orally twice daily. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDose reduction \nThe recommended dose of apixaban is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily in patients with NVAF and at \nleast two of the following characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine \n≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L). \n \nTherapy should be continued long-term. \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) \nThe recommended dose of apixaban for the treatment of acute DVT and treatment of PE is 10 mg \ntaken orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg taken orally twice daily. As per available \nmedical guidelines, short duration of treatment (at least 3 months) should be based on transient risk \nfactors (e.g., recent surgery, trauma, immobilisation). \n \nThe recommended dose of apixaban for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is 2.5 mg taken orally \ntwice daily. When prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated, the 2.5 mg twice daily dose \nshould be initiated following completion of 6 months of treatment with apixaban 5 mg twice daily or \nwith another anticoagulant, as indicated in Table 1 below (see also section 5.1). \n \nTable 1: \n Dosing schedule Maximum daily dose \n\nTreatment of DVT or PE 10 mg twice daily for the first 7 days  20 mg \n\nfollowed by 5 mg twice daily  10 mg \n\nPrevention of recurrent DVT \nand/or PE following completion of \n6 months of treatment for DVT or \nPE \n\n2.5 mg twice daily \n \n\n5 mg \n\n \nThe duration of overall therapy should be individualised after careful assessment of the treatment \nbenefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4). \n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose is missed, the patient should take Apixaban Accordimmediately and then continue with twice \ndaily intake as before. \n \nSwitching \nSwitching treatment from parenteral anticoagulants to Apixaban Accord(and vice versa) can be done \nat the next scheduled dose (see section 4.5). These medicinal products should not be administered \nsimultaneously. \n \nSwitching from vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy to Apixaban AccordWhen converting patients \nfrom vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy toApixaban Accord, warfarin or other VKA therapy \nshould be discontinued and Apixaban Accord started when the international normalised ratio (INR) is \n< 2. \n \nSwitching from Apixaban Accord to VKA therapy \nWhen converting patients from Apixaban Accord to VKA therapy, administration of Apixaban Accord \nshould be continued for at least 2 days after beginning VKA therapy. After 2 days of coadministration \nof Apixaban Accord with VKA therapy, an INR should be obtained prior to the next scheduled dose of \nApixaban Accord. Coadministration of Apixaban Accordand VKA therapy should be continued until \nthe INR is ≥ 2. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, the following recommendations apply: \n \n- for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery (VTEp), for the treatment of \nDVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt), no dose adjustment is \nnecessary (see section 5.2). \n \n- for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and serum creatinine \n≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L) associated with age ≥ 80 years or body weight ≤ 60 kg, a dose \nreduction is necessary and described above. In the absence of other criteria for dose reduction (age, \nbody weight), no dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). \n \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) the following \nrecommendations apply (see sections 4.4 and 5.2): \n \n- for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery (VTEp), for the treatment of \nDVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) apixaban is to be used with \ncaution; \n \n-  for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, patients should receive \n\nthe lower dose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. \n \nIn patients with creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min, or in patients undergoing dialysis, there is no \nclinical experience therefore apixaban is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nApixaban Accordis contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). \n \nIt is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4. and 5.2). \n \nIt should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or \nB). No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with elevated liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase \n(AST) >2 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN were excluded in clinical trials. Therefore Apixaban \nAccordshould be used with caution in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Prior to \ninitiatingApixaban Accord, liver function testing should be performed. \n \nBody weight \nVTEp and VTEt - No dose adjustment required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nNVAF - No dose adjustment required, unless criteria for dose reduction are met (see Dose reduction at \nthe beginning of section 4.2). \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment required (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly \nVTEp and VTEt – No dose adjustment required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nNVAF – No dose adjustment required, unless criteria for dose reduction are met (see Dose reduction \nat the beginning of section 4.2). \n \nPatients undergoing catheter ablation (NVAF) \nPatients can continue apixaban use while undergoing catheter ablation (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nApixaban can be initiated or continued in NVAF patients who may require cardioversion.  \n \nFor patients not previously treated with anticoagulants, exclusion of left atrial thrombus using an \nimage guided approach (e.g. transesophageal  echocardiography (TEE) or computed tomographic scan \n(CT)) prior to cardioversion should be considered, in accordance with established medical guidelines. \n\nFor patients initiating treatment with apixaban, 5 mg should be given twice daily for at least 2.5 days \n(5 single doses) before cardioversion to ensure adequate anticoagulation (see section 5.1). The dosing \nregimen should be reduced to 2.5 mg apixaban given twice daily for at least 2.5 days (5 single doses) \nif the patient meets the criteria for dose reduction (see above sections Dose reduction and Renal \nimpairment). \n \nIf cardioversion is required before 5 doses of apixaban can be administered, a 10 mg loading dose \nshould be given, followed by 5 mg twice daily. The dosing regimen should be reduced to a 5 mg \nloading dose followed by 2.5 mg twice daily if the patient meets the criteria for dose reduction (see \nabove sections Dose reduction and Renal impairment). The administration of the loading dose should \nbe given at least 2 hours before cardioversion (see section 5.1). \n \nFor all patients undergoing cardioversion, confirmation should be sought prior to cardioversion that \nthe patient has taken apixaban as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and duration of treatment should \ntake established guideline recommendations for anticoagulant treatment in patients undergoing \ncardioversion into account. \n \nPatients with NVAF and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention \n(PCI) \nThere is limited experience of treatment with apixaban at the recommended dose for NVAF \npatientswhen used in combination with antiplatelet agents in patients with ACS and/or undergoing PCI \nafterhaemostasis is achieved (see sections 4.4, 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Apixaban Accordin children and adolescents below age 18 have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use \nApixaban Accordshould be swallowed with water, with or without food. \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Apixaban Accordtablets may be crushed and \nsuspended in water, or 5% glucose  in water (G5W), or apple juice or mixed with apple puree and \nimmediately administered orally (see section 5.2). Alternatively, Apixaban Accordtablets may be \ncrushed and suspended in 60 mL of water or G5W and immediately delivered through a nasogastric \ntube (see section 5.2).  \n Crushed Apixaban Accord tablets are stable in water, G5W, apple juice, and apple puree for up to \n4 hours. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n• Active clinically significant bleeding. \n• Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n• Lesion or condition if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This may include \n\ncurrent or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of \nbleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent \n\n\n\n6 \n\nintracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular \nabnormalities. \n\n• Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulant agent e.g., unfractionated heparin (UFH), \nlow molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives \n(fondaparinux, etc.), oral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, etc.) except under \nspecific circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2), or when UFH is \ngiven at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH \nis given during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHaemorrhage risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Apixaban Accordare to be carefully observed for signs of \nbleeding. It is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. \nApixaban Accordadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see sections 4.8 \nand 4.9). \n \nAlthough treatment with apixaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, a calibrated \nquantitative anti-Factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional situations where knowledge of \napixaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g., overdose and emergency surgery (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nAn agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available. \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nDue to an increased bleeding risk, concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nThe concomitant use of Apixaban Accordwith antiplatelet agents increases the risk of bleeding (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \n(SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs), including acetylsalicylic acid. \n \nFollowing surgery, other platelet aggregation inhibitors are not recommended concomitantly with \nApixaban Accord(see section 4.5). \n \nIn patients with atrial fibrillation and conditions that warrant mono or dual antiplatelet therapy, a \ncareful assessment of the potential benefits against the potential risks should be made before \ncombining this therapy withApixaban Accord. \n \nIn a clinical trial of patients with atrial fibrillation, concomitant use of  acetylsalicylic acid (ASA ) \nincreased the major bleeding risk on apixaban from 1.8% per year to 3.4% per year and increased the \nbleeding risk on warfarin from 2.7% per year to 4.6% per year. In this clinical trial, there was limited \n(2.1%) use of concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy(see section 5.1). \n \nA clinical trial enrolled patients with atrial fibrillation with ACS and/or undergoing PCI and a \nplannedtreatment period with a P2Y12 inhibitor, with or without ASA, and oral anticoagulant (either \napixabanor VKA) for 6 months. Concomitant use of ASA increased the risk of ISTH (International \nSociety onThrombosis and Hemostasis) major or CRNM (Clinically Relevant Non-Major) bleeding in \napixaban-treatedsubjects from 16.4% per year to 33.1% per year (see section 5.1). \n \nIn a clinical trial of high-risk post acute coronary syndrome patientswithout atrial \nfibrillationcharacterised by multiple cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities, who received ASA or the \ncombination of ASA and clopidogrel, a significant increase in risk of ISTH (International Society on \n\n\n\n7 \n\nThrombosis and Haemostasis) major bleeding was reported for apixaban (5.13% per year) compared \nto placebo (2.04% per year). \n \nUse of thrombolytic agents for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke \nThere is very limited experience with the use of thrombolytic agents for the treatment of acute \nischemic stroke in patients administered apixaban(see section 4.5). \n \nPatients with prosthetic heart valves \nSafety and efficacy of Apixaban Accordhave not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves, \nwith or without atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the use of Apixaban Accordis not recommended in this \nsetting. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including apixaban are not recommended for patients with \na history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for patients \nthat are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein \nI antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic \nevents compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nSurgery and invasive procedures \nApixaban Accordshould be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive \nprocedures with a moderate or high risk of bleeding. This includes interventions for which the \nprobability of clinically significant bleeding cannot be excluded or for which the risk of bleeding \nwould be unacceptable. \n \nApixaban Accordshould be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive \nprocedures with a low risk of bleeding. This includes interventions for which any bleeding that occurs \nis expected to be minimal, non-critical in its location or easily controlled. \n \nIf surgery or invasive procedures cannot be delayed, appropriate caution should be exercised, taking \ninto consideration an increased risk of bleeding. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the \nurgency of intervention. \n \nApixaban Accordshould be restarted after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention as soon as \npossible provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established (for \ncardioversion see section 4.2). \n \nFor patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, Apixaban Accordtreatment does not \nneed to be interrupted (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nTemporary discontinuation \nDiscontinuing anticoagulants, includingApixaban Accord, for active bleeding, elective surgery, or \ninvasive procedures places patients at an increased risk of thrombosis. Lapses in therapy should be \navoided and if anticoagulation with Apixaban Accord must be temporarily discontinued for any \nreason, therapy should be restarted as soon as possible. \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal \ncatheters must be removed at least 5 hours prior to the first dose ofApixaban Accord. The risk may \nalso be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g., numbness or weakness of the \nlegs, bowel or bladder dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and \ntreatment is necessary. Prior to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential \n\n\n\n8 \n\nbenefit versus the risk in anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for \nthromboprophylaxis. \n \nThere is no clinical experience with the use of apixaban with indwelling intrathecal or epidural \ncatheters. In case there is such need and based on the general PK characteristics of apixaban, a time \ninterval of 20-30 hours (i.e., 2 x half-life) between the last dose of apixaban and catheter withdrawal \nshould elapse, and at least one dose should be omitted before catheter withdrawal. The next dose of \napixaban may be given at least 5 hours after catheter removal. As with all new anticoagulant medicinal \nproducts, experience with neuraxial blockade is limited and extreme caution is therefore recommended \nwhen using apixaban in the presence of neuraxial blockade. \n \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \nApixaban Accordis not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with \npulmonary embolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of apixaban have not been established in these clinical \nsituations. \n \nPatients with active cancer \nEfficacy and safety of apixaban in the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE (VTEt) in patients with active cancer have not been established. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nLimited clinical data indicate that apixaban plasma concentrations are increased in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nFor the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery (VTEp), the treatment of DVT, \ntreatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt), apixaban is to be used with caution \nin patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) (see sections 4.2 and \n5.2). \n \nFor the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, patients with severe renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min), and patients with serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL \n(133 micromole/L) associated with age ≥ 80 years or body weight ≤ 60 kg should receive the lower \ndose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily (see section 4.2). \n \nIn patients with creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min, or in patients undergoing dialysis, there is no \nclinical experience therefore apixaban is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nElderly patients \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nAlso, the coadministration of Apixaban Accordwith  ASA in elderly patients should be used cautiously \nbecause of a potentially higher bleeding risk. \n \nBody weight \nLow body weight (< 60 kg) may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nApixaban Accordis contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). \n \nIt is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nIt should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or \nB) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nPatients with elevated liver enzymes ALT/AST > 2 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN were \nexcluded in clinical trials. Therefore Apixaban Accordshould be used cautiously in this population \n(see section 5.2). Prior to initiating Apixaban Accord, liver function testing should be performed. \n \nInteraction with inhibitors of both cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) \nThe use of Apixaban Accordis not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment \nwith strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, \nitraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir). These \nmedicinal products may increase apixaban exposure by 2-fold (see section 4.5), or greater in the \npresence of additional factors that increase apixaban exposure (e.g., severe renal impairment). \n \nInteraction with inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp \nThe concomitant use of Apixaban Accordwith strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampicin, \nphenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may lead to a ~50% reduction in \napixaban exposure. In a clinical study in atrial fibrillation patients, diminished efficacy and a higher \nrisk of bleeding were observed with coadministration of apixaban with strong inducers of both \nCYP3A4 and P-gp compared with using apixaban alone. \n \nIn patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp \nthe following recommendations apply (see section 4.5): \n \nA. - for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery, for the prevention of stroke \nand systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, \napixaban should be used with caution; \n \nB. - for the treatment of DVT and treatment of PE, apixaban should not be used since efficacy may be \ncompromised. \n \nHip fracture surgery \nApixaban has not been studied in clinical trials in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery to evaluate \nefficacy and safety in these patients. Therefore, it is not recommended in these patients. \n \nLaboratory parameters \nClotting tests [e.g., prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)] are \naffected as expected by the mechanism of action of apixaban. Changes observed in these clotting tests \nat the expected therapeutic dose are small and subject to a high degree of variability (see section 5.1). \n \nInformation about excipients \nApixaban Accordcontains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’ \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp \nCoadministration of apixaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day), a strong inhibitor of both \nCYP3A4 and P-gp, led to a 2-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in mean \napixaban Cmax. \n \nThe use of Apixaban Accordis not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment \nwith strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, \nitraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nActive substances which are not considered strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, (eg., \namiodarone, clarithromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, naproxen, quinidine, verapamil) are expected to \nincrease apixaban plasma concentration to a lesser extent. No dose adjustment for apixaban is required \nwhen coadministered with agents that are not strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. For \nexample, diltiazem (360 mg once a day), considered a moderate CYP3A4 and a weak P-gp inhibitor, \nled to a 1.4-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.3-fold increase in Cmax. Naproxen (500 mg, \nsingle dose) an inhibitor of P-gp but not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold \nincrease in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. Clarithromycin (500 mg, twice a day), an \ninhibitor of P-gp and a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.6-fold and 1.3-fold increase in mean \napixaban AUC and Cmax respectively. \n \nInducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp \nCoadministration of apixaban with rifampicin, a strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, led to an \napproximate 54% and 42% decrease in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. The concomitant \nuse of apixaban with other strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may also lead to reduced apixaban plasma concentrations. No dose \nadjustment for apixaban is required during concomitant therapy with such medicinal products, \nhowever in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 \nand P-gp apixaban should be used with caution for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee \nreplacement surgery, for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and \nfor the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE. \n \nApixaban is not recommended for the treatment of DVT and PE in patients receiving concomitant \nsystemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp since efficacy may be \ncompromised (see section 4.4). \n \nAnticoagulants, platelet aggregation inhibitors, SSRIs/SNRIs and NSAIDs \nDue to an increased bleeding risk, concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants is \ncontraindicated except under specific circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy, when UFH is \ngiven at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given \nduring catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.3). \n \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with apixaban (5 mg single dose), \nan additive effect on anti-Factor Xa activity was observed. \n \nPharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were not evident when apixaban was \ncoadministered with ASA 325 mg once a day. \n \nApixaban coadministered with clopidogrel (75 mg once a day) or with the combination of clopidogrel \n75 mg and ASA 162 mg once daily, or with prasugrel (60 mg followed by 10 mg once daily) in \nPhase I studies did not show a relevant increase in template bleeding time, or further inhibition of \nplatelet aggregation, compared to administration of the antiplatelet agents without apixaban. Increases \nin clotting tests (PT, INR, and aPTT) were consistent with the effects of apixaban alone. \n \nNaproxen (500 mg), an inhibitor of P-gp, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold increase in mean apixaban \nAUC and Cmax, respectively. Corresponding increases in clotting tests were observed for apixaban. No \nchanges were observed in the effect of naproxen on arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and \nno clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \napixaban and naproxen. \n \n \nDespite these findings, there may be individuals with a more pronounced pharmacodynamic response \nwhen antiplatelet agents are coadministered with apixaban. Apixaban Accord should be used with \ncaution when coadministered with SSRIs/SNRIs, NSAIDs, ASA and/or P2Y12 inhibitors because \nthese medicinal products typically increase the bleeding risk (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nThere is limited experience of co-administration  with other platelet aggregation inhibitors (such as \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, dipyridamole, dextran or sulfinpyrazone) or thrombolytic agents. As \nsuch agents increase the bleeding risk, co-administration of these medicinal products with Apixaban \nAccord is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nOther concomitant therapies \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \napixaban was coadministered with atenolol or famotidine. Coadministration of apixaban 10 mg with \natenolol 100 mg did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban. \nFollowing administration of the two medicinal products together, mean apixaban AUC and Cmax were \n15% and 18% lower than when administered alone. The administration of apixaban 10 mg with \nfamotidine 40 mg had no effect on apixaban AUC or Cmax. \n \nEffect of apixaban on other medicinal products \nIn vitro apixaban studies showed no inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, \nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 (IC50 > 45 µM) and weak inhibitory effect on the activity \nof CYP2C19 (IC50 > 20 µM) at concentrations that are significantly greater than peak plasma \nconcentrations observed in patients. Apixaban did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4/5 at a \nconcentration up to 20 µM. Therefore, apixaban is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of \ncoadministered medicinal products that are metabolised by these enzymes. Apixaban is not a \nsignificant inhibitor of P-gp. \n \nIn studies conducted in healthy subjects, as described below, apixaban did not meaningfully alter the \npharmacokinetics of digoxin, naproxen, or atenolol. \n \nDigoxin \nCoadministration of apixaban (20 mg once a day) and digoxin (0.25 mg once a day), a P-gp substrate, \ndid not affect digoxin AUC or Cmax. Therefore, apixaban does not inhibit P-gp mediated substrate \ntransport. \n \nNaproxen \nCoadministration of single doses of apixaban (10 mg) and naproxen (500 mg), a commonly used \nNSAID, did not have any effect on the naproxen AUC or Cmax. \n \nAtenolol \nCoadministration of a single dose of apixaban (10 mg) and atenolol (100 mg), a common beta-blocker, \ndid not alter the pharmacokinetics of atenolol. \n \nActivated charcoal \nAdministration of activated charcoal reduces apixaban exposure (see section 4.9). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of apixaban in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Apixaban is not recommended during \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether apixaban or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available data in \nanimals have shown excretion of apixaban in milk. In rat milk, a high milk to maternal plasma ratio \n(Cmax about 8, AUC about 30) was found, possibly due to active transport into the milk. A risk to \nnewborns and infants cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision must be made to either discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from apixaban \ntherapy. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nFertility \nStudies in animals dosed with apixaban have shown no effect on fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nApixaban Accordhas no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of apixaban has been investigated in 7 Phase III clinical studies including more than \n21,000 patients: more than 5,000 patients in VTEp studies, more than 11,000 patients in NVAF studies \nand more than 4,000 patients in the VTE treatment (VTEt) studies, for an average total exposure of \n20 days, 1.7 years and 221 days respectively (see section 5.1). \n \nCommon adverse reactions were haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis, and haematoma (see Table 2 for \nadverse reaction profile and frequencies by indication). \n \nIn the VTEp studies, in total, 11% of the patients treated with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily experienced \nadverse reactions. The overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was \n10% in the apixaban vs enoxaparin studies. \n \nIn the NVAF studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was \n24.3% in the apixaban vs warfarin study and 9.6% in the apixaban vs acetylsalicylic acid study. In the \napixaban vs warfarin study the incidence of ISTH major gastrointestinal bleeds (including upper GI, \nlower GI, and rectal bleeding) with apixaban was 0.76%/year. The incidence of ISTH major \nintraocular bleeding with apixaban was 0.18%/year. \n \nIn the VTEt studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was \n15.6% in the apixaban vs enoxaparin/warfarin study and 13.3% in the apixaban vs placebo study (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 2 shows the adverse reactions ranked under headings of system organ class and frequency using \nthe following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data) for VTEp, NVAF, and VTEt respectively. \n \nTable 2 \nSystem organ class Prevention of \n\nVTE in adult \npatients who \n\nhave undergone \nelective hip or \n\nknee replacement \nsurgery (VTEp) \n\nPrevention of \nstroke and \nsystemic \n\nembolism in \nadult patients \n\nwith NVAF, with \none or more risk \nfactors (NVAF) \n\nTreatment of DVT \nand PE, and \nprevention of \n\nrecurrent DVT and \nPE (VTEt) \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nAnaemia  Common Common Common \nThrombocytopenia  Uncommon Uncommon Common \nImmune system disorders \n\nHypersensitivity, allergic oedema and \nanaphylaxis  \n\nRare Uncommon Uncommon \n\nPruritus Uncommon Uncommon Uncommon* \nNervous system disorders \n\n\n\n13 \n\nSystem organ class Prevention of \nVTE in adult \npatients who \n\nhave undergone \nelective hip or \n\nknee replacement \nsurgery (VTEp) \n\nPrevention of \nstroke and \nsystemic \n\nembolism in \nadult patients \n\nwith NVAF, with \none or more risk \nfactors (NVAF) \n\nTreatment of DVT \nand PE, and \nprevention of \n\nrecurrent DVT and \nPE (VTEt) \n\nBrain haemorrhage† Not known Uncommon Rare \nEye disorders \n\nEye haemorrhage (including \nconjunctival haemorrhage) \n\nRare Common Uncommon \n\nVascular disorders \n\nHaemorrhage, haematoma Common Common Common \nHypotension (including procedural \nhypotension) \n\nUncommon Common Uncommon \n\nIntra-abdominal haemorrhage Not known Uncommon Not known \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nEpistaxis Uncommon Common Common \nHaemoptysis Rare Uncommon Uncommon \nRespiratory tract haemorrhage  Not known Rare Rare \nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nNausea Common Common Common \nGastrointestinal haemorrhage Uncommon Common Common \nHaemorrhoidal haemorrhage Not known Uncommon Uncommon \nMouth haemorrhage Not known Uncommon Common \nHaematochezia Uncommon Uncommon Uncommon \nRectal haemorrhage, gingival \nbleeding \n\nRare Common Common \n\nRetroperitoneal haemorrhage Not known Rare Not known \nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nLiver function test abnormal, asparate \naminotransferase increased, blood \nalkaline phosphatase increased, blood \nbilirubin increased \n\nUncommon Uncommon Uncommon \n\nGamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased \n\nUncommon Common Common \n\nAlanine aminotransferase increased Uncommon Uncommon Common \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nSkin rash Not known Uncommon Common \nAlopecia Rare Uncommon Uncommon \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nMuscle haemorrhage Rare Rare Uncommon \nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nHaematuria Uncommon Common Common \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\nAbnormal vaginal haemorrhage, \nurogenital haemorrhage \n\nUncommon Uncommon Common \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nApplication site bleeding Not known Uncommon Uncommon \nInvestigations \n\n\n\n14 \n\nSystem organ class Prevention of \nVTE in adult \npatients who \n\nhave undergone \nelective hip or \n\nknee replacement \nsurgery (VTEp) \n\nPrevention of \nstroke and \nsystemic \n\nembolism in \nadult patients \n\nwith NVAF, with \none or more risk \nfactors (NVAF) \n\nTreatment of DVT \nand PE, and \nprevention of \n\nrecurrent DVT and \nPE (VTEt) \n\nOccult blood positive Not known Uncommon Uncommon \nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \n\nContusion Common Common Common \n\nPost procedural haemorrhage \n(including post procedural \nhaematoma, wound haemorrhage, \nvessel puncture site haematoma and \ncatheter site haemorrhage), wound \nsecretion, incision site haemorrhage \n(including incision site haematoma), \noperative haemorrhage \n\nUncommon Uncommon Uncommon \n\nTraumatic haemorrhage Not known Uncommon Uncommon \n* There were no occurrences of generalised pruritus in CV185057 (long term prevention of VTE)  \n†\n\n The term “Brain haemorrhage” encompasses all intracranial or intraspinal haemorrhages (ie., haemorrhagic stroke or \nputamen, cerebellar, intraventricular, or subdural haemorrhages). \n \nThe use of Apixaban Accordmay be associated with an increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from \nany tissue or organ, which may result in posthaemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and \nseverity will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose of apixaban may result in a higher risk of bleeding. In the event of haemorrhagic \ncomplications, treatment must be discontinued and the source of bleeding investigated. The initiation \nof appropriate treatment, e.g., surgical haemostasis,  or the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or the \nadministration of a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors should be considered. \n \nIn controlled clinical trials, orally-administered apixaban in healthy subjects at doses up to 50 mg daily \nfor 3 to 7 days (25 mg twice daily (bid) for 7 days or 50 mg once daily (od) for 3 days) had no \nclinically relevant adverseevents. \n \nIn healthy subjects, administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20 mg dose \nof apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively, and had no impact on Cmax. \nMean half-life of apixaban decreased from 13.4 hours when apixaban was administered alone to \n5.3 hours and 4.9 hours, respectively, when activated charcoal was administered 2 and 6 hours after \napixaban. Thus, administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of apixaban \noverdose or accidental ingestion. \n \nFor situations when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled \nbleeding, a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors is available (see section 4.4). Administration of \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n\nprothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) or recombinant factor VIIa may be considered. Reversal of \nApixaban Accordpharmacodynamic effects, as demonstrated by changes in the thrombin generation \nassay, was evident at the end of infusion and reached baseline values within 4 hours after the start of a \n4-factor PCC 30 minute infusion in healthy subjects. However, there is no clinical experience with the \nuse of 4-factor PCC medicinal products to reverse bleeding in individuals who have received Apixaban \nAccord. Currently there is no experience with the use of recombinant factor VIIa in individuals \nreceiving apixaban. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa could be considered and titrated depending \non improvement of bleeding. \n \nDepending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of \nmajor bleedings. \n \nHaemodialysis decreased apixaban AUC by 14% in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), \nwhen a single dose of apixaban 5 mg was administered orally. Therefore, haemodialysis is unlikely to \nbe an effective means of managing apixaban overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF02 \n \nMechanism of action \nApixaban is a potent, oral, reversible, direct and highly selective active site inhibitor of factor Xa. It \ndoes not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound \nfactor Xa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effects on platelet aggregation, but \nindirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting factor Xa, apixaban \nprevents thrombin generation and thrombus development. Preclinical studies of apixaban in animal \nmodels have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy in the prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis \nat doses that preserved haemostasis. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe pharmacodynamic effects of apixaban are reflective of the mechanism of action (FXa inhibition). \nAs a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR and \nactivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected \ntherapeutic dose are small and subject to a high degree of variability. They are not recommended to \nassess the pharmacodynamic effects of apixaban. In the thrombin generation assay, apixaban reduced \nendogenous thrombin potential, a measure of thrombin generation in human plasma. \n \nApixaban also demonstrates anti-FXa activity as evident by reduction in Factor Xa enzyme activity in \nmultiple commercial anti-FXa kits, however results differ across kits. Data from clinical trials are only \navailable for the Rotachrom® Heparin chromogenic assay. Anti-FXa activity exhibits a close direct \nlinear relationship with apixaban plasma concentration, reaching maximum values at the time of \napixaban peak plasma concentrations. The relationship between apixaban plasma concentration and \nanti-FXa activity is approximately linear over a wide dose range of apixaban. \n \nTable 3 below shows the predicted steady state exposure and anti-Factor Xa activity for each \nindication.

A \ntotal of 8,464 patients were randomised in two pivotal, double-blind, multi-national studies, comparing \napixaban 2.5 mg given orally twice daily (4,236 patients) or enoxaparin 40 mg once daily \n(4,228 patients). Included in this total were 1,262 patients (618 in the apixaban group) of age 75 or \nolder, 1,004 patients (499 in the apixaban group) with low body weight (≤ 60 kg), 1,495 patients \n(743 in the apixaban group) with BMI ≥ 33 kg/m2, and 415 patients (203 in the apixaban group) with \nmoderate renal impairment. \n \nThe ADVANCE-3 study included 5,407 patients undergoing elective hip replacement, and the \nADVANCE-2 study included 3,057 patients undergoing elective knee replacement. Subjects received \neither apixaban 2.5 mg given orally twice daily (po bid) or enoxaparin 40 mg administered \nsubcutaneously once daily (sc od). The first dose of apixaban was given 12 to 24 hours post-surgery, \nwhereas enoxaparin was started 9 to 15 hours prior to surgery. Both apixaban and enoxaparin were \ngiven for 32-38 days in the ADVANCE-3 study and for 10-14 days in the ADVANCE-2 study. \n \nBased on patient medical history in the studied population of ADVANCE-3 and ADVANCE-2 \n(8,464 patients), 46% had hypertension, 10% had hyperlipidemia, 9% had diabetes, and 8% had \ncoronary artery disease. \n \nApixaban demonstrated a statistically superior reduction in the primary endpoint, a composite of all \nVTE/all cause death, and in the Major VTE endpoint, a composite of proximal DVT, non-fatal PE, and \nVTE-related death, compared to enoxaparin in both elective hip or knee replacement surgery (see \nTable 4). \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTable 4: Efficacy results from pivotal phase III studies \nStudy ADVANCE-3 (hip) ADVANCE-2 (knee) \nStudy treatment \nDose \nDuration of treatment  \n\nApixaban \n2.5 mg po \ntwice daily \n\n35 ± 3 d \n\nEnoxaparin \n40 mg sc \n\nonce daily \n35 ± 3 d \n\np-value Apixaban \n2.5 mg po \ntwice daily \n\n12 ± 2 d \n\nEnoxaparin \n40 mg sc \n\nonce daily \n12 ± 2 d \n\np-value \n\nTotal VTE/all-cause death \nNumber of \nevents/subjects \nEvent rate \n\n27/1,949 \n1.39% \n\n74/1,917 \n3.86% < 0.000\n\n1 \n\n147/976 \n15.06% \n\n243/997 \n24.37% \n\n<0.0001 \nRelative risk \n95% CI \n\n0.36 \n(0.22, 0.54) \n\n 0.62 \n(0.51, 0.74) \n\n \n\nMajor VTE \nNumber of \nevents/subjects \nEvent rate \n\n10/2,199 \n0.45% \n\n25/2,195 \n1.14% \n\n0.0107 \n\n13/1,195 \n1.09% \n\n26/1,199 \n2.17% \n\n0.0373 \nRelative risk \n95% CI \n\n0.40 \n(0.15, 0.80) \n\n 0.50 \n(0.26, 0.97) \n\n \n\n \nThe safety endpoints of major bleeding, the composite of major and clinically relevant non-major \n(CRNM) bleeding, and all bleeding showed similar rates for patients treated with apixaban 2.5 mg \ncompared with enoxaparin 40 mg (see Table 5).

The program \nwas designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of apixaban for the prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and one or more additional \nrisk factors, such as:  \n• prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) \n• age ≥ 75 years \n• hypertension \n• diabetes mellitus \n• symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II) \n\n \nARISTOTLE STUDY \nIn the ARISTOTLE study a total of 18,201 patients were randomised to double-blind treatment with \napixaban 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients [4.7%], see section 4.2) or \nwarfarin (target INR range 2.0-3.0), patients were exposed to study drug for a mean of 20 months. The \nmean age was 69.1 years, the mean CHADS2 score was 2.1 and 18.9% of patients had prior stroke or \nTIA. \n \nIn the study, apixaban achieved statistically significant superiority in the primary endpoint of \nprevention of stroke (haemorrhagic or ischaemic) and systemic embolism (see Table 6) compared with \nwarfarin. \n \nTable 6: Efficacy outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation in the ARISTOTLE study \n Apixaban  \n\nN=9,120 \nn (%/yr) \n\nWarfarin  \nN=9,081 \nn (%/yr) \n\nHazard ratio \n(95% CI) \n\n \np-value \n\nStroke or systemic embolism 212 (1.27) 265 (1.60) 0.79 (0.66, 0.95) 0.0114 \nStroke     \n\nIschaemic or unspecified 162 (0.97) 175 (1.05) 0.92 (0.74, 1.13)  \nHaemorrhagic 40 (0.24) 78 (0.47) 0.51 (0.35, 0.75)  \n\nSystemic embolism 15 (0.09) 17 (0.10) 0.87 (0.44, 1.75)  \n \nFor patients randomised to warfarin, the median percentage of time in therapeutic range (TTR) \n(INR 2-3) was 66%. \n \nApixaban showed a reduction of stroke and systemic embolism compared to warfarin across the \ndifferent levels of center TTR; within the highest quartile of TTR according to center, the hazard ratio \nfor apixaban vs warfarin was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.38, 1.40). \n \nKey secondary endpoints of major bleeding and all cause death were tested in a pre-specified \nhierarchical testing strategy to control the overall type 1 error in the trial. Statistically significant \nsuperiority was also achieved in the key secondary endpoints of both major bleeding and all-cause \ndeath (see Table 7).

ASA was given at a once daily dose of 81 mg \n(64%), 162 (26.9%), 243 (2.1%), or 324 mg (6.6%) at the discretion of the investigator. Patients were \nexposed to study drug for a mean of 14 months. The mean age was 69.9 years, the mean CHADS2 \nscore was 2.0 and 13.6% of patients had prior stroke or TIA. \n \nCommon reasons for unsuitability for VKA therapy in the AVERROES study included \nunable/unlikely to obtain INRs at requested intervals (42.6%), patient refused treatment with VKA \n(37.4%), CHADS2 score = 1 and physician did not recommend VKA (21.3%), patient could not be \nrelied on to adhere to VKA medicinal product instruction (15.0%), and difficulty/expected difficulty in \ncontacting patient in case of urgent dose change (11.7%). \n \nAVERROES was stopped early based on a recommendation by the independent Data Monitoring \nCommittee due to clear evidence of reduction of stroke and systemic embolism with an acceptable \nsafety profile. \n \nThe overall discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 1.5% for apixaban and 1.3% for ASA in \nthe AVERROES study. \n \nIn the study, apixaban achieved statistically significant superiority in the primary endpoint of \nprevention of stroke (haemorrhagic, ischaemic or unspecified) or systemic embolism (see Table 8) \ncompared to ASA. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nTable 8: Key efficacy outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation in the AVERROES study \n Apixaban \n\nN = 2,807  \nn (%/year) \n\nASA  \nN = 2,791 \n\nn (%/year) \n\nHazard ratio \n(95% CI) \n\n \np-value \n\nStroke or systemic embolism* 51 (1.62) 113 (3.63) 0.45 (0.32, 0.62) < 0.0001 \nStroke     \n\nIschaemic or unspecified 43 (1.37) 97 (3.11) 0.44 (0.31, 0.63)  \nHaemorrhagic 6 (0.19) 9 (0.28) 0.67 (0.24, 1.88)  \n\nSystemic embolism 2 (0.06) 13 (0.41) 0.15 (0.03, 0.68)  \nStroke, systemic embolism, \nMI, or vascular death*† \n\n132 (4.21) 197 (6.35) 0.66 (0.53, 0.83) 0.003 \n\nMyocardial infarction 24 (0.76) 28 (0.89) 0.86 (0.50, 1.48)  \nVascular death 84 (2.65) 96 (3.03) 0.87 (0.65, 1.17)  \n\nAll-cause death† 111 (3.51) 140 (4.42) 0.79 (0.62, 1.02) 0.068 \n* Assessed by sequential testing strategy designed to control the overall type I error in the trial. \n† Secondary endpoint. \n \nThere was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of major bleeding between apixaban \nand ASA (see Table 9). \n \nTable 9: Bleeding events in patients with atrial fibrillation in the AVERROES study \n\n Apixaban \nN = 2,798 \nn(%/year) \n\nASA \nN = 2,780 \n\nn (%/year) \n\nHazard ratio \n(95%CI) \n\np-value \n\nMajor* 45 (1.41) 29 (0.92) 1.54 (0.96, 2.45)  0.0716 \nFatal, n 5 (0.16) 5 (0.16)   \nIntracranial, n 11 (0.34) 11 (0.35)   \n\nMajor + CRNM† 140 (4.46) 101 (3.24) 1.38 (1.07, 1.78) 0.0144 \nAll 325 (10.85) 250 (8.32) 1.30 (1.10, 1.53) 0.0017 \n*Major bleeding defined per International Society on Thrombosis ad Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria. \n† Clinically Relevant Non-Major \n \nNVAF patients with ACS and/or undergoing PCI \nAUGUSTUS, an open-label, randomised , controlled, 2 by 2 factorial design trial, enrolled 4,614 \npatients with NVAF who had ACS (43%) and/or underwent PCI (56%). All patients \nreceivedbackground therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel: 90.3%) prescribed per local standard \nof care. \n \nPatients were randomised, up to 14 days after the ACS and/or PCI to either apixaban 5 mg twice \ndaily(2.5 mg twice daily if two or more of the dose-reduction criteria were met; 10% received lower \ndose)or VKA and to either ASA (81 mg once daily) or placebo. The mean age was 69.9 years, 94% \nofpatients randomised, had a CHA2DS2-VASc score > 2, and 47% had a HAS-BLED score > 3. \nForpatients randomised to VKA, the proportion of time in therapeutic range (TTR) (INR 2-3) was \n56%,with 32% of time below TTR and 12% above TTR. \n \nThe primary objective of AUGUSTUS was to assess safety, with a primary endpoint of ISTH major \norCRNM bleeding. In the apixaban versus VKA comparison, the primary safety endpoint of ISTH \nmajoror CRNM bleeding at month 6 occurred in 241 (10.5%), and 332 (14.7%) patients in the \napixaban armand in the VKA arm respectively (HR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.82; 2-sided p<0.0001 for \nnon-inferiorityand p<0.0001 for superiority). For VKA, additional analyses using subgroups by TTR \nshowed that thehighest rate of bleeding was associated with the lowest quartile of TTR. The rate of \nbleeding wassimilar between apixaban and the highest quartile of TTR. \n \nIn the ASA versus placebo comparison, the primary safety endpoint of ISTH major or CRNMbleeding \nat month 6 occurred in 367 (16.1%), and 204 (9.0%) patients in the ASA arm and in theplacebo arm \nrespectively (HR=1.88, 95% CI: 1.58, 2.23; two-sided p<0.0001). \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \nSpecifically, in apixaban-treated patients, major or CRNM bleeding occurred in 157 (13.7%), and 84 \n(7.4%) patients in the ASA arm and in the placebo arm respectively. In VKA-treated patients, major \norCRNM bleeding occurred in 208 (18.5%), and 122 (10.8%) patients in the ASA arm and in \ntheplacebo arm respectively. \n \nOther treatment effects were evaluated as a secondary objective of the study, with \ncompositeendpoints. \nIn the apixaban versus VKA comparison, the composite endpoint of death or re-hospitalization \noccurred in 541 (23.5%) and 632 (27.4%) patients in the apixaban and in the VKA arm, \nrespectively.The composite endpoint of death or ischemic event (stroke, myocardial infarction, stent \nthrombosis or urgent revascularization) occurred in 170 (7.4%), and 182 (7.9%) patients in the \napixaban and in the \nVKA arm, respectively. \nIn the ASA versus placebo comparison, the composite endpoint of death or re-hospitalization \noccurredin 604 (26.2%) and 569 (24.7%) patients in the ASA and in the placebo arm, respectively. \nThecomposite endpoint of death or ischemic event (stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis \norurgent revascularization) occurred in 163 (7.1%), and 189 (8.2%) patients in the ASA and in \ntheplacebo arm, respectively. \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nEMANATE, an open-label, multi-center study, enrolled 1500 patients who were either oral \nanticoagulant naïve or pre-treated less than 48 hours, and scheduled for cardioversion for NVAF. \nPatients were randomised, 1:1 to apixaban or to heparin and/or VKA for the prevention of \ncardiovascular events. Electrical and/or pharmacologic cardioversion was conducted after at least 5 \ndoses of 5 mg twice daily apixaban (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients (see section 4.2)) or at \nleast 2 hours after a 10 mg loading dose (or a 5 mg loading dose in selected patients (see section 4.2)) \nif earlier cardioversion was required. In the apixaban group, 342 patients received a loading dose (331 \npatients received the 10 mg dose and 11 patients received the 5 mg dose). \n \nThere were no strokes (0%) in the apixaban group (n= 753) and 6 (0.80%) strokes in the heparin \nand/or VKA group (n = 747; RR 0.00, 95% CI 0.00, 0.64). All-cause death occurred in 2 patients \n(0.27%) in the apixaban group and 1 patient (0.13%) in the heparin and/or VKA group. No systemic \nembolism events were reported. \n \nMajor bleeding and CRNM bleeding events occurred in 3 (0.41%) and 11 (1.50%) patients, \nrespectively, in the apixaban group, compared to 6 (0.83%) and 13 (1.80%) patients in the heparin \nand/or VKA group. \n \nThis exploratory study showed comparable efficacy and safety between apixaban and heparin and/or \nVKA treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) \nThe clinical program (AMPLIFY: apixaban versus enoxaparin/warfarin, AMPLIFY-EXT: apixaban \nversus placebo) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of apixaban for the treatment of \nDVT and/or PE (AMPLIFY), and extended therapy for the prevention of recurrent DVT and/or PE \nfollowing 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant treatment for DVT and/or PE (AMPLIFY-EXT). Both \nstudies were randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, multinational trials in patients with \nsymptomatic proximal DVT or symptomatic PE. All the key safety and efficacy endpoints were \nadjudicated by an independent blinded committee. \n \nAMPLIFY STUDY  \nIn the AMPLIFY study a total of 5,395 patients were randomised to treatment with apixaban 10 mg \ntwice daily orally for 7 days followed by apixaban 5 mg twice daily orally for 6 months, or enoxaparin \n1 mg/kg twice daily subcutaneously for at least 5 days (until INR≥ 2) and warfarin (target INR range \n2.0-3.0) orally for 6 months. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nThe mean age was 56.9 years and 89.8% of randomised patients had unprovoked VTE events. \n \nFor patients randomised to warfarin, the mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0) \nwas 60.9. Apixaban showed a reduction in recurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE- related death across \nthe different levels of center TTR; within the highest quartile of TTR according to center, the relative \nrisk for apixaban vs enoxaparin/warfarin was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.39, 1.61). \n \nIn the study, apixaban was shown to be non-inferior to enoxaparin/warfarin in the combined primary \nendpoint of adjudicated recurrent symptomatic VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal PE) or VTE-related \ndeath (see Table 10). \n \nTable 10: Efficacy results in the AMPLIFY study \n Apixaban \n\nN=2,609 \nn (%) \n\nEnoxaparin/warfari\nn \n\nN=2,635 \nn (%) \n\nRelative risk \n(95% CI) \n\nVTE or VTE-related \ndeath \n\n59 (2.3) 71 (2.7) 0.84 (0.60, 1.18)* \n\n DVT 20 (0.7) 33 (1.2)  \n\n PE 27 (1.0) 23 (0.9)  \n\n VTE-related \n death \n\n12 (0.4) 15 (0.6)  \n\nVTE or all-cause \ndeath \n\n84 (3.2) 104 (4.0) 0.82 (0.61, 1.08) \n\nVTE or CV-related \ndeath \n\n61 (2.3) 77 (2.9) 0.80 (0.57, 1.11) \n\nVTE, VTE-related \ndeath, or major \nbleeding \n\n73 (2.8) 118 (4.5) 0.62 (0.47, 0.83) \n\n* Noninferior compared to enoxaparin/warfarin (p-value <0.0001) \n \nApixaban efficacy in initial treatment of VTE was consistent between patients who were treated for a \nPE [Relative Risk 0.9; 95% CI (0.5, 1.6)] or DVT [Relative Risk 0.8; 95% CI (0.5, 1.3)].

Apixaban is \nrapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 3 to 4 hours after tablet intake. Intake \nwith food does not affect apixaban AUC or Cmax at the 10 mg dose. Apixaban can be taken with or \nwithout food. \n \nApixaban demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics with dose proportional increases in exposure for oral \ndoses up to 10 mg. At doses ≥ 25 mg apixaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased \nbioavailability. Apixaban exposure parameters exhibit low to moderate variability reflected by a \nwithin-subject and inter-subject variability of ~20% CV and ~30% CV, respectively. \n \nFollowing oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets suspended in 30 mL of \nwater, exposure was comparable to exposure after oral administration of 2 whole 5 mg tablets. \nFollowing oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets with 30 g of apple \npuree, the Cmax and AUC were 21% and 16% lower, respectively, when compared to administration of \n2 whole 5 mg tablets. The reduction in exposure is not considered clinically relevant. \n \nFollowing administration of a crushed 5 mg apixaban tablet suspended in 60 mL of G5W and \ndelivered via a nasogastric tube, exposure was similar to exposure seen in other clinical trials \ninvolving healthy subjects receiving a single oral 5 mg apixaban tablet dose. \n \nGiven the predictable, dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile of apixaban, the bioavailability \nresults from the conducted studies are applicable to lower apixaban doses. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in humans is approximately 87%. The volume of distribution (Vss) is \napproximately 21 litres. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \nApixaban has multiple routes of elimination. Of the administered apixaban dose in humans, \napproximately 25% was recovered as metabolites, with the majority recovered in faeces. Renal \nexcretion of apixaban accounts for approximately 27% of total clearance. Additional contributions \nfrom biliary and direct intestinal excretion were observed in clinical and nonclinical studies, \nrespectively. \n \nApixaban has a total clearance of about 3.3 L/h and a half-life of approximately 12 hours. \n \nO-demethylation and hydroxylation at the 3-oxopiperidinyl moiety are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Apixaban is metabolised mainly via CYP3A4/5 with minor contributions from \nCYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2J2. Unchanged apixaban is the major drug-related component in \nhuman plasma with no active circulating metabolites present. Apixaban is a substrate of transport \nproteins, P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was no impact of impaired renal function on peak concentration of apixaban. There was an \nincrease in apixaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via measured \ncreatinine clearance. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 51-80 mL/min), moderate \n(creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) renal \nimpairment, apixaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 16, 29, and 44% respectively, \ncompared to individuals with normal creatinine clearance. Renal impairment had no evident effect on \nthe relationship between apixaban plasma concentration and anti-FXa activity. \n \nIn subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the AUC of apixaban was increased by 36% when a \nsingle dose of apixaban 5 mg was administered immediately after haemodialysis, compared to that \nseen in subjects with normal renal function. Haemodialysis, started two hours after administration of a \nsingle dose of apixaban 5 mg, decreased apixaban AUC by 14% in these ESRD subjects, \ncorresponding to an apixaban dialysis clearance of 18 mL/min. Therefore, haemodialysis is unlikely to \nbe an effective means of managing apixaban overdose. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a study comparing 8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh A score 5 (n = 6) and \nscore 6 (n = 2), and 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh B score 7 (n = 6) and \nscore 8 (n = 2), to 16 healthy control subjects, the single-dose pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics of apixaban 5 mg were not altered in subjects with hepatic impairment. Changes in \nanti-Factor Xa activity and INR were comparable between subjects with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment and healthy subjects. \n \nElderly \nElderly patients (above 65 years) exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with \nmean AUC values being approximately 32% higher and no difference in Cmax. \n \nGender \nExposure to apixaban was approximately 18% higher in females than in males. \n \nEthnic origin and race \nThe results across phase I studies showed no discernible difference in apixaban pharmacokinetics \nbetween White/Caucasian, Asian and Black/African American subjects. Findings from a population \npharmacokinetic analysis in patients who received apixaban were generally consistent with the phase I \nresults. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nBody weight \nCompared to apixaban exposure in subjects with body weight of 65 to 85 kg, body weight > 120 kg \nwas associated with approximately 30% lower exposure and body weight < 50 kg was associated with \napproximately 30% higher exposure.  \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics  relationship \nThe pharmacokinetic /pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between apixaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (anti-FXa activity, INR, PT, aPTT) has been evaluated after \nadministration of a wide range of doses (0.5 – 50 mg). The relationship between apixaban plasma \nconcentration and anti-Factor Xa activity was best described by a linear model. The PK/PD \nrelationship observed in patients was consistent with that established in healthy subjects. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, fertility and embryo-foetal \ndevelopment and juvenile toxicity. \n \nThe major observed effects in the repeated dose toxicity studies were those related to the \npharmacodynamic action of apixaban on blood coagulation parameters. In the toxicity studies little to \nno increase of bleeding tendency was found. However, since this may be due to a lower sensitivity of \nthe non-clinical species compared to humans, this result should be interpreted with caution when \nextrapolating to humans. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \n(NVAF), with one or more risk factors, such as prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA); \nage≥ 75 years; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II). \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults (see section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) \nThe recommended dose of apixaban is 5 mg taken orally twice daily. \n \nDose reduction \nThe recommended dose of apixaban is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily in patients with NVAF and at \nleast two of the following characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine \n≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L). \n \nTherapy should be continued long-term. \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) \nThe recommended dose of apixaban for the treatment of acute DVT and treatment of PE is 10 mg \ntaken orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg taken orally twice daily. As per available \nmedical guidelines, short duration of treatment (at least 3 months) should be based on transient risk \nfactors (e.g., recent surgery, trauma, immobilisation). \n \nThe recommended dose of apixaban for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is 2.5 mg taken orally \ntwice daily. When prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated, the 2.5 mg twice daily dose \n\n\n\n30 \n\nshould be initiated following completion of 6 months of treatment with apixaban 5 mg twice daily or \nwith another anticoagulant, as indicated in Table 1 below (see also section 5.1) \n \nTable 1: \n Dosing schedule Maximum daily dose \n\nTreatment of DVT or PE  10 mg twice daily for the first 7 days  \n \n\n20 mg \n\nfollowed by 5 mg twice daily  10 mg \n\nPrevention of recurrent DVT \nand/or PE following completion of \n6 months of treatment for DVT or \nPE \n\n2.5 mg twice daily \n \n\n5 mg \n\n \nThe duration of overall therapy should be individualised after careful assessment of the treatment \nbenefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4). \n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose is missed, the patient should take Apixaban Accordimmediately and then continue with twice \ndaily intake as before. \n \nSwitching \nSwitching treatment from parenteral anticoagulants to Apixaban Accord(and vice versa) can be done \nat the next scheduled dose (see section 4.5). These medicinal products should not be administered \nsimultaneously. \n \nSwitching from vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy to  Apixaban AccordWhen converting patients \nfrom vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy toApixaban Accord, warfarin or other VKA therapy \nshould be discontinued and Apixaban Accord started when the international normalised ratio (INR) \nis < 2. \n \nSwitching from Apixaban Accord to VKA therapy \nWhen converting patients from Apixaban Accordto VKA therapy, administration of Apixaban Accord \nshould be continued for at least 2 days after beginning VKA therapy. After 2 days of coadministration \nof Apixaban Accordwith VKA therapy, an INR should be obtained prior to the next scheduled dose of \nApixaban Accord. Coadministration of Apixaban Accord and VKA therapy should be continued until \nthe INR is ≥ 2. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, the following recommendations apply: \n \n- for the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt), no dose \nadjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). \n \n- for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and serum creatinine ≥1.5 \nmg/dL (133 micromole/L) associated with age ≥80 years or body weight ≤60 kg, a dose reduction is \nnecessary and described above. In the absence of other criteria for dose reduction (age, body weight), \nno dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). \n \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) the following \nrecommendations apply (see sections 4.4 and 5.2): \n \n-  for the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) \n\napixaban is to be used with caution; \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n-  for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, patients should receive \nthe lower dose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. \n\n \nIn patients with creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min, or in patients undergoing dialysis, there is no \nclinical experience therefore apixaban is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nApixaban Accordis contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). \n \nIt is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4. and 5.2). \n \nIt should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or \nB). No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with elevated liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase \n(AST) >2 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN were excluded in clinical trials. Therefore Apixaban \nAccordshould be used with caution in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Prior to initiating \nApixaban Accord, liver function testing should be performed. \n \nBody weight \nVTEt - No dose adjustment required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \nNVAF - No dose adjustment required, unless criteria for dose reduction are met (see Dose reduction at \nthe beginning of section 4.2). \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment required (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly \nVTEt - No dose adjustment required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \nNVAF - No dose adjustment required, unless criteria for dose reduction are met (see Dose reduction at \nthe beginning of section 4.2). \n \nPatients undergoing catheter ablation (NVAF) \nPatients can continue apixaban use while undergoing catheter ablation (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nApixaban can be initiated or continued in NVAF patients who may require cardioversion.  \n \nFor patients not previously treated with anticoagulants, exclusion of left atrial thrombus using an \nimage guided approach (e.g. transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or computed tomographic scan \n(CT)) prior to cardioversion should be considered, in accordance with established medical guidelines. \n\nFor patients initiating treatment with apixaban, 5 mg should be given twice daily for at least 2.5 days \n(5 single doses) before cardioversion to ensure adequate anticoagulation (see section 5.1). The dosing \nregimen should be reduced to 2.5 mg apixaban given twice daily for at least 2.5 days (5 single doses) \nif the patient meets the criteria for dose reduction (see above sections Dose reduction and Renal \nimpairment). \n \nIf cardioversion is required before 5 doses of apixaban can be administered, a 10 mg loading dose \nshould be given, followed by 5 mg twice daily. The dosing regimen should be reduced to a 5 mg \nloading dose followed by 2.5 mg twice daily if the patient meets the criteria for dose reduction (see \nabove sections Dose reduction and Renal impairment). The administration of the loading dose should \nbe given at least 2 hours before cardioversion (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nFor all patients undergoing cardioversion, confirmation should be sought prior to cardioversion that \nthe patient has taken apixaban as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and duration of treatment should \ntake established guideline recommendations for anticoagulant treatment in patients undergoing \ncardioversion into account. \n \nPatients with NVAF and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention \n(PCI) \nThere is limited experience of treatment with apixaban at the recommended dose for NVAF patients \nwhen used in combination with antiplatelet agents in patients with ACS and/or undergoing PCI after \nhaemostasis is achieved (see sections 4.4, 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Apixaban Accord in children and adolescents below age 18 have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use \nApixaban Accord should be swallowed with water, with or without food. \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Apixaban Accord tablets may be crushed and \nsuspended in water, or 5% glucose  in water (G5W), or apple juice or mixed with apple puree and \nimmediately administered orally (see section 5.2). Alternatively, Apixaban Accordtablets may be \ncrushed and suspended in 60 mL of water or G5W and immediately delivered through a nasogastric \ntube (see section 5.2).  \n \nCrushed Apixaban Accord tablets are stable in water,G5W,apple juice,and apple puree for up to \n4 hours. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n• Active clinically significant bleeding. \n• Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n• Lesion or condition if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This may include \n\ncurrent or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of \nbleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent \nintracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular \nabnormalities. \n\n• Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulant agent e.g., unfractionated heparin (UFH), \nlow molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives \n(fondaparinux, etc.), oral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, etc.) except under \nspecific circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is \ngiven at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH \nis given during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHaemorrhage risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Apixaban Accordare to be carefully observed for signs of \nbleeding. It is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. \nApixaban Accordadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see sections 4.8 \nand 4.9). \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nAlthough treatment with apixaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, a calibrated \nquantitative anti-Factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional situations where knowledge of \napixaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g., overdose and emergency surgery (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nAn agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available. \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nDue to an increased bleeding risk, concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nThe concomitant use of Apixaban Accord with antiplatelet agents increases the risk of bleeding (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \n(SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs), including acetylsalicylic acid. \n \nFollowing surgery, other platelet aggregation inhibitors are not recommended concomitantly with \nApixaban Accord (see section 4.5). \n \nIn patients with atrial fibrillation and conditions that warrant mono or dual antiplatelet therapy, a \ncareful assessment of the potential benefits against the potential risks should be made before \ncombining this therapy with Apixaban Accord. \nIn a clinical trial of patients with atrial fibrillation, concomitant use of   acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) \nincreased the major bleeding risk on apixaban from 1.8% per year to 3.4% per year and increased the \nbleeding risk on warfarin from 2.7% per year to 4.6% per year. In this clinical trial, there was limited \n(2.1%) use of concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy(see section 5.1). \nA clinical trial enrolled patients with atrial fibrillation with ACS and/or undergoing PCI and a planned \ntreatment period with a P2Y12 inhibitor, with or without ASA, and oral anticoagulant (either apixaban \nor VKA) for 6 months. Concomitant use of ASA increased the risk of ISTH (International Society on \nThrombosis and Hemostasis) major or CRNM (Clinically Relevant Non-Major) bleeding in \napixaban-treated subjects from 16.4% per year to 33.1% per year (see section 5.1). \n \nIn a clinical trial of high-risk post acute coronary syndrome patientswithout atrial fibrillation, \ncharacterised by multiple cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities, who received ASA or the \ncombination of ASA and clopidogrel, a significant increase in risk of ISTH (International Society on \nThrombosis and Haemostasis) major bleeding was reported for apixaban (5.13% per year) compared \nto placebo (2.04% per year). \n \nUse of thrombolytic agents for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke \nThere is very limited experience with the use of thrombolytic agents for the treatment of acute \nischemic stroke in patients administered apixaban(see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nPatients with prosthetic heart valves \nSafety and efficacy of Apixaban Accordhave not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves, \nwith or without atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the use of Apixaban Accord is not recommended in this \nsetting. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting  oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including apixaban are not recommended for patients with \na history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for patients \nthat are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein \nI antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic \nevents compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nSurgery and invasive procedures \nApixaban Accordshould be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive \nprocedures with a moderate or high risk of bleeding. This includes interventions for which the \nprobability of clinically significant bleeding cannot be excluded or for which the risk of bleeding \nwould be unacceptable. \n \nApixaban Accordshould be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive \nprocedures with a low risk of bleeding. This includes interventions for which any bleeding that occurs \nis expected to be minimal, non-critical in its location or easily controlled. \n \nIf surgery or invasive procedures cannot be delayed, appropriate caution should be exercised, taking \ninto consideration an increased risk of bleeding. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the \nurgency of intervention. \n \nApixaban Accord should be restarted after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention as soon as \npossible provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established (for \ncardioversion see section 4.2). \n \nFor patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, Apixaban Accord treatment does not \nneed to be interrupted (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nTemporary discontinuation \nDiscontinuing anticoagulants, including Apixaban Accord, for active bleeding, elective surgery, or \ninvasive procedures places patients at an increased risk of thrombosis. Lapses in therapy should be \navoided and if anticoagulation with Apixaban Accord must be temporarily discontinued for any \nreason, therapy should be restarted as soon as possible. \n \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \nApixaban Accord is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with \npulmonary embolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of apixaban have not been established in these clinical \nsituations.  \n \nPatients with active cancer \nEfficacy and safety of apixaban in the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE (VTEt) in patients with active cancer have not been established. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nLimited clinical data indicate that apixaban plasma concentrations are increased in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nFor the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt), apixaban \nis to be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n15-29 mL/min) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nFor the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, patients with severe renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min), and patients with serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL \n(133 micromole/L) associated with age ≥ 80 years or body weight ≤ 60 kg should receive the lower \ndose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily (see section 4.2); \n \nIn patients with creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min, or in patients undergoing dialysis, there is no \nclinical experience therefore apixaban is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nElderly patients \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \nAlso, the co-administration of Apixaban Accord with ASA in elderly patients should be used \ncautiously because of a potentially higher bleeding risk. \n \nBody weight \nLow body weight (< 60 kg) may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nApixaban Accordis contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). \n \nIt is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nIt should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or \nB) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with elevated liver enzymes ALT/AST > 2 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN were \nexcluded in clinical trials. Therefore Apixaban Accord should be used cautiously in this population \n(see section 5.2). Prior to initiating Apixaban Accord, liver function testing should be performed. \n \nInteraction with inhibitors of both cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) \nThe use of Apixaban Accordis not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment \nwith strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, \nitraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir). These \nmedicinal products may increase apixaban exposure by 2-fold (see section 4.5) or greater in the \npresence of additional factors that increase apixaban exposure (e.g., severe renal impairment). \n \nInteraction with inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp \nThe concomitant use of Apixaban Accord with strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampicin, \nphenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may lead to a ~50% reduction in \napixaban exposure. In a clinical study in atrial fibrillation patients, diminished efficacy and a higher \nrisk of bleeding were observed with coadministration of apixaban with strong inducers of both \nCYP3A4 and P-gp compared with using apixaban alone. \n \nIn patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp \nthe following recommendations apply (see section 4.5): \n \n-C.  for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and for the prevention \nof recurrent DVT and PE, apixaban should be used with caution; \n \n-D.  for the treatment of DVT and treatment of PE, apixaban should not be used since efficacy may be \ncompromised. \n \nLaboratory parameters \nClotting tests [e.g., prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)] are \naffected as expected by the mechanism of action of apixaban. Changes observed in these clotting tests \nat the expected therapeutic dose are small and subject to a high degree of variability (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nInformation about excipients \nApixaban Accordcontains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance,  \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’ \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp \nCoadministration of apixaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day), a strong inhibitor of both \nCYP3A4 and P-gp, led to a 2-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in mean \napixaban Cmax. \n \nThe use of Apixaban Accord is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic \ntreatment with strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., \nketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., \nritonavir) (see section 4.4). \n \nActive substances which are not considered strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, (e.g., \namiodarone, clarithromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, naproxen, quinidine, verapamil) are expected to \nincrease apixaban plasma concentration to a lesser extent. No dose adjustment for apixaban is required \nwhen coadministered with agents that are not strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. For \nexample, diltiazem (360 mg once a day), considered a moderate CYP3A4 and a weak P-gp inhibitor, \nled to a 1.4-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.3-fold increase in Cmax. Naproxen (500 mg, \nsingle dose) an inhibitor of P-gp but not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold \nincrease in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. Clarithromycin (500 mg, twice a day), an \ninhibitor of P-gp and a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.6-fold and 1.3-fold increase in mean \napixaban AUC and Cmax respectively. \n \nInducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp  \nCoadministration of apixaban with rifampicin, a strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, led to an \napproximate 54% and 42% decrease in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. The concomitant \nuse of apixaban with other strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may also lead to reduced apixaban plasma concentrations. No dose \nadjustment for apixaban is required during concomitant therapy with such medicinal products, \nhowever in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 \nand P-gp apixaban should be used with caution for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in \npatients with NVAF and for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE. Apixaban is not recommended \nfor the treatment of DVT and PE in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong \ninducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp since efficacy may be compromised (see section 4.4). \n \nAnticoagulants, platelet aggregation inhibitors, SSRIs/SNRIs and NSAIDs \nDue to an increased bleeding risk, concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants is \ncontraindicated except under specific circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy, when UFH is \ngiven at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given \nduring catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.3). \n \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with apixaban (5 mg single dose), \nan additive effect on anti-Factor Xa activity was observed. \n \nPharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were not evident when apixaban was \ncoadministered with ASA 325 mg once a day. \n \nApixaban coadministered with clopidogrel (75 mg once a day) or with the combination of clopidogrel \n75 mg and ASA 162 mg once daily, or with prasugrel (60 mg followed by 10 mg once daily) in \nPhase I studies did not show a relevant increase in template bleeding time, or further inhibition of \n\n\n\n37 \n\nplatelet aggregation, compared to administration of the antiplatelet agents without apixaban. Increases \nin clotting tests (PT, INR, and aPTT) were consistent with the effects of apixaban alone. \n \nNaproxen (500 mg), an inhibitor of P-gp, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold increase in mean apixaban \nAUC and Cmax, respectively. Corresponding increases in clotting tests were observed for apixaban. No \nchanges were observed in the effect of naproxen on arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and \nno clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \napixaban and naproxen. \n \nDespite these findings, there may be individuals with a more pronounced pharmacodynamic response \nwhen antiplatelet agents are coadministered with apixaban. Apixaban Accord should be used with \ncaution when coadministered with SSRIs/SNRIs, NSAIDs, ASA and/or P2Y12 because these \nmedicinal products typically increase the bleeding risk (see section 4.4). \n \nThere is limited experience of co-administration with other platelet aggregation inhibitors (such as \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, dipyridamole, dextran or sulfinpyrazone) or thrombolytic agents. As \nsuch agents increase the bleeding risk, co-administration of these medicinal products with Apixaban \nAccord is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nOther concomitant therapies \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \napixaban was coadministered with atenolol or famotidine. Coadministration of apixaban 10 mg with \natenolol 100 mg did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban. \nFollowing administration of the two medicinal products together, mean apixaban AUC and Cmax were \n15% and 18% lower than when administered alone. The administration of apixaban 10 mg with \nfamotidine 40 mg had no effect on apixaban AUC or Cmax. \n \nEffect of apixaban on other medicinal products \nIn vitro apixaban studies showed no inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, \nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 (IC50 > 45 µM) and weak inhibitory effect on the activity \nof CYP2C19 (IC50 > 20 µM) at concentrations that are significantly greater than peak plasma \nconcentrations observed in patients. Apixaban did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4/5 at a \nconcentration up to 20 µM. Therefore, apixaban is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of \ncoadministered drugs that are metabolised by these enzymes. Apixaban is not a significant inhibitor of \nP-gp. \n \nIn studies conducted in healthy subjects, as described below, apixaban did not meaningfully alter the \npharmacokinetics of digoxin, naproxen, or atenolol. \n \nDigoxin \nCoadministration of apixaban (20 mg once a day) and digoxin (0.25 mg once a day), a P-gp substrate, \ndid not affect digoxin AUC or Cmax. Therefore, apixaban does not inhibit P-gp mediated substrate \ntransport. \n \nNaproxen \nCoadministration of single doses of apixaban (10 mg) and naproxen (500 mg), a commonly used \nNSAID, did not have any effect on the naproxen AUC or Cmax. \n \nAtenolol \nCoadministration of a single dose of apixaban (10 mg) and atenolol (100 mg), a common beta-blocker, \ndid not alter the pharmacokinetics of atenolol. \n \nActivated charcoal \nAdministration of activated charcoal reduces apixaban exposure (see section 4.9). \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of apixaban in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Apixaban is not recommended during \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether apixaban or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available data in \nanimals have shown excretion of apixaban in milk. In rat milk, a high milk to maternal plasma ratio \n(Cmax about 8, AUC about 30) was found, possibly due to active transport into the milk. A risk to \nnewborns and infants cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision must be made to either discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from apixaban \ntherapy. \n \nFertility \nStudies in animals dosed with apixaban have shown no effect on fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nApixaban Accordhas no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of apixaban has been investigated in 4 Phase III clinical studies including more than \n15,000 patients: more than 11,000 patients in NVAF studies and more than 4,000 patients in the VTE \ntreatment (VTEt) studies, for an average total exposure of 1.7 years and 221 days respectively \n(see section 5.1). \n \nCommon adverse reactions were haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis, and haematoma (see Table 2 for \nadverse reaction profile and frequencies by indication). \n \nIn the NVAF studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was \n24.3% in the apixaban vs warfarin study and 9.6% in the apixaban vs acetylsalicylic acid study. In the \napixaban vs warfarin study the incidence of ISTH major gastrointestinal bleeds (including upper GI, \nlower GI, and rectal bleeding) with apixaban was 0.76%/year. The incidence of ISTH major \nintraocular bleeding with apixaban was 0.18%/year. \n \nIn the VTEt studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was \n15.6% in the apixaban vs enoxaparin/warfarin study and 13.3% in the apixaban vs placebo study \n(see section 5.1). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 2 shows the adverse reactions ranked under headings of system organ class and frequency using \nthe following convention: very common (≥ 1/10) common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data) for NVAF and VTEt respectively. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \nTable 2 \nSystem organ class Prevention of stroke and systemic \n\nembolism in adult patients with \nNVAF, with one or more risk \n\nfactors (NVAF) \n\nTreatment of DVT \nand PE, and \nprevention of \n\nrecurrent DVT and \nPE (VTEt) \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nAnaemia Common Common \nThrombocytopenia Uncommon Common \nImmune system disorders \n\nHypersensitivity, allergic oedema and \nanaphylaxis  \n\nUncommon Uncommon \n\nPruritus Uncommon Uncommon* \nNervous system disorders \n\nBrain haemorrhage† Uncommon Rare \nEye disorders \n\nEye haemorrhage (including \nconjunctival haemorrhage) \n\nCommon Uncommon \n\nVascular disorders \n\nHaemorrhage, haematoma Common Common \nHypotension (including procedural \nhypotension) \n\nCommon Uncommon \n\nIntra-abdominal haemorrhage Uncommon Not known \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nEpistaxis Common Common \nHaemoptysis Uncommon Uncommon \nRespiratory tract haemorrhage  Rare Rare \nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nNausea Common Common \nGastrointestinal haemorrhage  Common Common \nHaemorrhoidal haemorrhage Uncommon Uncommon \nMouth haemorrhage Uncommon Common \nHaematochezia Uncommon Uncommon \nRectal haemorrhage, gingival bleeding Common Common \nRetroperitoneal haemorrhage Rare Not known \nHepatobiliary disorders  \nLiver function test abnormal, aspartate \naminotransferase increased, blood \nalkaline phosphatase increased, blood \nbilirubin increased \n\nUncommon Uncommon \n\nGamma-glutamyltransferase increased Common Common \nAlanine aminotransferase increased Uncommon Common \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nSkin rash Uncommon Common \nAlopecia Uncommon Uncommon \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nMuscle haemorrhage Rare Uncommon \nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nHaematuria Common Common \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\n\n\n40 \n\nSystem organ class Prevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism in adult patients with \nNVAF, with one or more risk \n\nfactors (NVAF) \n\nTreatment of DVT \nand PE, and \nprevention of \n\nrecurrent DVT and \nPE (VTEt) \n\nAbnormal vaginal haemorrhage, \nurogenital haemorrhage \n\nUncommon Common \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nApplication site bleeding Uncommon Uncommon \nInvestigations \n\nOccult blood positive Uncommon Uncommon \nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \n\nContusion Common Common \n\nPost procedural haemorrhage \n(including post procedural \nhaematoma, wound haemorrhage, \nvessel puncture site haematoma and \ncatheter site haemorrhage), wound \nsecretion, incision site haemorrhage \n(including incision site haematoma), \noperative haemorrhage \n\nUncommon Uncommon \n\nTraumatic haemorrhage Uncommon Uncommon \n* There were no occurrences of generalised  pruritus in CV185057 (long term prevention of VTE)  \n†\n\n The term “Brain haemorrhage” encompasses all intracranial or intraspinal haemorrhages (ie., haemorrhagic stroke or \nputamen, cerebellar, intraventricular, or subdural haemorrhages). \n \nThe use of Apixaban Accordmay be associated with an increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from \nany tissue or organ, which may result in posthaemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and \nseverity will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose of apixaban may result in a higher risk of bleeding. In the event of haemorrhagic \ncomplications, treatment must be discontinued and the source of bleeding investigated. The initiation \nof appropriate treatment, e.g., surgical haemostasisor the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or the \nadministration of a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors should be considered. \n \nIn controlled clinical trials, orally-administered apixaban in healthy subjects at doses up to 50 mg daily \nfor 3 to 7 days (25 mg twice daily (bid) for 7 days or 50 mg once daily (od) for 3 days) had no \nclinically relevant adverseevents. \n \nIn healthy subjects, administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20 mg dose \nof apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively, and had no impact on Cmax. \nMean half-life of apixaban decreased from 13.4 hours when apixaban was administered alone to \n5.3 hours and 4.9 hours, respectively, when activated charcoal was administered 2 and 6 hours after \napixaban. Thus, administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of apixaban \noverdose or accidental ingestion. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n41 \n\n \nFor situations when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled \nbleeding, a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors is available (see section 4.4). Administration of \nprothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) or recombinant factor VIIa may be considered. Reversal of \nApixaban Accordpharmacodynamic effects, as demonstrated by changes in the thrombin generation \nassay, was evident at the end of infusion and reached baseline values within 4 hours after the start of a \n4-factor PCC 30 minute infusion in healthy subjects. However, there is no clinical experience with the \nuse of 4-factor PCC  medicinal products to reverse bleeding in individuals who have received \nApixaban Accord. Currently there is no experience with the use of recombinant factor VIIa in \nindividuals receiving apixaban. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa could be considered and titrated \ndepending on improvement of bleeding. \n \nDepending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of \nmajor bleedings. \n \nHaemodialysis decreased apixaban AUC by 14% in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), \nwhen a single dose of apixaban 5 mg was administered orally. Therefore, haemodialysis is unlikely to \nbe an effective means of managing apixaban overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF02 \n \nMechanism of action \nApixaban is a potent, oral, reversible, direct and highly selective active site inhibitor of factor Xa. It \ndoes not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound \nfactor Xa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effects on platelet aggregation, but \nindirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting factor Xa, apixaban \nprevents thrombin generation and thrombus development. Preclinical studies of apixaban in animal \nmodels have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy in the prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis \nat doses that preserved haemostasis. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe pharmacodynamic effects of apixaban are reflective of the mechanism of action (FXa inhibition). \nAs a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR and \nactivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected \ntherapeutic dose are small and subject to a high degree of variability. They are not recommended to \nassess the pharmacodynamic effects of apixaban. In the thrombin generation assay, apixaban reduced \nendogenous thrombin potential, a measure of thrombin generation in human plasma. \n \nApixaban also demonstrates anti-FXa activity as evident by reduction in Factor Xa enzyme activity in \nmultiple commercial anti-FXa kits, however results differ across kits. Data from clinical trials are only \navailable for the Rotachrom® Heparin chromogenic assay. Anti-FXa activity exhibits a close direct \nlinear relationship with apixaban plasma concentration, reaching maximum values at the time of \napixaban peak plasma concentrations. The relationship between apixaban plasma concentration and \nanti-FXa activity is approximately linear over a wide dose range of apixaban. \n \nTable 3 below shows the predicted steady state exposure and anti-Factor Xa activity. In non-valvular \natrial fibrillation patients taking apixaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, the \nresults demonstrate a less than 1.7-fold fluctuation in peak-to-trough levels. In patients taking \napixaban for the treatment of DVT and PE or prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, the results \ndemonstrate a less than 2.2-fold fluctuation in peak-to-trough levels. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nTable 3:Predicted apixaban steady-state exposure and anti-Xa activity \n\n Apix. \nCmax (ng/mL) \n\nApix. \nCmin (ng/mL) \n\nApix. anti-Xa \nactivity max \n\n(IU/mL) \n\nApix. anti-Xa \nactivity min \n\n(IU/mL) \n\n Median [5th, 95th Percentile] \n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism: NVAF \n\n2.5 mg twice \ndaily* \n\n123 [69, 221] 79 [34, 162] 1.8 [1.0, 3.3] 1.2 [0.51, 2.4] \n\n5 mg twice daily 171 [91, 321] 103 [41, 230] 2.6 [1.4, 4.8] 1.5 [0.61, 3.4] \n\nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) \n\n2.5 mg twice daily 67 [30, 153] 32 [11, 90] 1.0 [0.46, 2.5] 0.49 [0.17, 1.4] \n\n5 mg twice daily 132 [59, 302] 63 [22, 177] 2.1 [0.91, 5.2] 1.0 [0.33, 2.9] \n\n10 mg twice daily 251 [111, 572] 120 [41, 335] 4.2 [1.8, 10.8] 1.9 [0.64, 5.8] \n* Dose adjusted population based on 2 of 3 dose reduction criteria in the ARISTOTLE study. \n \nAlthough treatment with apixaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, a calibrated \nquantitative anti-Factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional situations where knowledge of \napixaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g., overdose and emergency surgery. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) \nA total of 23,799 patients were randomised in the clinical program (ARISTOTLE: apixaban versus \nwarfarin, AVERROES: apixaban versus ASA) including 11,927 randomised to apixaban. The program \nwas designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of apixaban for the prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and one or more additional \nrisk factors, such as: \n• prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) \n• age ≥ 75 years \n• hypertension \n• diabetes mellitus \n• symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II) \n \nARISTOTLE STUDY  \nIn the ARISTOTLE study a total of 18,201 patients were randomised to double-blind treatment with \napixaban 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients [4.7%], see section 4.2) or \nwarfarin (target INR range 2.0-3.0), patients were exposed to study drug for a mean of 20 months. The \nmean age was 69.1 years, the mean CHADS2 score was 2.1, 18.9 % of patients had prior stroke or \nTIA. \n \nIn the study, apixaban achieved statistically significant superiority in the primary endpoint of \nprevention of stroke (haemorrhagic or ischaemic) and systemic embolism (see Table 4) compared with \nwarfarin. \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nTable 4: Efficacy outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation in the ARISTOTLE study \n Apixaban  \n\nN=9,120 \nn (%/yr) \n\nWarfarin  \nN=9,081 \nn (%/yr) \n\nHazard ratio \n(95% CI) \n\n \np-value \n\nStroke or systemic embolism 212 (1.27) 265 (1.60) 0.79 (0.66, 0.95) 0.0114 \nStroke     \n\nIschaemic or unspecified 162 (0.97) 175 (1.05) 0.92 (0.74, 1.13)  \nHaemorrhagic 40 (0.24) 78 (0.47) 0.51 (0.35, 0.75)  \n\nSystemic embolism 15 (0.09) 17 (0.10) 0.87 (0.44, 1.75)  \n \nFor patients randomised to warfarin, the median percentage of time in therapeutic range (TTR) \n(INR 2-3) was 66%. \n \nApixaban showed a reduction of stroke and systemic embolism compared to warfarin across the \ndifferent levels of center TTR; within the highest quartile of TTR according to center, the hazard ratio \nfor apixaban vs warfarin was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.38, 1.40). \n \nKey secondary endpoints of major bleeding and all cause death were tested in a pre-specified \nhierarchical testing strategy to control the overall type 1 error in the trial.

The mean age was 69.9 years, 94% \nofpatients randomised, had a CHA2DS2-VASc score > 2, and 47% had a HAS-BLED score > 3. \nForpatients randomised to VKA, the proportion of time in therapeutic range (TTR) (INR 2-3) was \n56%,with 32% of time below TTR and 12% above TTR. \n \nThe primary objective of AUGUSTUS was to assess safety, with a primary endpoint of ISTH major \norCRNM bleeding. In the apixaban versus VKA comparison, the primary safety endpoint of ISTH \nmajoror CRNM bleeding at month 6 occurred in 241 (10.5%), and 332 (14.7%) patients in the \napixaban armand in the VKA arm respectively (HR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.82; 2-sided p<0.0001 for \nnon inferiorityand p<0.0001 for superiority). For VKA, additional analyses using subgroups by TTR \nshowed that thehighest rate of bleeding was associated with the lowest quartile of TTR. The rate of \nbleeding wassimilar between apixaban and the highest quartile of TTR. \nIn the ASA versus placebo comparison, the primary safety endpoint of ISTH major or CRNMbleeding \nat month 6 occurred in 367 (16.1%), and 204 (9.0%) patients in the ASA arm and in theplacebo arm \nrespectively (HR=1.88, 95% CI: 1.58, 2.23; two-sided p<0.0001). \n \nSpecifically, in apixaban-treated patients, major or CRNM bleeding occurred in 157 (13.7%), and \n84(7.4%) patients in the ASA arm and in the placebo arm respectively. In VKA-treated patients, major \norCRNM bleeding occurred in 208 (18.5%), and 122 (10.8%) patients in the ASA arm and in \ntheplacebo arm respectively. \n \nOther treatment effects were evaluated as a secondary objective of the study, with composite end \npoints. \nIn the apixaban versus VKA comparison, the composite endpoint of death or re-hospitalization \noccurred in 541 (23.5%) and 632 (27.4%) patients in the apixaban and in the VKA arm, respectively. \nThe composite endpoint of death or ischemic event (stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis \norurgent revascularization) occurred in 170 (7.4%), and 182 (7.9%) patients in the apixaban and in \ntheVKA arm, respectively. \n \nIn the ASA versus placebo comparison, the composite endpoint of death or re-hospitalization occurred \nin 604 (26.2%) and 569 (24.7%) patients in the ASA and in the placebo arm, respectively. The \ncomposite endpoint of death or ischemic event (stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis or \nurgent revascularization) occurred in 163 (7.1%), and 189 (8.2%) patients in the ASA and in \ntheplacebo arm, respectively. \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nEMANATE, an open-label, multi-center study, enrolled 1500 patients who were either oral \nanticoagulant naïve or pre-treated less than 48 hours, and scheduled for cardioversion for NVAF. \nPatients were randomized 1:1 to apixaban or to heparin and/or VKA for the prevention of \ncardiovascular events. Electrical and/or pharmacologic cardioversion was conducted after at least 5 \ndoses of 5 mg twice daily apixaban (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients (see section 4.2)) or at \nleast 2 hours after a 10 mg loading dose (or a 5 mg loading dose in selected patients (see section 4.2)) \nif earlier cardioversion was required. In the apixaban group, 342 patients received a loading dose (331 \npatients received the 10 mg dose and 11 patients received the 5 mg dose). \n \nThere were no strokes (0%) in the apixaban group (n= 753) and 6 (0.80%) strokes in the heparin \nand/or VKA group (n = 747; RR 0.00, 95% CI 0.00, 0.64). All-cause death occurred in 2 patients \n\n\n\n46 \n\n(0.27%) in the apixaban group and 1 patient (0.13%) in the heparin and/or VKA group. No systemic \nembolism events were reported. \n \nMajor bleeding and CRNM bleeding events occurred in 3 (0.41%) and 11 (1.50%) patients, \nrespectively, in the apixaban group, compared to 6 (0.83%) and 13 (1.80%) patients in the heparin \nand/or VKA group. \n \nThis exploratory study showed comparable efficacy and safety between apixaban and heparin and/or \nVKA treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTEt) \nThe clinical program (AMPLIFY: apixaban versus enoxaparin/warfarin, AMPLIFY-EXT: apixaban \nversus placebo) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of apixaban for the treatment of \nDVT and/or PE (AMPLIFY), and extended therapy for the prevention of recurrent DVT and/or PE \nfollowing 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant treatment for DVT and/or PE (AMPLIFY-EXT). Both \nstudies were randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, multinational trials in patients with \nsymptomatic proximal DVT or symptomatic PE. All the key safety and efficacy endpoints were \nadjudicated by an independent blinded committee. \n \nAMPLIFY STUDY \nIn the AMPLIFY study a total of 5,395 patients were randomised to treatment with apixaban 10 mg \ntwice daily orally for 7 days followed by apixaban 5 mg twice daily orally for 6 months, or enoxaparin \n1 mg/kg twice daily subcutaneously for at least 5 days (until INR≥ 2) and warfarin (target INR range \n2.0-3.0) orally for 6 months. \n \nThe mean age was 56.9 years and 89.8% of randomised patients had unprovoked VTE events. \nFor patients randomised to warfarin, the mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0) \nwas 60.9. Apixaban showed a reduction in recurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE- related death across \nthe different levels of center TTR; within the highest quartile of TTR according to center, the relative \nrisk for apixaban vs enoxaparin/warfarin was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.39, 1.61). \n \nIn the study, apixaban was shown to be non-inferior to enoxaparin/warfarin in the combined primary \nendpoint of adjudicated recurrent symptomatic VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal PE) or VTE-related \ndeath (see Table 8). \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nTable 8: Efficacy results in the AMPLIFY study \n Apixaban \n\nN=2,609 \nn (%) \n\nEnoxaparin/ \nwarfarin \nN=2,635 \n\nn (%) \n\nRelative risk \n(95% CI) \n\nVTE or VTE-related \ndeath \n\n59 (2.3) 71 (2.7) 0.84 (0.60, 1.18)* \n\n DVT 20 (0.7) 33 (1.2)  \n\n PE 27 (1.0) 23 (0.9)  \n\n VTE-related \n death \n\n12 (0.4) 15 (0.6)  \n\nVTE or all-cause \ndeath \n\n84 (3.2) 104 (4.0) 0.82 (0.61, 1.08) \n\nVTE or CV-related \ndeath \n\n61 (2.3) 77 (2.9) 0.80 (0.57, 1.11) \n\nVTE, VTE-related \ndeath, or major \nbleeding \n\n73 (2.8) 118 (4.5) 0.62 (0.47, 0.83) \n\n* Noninferior compared to enoxaparin/warfarin (p-value < 0.0001) \n \nApixaban efficacy in initial treatment of VTE was consistent between patients who were treated for a \nPE [Relative Risk 0.9; 95% CI (0.5, 1.6)] or DVT [Relative Risk 0.8; 95% CI (0.5, 1.3)].

Apixaban is \nrapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 3 to 4 hours after tablet intake. Intake \nwith food does not affect apixaban AUC or Cmax at the 10 mg dose. Apixaban can be taken with or \nwithout food. \n \nApixaban demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics with dose proportional increases in exposure for oral \ndoses up to 10 mg. At doses ≥ 25 mg apixaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased \nbioavailability. Apixaban exposure parameters exhibit low to moderate variability reflected by a \nwithin-subject and inter-subject variability of ~20% CV and ~30% CV, respectively. \n \nFollowing oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets suspended in 30 mL of \nwater, exposure was comparable to exposure after oral administration of 2 whole 5 mg tablets. \nFollowing oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets with 30 g of apple \npuree, the Cmax and AUC were 21% and 16% lower, respectively, when compared to administration of \n2 whole 5 mg tablets. The reduction in exposure is not considered clinically relevant. \n \nFollowing administration of a crushed 5 mg apixaban tablet suspended in 60 mL of G5W and \ndelivered via a nasogastric tube, exposure was similar to exposure seen in other clinical trials \ninvolving healthy subjects receiving a single oral 5 mg apixaban tablet dose. \n \nGiven the predictable, dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile of apixaban, the bioavailability \nresults from the conducted studies are applicable to lower apixaban doses. \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in humans is approximately 87%. The volume of distribution (Vss) is \napproximately 21 litres. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \nApixaban has multiple routes of elimination. Of the administered apixaban dose in humans, \napproximately 25% was recovered as metabolites, with the majority recovered in faeces. Renal \nexcretion of apixaban accounts for approximately 27% of total clearance. Additional contributions \nfrom biliary and direct intestinal excretion were observed in clinical and nonclinical studies, \nrespectively. \n \nApixaban has a total clearance of about 3.3 L/h and a half-life of approximately 12 hours. \n \nO-demethylation and hydroxylation at the 3-oxopiperidinyl moiety are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Apixaban is metabolised mainly via CYP3A4/5 with minor contributions from \nCYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2J2. Unchanged apixaban is the major drug-related component in \nhuman plasma with no active circulating metabolites present. Apixaban is a substrate of transport \nproteins, P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was no impact of impaired renal function on peak concentration of apixaban. There was an \nincrease in apixaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via measured \ncreatinine clearance. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 51-80 mL/min), moderate \n(creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15-29 mL/min) renal \nimpairment, apixaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 16, 29, and 44% respectively, \ncompared to individuals with normal creatinine clearance. Renal impairment had no evident effect on \nthe relationship between apixaban plasma concentration and anti-FXa activity. \n \nIn subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the AUC of apixaban was increased by 36% when a \nsingle dose of apixaban 5 mg was administered immediately after haemodialysis, compared to that \nseen in subjects with normal renal function. Haemodialysis, started two hours after administration of a \nsingle dose of apixaban 5 mg, decreased apixaban AUC by 14% in these ESRD subjects, \ncorresponding to an apixaban dialysis clearance of 18 mL/min. Therefore, haemodialysis is unlikely to \nbe an effective means of managing apixaban overdose. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a study comparing 8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh A score 5 (n = 6) and \nscore 6 (n = 2), and 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh B score 7 (n = 6) and \nscore 8 (n = 2), to 16 healthy control subjects, the single-dose pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics of apixaban 5 mg were not altered in subjects with hepatic impairment. Changes in \nanti-Factor Xa activity and INR were comparable between subjects with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment and healthy subjects. \n \nElderly \nElderly patients (above 65 years) exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with \nmean AUC values being approximately 32% higher and no difference in Cmax. \n \nGender \nExposure to apixaban was approximately 18% higher in females than in males. \n \nEthnic origin and race \nThe results across phase I studies showed no discernible difference in apixaban pharmacokinetics \nbetween White/Caucasian, Asian and Black/African American subjects. Findings from a population \npharmacokinetic analysis in patients who received apixaban were generally consistent with the phase I \nresults. \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nBody weight \nCompared to apixaban exposure in subjects with body weight of 65 to 85 kg, body weight > 120 kg \nwas associated with approximately 30% lower exposure and body weight < 50 kg was associated with \napproximately 30% higher exposure. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nThe pharmacokinetic /pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between apixaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (anti-FXa activity, INR, PT, aPTT) has been evaluated after \nadministration of a wide range of doses (0.5 – 50 mg). The relationship between apixaban plasma \nconcentration and anti-Factor Xa activity was best described by a linear model. The PK/PD \nrelationship observed in patients was consistent with that established in healthy subjects. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, fertility and embryo-foetal \ndevelopment and juvenile toxicity. \n \nThe major observed effects in the repeated dose toxicity studies were those related to the \npharmacodynamic action of apixaban on blood coagulation parameters. In the toxicity studies little to \nno increase of bleeding tendency was found. However, since this may be due to a lower sensitivity of \nthe non-clinical species compared to humans, this result should be interpreted with caution when \nextrapolating to humans. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Apixaban Accord is and what it is used for \n \nApixaban Accordcontains the active substance apixaban and belongs to a group of medicines called \nanticoagulants. This medicine helps to prevent blood clots from forming by blocking Factor Xa, which \nis an important component of blood clotting. \n \nApixaban Accord is used in adults: \n- to prevent blood clots (deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) from forming after hip or knee replacement \n\noperations. After an operation to the hip or knee you may be at a higher risk of developing blood \nclots in your leg veins. This can cause the legs to swell, with or without pain. If a blood clot travels \nfrom your leg to your lungs, it can block blood flow causing breathlessness, with or without chest \npain. This condition (pulmonary embolism) can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical \nattention. \n\n \n- to prevent a blood clot from forming in the heart in patients with an irregular heart beat (atrial \n\nfibrillation) and at least one additional risk factor. Blood clots may break off and travel to the brain \nand lead to a stroke or travelto other organs and prevent normal blood flow to that organ (also \nknown as a systemic embolism). A stroke can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical \nattention. \n\n \n- to treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of your \n\nlungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood vessels of \nyour legs and/or lungs. \n\n \n \n2.
