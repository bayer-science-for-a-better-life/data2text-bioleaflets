PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolutions for sealant. \n \nClear or slightly opalescent solutions. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEVICEL is indicated in adults as supportive treatment in surgery where standard surgical techniques are \ninsufficient, for improvement of haemostasis (see section 5.1). \n \nEVICEL is also indicated in adults as suture support for haemostasis in vascular surgery and for suture line \nsealing in dura mater closure. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of EVICEL is restricted to experienced surgeons who have been trained in the use of EVICEL. \n \nPosology \n \nThe volume of EVICEL to be applied and the frequency of application should always be oriented towards \nthe underlying clinical needs of the patient. \n \nThe dose to be applied is governed by variables including, but not limited to, the type of surgical \nintervention, the size of the area and the mode of intended application and the number of applications. \nApplication of the product must be individualised by the treating physician. In controlled clinical trials in \nvascular surgery, the individual dosage used was up to 4 ml; for suture line sealing in dura mater closure, \ndoses of up to 8 ml were used, whereas in retroperitoneal or intra-abdominal surgery the individual dosage \nused was up to 10 ml. However, for some procedures (e.g., liver traumata) larger volumes may be required. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nThe initial volume of the product to be applied at a chosen anatomic site or target surface area should be \nsufficient to entirely cover the intended application area. The application can be repeated, if necessary. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nEvicel is for epilesional use. \n \nFor instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. The product \nshould only be administered according to the instructions and with the devices recommended for this product \n(see section 6.6). \n \nPrior to applying EVICEL the surface area of the wound needs to be dried by standard techniques (e.g. \nintermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices).  \n \nTo avoid the risk of potentially life-threatening air or gas embolism EVICEL should be sprayed using \npressurised CO2 gas only. For spray application see sections 4.4 and 6.6 for specific recommendations on the \nrequired pressure and distance from tissue per surgical procedure and length of applicator tip. \n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nEVICEL must not be applied intravascularly. \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nSpray application of EVICEL should not be used in endoscopic procedures. For laparoscopy, see section 4.4. \n \nEVICEL must not be used for sealing the suture line in dura mater if there are gaps of greater than 2 mm \nafter suturing. \n \nEVICEL must not be used as a glue for the fixation of dural patches. \n \nEVICEL must not be used as a sealant when the dura mater cannot be sutured. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEVICEL is for epilesional use only. It must not be applied intravascularly. \n \nLife-threatening thromboembolic complications may occur if the product is unintentionally applied \nintravascularly. \n \nLife-threatening air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing pressure regulator \nto administer EVICEL. This event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at higher than \nrecommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface.   \n \nEVICEL spray application should only be used if it is possible to accurately judge the spray distance, \nespecially during laparoscopy. Spray distance from tissue and CO2 pressure should be within the ranges \nrecommended by the manufacturer (see table in section 6.6 for pressure and distance).   \n \nWhen spraying EVICEL, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation, and end tidal CO2 should be \nmonitored because of the possibility of occurrence of a gas embolism.  \n \nWhen using accessory tips with this product, the instructions for use of the tips should be followed. \n \nBefore administration of EVICEL, care is to be taken that parts of the body outside the desired application \narea are sufficiently protected (covered) to prevent tissue adhesion at undesired sites.  \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \nEVICEL should be applied as a thin layer. Excessive clot thickness may negatively interfere with the \nproduct\u2019s efficacy and the wound healing process \n \nAdequate data are not available to support the use of this product in tissue gluing, application through a \nflexible endoscope for treatment of bleeding, or in gastrointestinal anastomoses. \n \nAs with any protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Signs of hypersensitivity \nreactions include hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. \nIf these symptoms occur, the administration should be discontinued immediately.  \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nThe concomitant use of EVICEL for dural suture line sealing with implants from synthetic materials or dural \npatches has not been evaluated in clinical studies.  \n \nThe use of EVICEL in patients undergoing radiotherapy within 7 days after surgery has not been evaluated. \nIt is not known whether radiation therapy could affect the efficacy of fibrin sealant when used for suture line \nsealing in dura mater closure. \n \nComplete haemostasis should be achieved before application of EVICEL to seal the dural suture line. \n \nThe use of EVICEL as a sealant in transphenoidal and otoneurosurgical procedures has not been studied. \n \nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human \nblood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific \nmarkers of infection, and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of \nviruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the \npossibility of transmitting infectious agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or \nemerging viruses and other pathogens.  \n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, and \nhepatitis B virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus. The measures taken may be of limited value \nagainst non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant \nwomen (foetal infection) and for individuals with immunodeficiency or increased erythropoiesis (e.g., \nhaemolytic anaemia). \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time EVICEL is administered to a patient, the name and batch number \nof the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the product. \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed.  \n \nSimilar to comparable products or thrombin solutions, the product may be denatured after exposure to \nsolutions containing alcohol, iodine or heavy metals (e.g., antiseptic solutions). Such substances should be \nremoved to the greatest possible extent before applying the product. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nThe safety of fibrin sealants/haemostatics for use in human pregnancy or during breast-feeding has not been \nestablished in controlled clinical trials. Experimental animal studies are insufficient to assess the safety with \nrespect to reproduction, development of the embryo or foetus, the course of gestation, and peri- and \npost-natal development. Therefore, the product should be administered to pregnant and breast-feeding \nwomen only if clearly needed. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \napplication site, bronchospasm, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, \nnausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) may occur in rare \ncases in patients treated with fibrin sealants/haemostatics. In isolated cases, these reactions have progressed \nto severe anaphylaxis. Such reactions may especially be seen if the preparation is applied repeatedly, or \nadministered to patients known to be hypersensitive to constituents of the product. \n Antibodies against components of fibrin sealant/haemostatic products may occur rarely. \n \nInadvertent intravascular injection could lead to thromboembolic event and disseminated intravascular \ncoagulation (DIC), and there is also a risk of anaphylactic reaction (see section 4.4). \n\nLife-threatening air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing pressure regulator \nto administer EVICEL. This event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at higher than \nrecommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface. \n \nFor safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and Preferred \nTerm Level). Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: Very common \n(\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very \nrare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).  \n \n \nMedDRA System Organ Class Preferred Term  Frequency \n\nAdverse reactions in retroperitoneal or intra-abdominal surgery studies  \n\nInfections and infestations Abdominal abscess \nPyrexia \n\nCommon \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nCoagulopathy Common \n\nAdverse reactions in vascular surgery study  \n\nInfections and infestations Graft infection, Staphylococcal \ninfection \n\nUncommon \n\nVascular disorders Haematoma Uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nOedema peripheral \n \n\nUncommon \n\nInvestigations Decreased haemoglobin Uncommon \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications \n\nIncision site haemorrhage \nVascular graft occlusion \nWound \nPost procedural haematoma \nPost-operative wound complication \n\nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n\nAdverse reactions in neurosurgery study  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nInfections and infestations  Meningitis Common \n\nNervous system disorders Intracranial hypotension (CSF \nleakage) \nCSF rhinorrhoea \nHeadache \nHydrocephalus \nSubdural hygroma \n\nCommon \n \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n\nVascular disorders Haematoma Common \n\n \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reaction rates in retroperitoneal or intra-abdominal surgery studies \n \nAmong 135 patients undergoing retroperitoneal and intra-abdominal surgery (67 patients treated with \nEVICEL and 68 controls), no adverse events were considered to be causally related to the study treatment \naccording to the investigator assessments. However, 3 serious adverse events (SAE) (one abdominal abscess \nin the EVICEL group and one abdominal and one pelvic abscess in the control group) were considered by \nthe Sponsor to be possibly related to study treatment. \nIn a study in a paediatric population involving 40 patients (20 patients treated with EVICEL and 20 \ncontrols), two adverse events (pyrexia and coagulopathy) were considered possibly related to EVICEL by the \ninvestigator. \n \nAdverse reactions \u2013 vascular surgery  \n \nIn a controlled study involving 147 patients undergoing vascular grafting procedures (75 treated with \nEVICEL and 72 controls), a total of 16 subjects were reported to have had a graft thrombosis/occlusion \nadverse event during the study period. The events were evenly distributed across treatment arms, with 8 each \nin the EVICEL and the control groups.  \n \nA non-interventional post-authorisation safety study was conducted which involved 300 patients undergoing \nvascular surgery during which EVICEL was used.  Safety monitoring focused on the specific adverse \nreactions of graft patency, thrombotic events, and bleeding events.  No adverse reactions were reported \nduring the study.   \n \nAdverse reactions \u2013 neurosurgery \n \nIn a controlled study involving 139 patients undergoing elective neurosurgical procedures (89 treated with \nEVICEL and 50 controls), a total of 7 subjects treated with EVICEL experienced nine AEs that were \nconsidered to be possibly related to the study product. These included intracranial hypotension (CSF \nleakage), CSF rhinorrhea, meningitis, headache, hydrocephalus, subdural hygroma, and haematoma.  \n \nThe incidence of CSF leakage and the incidence of Surgical Site Infections were monitored as safety \nendpoints in the study.  At 30 days post-operatively the incidence of SSIs was similar between the two \ntreatment groups.  Post-operative CSF leakage occurred within 30 days from treatment in 4/89 (4.5%) \nsubjects treated with EVICEL (two cases of CSF leakage with impaired wound healing and two cases of \nrhinorrhoea) and in 1/50 (2.0%) subjects treated with additional sutures. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: local haemostatics, combinations, ATC code: B02BC30  \n \nMechanism of action  \nThe fibrin adhesion system initiates the last phase of physiological blood coagulation. Conversion of \nfibrinogen into fibrin occurs by the splitting of fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and fibrinopeptides. The \nfibrin monomers aggregate and form a fibrin clot. Factor XIIIa, which is activated from Factor XIII by \nthrombin, crosslinks fibrin. Calcium ions are required for both, the conversion of fibrinogen and the \ncrosslinking of fibrin. As wound healing progresses, increased fibrinolytic activity is induced by plasmin and \ndecomposition of fibrin to fibrin degradation products is initiated.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nClinical studies demonstrating haemostasis and suture support were conducted in a total of 147 patients \n(75 with EVICEL, 72 with control) undergoing vascular surgery with PTFE grafts and in a total of \n135 patients (66 with EVICEL, 69 with control) undergoing retroperitoneal and intra-abdominal surgery. \n \nThe efficacy of EVICEL for suture line sealing in dura mater closure was demonstrated in 139 patients \n(89 treated with EVICEL and 50 controls) undergoing craniotomy/craniectomy procedures.  \n \nPaediatric population  \nLimited paediatric data are available to support efficacy and safety of EVICEL in this population. Of \n135 patients undergoing retroperitoneal and intra-abdominal surgery who were included in the controlled \nstudy of EVICEL, 4 paediatric patients were treated with EVICEL. Of these, 2 were children aged 2 and \n5 years and 2 were adolescents of 16 years. In addition, a paediatric controlled clinical study evaluating the \nsafety and effectiveness of EVICEL as an adjunct to haemostasis in soft tissue or parenchymal organ \nbleeding was conducted in 40 patients (20 treated with EVICEL and 20 controls). The patients age range was \nfrom 11 months to 17 years. Data from this study were consistent with results from the previous study in \nretroperitoneal and intra-abdominal surgery where non-inferior haemostatic efficacy of EVICEL was \ndemonstrated.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nEVICEL is intended for epilesional use only. Intravascular administration is contraindicated. As a \nconsequence, intravascular pharmacokinetic studies were not performed in man. \n \nStudies have been conducted in rabbits to evaluate the absorption and elimination of thrombin when applied \nto the cut surface of the liver resulting from partial hepatectomy. Using 125I-thrombin it was shown that a \nslow absorption of biologically inactive peptides resulting from the breakdown of thrombin occurred, \nreaching a Cmax in the plasma after 6-8 hours. At the Cmax, the plasma concentration represented only 1-2% of \nthe applied dose.  \n \nFibrin sealants/haemostatics are metabolised in the same way as endogenous fibrin, by fibrinolysis and \nphagocytosis. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nStudies performed in bacteria to determine mutagenicity were negative for thrombin alone, Biological Active \nComponent (containing fibrinogen, citrate, glycine, tranexamic acid, and arginine hydrochloride), TnBP \nalone, and Triton X-100 alone at all concentrations tested. All concentrations of the combination of TnBP \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nand Triton X-100 also tested negative in assays performed to determine mammalian cell mutagenicity, \nchromosomal aberrations and micronuclei induction. \n \nAfter local application, absorption of thrombin into the plasma is slow and consists principally of thrombin \ndegradation products which are eliminated. \n \nNo toxicological effects due to the solvent detergent reagents (TnBP and Triton X-100) used in the virus \ninactivation procedure are expected since the residual levels are less than 5 \u00b5g/ml. \n \nNeurotoxicity studies performed with EVICEL confirmed that subdural administration in the rabbit was not \nassociated with any evidence of neurotoxicity. Neurobehavioral observations for 14\u00b11 days showed no \nabnormal findings. No major macroscopic signs of local intolerance and no treatment-related macroscopic \nfindings were observed. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid did not reveal major signs of inflammation. \n \n \n6.

The new expiry date at \n2\uf0b0C-8\uf0b0C should be noted on the carton but should not exceed the expiry date printed by the manufacturer on \nthe carton and label. At the end of this period the product has to be used or discarded. \n \nOnce drawn up into the application device, the product must be used immediately. \n \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nEVICEL is supplied as a package containing two separate vials (glass type I) with rubber stoppers (type I), \neach containing 1 ml, 2 ml, or 5 ml solution of Human Fibrinogen and Human Thrombin, respectively. \n \nAn application device and appropriate accessory tips are supplied separately. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nThe instructions for use are also described in the healthcare professionals package leaflet part. \nThe solutions are clear or slightly opalescent. Solutions that are cloudy or have deposits should not be used. \n \nThawing \n \nThe vials should be thawed in one of the following ways: \n2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C (refrigerator): vials thaw within 1 day, or \n20\u00b0C-25\u00b0C (room temperature): vials thaw within 1 hour, or \n37\u00b0C (e.g., water bath, using aseptic technique, or by warming vials in the hand): vials should be thawed \nwithin 10 minutes and must not be left at this temperature for longer than 10 minutes or until fully thawed. \nThe temperature must not exceed 37\u00b0C.  \n \nBefore use, the product must reach 20-30\u00b0C.  \n \nDevice assembly \n \nEVICEL should only be applied using the CE-marked EVICEL application device and optional use of \naccessory tips to the device. Leaflets giving detailed instructions for use of EVICEL in conjunction with the \napplication device and optional accessory tips are provided with the package of the application device and of \nthe accessory tips. The accessory tips should only be used by persons adequately trained in laparoscopic, \nlaparoscopic-assisted, or open surgical procedures. \n \nDraw the contents of the two vials into the application device, following the instructions for use in the device \npackage. Both syringes should be filled with equal volumes, and should not contain air bubbles. No needles \nare involved in the preparation of EVICEL for administration. \n \nApplication by dripping  \n\n \nKeeping the tip of the applicator as close to the tissue surface as possible, but without touching the tissue \nduring application, apply individual drops to the area to be treated. If the applicator tip becomes blocked, the \ncatheter tip can be cut back in 0.5 cm increments.   \n \nSpray application  \n \nTo avoid the risk of potentially life-threatening air or gas embolism EVICEL should be sprayed using \npressurized CO2 gas only (see table below).  \n\nThe pressure regulator should be used in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nConnect the short tube on the application device to the male luer-lock end of the long gas tube. Connect the \nfemale luer lock of the gas tube (with the 0.2 \u03bcm bacteriostatic filter) to a pressure regulator.  \n\n \nWhen applying EVICEL using a spray device, it has to be ensured that the pressure and the distance from the \ntissue are within the ranges recommended by the marketing authorisation holder of this product, as given in \nthe following table: \n \n\nSurgery Spray set  \nto be used \n\nApplicator tips  \nto be used \n\nPressure \nregulator  \nto be used \n\nRecommended \ndistance from \ntarget tissue \n\nRecommended \nspray pressure \n\nOpen \nsurgery \n\n \nEVICEL \n\nApplicator \nDevice \n\n6 cm Flexible Tip  \nOmrix \n\nPressure \nRegulator \n\n10 \u2013 15 cm \n(4 \u2013 6 in) \n\n20 \u2013 25 psi \n(1.4 \u2013 1.7 bar) 35 cm Rigid Tip45 cm Flexible Tip\n\nLaparoscopic \nprocedures \n\n35 cm Rigid Tip \n4 \u2013 10 cm \n(1.6 \u2013 4 in) \n\n15 \u2013 20 psi \n(1.0 \u2013 1.4 bar)\n\n45 cm Flexible Tip 20 psi \n(1.4 bar)\n\n \n\nThe product should then be sprayed onto the surface of the tissue in short bursts (0.1-0.2 ml) to form a thin, \neven layer. EVICEL forms a clear film over the area of application.  \n\n \nWhen spraying EVICEL, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation and end tidal CO2 should be \nmonitored because of the possibility of occurrence of gas embolism. \n \nWhen using accessory tips with this product, the instructions for use of the tips should be followed. \n \nDisposal \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n \n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nEVICEL solutions for sealant \n \n\nhuman fibrinogen \nhuman thrombin \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n \n \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n\n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n \n1. What EVICEL is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use EVICEL \n3. How to use EVICEL  \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store EVICEL \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What EVICEL is and what it is used for \n \nEVICEL is a Human Fibrin Sealant which is supplied as a package containing two separate vials, each \ncontaining 1 ml, 2 ml or 5 ml of solution (Human Fibrinogen and Human Thrombin respectively).  \n \nAn application device and appropriate accessory tips are supplied separately. \n \nFibrinogen is a concentrate of clottable protein and thrombin is an enzyme that causes clottable protein to \ncoalesce. Thus, when the two components are mixed together they clot instantly. \n \nEVICEL is applied in adults during surgical operations to reduce bleeding and oozing during and after the \noperation.  \n \nEVICEL can be used in blood vessel surgery and in surgery taking place on the posterior abdominal wall. \nEVICEL can also be used to support the watertight closure of the cerebral envelopes (dura mater) during \nneurosurgery when other surgical techniques are insufficient.  \n \nIt is dripped or sprayed onto cut tissue where it forms a thin layer that seals the tissue and/or stops bleeding. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use EVICEL \n \nDo not use EVICEL \n \n\uf0b7 If you are hypersensitive (allergic) to products made from human blood or to any of the other ingredients \n\nof EVICEL (listed in section 6). Signs of allergic reactions include hives, rash, tightness of the chest, \nwheezing, drop in blood pressure, and breathing difficulties. If these symptoms occur, the administration \nhas to be discontinued immediately. \n\n\uf0b7 EVICEL must not be applied intravascularly. \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n\uf0b7 EVICEL should not be used in endoscopic surgery. For laparoscopy, see recommendations below. \n\uf0b7 EVICEL must not be used for sealing the suture line in dura mater if there are gaps of greater than 2 mm \n\nafter suturing. \n\uf0b7 EVICEL must not be used as a glue for the fixation of dural patches. \n\uf0b7 EVICEL must not be used as a sealant when the dura mater cannot be sutured. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \n\uf0b7 To avoid the risk of potentially fatal air or gas embolism EVICEL should be sprayed using \n\npressurised CO2 gas only. \n \n\uf0b7 Prior to applying EVICEL, the surface area of the wound needs to be dried by standard techniques (e.g. \n\nintermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices). \n \n\uf0b7 When EVICEL is applied during surgery, the surgeon must ensure that it is only applied onto the surface \n\nof tissue. EVICEL must not be injected into tissue or blood vessels because it would cause clots which \ncould be fatal.  \n\n \n\uf0b7 The use of EVICEL has not been studied in the following procedures, and there is therefore no \n\ninformation to show that it would be effective in these procedures: \n\uf0b7 gluing tissues together \n\uf0b7 surgery to the brain or spinal cord except for support of watertight closure of cerebral envelopes \n\n(dura mater) \n\uf0b7 controlling bleeding in the stomach or intestines by applying the product through an endoscope \n\n(tube) \n\uf0b7 sealing surgical repairs to the intestines \n\uf0b7 sealing in transphenoidal and otoneurosurgical procedures \n\n \n\uf0b7 It is not known whether radiation therapy could affect the effectiveness of fibrin sealant when used for \n\nsuture line sealing during neurosurgery. \n \n\uf0b7 Use of EVICEL during neurosurgery in patients who are also being treated with implants or with dural \n\npatches has not been evaluated in clinical studies. \n \n\uf0b7 The bleeding should be controlled before EVICEL is used to seal the dural suture line. \n \n\uf0b7 EVICEL will be applied as a thin layer. Excessive clot thickness may negatively interfere with the \n\nproduct\u2019s efficacy and the wound healing process. \n \nLife-threatening air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing a pressure \nregulator to administer EVICEL. This event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at higher than \nrecommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface. EVICEL spray application should \nonly be used if it is possible to accurately judge the spray distance, especially during laparoscopy. Spray \ndistance from tissue and pressure should be within the ranges recommended by the manufacturer (see table \nin section Instructions for Use). When spraying EVICEL, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen \nsaturation, and end tidal CO2 should be monitored because of the possibility of occurrence of air or gas \nembolism. Spray devices and accessory tips provide instructions for use with recommendations for pressure \nranges and proximity to tissue surface, which should be carefully followed.  \n \n\uf0b7 Nearby areas should be protected to make sure that EVICEL is only applied onto the surface which is to \n\nbe treated. \n \n\uf0b7 As with any product containing proteins, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Signs of \n\nsuch reactions include hives, rash, tightness of the chest, wheezing, drop in blood pressure and \nanaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur, the administration has to be discontinued immediately. \n\n \n\uf0b7 When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put into place to prevent \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\ninfections being passed on to patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to \nmake sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools of \nplasma for signs of viruses/infections. Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the \nprocessing of the blood and plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when \nmedicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on \ninfection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses, or other \ntypes of infections. \n\n \nThe measures taken in the manufacture of fibrinogen and thrombin are considered effective for lipid coated \nviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus, and the \nnon-enveloped virus, hepatitis A. The measures taken may be of limited value against parvovirus B19. \nParvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals whose \nimmune system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia (e.g., sickle cell disease or haemolytic \nanaemia). \n \nThe healthcare professionals will record the name and batch number of the medicinal product in order to \ntrace any possible infection source. \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nLimited paediatric data are available to support efficacy and safety of EVICEL in this population.   \n \nOther medicines and EVICEL \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines, \neven those not prescribed. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nThere is not enough information available to know whether any particular risks are associated with the use of \nEVICEL during pregnancy or whilst breast-feeding. However, since EVICEL is used during a surgical \noperation, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, you should discuss the overall risks of the operation with \nyour doctor. \n \n \n3. How to use EVICEL \n \nThe doctor treating you will administer EVICEL during surgery. During your operation, your doctor will \ndrip or spray EVICEL onto raw tissue, using an application device. This device allows equal amounts of the \ntwo components of EVICEL to be administered at the same time, and ensures that they mix evenly, which is \nimportant for the sealant to have its optimal effect. \n \nThe amount of EVICEL that will be applied depends on the surface area of tissue to be treated during the \noperation. It will be dripped onto the tissue in very small amounts or sprayed in short bursts (0.1-0.2 ml), to \nproduce a thin, even layer. If application of a single layer of EVICEL does not completely stop the bleeding, \na second layer may be applied. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The following \nside effects which occurred during clinical studies were considered to be related to the use of EVICEL:  \n \nMost serious side effects \n\u2013 Watery fluid coming out of your wound or nose (CSF leakage/CSF rhinorrhea) \n\u2013 Headache, nausea, and vomiting (due to Subdural Hygroma, which is accumulation of CSF in the subdural \nspace) \n\u2013 Fever, or prolonged constipation, flatulence (due to abdominal abscess) \n \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nThe frequency of the effects listed above was common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). \n \n- Numbness or pain in your extremities, change in skin colour (due to Graft Occlusion or Thrombosis) \nThe frequency of this effect was uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n \n \nIf you experience any of the above mentioned symptoms, or any other symptoms related to your surgery, \nplease contact your doctor or surgeon immediately. If you feel unwell tell your doctor immediately, even if \nyour symptoms are different from those just described. \n \nOther side effects \nOther side effects which were reported to be common during clinical trials with EVICEL (i.e., may affect up \nto 1 in 10 people) included meningitis, fever, difficulties with blood clotting and accumulation of CSF fluid \nin the brain cavities (hydrocephalus). The frequency of all of these effects was common. \n \nSide effects which were uncommon during clinical trials with EVICEL (i.e., may affect up to 1 in \n100 people) included infection, blood accumulation (haematoma), swelling, decreased haemoglobin, and \npost-operative wound complications (including bleeding or infection). \n \nEVICEL is a fibrin sealant.  Fibrin sealants in general may, in rare cases (up to 1 patient in 1,000 people), \ncause an allergic reaction.  If you experience an allergic reaction you might have one or more of the \nfollowing symptoms: skin rash, hives or wheals (nettle-rash), tightness of the chest, chills, flushing, \nheadache, low blood pressure, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, increased heart rate, tingling, vomiting, or \nwheezing. No allergic reactions have so far been reported in patients treated with EVICEL. \n \nThere is also a theoretical possibility that you could develop antibodies to the proteins in EVICEL, which \ncould potentially interfere with blood clotting. The frequency of the type of event is not known (cannot be \nestimated from available data). \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor , pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

Do not use after the expiry date stated on \nthe carton. \nWithin the 2 years shelf life, after thawing, unopened vials can be stored at 2oC - 8\uf0b0C (in a refrigerator) and \nprotected from light, for up to 30 days. The date on which refrigerator storage was started should be marked \non the carton in the space provided. Do not re-freeze. The fibrinogen and thrombin components are stable at \nroom temperature for up to 24 hours but when they have been drawn up into the administration device, they \nmust be used immediately. \n \nThe vials must be stored in an upright position. \nDo not use after the expiry date stated on the carton and label.  \nKeep out of sight and reach of children. \n \nThe application device should be stored at room temperature, separately from the fibrinogen and thrombin.  \n \nThawing \n \nThe vials should be thawed in one of the following ways: \n2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C (refrigerator): vials thaw within 1 day,  \n20\u00b0C-25\u00b0C (room temperature): vials thaw within 1 hour,  \n37\u00b0C (e.g., water bath, using aseptic technique, or by warming vials in the hand): vials should be thawed \nwithin 10 minutes and must not be left at this temperature for longer than 10 minutes or until fully thawed. \nThe temperature must not exceed 37\u00b0C. \nBefore use, the product must reach 20\u00b0C-30\u00b0C. \n \nPreparation \n \nEVICEL should only be applied using the CE-marked EVICEL application device and optional use of a tip \naccessory to the device. Leaflets giving detailed instructions for use of EVICEL in conjunction with the \napplication device and optional accessory tips are provided with the package of the application device and of \nthe accessory tips. The accessory tips should only be used by persons adequately trained in laparoscopic, \nlaparoscopic-assisted, or open surgical procedures. The product should only be reconstituted and \nadministered according to the instructions and with the devices recommended for this product.  \n \nTo avoid the risk of potentially life-threatening air or gas embolism EVICEL should be sprayed using \npressurised CO2 only. \n \nThe solutions should be clear or slightly opalescent. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. \nDraw the contents of the two vials into the application device, following the instructions for use in the device \npackage. Both syringes should be filled with equal volumes, and should not contain air bubbles. No needles \nare involved in the preparation of EVICEL for administration. \n \nPrior to applying EVICEL the surface area of the wound needs to be dried by standard techniques (e.g., \nintermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nApplication by dripping  \n \nKeeping the tip of the applicator as close to the tissue surface as possible, but without touching the tissue \nduring application, apply individual drops to the area to be treated. If the applicator tip becomes blocked, the \ncatheter tip can be cut back in 0.5 cm increments.   \n \nSpray application  \n \nEVICEL must be sprayed using pressurised CO2 only. \n \nConnect the short tube on the application device to the male luer-lock end of the long gas tube. Connect the \nfemale luer-lock of the gas tube (with the 0.2 \u03bcm bacteriostatic filter) to a pressure regulator. The pressure \nregulator should be used in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  \n\n \nWhen applying EVICEL using a spray device, be sure to use a pressure and a distance from tissue within the \nranges recommended by the manufacturer: \n \nSurgery Spray set  \n\nto be used \nApplicator tips  \nto be used \n\nPressure \nregulator  \nto be used \n\nDistance from \ntarget tissue \n\nSpray \npressure \n\nOpen \nsurgery \n\n \nEVICEL \n\nApplicator \nDevice \n\n6 cm flexible tip  \nOmrix \n\nPressure \nRegulator \n\n10 \u2013 15 cm \n(4 \u2013 6 in) \n\n20 \u2013 25 psi \n(1.4 \u2013 1.7 bar) 35 cm rigid tip45 cm flexible tip\n\nLaparoscopic \nprocedures \n\n35 cm rigid tip \n4 \u2013 10 cm \n(1.6 \u2013 4 in) \n\n15 \u2013 20 psi \n(1.0 \u2013 1.4 bar)\n\n45 cm flexible tip 20 psi \n(1.4 bar)\n\n \n\nThe product should then be sprayed onto the surface of the tissue in short bursts (0.1-0.2 ml) to form a thin, \neven layer.

each containing 1 ml, 2 ml or 5 ml of solution (human fibrinogen and human thrombin respectively). an application device and appropriate accessory tips are supplied separately. fibrinogen is a concentrate of clottable protein and thrombin is an enzyme that causes clottable protein to coalesce. thus, when the two components are mixed together they clot instantly. evicel is applied in adults during surgical operations to reduce bleeding and oozing during and after the operation. evicel can be used in blood vessel surgery and in surgery taking place on the posterior abdominal wall. evicel can also be used to support the watertight closure of the cerebral envelopes (dura mater) during neurosurgery when other surgical techniques are insufficient. it is dripped or sprayed onto cut tissue where it forms a thin layer that seals the tissue and/or stops bleeding.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "evicel", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "a human fibrin

blood or to any of the other ingredients of evicel (listed in section 6). signs of allergic reactions include hives, rash, tightness of the chest, wheezing, drop in blood pressure, and breathing difficulties. if these symptoms occur, the administration has to be discontinued immediately. evicel must not be applied intravascularly. evicel should not be used in endoscopic surgery. for laparoscopy, see recommendations below. evicel must not be used for sealing the suture line in dura mater if there are gaps of greater than 2 mm after suturing. evicel must not be used as a glue for the fixation of dural patches. evicel must not be used as a sealant when the dura mater cannot be sutured. warnings and precautions to avoid the risk of potentially fatal air or gas embolism evicel should be sprayed using pressurised co2 gas only. prior to applying evicel, the surface area of the wound needs to be dried by standard techniques (e.g. intermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices). when evicel is applied during surgery, the surgeon must ensure that it is only applied onto the surface of tissue. evicel must not be injected into tissue or blood vessels because it would cause clots which could be fatal. the use of evicel has not been studied in the following procedures, and there is therefore no information to show that it would be effective in these procedures: gluing tissues together surgery to the brain or spinal cord except for support of watertight closure of cerebral envelopes (dura mater) controlling bleeding in the stomach or intestines by applying the product through an endoscope (tube) sealing surgical repairs to the intestines sealing in transphenoidal and otoneurosurgical procedures it is not known whether radiation therapy could affect the effectiveness of fibrin sealant when used for suture line sealing during neurosurgery. use of evicel during neurosurgery in patients who are also being treated with implants or with dural patches has not been evaluated in clinical studies. the bleeding should be controlled before evicel is used to seal the dural suture line. evicel will be applied as a thin layer. excessive clot thickness may negatively interfere with the product's efficacy and the wound healing process. life-threatening air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing a pressure regulator to administer evicel. this event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at higher than recommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface. evicel spray application should only be used if it is possible to accurately judge the spray distance, especially during laparoscopy. spray distance from tissue and pressure should be within the ranges recommended by the manufacturer (see table in section instructions for use). when spraying evicel, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation, and end tidal co2 should be monitored because of the possibility of occurrence of air or gas embolism. spray devices and accessory tips provide instructions for use with recommendations for pressure ranges and proximity to tissue surface, which should be carefully followed. nearby areas should be protected to make sure that evicel is only applied onto the surface which is to be treated. as with any product containing proteins, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. signs of such reactions include hives, rash, tightness of the chest, wheezing, drop in blood pressure and anaphylaxis. if these symptoms occur, the administration has to be discontinued immediately. when medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put into place to prevent 26 infections being passed on to patients. these include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of viruses/infections. manufacturers of these products also include steps in the processing of the blood and plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. this also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses, or other types of infections. the measures taken in the manufacture of fibrinogen and thrombin are considered effective for lipid coated viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), hepatitis b virus, and hepatitis c virus, and the non-enveloped virus, hepatitis a. the measures taken may be of limited value against parvovirus b19. parvovirus b19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals whose immune system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia (e.g., sickle cell disease or haemolytic anaemia). the healthcare professionals will record the name and batch number of the medicinal product in order to trace any possible infection source. children and adolescents limited paediatric data are available to support efficacy and safety of evicel in this population. other medicines and evicel tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines, even those not prescribed. pregnancy and breast-feeding there is not enough information available to know whether any particular risks are associated with the use of evicel during pregnancy or whilst breast-feeding. however, since evicel is used during a surgical operation, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, you should discuss the overall risks of the operation with your doctor.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "evicel", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",

will be applied depends on the surface area of tissue to be treated during the operation. it will be dripped onto the tissue in very small amounts or sprayed in short bursts (0.1-0.2 ml), to produce a

side effects which occurred during clinical studies were considered to be related to the use of evicel: most serious side effects watery fluid coming out of your wound or nose (csf leakage/csf rhinorrhea) headache, nausea, and vomiting (due to subdural hygroma, which is accumulation of csf in the subdural space) fever, or prolonged constipation, flatulence (due to abdominal abscess) 27 the frequency of the effects listed above was common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). - numbness or pain in your extremities, change in skin colour (due to graft occlusion or thrombosis) the frequency of this effect was uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). if you experience any of the above mentioned symptoms, or any other symptoms related to your surgery, please contact your doctor or surgeon immediately. if you feel unwell tell your doctor immediately, even if your symptoms are different from those just described. other side effects other side effects which were reported to be common during clinical trials with evicel (i.e., may affect up to 1 in 10 people) included meningitis, fever, difficulties with blood clotting and accumulation of csf fluid in the brain cavities (hydrocephalus). the frequency of all of these effects was common. side effects which were uncommon during clinical trials with evicel (i.e., may affect up to 1 in 100 people) included infection, blood accumulation (haematoma), swelling, decreased haemoglobin, and post-operative wound complications (including bleeding or infection). evicel is a fibrin sealant. fibrin sealants in general may, in rare cases (up to 1 patient in 1,000 people), cause an allergic reaction. if you experience an allergic reaction you might have one or more of the following symptoms: skin rash, hives or wheals (nettle-rash), tightness of the chest, chills, flushing, headache, low blood pressure, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, increased heart rate, tingling, vomiting, or wheezing. no allergic reactions have so far been reported in patients treated with evicel. there is also a theoretical possibility that you could develop antibodies to the proteins in evicel, which could potentially interfere with blood clotting. the frequency of the type of event is not known (cannot be estimated from available data). reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor , pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can
