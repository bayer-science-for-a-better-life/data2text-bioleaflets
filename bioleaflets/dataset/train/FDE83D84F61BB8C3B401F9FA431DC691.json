NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDesloratadine Teva 5 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 5 mg desloratadine. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect:  \nEach film-coated tablet contains 1.2 mg of lactose monohydrate (see section 4.4). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet \n \nBlue, round, biconvex film-coated tablet - printed in with ink: \u201cD5\u201d on one side and plain on the other. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDesloratadine Teva is indicated in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older for the relief of symptoms \nassociated with: \n- allergic rhinitis (see section 5.1) \n- urticaria (see section 5.1) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents (12 years of age and over) \n The recommended dose of Desloratadine Teva 5 mg film-coated tablets is one tablet once a day. \n \nIntermittent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or for less than 4 weeks) \nshould be managed in accordance with the evaluation of patient\u2019s disease history and the treatment could be \ndiscontinued after symptoms are resolved and reinitiated upon their reappearance. \nIn persistent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than 4 weeks), \ncontinued treatment may be proposed to the patients during the allergen exposure periods. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is limited clinical trial efficacy experience with the use of desloratadine in adolescents 12 through \n17 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Desloratadine Teva 5 mg film-coated tablets in children below the age of 12 years \nhave not been established.  \n \nMethod of administration \nOral use. \nThe dose can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to loratadine. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn the case of severe renal insufficiency, Desloratadine Teva 5 mg film-coated tablets should be used with \ncaution (see section 5.2). \n \nDesloratadine should be administered with caution in patients with medical or familial history of seizures, \nand mainly young children (see section 4.8), being more susceptible to develop new seizures under \ndesloratadine treatment. Healthcare providers may consider discontinuing desloratadine in patients who \nexperience a seizure while on treatment. \n \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo clinically relevant interactions were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets in which \nerythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nIn a clinical pharmacology trial, desloratadine tablets taken concomitantly with alcohol did not potentiate the \nperformance impairing effects of alcohol (see section 5.1). However, cases of alcohol intolerance and \nintoxication have been reported during post-marketing use. Therefore, caution is recommended if alcohol is \ntaken concomitantly. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nA large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative \nnor foeto/ neonatal toxicity of desloratadine. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects \nwith respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid \nthe use of Desloratadine Teva 5 mg film-coated tablets during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nDesloratadine has been identified in breastfed newborns/infants of treated women. The effect of \ndesloratadine on newborns/infants is unknown. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-\nfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from Desloratadine Teva 5 mg film-coated tablets therapy taking into \naccount the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data available on male and female fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDesloratadine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines based on clinical trials. \nPatients should be informed that most people do not experience drowsiness. Nevertheless, as there is \nindividual variation in response to all medicinal products, it is recommended that patients are advised not to \nengage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or using machines, until they have \nestablished their own response to the medicinal product. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIn clinical trials in a range of indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at the \nrecommended dose of 5 mg daily, undesirable effects with desloratadine were reported in 3 % of patients in \nexcess of those treated with placebo. The most frequent of adverse reactions reported in excess of placebo \nwere fatigue (1.2 %), dry mouth (0.8 %) and headache (0.6 %).  \n \nPaediatric population \nIn a clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients, 12 through 17 years of age, the most common adverse event \nwas headache; this occurred in 5.9 % of patients treated with desloratadine and 6.9 % of patients receiving \nplacebo. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe frequency of the clinical trial adverse reactions reported in excess of placebo and other undesirable \neffects reported during the post-marketing period are listed in the following table Frequencies are defined as \nvery common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions seen with \n\ndesloratadine \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nNot known Increased appetite \n\nPsychiatric disorders Very rare \nNot known \n\nHallucinations \nAbnormal behaviour, aggression \n\nNervous system disorders Common \nVery rare \n\nHeadache \nDizziness, somnolence, insomnia, \npsychomotor hyperactivity, seizures \n\nCardiac disorders Very rare  \nNot known \n\nTachycardia, palpitations \nQT prolongation \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common \nVery rare \n\nDry mouth \nAbdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, \ndyspepsia, diarrhoea \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Very rare  \n \nNot known: \n\nElevations of liver enzymes, increased \nbilirubin, hepatitis \nJaundice \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nNot known Photosensitivity \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nVery rare Myalgia \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon \nVery rare \n \n \nNot known: \n\nFatigue \nHypersensitivity reactions (such as \nanaphylaxis, angioedema, dyspnoea, \npruritus, rash, and urticaria) \nAsthenia \n\nInvestigations Not known Weight increased \n \nPaediatric population \nOther undesirable effects reported during the post-marketing period in paediatric patients with an unknown \nfrequency included QT prolongation, arrhythmia, bradycardia, abnormal behaviour, and aggression. \n \nA retrospective observational safety study indicated an increased incidence of new-onset seizure in patients 0 \nto 19 years of age when receiving desloratadine compared with periods not receiving desloratadine. Among \nchildren 0-4 years old, the adjusted absolute increase was 37.5 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 10.5-64.5) per \n100,000 person years (PY) with a background rate of new onset seizure of 80.3 per 100,000 PY. Among \npatients 5-19 years of age, the adjusted absolute increase was 11.3 (95% CI 2.3-20.2) per 100,000 PY with a \nbackground rate of 36.4 per 100,000 PY. (See section 4.4.) \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n\n\n5 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V*. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to that \nseen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher. \n \nTreatment \nIn the event of overdose, consider standard measures to remove unabsorbed active substance. Symptomatic \nand supportive treatment is recommended. \n \nDesloratadine is not eliminated by haemodialysis; it is not known if it is eliminated by peritoneal dialysis. \n \nSymptoms \nBased on a multiple dose clinical trial, in which up to 45 mg of desloratadine was administered (nine times \nthe clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to that \nseen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihistamines \u2013 H1 antagonist, ATC code: R06A X27 \n \nMechanism of action \nDesloratadine is a non-sedating, long-acting histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H1-receptor \nantagonist activity. After oral administration, desloratadine selectively blocks peripheral histamine \nH1-receptors because the substance is excluded from entry to the central nervous system. \n \nDesloratadine has demonstrated antiallergic properties from in vitro studies. These include inhibiting the \nrelease of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 from human mast cells/basophils, \nas well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin on endothelial cells. The clinical \nrelevance of these observations remains to be confirmed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn a multiple dose clinical trial, in which up to 20 mg of desloratadine was administered daily for 14 days, no \nstatistically or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was observed. In a clinical pharmacology trial, in \nwhich desloratadine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical dose) for ten days, no \nprolongation of QTc interval was seen. \n \nNo clinically relevant changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in multiple-dose \nketoconazole and erythromycin interaction trials. \n \nDesloratadine does not readily penetrate the central nervous system. In controlled clinical trials, at the \nrecommended dose of 5 mg daily, there was no excess incidence of somnolence as compared to placebo. \nDesloratadine given at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg did not affect psychomotor performance in clinical \ntrials. In a single dose study performed in adults, desloratadine 5 mg did not affect standard measures of \nflight performance including exacerbation of subjective sleepiness or tasks related to flying. \n \n\nhttp://www.google.co.uk/url?url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc&rct=j&frm=1&q=&esrc=s&sa=U&ei=aaztVLTSMOSc7gbJq4DAAg&ved=0CBYQFjAA&sig2=yzUOL4Px9reyQdo7yLkGLA&usg=AFQjCNH3PGeyMuvF5o4tqk4n9r4W0dgBIQ\n\n\n6 \n\nIn clinical pharmacology trials, co-administration with alcohol did not increase the alcohol-induced \nimpairment in performance or increase in sleepiness. No significant differences were found in the \npsychomotor test results between desloratadine and placebo groups, whether administered alone or with \nalcohol. \n \nIn patients with allergic rhinitis, desloratadine was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal \ndischarge and itching, as well as ocular itching, tearing and redness, and itching of palate. Desloratadine \neffectively controlled symptoms for 24 hours.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe efficacy of desloratadine tablets has not been clearly demonstrated in trials with adolescent patients 12 \nthrough 17 years of age. \n \nIn addition to the established classifications of seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can alternatively be \nclassified as intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis according to the duration of \nsymptoms. Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week \nor for less than 4 weeks. Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of symptoms for 4 days or more \nper week and for more than 4 weeks. \n \nDesloratadine was effective in alleviating the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis as shown by the total score \nof the rhino-conjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire. The greatest amelioration was seen in the domains of \npractical problems and daily activities limited by symptoms. \n \nChronic idiopathic urticaria was studied as a clinical model for urticarial conditions, since the underlying \npathophysiology is similar, regardless of etiology, and because chronic patients can be more easily recruited \nprospectively. Since histamine release is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, desloratadine is expected to \nbe effective in providing symptomatic relief for other urticarial conditions, in addition to chronic idiopathic \nurticaria, as advised in clinical guidelines. \n \nIn two placebo-controlled six week trials in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, desloratadine was \neffective in relieving pruritus and decreasing the size and number of hives by the end of the first dosing \ninterval. In each trial, the effects were sustained over the 24 hour dosing interval. As with other antihistamine \ntrials in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who were identified as nonresponsive to \nantihistamines was excluded. An improvement in pruritus of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of \npatients treated with desloratadine compared with 19 % of patients treated with placebo. Treatment with \ndesloratadine also significantly reduced interference with sleep and daytime function, as measured by a four-\npoint scale used to assess these variables. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nDesloratadine plasma concentrations can be detected within 30 minutes of administration. \nDesloratadine is well absorbed with maximum concentration achieved after approximately 3 hours; the \nterminal phase half-life is approximately 27 hours. The degree of accumulation of desloratadine was \nconsistent with its half-life (approximately 27 hours) and a once daily dosing frequency. The bioavailability \nof desloratadine was dose proportional over the range of 5 mg to 20 mg. \n \nIn a pharmacokinetic trial in which patient demographics were comparable to those of the general seasonal \nallergic rhinitis population, 4 % of the subjects achieved a higher concentration of desloratadine. This \npercentage may vary according to ethnic background. Maximum desloratadine concentration was about \n3-fold higher at approximately 7 hours with a terminal phase half-life of approximately 89 hours. The safety \nprofile of these subjects was not different from that of the general population. \n \nDistribution \nDesloratadine is moderately bound (83 % - 87 %) to plasma proteins. There is no evidence of clinically \nrelevant medicine accumulation following once daily dosing of desloratadine (5 mg to 20 mg) for 14 days. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nBiotransformation \nThe enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and therefore, some \ninteractions with other medicinal products can not be fully excluded. Desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 \nin vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a \nsubstrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. \n \nElimination \nIn a single dose trial using a 7.5 mg dose of desloratadine, there was no effect of food (high-fat, high caloric \nbreakfast) on the disposition of desloratadine. In another study, grapefruit juice had no effect on the \ndisposition of desloratadine. \n \nRenally impaired patients \nThe pharmacokinetics of desloratadine in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) was compared with \nthat of healthy subjects in one single-dose study and one multiple dose study. In the single-dose study, the \nexposure to desloratadine was approximately 2 and 2.5-fold greater in subjects with mild to moderate and \nsevere CRI, respectively, than in healthy subjects. In the multiple-dose study, steady state was reached after \nDay 11, and compared to healthy subjects the exposure to desloratadine was ~1.5-fold greater in subjects \nwith mild to moderate CRI and ~2.5-fold greater in subjects with severe CRI. In both studies, changes in \nexposure (AUC and Cmax) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were not clinically relevant. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDesloratadine is the primary active metabolite of loratadine. Non-clinical studies conducted with \ndesloratadine and loratadine demonstrated that there are no qualitative or quantitative differences in the \ntoxicity profile of desloratadine and loratadine at comparable levels of exposure to desloratadine. \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, \nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and development. The \nlack of carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in studies conducted with desloratadine and loratadine. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Desloratadine Teva is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Desloratadine Teva is \nDesloratadine Teva contains desloratadine which is an antihistamine. \n \nHow Desloratadine Teva works \nDesloratadine Teva is an antiallergy medicine that does not make you drowsy. It helps control your allergic \nreaction and its symptoms. \n \nWhen Desloratadine Teva should be used \nDesloratadine Teva relieves symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages \ncaused by an allergy, for example, hay fever or allergy to dust mites) in adults and adolescents 12 years of \nage and older.
