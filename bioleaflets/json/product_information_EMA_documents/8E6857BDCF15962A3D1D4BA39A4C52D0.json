NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPreotact 100 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains 1.61 mg parathyroid hormone corresponding to 14 doses. \nAfter reconstitution, each dose of 71.4 microlitre contains 100 micrograms parathyroid hormone \nproduced in Escherichia coli by recombinant DNA technology  \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nWhite to off-white powder and clear, colourless solvent.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPreotact is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of \nfractures (see section 5.1). \n \nA significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral, but not hip fractures has been demonstrated. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nThe recommended dose is 100 micrograms of parathyroid hormone administered once-daily \nPosology \n\n \nPatients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate. \n \nData support continuous treatment with Preotact for up to 24 months (see section 4.4). \n \nFollowing treatment with Preotact patients can be treated with a bisphosphonate to further increase \nbone mineral density (see section 5.1). \n \n\nRenal impairment \nSpecial populations \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance 30 to 80 ml/min). There is no data available in patients with severe renal impairment.  \nPreotact should therefore not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (total score of \n7 to 9 on the Child-Pugh scale). There is no data available in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nPreotact should therefore not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety and efficacy of Preotact in patients under 18 years have not been studied. There is no \nrelevant use of Preotact in paediatric patients for the treatment of osteoporosis at high risk of fractures \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nElderly  \nDose adjustment based upon age is not required (see section 5.2). \n \n\n \nMethod of administration  \n\nThe dose is administered as a subcutaneous injection into the abdomen. \n \nPatients must be trained to use the proper injection techniques (see section 6.6). A user manual is     \nincluded in the box to instruct patients on the correct use of the pen. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nPreotact is contraindicated in patients \n• with hypersensitivity to parathyroid hormone or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1) \n• who are receiving or who has previously received radiation therapy to the skeleton  \n• with skeletal malignancies or bone metastases. \n• with pre-existing hypercalcemia and other disturbances in the phosphocalcic metabolism \n• with metabolic bone diseases other than primary osteoporosis (including hyperparathyroidism \n\nand Paget’s disease of the bone) \n• with unexplained elevations of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase \n• with severe renal impairment \n• with severe hepatic impairment \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nPatients initiated on Preotact therapy should be monitored at months 1, 3 and 6 for elevated levels of \nserum and/or urinary calcium. Monitoring beyond 6 months is not recommended for patients whose \ntotal serum calcium is within the normal limits at 6 months. \n\nMonitoring of patients during treatment \n\n \nElevated serum calcium was observed during Preotact treatment. Serum calcium concentrations reach \na maximum between 6 and 8 hours post dose and normally return to baseline by 20 to 24 hours after \neach administration of parathyroid hormone. Therefore if any blood samples are taken from a patient \nfor monitoring of calcium levels, this should be done at least 20 hours after the most recent injection. \n \n\nPatients with persistent elevated serum calcium (above the upper normal level) should be evaluated for \nunderlying disease (e.g. hyperparathyroidism). If no underlying condition is found, the following \nmanagement procedures should be followed: \n\nManagement of elevated serum calcium \n\n \n• Calcium and vitamin D supplementation should be withdrawn \n• The frequency of Preotact dosing should be changed to 100 micrograms every other day \n• If elevated levels continue, Preotact therapy should be stopped and the patient monitored until \n\nthe abnormal values have reverted to normal \n \n\nPatients with pre-existing hypercalciuria \nCaution should be exercised in \n\nPreotact has been studied in patients with pre-existing hypercalciuria. In these patients, Preotact \ntreatment was more likely to exacerbate their underlying hypercalciuria. \n \nPatients with urolithiasis \nPreotact has not been studied in patients with active urolithiasis. Preotact should be used with caution \nin patients with active or previous urolithiasis. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nPatients receiving cardiac glucosides \nCaution should be exercised in patients receiving cardiac glucosides due to the risk of digitalis toxicity \nif hypercalcemia develops (see section 4.5). \n \n\nStudies in rats indicate an increased incidence of osteosarcoma with long-term administration of \nPreotact (see section 5.3). The occurrence of osteosarcoma only occurred at doses that produced \nsystemic exposures > 27-times higher than that observed in humans at the 100 micrograms dose. Until \nfurther clinical data becomes available the recommended treatment time of 24 months should not be \nexceeded. \n\nDuration of treatment \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nParathyroid hormone is a natural peptide that is not metabolised by, and does not inhibit hepatic \nmicrosomal drug-metabolising enzymes (e.g. cytochrome P450 isoenzymes). Furthermore, parathyroid \nhormone is not protein bound and has a low volume of distribution. Consequently, no interaction with \nother medicinal products would be anticipated and no specific drug-drug interactions studies were \nperformed. No potential for drug interactions was identified in the clinical program. \n \nFrom the knowledge of the mechanism of action, combined use of Preotact and cardiac glucosides \nmay predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcemia develops (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere are no data available from the use of parathyroid hormone in women of childbearing potential, \nduring pregnancy and breast feeding. Animal studies of reproductive toxicity are incomplete (see \nsection 5.3). \n \nParathyroid hormone should not be used in women of childbearing potential, during pregnancy or \nbreast-feeding. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. As some \nepisodes of dizziness have been described in patients treated with Preotact, patients should refrain \nfrom driving or using machines until symptoms have subsided. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe following adverse reaction (ADR) data are based on two placebo-controlled studies involving \n2,642 postmenopausal osteoporotic women of whom 1,341 received parathyroid hormone. \nApproximately 71.4% of the patients on parathyroid hormone reported at least one ADR. \n \nHypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria reflect the known pharmacodynamic actions of parathyroid \nhormone in the gastrointestinal tract, the kidney, and the bone. Hypercalcemia was reported in 25.3% \nof patients and hypercalciuria in 39.3% of patients treated with Preotact. Hypercalcemia was transient \nand was reported most frequently in the first 3 months of treatment. It was managed during the clinical \nprogramme by monitoring laboratory values and the use of a pre-specified management algorithm (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4, and 5.1). \n \nThe only other very commonly reported ADR was nausea. \n \nThe table below gives an overview of the ADRs where the incidence is at least 0.5% higher in the \nparathyroid hormone group compared to placebo. The following categories are used to rank the \nadverse reactions by frequency of occurrence: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); and very rare (<1/10,000), including \nisolated reports. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nSystem organ class Parathyroid hormone  \nN=1341 \n\n(%) \nInfections and infestations  \nUncommon  \nInfluenza 0.5 \n  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common   \nHypercalcemia 25.3 \nCommon  \nBlood calcium increased 3.1 \nUncommon   \nBlood alkaline phosphatase increased 0.8 \nAnorexia 0.6 \nBlood uric acid increased 0.6 \n  \nNervous system disorders  \nCommon   \nHeadache 9.3 \nDizziness 3.9 \nUncommon  \nDysgeusia 0.8 \nParosmia 0.7 \n  \nCardiac disorders  \nCommon   \nPalpitations 1.0 \n  \nGastrointestinal disorders  \nVery common   \nNausea 13.5 \nCommon   \nVomiting 2.5 \nConstipation 1.8 \nDyspepsia 1.3 \nDiarrhoea 1.0 \nUncommon  \nAbdominal pain 0.8 \n  \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon  \nMuscle cramp 1.1 \nPain in extremity 1.1 \nBack pain 1.0 \n  \nRenal and urinary disorders  \nVery common   \nHypercalciuria 39.3 \nCommon  \nUrine calcium/creatinine ratio increased 2.9 \nUrine calcium increased 2.2 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n  \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions  \nCommon   \nInjection site erythema 2.6 \nFatigue 1.8 \nAsthenia 1.2 \nUncommon   \nInjection site irritation 0.9 \n\n \nPreotact increases serum uric acid concentrations. For all subjects who received parathyroid hormone \n100 micrograms blood uric acid increase was reported for 8 subjects (0.6%) and hyperuricemia was \nreported for 5 subjects (0.4%). Although gout, arthralgia and nephrolithiasis were reported as ADRs, \nthe relationship to elevations in uric acid due to Preotact administration has not been fully established. \n \nAntibodies to parathyroid hormone \nIn a large phase III clinical study, antibodies to parathyroid hormone were detected in 3% of women \nreceiving Preotact compared to 0.2% of women receiving placebo. In these women with a positive \ntitre, there was no evidence of hypersensitivity reactions, allergic reactions, effects on bone mineral \ndensity response, or effects on serum calcium. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSigns and symptoms \nIn the Preotact clinical program, accidental overdose has been reported. \nPreotact has been administered in single doses up to 5 micrograms/kg and in repeated doses of up to \n3 micrograms/kg/day for 3 days and up to 2.5 micrograms/kg/day for 7 days. The effects of overdose \nthat might be expected include delayed hypercalcemia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and headache. \n \nOverdose management \nThere is no specific antidote for Preotact. Treatment of suspected overdose should include temporary \ndiscontinuation of Preotact, monitoring of serum calcium, and implementation of appropriate, \nsupportive measures, such as hydration. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological \nactivity of Preotact further measures should not be necessary. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Calcium homeostatis, parathyroid hormones and analogues, ATC code: \nH05AA03. \n \nMechanism of action \nPreotact contains recombinant human parathyroid hormone which is identical to the full-length native \n84-amino acid polypeptide. \n \nPhysiological actions of parathyroid hormone include stimulation of bone formation by direct effects \non bone forming cells (osteoblasts) indirectly increasing the intestinal absorption of calcium and \nincreasing the tubular reabsorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate by the kidney. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe skeletal effects of parathyroid hormone depend upon the pattern of systemic exposure. Transient \nelevations in parathyroid hormone levels after subcutaneous injection of Preotact stimulates new bone \nformation on trabecular and cortical (periosteal and/or endosteal) bone surfaces by preferential \nstimulation of osteoblastic activity over osteoclastic activity. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nEffects on serum calcium concentrations \nParathyroid hormone is the principal regulator of serum calcium homeostasis. In response to \nsubcutaneous doses of Preotact (100 micrograms parathyroid hormone), serum total calcium levels \nincrease gradually and reach peak concentration (mean increase in 129 patients, 0.15 mmol/l) at \napproximately 6 to 8 hours after dosing. In general, serum calcium levels return to baseline levels \n24 hours after dosing. \n \nBased on two placebo-controlled studies involving 2642 postmenopausal osteoporotic women, \nhypercalcemia was reported in 25.3% of patients treated with Preotact compared to 4.3% of placebo-\ntreated patients. The hypercalcemia was transient and was reported most frequently in the first \n3 months of treatment. It was managed during the clinical programme by monitoring laboratory values \nand the use of a pre-specified management algorithm (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \n\nEffect on fracture incidence \nClinical efficacy \n\nThe pivotal study was an 18-month double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study (TOP) of the \neffect of Preotact on fracture incidence in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.  \n \nA total of 2532 patients (1286 Preotact and 1246 placebo), aged 45-94 years (8.1% 45-54 years and \n11.4% > 75 years), were randomised to receive 100 micrograms/day or placebo with daily calcium \n(700 mg) and vitamin D (400 IU) supplementation.  \n \nOverall, approximately 19% of the subjects in each treatment group had at least 1 prevalent vertebral \nfracture at baseline. The mean baseline lumbar T score was approximately -3.0 in each treatment \ngroup. \n \nOf the 2,532 randomised intention-to-treat (ITT) patients, a total of 59 patients experienced at least \none new vertebral fracture, placebo: 42 (3.37%) – Preotact: 17 (1.32%), p=0.001. Patients in the \nPreotact treatment group had a 61% relative risk reduction of a new vertebral fracture at month 18 \ncompared to the patients in the placebo group. \n \nTo prevent one or more new vertebral fractures, 48 women had to be treated for a median of \n18 months for the total population. For patients with pre-existing fractures, number needed to treat \n(NNT) is 21 patients. \n \n \nThere was no significant difference between the treatment groups in the incidence of any non-vertebral \nclinical fracture: 5.52% for Preotact vs. 5.86% for placebo. \n \nThe most relevant fracture reduction was observed among patients at high risk of fractures such as \npatients with previous fractures and in patients with a lumbar spine T-score of < - 3. \n \nRelatively few patients less than 5 years postmenopausal and 45-54 years of age were enrolled in the \nphase III study (2-3%). The results for these subjects were not different from the results in the study as \na whole. \n \nEffect on bone mineral density (BMD) \nIn the pivotal study, Preotact increased BMD in the lumbar spine after 18 months treatment by 6.5% \ncompared with -0.3% for placebo (p<0.001). Significant increases in hip BMD (total, femoral neck, \ntrochanter) were observed at study endpoint; 1.0, 1.8 and 1.0%, respectively, for Preotact versus -1.1, -\n0.7 and -0.6% for placebo (p<0.001).  \n \nContinued treatment for up to 24 months in an open-label extension of this study resulted in a \ncontinued increase in BMD. The increase from baseline in lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD was \n6.8% and 2.2%, respectively in patients treated with Preotact. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nThe effects of Preotact on bone architecture were evaluated using quantitative computed tomography \n(QCT) and peripheral QCT. Volumetric trabecular BMD at the lumbar spine increased by 38% over \nbaseline at 18 months. Similarly, volumetric trabecular BMD at the total hip increased by 4.7%. \nSimilar increases occurred at the femoral neck, trochanter, and intertrochanter. Treatment with \nPreotact reduced volumetric cortical bone BMD (measured at the distal radius and mid-shaft tibia), \nwhile periosteal circumference or indices of cortical bone strength were maintained. \n \nIn the 24-month alendronate combination therapy study (PaTH), the effects of Preotact on bone \narchitecture were also evaluated using QCT. Volumetric trabecular BMD at the lumbar spine \nincreased by 26, 13, and 11% (Preotact, Preotact and alendronate and alendronate, respectively) over \nbaseline at 12 months. Similarly, volumetric trabecular BMD at the total hip increased by 9, 6, and \n2%, respectively, in the 3 groups.  \n \nTreatment of osteoporosis with combination and sequential therapy \nThe PaTH study was a National Institute of Health (NIH) sponsored randomised, placebo-controlled, 2 \nyear, multicenter, double-blind trial of Preotact and alendronate as monotherapy and in combination \nfor the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Inclusion criteria were; women between 55 and 85 \nyears of age with BMD T-scores below -2.5 or below -2 and at least one additional risk factor for \nfracture. All women were given calcium (400-500 mg) and vitamin D (400 IU) supplements. \n \nA total of 238 postmenopausal women, were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment \ngroups; Preotact (100 micrograms parathyroid hormone), alendronate (10 mg), or the combination of \nboth, and followed for 12 months. In the second year of the study women in the original Preotact \ngroup were randomly assigned to receive either alendronate or matching placebo, and women in the \nother two groups received alendronate. \n \nAt baseline a total of 165 women (69%) had a T-score below –2.5, and 112 (47%) reported at least one \nfracture after menopause. \n \nOne year of therapy, showed the following results: the increases in lumbar spine BMD above baseline \nwere similar in the Preotact and combination-therapy groups (6.3 and 6.1%, respectively), but were \nsomewhat smaller in the alendronate group (4.6%). Increases in BMD at the total hip were 0.3, 1.9, \nand 3.0% for the 3 groups, respectively. \n \nAt the end of year 2 (12 months after Preotact was discontinued), there was a 12.1% mean increase in \ndual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) spine BMD for patients who received alendronate for the \nsecond year. For the patients who received placebo during the second year, the mean percent increase \nwas 4.1% compared to baseline, but had decreased slightly compared to the end of 12 months of \nPreotact treatment. For the mean change in hip BMD, there was a 4.5% increase from baseline with \none year of alendronate compared to a 0.1% decrease after one year of placebo. \n \nPreotact in combination with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in 180 postmenopausal women has \nbeen shown to significantly increase lumbar spine BMD at 12 months compared with HRT alone (7.1 \n% vs. 1.1%, p<0.001). The combination was effective regardless of age, baseline rate of bone \nturnover, or baseline BMD. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \nSubcutaneous administration of 100 micrograms of parathyroid hormone into the abdomen produces a \nrapid increase in plasma parathyroid hormone levels and achieves a peak at 1 to 2 hours after dosing. \nThe average half-life is of about 1.5 hours. The absolute bioavailability of 100 micrograms of \nparathyroid hormone after subcutaneous administration in the abdomen is 55%. \n \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution at steady-state following intravenous administration is approximately 5.4 l. \nInterindividual variability in the volume of distribution of parathyroid hormone is about 40%. \n \nBiotransformation \nParathyroid hormone is efficiently removed from the blood by a receptor-mediated process in the liver \nand is broken down into smaller peptide fragments. The fragments derived from the amino-terminus \nare further degraded within the cell while the fragments derived from the carboxy-terminius are \nreleased back into the blood and cleared by the kidney. These carboxy-terminal fragments are thought \nto play a role in the regulation of parathyroid hormone activity. Under normal physiologic conditions, \nfull-length parathyroid hormone (1-84) constitutes only 5-30% of the circulating forms of the \nmolecule, while 70-95% is present as carboxy-terminal fragments. Following a subcutaneous dose of \nPreotact, C-terminal fragments make up about 60-90% of the circulating forms of the molecule. \nSystemic clearance of parathyroid hormone (45.3 l/hour) following an intravenous dose is close to \nnormal liver plasma flow and is consistent with extensive hepatic metabolism of the active substance. \nInterindividual variability in systemic clearance is about 15%. \n \nElimination \nParathyroid hormone is metabolised in the liver and to a lesser degree in the kidney. Parathyroid \nhormone is not excreted from the body in its intact form. Circulating carboxy-terminal fragments are \nfiltered by the kidney, but are subsequently broken to even smaller fragments during tubular reuptake.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nThere was a modest increase of about 20% in the mean baseline corrected exposure (AUC) to \nparathyroid hormone in a study conducted in 6 men and 6 women with moderate hepatic impairment \nas compared with a matched group of 12 subjects with normal hepatic function.  \n \nNo studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe overall exposure and Cmax of parathyroid hormone were slightly increased (22% and 56%, \nrespectively) in a group of 8 male and 8 female subjects with mild-to-moderate renal impairment \n(creatinine clearances of 30 to 80 ml/min) compared with a matched group of 16 subjects with normal \nrenal function.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of parathyroid hormone in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance of less than 30 ml/min) has not been investigated. \n \nElderly \nNo differences in Preotact pharmacokinetics were detected with regard to age (range 47-88 years). \nDosage adjustment based on age is not required. \n \n \nGender \nThe medicinal product has only been studied in postmenopausal women. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, mutagenicity, toxicity to fertility and general reproduction, and local tolerance. \n \nIn monkeys receiving daily subcutaneous doses for 6 months, there was an increased occurrence of \nrenal tubular mineralization at exposure levels below clinical exposure levels. \n \nRats treated with near life-time daily injections had dose-dependent exaggerated bone formation and \nan increased incidence of bone tumours, including osteosarcoma, most probably due to an epigenetic \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\nmechanism. Due to the differences in bone physiology in rats and humans, the clinical relevance of \nthese findings is probably minor. No osteosarcomas have been observed in clinical trials. \n \nThere are no studies of foetal, developmental, perinatal or postnatal toxicity. It is unknown whether \nrecombinant human parathyroid hormone is excreted in the milk of lactating animals. \n \n \n6.

What Preotact is and what it is used for \n \nPreotact is used to treat osteoporosis in women past menopause with high risk of fractures. \nOsteoporosis is a disease that causes bones to become thin and fragile. It is especially common in \nwomen after the menopause. The disease progresses gradually so you may not feel any symptoms at \nfirst. But if you have osteoporosis, it makes you more likely to break bones, especially in your spine, \nhips and wrists. It may also cause back pain, loss of height, and a curved back. \n \nPreotact reduces the risk of breaking spinal bones because it increases your bone quality and strength. \nIt has not been shown that Preotact reduces the risk of breaking your hip. \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Preotact \n \nDo not use Preotact \n• if you are allergic to parathyroid hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6); \n• if you shall have or previously have had radiation therapy to the skeleton; \n• if you have cancer of the bones; \n• if you suffer from high calcium levels in your blood or other disturbances in the calcium-\n\nphosphor metabolism; \n• if you have other bone disease (including hyperparathyroidism or Paget’s disease); \n• if you have high levels of alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme produced by the organism; may \n\nsignal certain medical conditions, related to bones and liver); \n• if you suffer from severe kidney problems; \n• if you suffer from severe liver disease; \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Preotact if you: \n• have a high level of calcium in your urine; \n• suffer from kidney stones; \n• receive heart medicine (e.g. digoxin also known as digitalis). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\nMeasuring of the calcium levels in the blood and/or urine \n \nYour doctor will check your response to the treatment at regular intervals. Your doctor will perform \nblood and/or urine tests to measure the level of calcium in your blood and/or urine at month 1, 3 and 6 \nafter starting your treatment with Preotact. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nPreotact should not be used in children or adolescents under 18 years old. \n \nOther medicines and Preotact \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nYou should use Preotact with caution if you receive heart medicine (e.g. digoxin also known as \ndigitalis). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine \nDo not use Preotact if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nIf you feel dizzy, do not drive or operate any machines until you feel better.  \n \nPreotact contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose.  \nThis means that it is essentially “sodium-free”. \n \n \n3. How to use Preotact \n \nAlways use Preotact exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure.  \n \nDosage \n \nThe recommended dose of Preotact is 100 micrograms per day. \n \nYour doctor may advise you to take supplementary calcium and vitamin D. Your doctor will tell you \nhow much you should take each day.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nBefore it is used for the first time, the medicine in the Preotact pre-filled pen has to be mixed (please \nrefer to the “Instructions for use”). \n \nAfter you do this, the Preotact pre-filled pen is ready for use and the medicine is ready to be injected \ninto the abdomen (under the skin).  \n \nWhen you are not using it, put the pre-filled pen back into the refrigerator. \n \nImportant information when using Preotact \n• Inject yourself with Preotact shortly after you have taken your pre-filled pen out of the \n\nrefrigerator. \n• Put the pre-filled pen back into the refrigerator immediately after you have used it.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\n• Do not shake the pre-filled pen (neither before nor after injection) as it may destroy the effect \nof the medicine. \n\n• Use a new needle for each injection and throw the needle away after each use. \n• Never store your pre-filled pen with the needle attached. \n• Always attach a new needle before use \n• Never share your pre-filled pen with anyone. \n\n \nFor instructions on how to use the pre-filled pen, please read the ”Instructions for use”.. \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nKeep using Preotact for as long as your doctor prescribes it for you – normally no longer than \n24 months. \n \nIf you use more Preotact than you should \n \nIf, by accident, you inject more than one dose of Preotact in a day, contact immediately your doctor or \npharmacist. \n \nIf you forget to use Preotact \n \nIf you forget to take Preotact (or cannot take Preotact at your usual time), take it as soon as possible on \nthat day.  \nNever inject more than one dose in the same day.  \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Preotact \n \nDiscuss with your doctor if you consider stopping the treatment with Preotact before you finish the \nprescribed period. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
