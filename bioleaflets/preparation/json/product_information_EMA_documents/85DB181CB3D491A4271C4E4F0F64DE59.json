NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTelmisartan Teva 20 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 20 mg telmisartan \n \nExcipients with known effect:  \n \nEach tablet contains 21.4 mg sorbitol (E420) \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet \n \nWhite to off white, oval shaped tablet; one side of the tablet is debossed with the number \n\"93\". The other side of the tablet is debossed with the number \"7458\". \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHypertension \nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults. \n \nCardiovascular prevention \nReduction of cardiovascular morbidity in adults with: \n• manifest atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral \n\narterial disease) or \n• type 2 diabetes mellitus with documented target organ damage \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension \nThe usually effective dose is 40 mg once daily. Some patients may already benefit at a daily dose of 20 mg. \nIn cases where the target blood pressure is not achieved, the dose of telmisartan can be increased to a \nmaximum of 80 mg once daily. Alternatively, telmisartan may be used in combination with thiazide-type \ndiuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, which has been shown to have an additive blood pressure lowering \neffect with telmisartan. When considering raising the dose, it must be borne in mind that the maximum \nantihypertensive effect is generally attained four to eight weeks after the start of treatment (see section 5.1). \n \nCardiovascular prevention \nThe recommended dose is 80 mg once daily. It is not known whether doses lower than 80 mg of telmisartan \nare effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity. \nWhen initiating telmisartan therapy for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity, close monitoring of blood \npressure is recommended, and if appropriate adjustment of medications that lower blood pressure may be \nnecessary. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \nLimited experience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. \nA lower starting dose of 20 mg is recommended in these patients (see section 4.4). No posology adjustment \nis required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.  \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nTelmisartan Teva is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the posology should not exceed 40 mg once daily (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Telmisartan Teva in children and adolescents aged below 18 have not been \nestablished.  \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \n \nMethod of administration \nTelmisartan tablets are for once-daily oral administration and should be taken with liquid, with or without \nfood. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n• Biliary obstructive disorders \n• Severe hepatic impairment \n \nThe concomitant use of Telmisartan Teva with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients \nwith diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPregnancy \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nHepatic impairment \nTelmisartan Teva is not to be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or severe \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile. These patients can \nbe expected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan. Telmisartan Teva should be used only with \ncaution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. \n \nRenovascular hypertension \nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal \nartery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal products that \naffect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \nWhen Telmisartan Teva is used in patients with impaired renal function, periodic monitoring of potassium \nand creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of \nTelmisartan Teva in patients with recent kidney transplantation. \n \nIntravascular hypovolaemia \nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose of Telmisartan Teva, may occur in patients who are \nvolume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea, or vomiting. \nSuch conditions should be corrected before the administration of Telmisartan Teva. Volume and/or sodium \ndepletion should be corrected prior to administration of Telmisartan Teva. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n \nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren \nincreases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). \nDual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with \ndiabetic nephropathy. \n \nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, \nincluding renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system such as telmisartan \nhas been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPrimary aldosteronism \nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products acting \nthrough inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not recommended. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or \nobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nDiabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics \nIn these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an \napproptiate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics \nmay be required, when indicated. \n \nHyperkalaemia \nThe use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause \nhyperkalaemia. \nIn the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic patients, in patients concomitantly treated with \nother medicinal products that may increase potassium levels, and/or in patients with intercurrent events, \nhyperkalaemia may be fatal. \n \nBefore considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensinaldosterone \nsystem, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated. \nThe main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are: \n- Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years) \n- Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosteronesystem and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of \nmedicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, \n\n\n\n5 \n\npotassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti-\ninflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, \nimmunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim. \n\n- Intercurrent events, in particular dehydratation, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis, \nworsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious diseases), \ncellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extend trauma). \n\n \nClose monitoring of serum potassium in at risk patients is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nSorbitol \nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take Telmisartan Teva. \n \nEthnic differences \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, telmisartan and the other angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population. \n \nOther \nAs with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic \ncardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDigoxin \nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma concentration \n(49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing \ntelmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nAs with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, telmisartan may \nprovoke hyperkalaemia (see section 4.4). The risk may increase in case of treatment combination with other \nmedicinal products that may also provoke hyperkalaemia (salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-\nsparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal antiinflammatory \nmedicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives \n(cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim). \n \nThe occurrence of hyperkalaemia depends on associated risk factors. The risk is increased in case of the \nabove-mentioned treatment combinations. The risk is particularly high in combination with potassium \nsparing-diuretics, and when combined with salt substitutes containing potassium. A combination with ACE \ninhibitors or NSAIDs, for example, presents a lesser risk provided that precautions for use are strictly \nfollowed. \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \n \nPotassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. Potassium \nsparing diuretics e.g. spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium supplements, or \npotassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum potassium. If concomitant \nuse is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent \nmonitoring of serum potassium. \n \nLithium \nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant \nadministration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with angiotensin II receptor \n\n\n\n6 \n\nantagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum \nlithium levels is recommended. \n \nConcomitant use requiring caution \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products \nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective \nNSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists. In some patients with \ncompromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised renal function), \nthe co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may \nresult in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually \nreversible. Therefore, the combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients \nshould be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after \ninitiation of concomitant therapy and periodically thereafter. \n \nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known. \n \nDiuretics (thiazide or loop diuretics) \nPrior treatment with high dose diuretics such as furosemide (loop diuretic) and hydrochlorothiazide (thiazide \ndiuretic) may result in volume depletion, and in a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with \ntelmisartan. \n \nTo be taken into account with concomitant use \n \nOther antihypertensive agents \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan can be increased by concomitant use of other \nantihypertensive medicinal products. \n \nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) through \nthe combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher \nfrequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including \nacute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products may \npotentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan: Baclofen, amifostine. \nFurthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics, or \nantidepressants. \n \nCorticosteroïds (systemic route) \nReduction of the antihypertensive effect. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy \n(see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and \nthird trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Telmisartan Teva in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during \nthe first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. \nWhilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, \n\n\n\n7 \n\nsimilar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is \nconsidered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive \ntreatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped \nimmediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started. \nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to \ninduce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and \nneonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). Should exposure to \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. Infants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Telmisartan Teva during breast-feeding, \nTelmisartan Teva is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles \nduring breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nFertility  \nIn preclinical studies, no effects of telmisartan on male and female fertility were observed. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nWhen driving vehicles or operating machinery it should be taken into account that dizziness or drowsiness \nmay occasionally occur when taking antihypertensive therapy, such as Telmisartan Teva. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nSerious adverse drug reactions include anaphylactic reaction and angioedema which may occur rarely \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), and acute renal failure. \n \nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions reported with telmisartan was usually comparable to placebo \n(41.4% vs 43.9 %) in controlled trials in patients treated for hypertension. The incidence of adverse reactions \nwas not dose related and showed no correlation with gender, age or race of the patients. The safety profile of \ntelmisartan in patients treated for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity was consistent with that obtained \nin hypertensive patients. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed below have been accumulated from controlled clinical trials in patients treated \nfor hypertension and from post-marketing reports. The listing also takes into account serious adverse \nreactions and adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported in three clinical long-term studies \nincluding 21,642 patients treated with telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity for up to six \nyears. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: \nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInfections and infestations \nUncommon: Urinary tract infection including cystitis, upper \n\nrespiratory tract infection including pharyngitis \n\n\n\n8 \n\nand sinusitis \nRare: Sepsis including fatal outcome1 \n  \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon Anaemia \nRare: Eosinophilia thrombocytopenia \n  \nImmune system disorders \nRare: Anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity \n  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nUncommon Hyperkalaemia \nRare: Hypoglycaemia (in diabetic patients) \n  \nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: Insomnia, depression \nRare: Anxiety \n  \nNervous system disorders \nUncommon: Syncope \nRare: Somnolence \n  \nEye disorders \nRare: Visual disturbance \n  \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nUncommon: Vertigo \n  \nCardiac disorders \nUncommon: Bradycardia \nRare: Tachycardia \n  \nVascular disorders \nUncommon: Hypotension2, orthostatic hypotension \n  \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: Dyspnoea, cough \nVery rare: Interstinal lung disease4 \n  \nGastrointestinal disorders \nUncommon: Abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, flatulence, \n\nvomiting \nRare: Dry mouth, stomach discomfort, dysgeusia \n  \nHepato-biliary disorders \nRare: Hepatic function abnormal/liver disorder3 \n  \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon: Pruritus, hyperhidrosis, rash \nRare: Angioedema (also with fatal outcome), eczema, \n\nerythema, urticaria, drug eruption, toxic skin \neruption  \n\n  \nMuscoloskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n\n\n9 \n\nUncommon: Back pain (e.g. sciatica), muscle spasms, myalgia \nRare: Arthralgia, pain in extremetis, tendon pain \n\n(tendenitis like symptoms) \n  \nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon: Renal impairment including acute renal failure \n  \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nUncommon: Chest pain, asthenia (weakness) \nRare: Influenza-like illness \n  \nInvestigations \nUncommon: Blood creatinine increased \nRare: Haemoglobin decreased, blood uric acid \n\nincreased, hepatic enzyme increased, blood \ncreatine phosphokinase increased \n\n \n1, 2, 3, 4: for further descriptions, please see sub-section  “Description of selected adverse reactions”. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nSepsis \nIn the PRoFESS trial, an increased incidence of sepsis was observed with telmisartan compared with \nplacebo. The event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known (see also section \n5.1). \n \nHypotension \nThis adverse reaction was reported as common in patients with controlled blood pressure who were treated \nwith telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity on top of standard care. \n \nHepatic function abnormal / liver disorder \nMost cases of hepatic function abnormal / liver disorder from post-marketing experience occurred in \nJapanese patients. Japanese patients are more likely to experience these adverse reactions. \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nCases of interstitial lung disease have been reported from post-marketing experience in temporal association \nwith the intake of telmisartan. However, a causal relationship has not been established. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited information available with regard to overdose in humans. \n \nSymptoms \nThe most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose were hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia \ndizziness, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been reported. \n \nTreatment \nTelmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment \nshould be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of \nthe symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nmay be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored \nfrequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume \nreplacement given quickly. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II Antagonists, plain, ATC Code: C09CA07. \n \nMechanism of action \nTelmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan \ndisplaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is \nresponsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity \nat the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is long-lasting. Telmisartan \ndoes not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised AT receptors. The \nfunctional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible overstimulation by \nangiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma aldosterone levels are decreased by \ntelmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels. Telmisartan does not \ninhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the enzyme which also degrades bradykinin. Therefore it \nis not expected to potentiate bradykinin-mediated adverse effects. \n \nIn human, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood pressure \nincrease. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 48 hours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension \nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within 3 hours. \nThe maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of treatment and \nis sustained during long-term therapy. \n \nThe antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours before \nthe next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by trough to peak \nratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo controlled clinical \nstudies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to recovery of baseline systolic blood \npressure (SBP). In this respect data concerning diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are inconsistent. \n \nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without affecting \npulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its hypotensive \nactivity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents \nrepresentative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials \ncomparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril). \n \nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment values \nover a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension. \n \nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those given \nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two antihypertensive \ntreatments. \n \nCardiovascular prevention \n \nONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) \ncompared the effects of telmisartan, ramipril and the combination of telmisartan and ramipril on \n\n\n\n11 \n\ncardiovascular outcomes in 25620 patients aged 55 years or older with a history of coronary artery disease, \nstroke, TIA, peripheral arterial disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ \ndamage (e.g. retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, macro- or microalbuminuria), which is a population at \nrisk for cardiovascular events. \n \nPatients were randomized to one of the three following treatment groups: telmisartan 80 mg (n = 8542), \nramipril 10 mg (n = 8576), or the combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus ramipril 10 mg (n = 8502), and \nfollowed for a mean observation time of 4.5 years.  \n \nTelmisartan showed a similar effect to ramipril in reducing the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular \ndeath, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure. The \nincidence of the primary endpoint was similar in the telmisartan (16.7 %) and ramipril (16.5 %) groups. The \nhazard ratio for telmisartan vs. ramipril was 1.01 (97.5 % CI 0.93 - 1.10, p (non-inferiority) = 0.0019 at a \nmargin of 1.13). The all-cause mortality rate was 11.6 % and 11.8 % among telmisartan and ramipril treated \npatients, respectively. \n \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with \nRamipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes)) \nhave examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an angiotensin II receptor blocker. \nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, \nor type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in \npatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as compared to \nmonotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also relevant \nfor other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients \nwith diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was a \nstudy designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor or an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, \ncardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse \noutcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than \nin the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, hypotension \nand renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group. \n \nTelmisartan was found to be similarly effective to ramipril in the pre-specified secondary endpoint of \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.99 (97.5 % CI 0.90 - 1.08), p \n(non-inferiority) = 0.0004], the primary endpoint in the reference study HOPE (The Heart Outcomes \nPrevention Evaluation Study), which had investigated the effect of ramipril vs. placebo.  \n \nTRANSCEND randomized ACE-I intolerant patients with otherwise similar inclusion criteria as \nONTARGET to telmisartan 80 mg (n=2954) or placebo (n=2972), both given on top of standard care. The \nmean duration of follow up was 4 years and 8 months. No statistically significant difference in the incidence \nof the primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or \nhospitalization for congestive heart failure) was found [15.7 % in the telmisartan and 17.0 % in the placebo \ngroups with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95 % CI 0.81 - 1.05, p = 0.22)]. There was evidence for a benefit of \ntelmisartan compared to placebo in the pre-specified secondary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, \nnon-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.87 (95 % CI 0.76 - 1.00, p = 0.048)]. There was no \nevidence for benefit on cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.03, 95 % CI 0.85 - 1.24). \n \nCough and angioedema were less frequently reported in patients treated with telmisartan than in patients \ntreated with ramipril, whereas hypotension was more frequently reported with telmisartan.  \n \nCombining telmisartan with ramipril did not add further benefit over ramipril or telmisartan alone. CV \nmortality and all cause mortality were numerically higher with the combination. In addition, there was a \n\n\n\n12 \n\nsignificantly higher incidence of hyperkalaemia, renal failure, hypotension and syncope in the combination \narm. Therefore the use of a combination of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended in this population. \n \nIn the “Prevention Regimen For Effectively avoiding Second Strokes” (PRoFESS) trial in patients 50 years \nand older, who recently experienced stroke, an increased incidence of sepsis was noted for telmisartan \ncompared with placebo, 0.70 % vs. 0.49 % [RR 1.43 (95 % confidence interval 1.00 - 2.06)]; the incidence \nof fatal sepsis cases was increased for patients taking telmisartan (0.33 %) vs. patients taking placebo (0.16 \n%) [RR 2.07 (95 % confidence interval 1.14 - 3.76)]. The observed increased occurrence rate of sepsis \nassociated with the use of telmisartan may be either a chance finding or related to a mechanism not currently \nknown. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety and efficacy of Telmisartan Teva in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of two doses of telmisartan were assessed in 76 hypertensive, largely \noverweight patients aged 6 to < 18 years (body weight ≥ 20 kg and ≤ 120 kg, mean 74.6 kg), after taking \ntelmisartan 1 mg/kg (n = 29 treated) or 2 mg/kg (n = 31 treated) over a four-week treatment period. By \ninclusion the presence of secondary hypertension was not investigated. In some of the investigated patients \nthe doses used were higher than those recommended in the treatment of hypertension in the adult population, \nreaching a daily dose comparable to160 mg, which was tested in adults. After adjustment for age group \neffects mean SBP changes from baseline (primary objective) were -14.5 (1.7) mm Hg in the telmisartan \n2 mg/kg group, -9.7 (1.7) mm Hg in the telmisartan 1 mg/kg group, and -6.0 (2.4) in the placebo group. The \nadjusted DBP changes from baseline were -8.4 (1.5) mm Hg, -4.5 (1.6) mm Hg and -3.5 (2.1) mm Hg \nrespectively. The change was dose dependent. The safety data from this study in patients aged 6 to < 18 \nyears appeared generally similar to that observed in adults. The safety of long term treatment of telmisartan \nin children and adolescents was not evaluated. \nAn increase in eosinophils reported in this patient population has not been recorded in adults. Its clinical \nsignificance and relevance is unknown. \nThese clinical data do not allow to make conclusions on the efficacy and safety of telmisartan in \nhypertensive paediatric population. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAbsorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute bioavailability \nfor telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the area under the \nplasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately 6 % (40 mg dose) to \napproximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma concentrations are similar \nwhether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy. There is no \nlinear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent AUC increase \ndisproportionately at doses above 40 mg. \n \nDistribution \nTelmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. \nThe mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l. \n \nBiotransformation \nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No pharmacological \nactivity has been shown for the conjugate. \n \nElimination \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTelmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination half-life of \n>20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area under the plasma \nconcentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no evidence of clinically \nrelevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma concentrations were higher in \nfemales than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy. \n \nAfter oral (and intravenous) administration, telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, mainly \nas unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma clearance (Cltot) is \nhigh (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about 1,500 ml/min). \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of two doses of telmisartan were assessed as a secondary objective in hypertensive \npatients (n = 57) aged 6 to < 18 years after taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg over a four-week treatment \nperiod. Pharmacokinetic objectives included the determination of the steady-state of telmisartan in children \nand adolescents, and investigation of age-related differences. Although the study was too small for a \nmeaningful assessment of the pharmacokinetics of children under 12 years of age, the results are generally \nconsistent with the findings in adults and confirm the non-linearity of telmisartan, particularly for Cmax. \n \nGender \nDifferences in plasma concentrations were observed, with Cmax and AUC being approximately 3- and 2-fold \nhigher, respectively, in females compared to males. \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations was \nobserved. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal insufficiency \nundergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient patients and cannot \nbe removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute bioavailability \nup to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range \ncaused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal \nhaemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium in \nnormotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal injury \n(erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-mediated \nundesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation. \n \nIn both species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular \ncells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance. \n \nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an effect \non the postnatal development of the offsprings such as lower body weight and delayed eye opening was \nobserved. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no evidence \nof carcinogenicity in rats and mice. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHypertension \nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults. \n \nCardiovascular prevention \nReduction of cardiovascular morbidity in adults with: \n• manifest atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral \n\narterial disease) or \n• type 2 diabetes mellitus with documented target organ damage \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension \nThe usually effective dose is 40 mg once daily. Some patients may already benefit at a daily dose of 20 mg. \nIn cases where the target blood pressure is not achieved, the dose of telmisartan can be increased to a \nmaximum of 80 mg once daily. Alternatively, telmisartan may be used in combination with thiazide-type \ndiuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, which has been shown to have an additive blood pressure lowering \neffect with telmisartan. When considering raising the dose, it must be borne in mind that the maximum \nantihypertensive effect is generally attained four to eight weeks after the start of treatment (see section 5.1). \n \nCardiovascular prevention \nThe recommended dose is 80 mg once daily. It is not known whether doses lower than 80 mg of telmisartan \nare effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity. \nWhen initiating telmisartan therapy for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity, close monitoring of blood \npressure is recommended, and if appropriate adjustment of medications that lower blood pressure may be \nnecessary. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \nLimited experience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. \nA lower starting dose of 20 mg is recommended in these patients (see section 4.4). No posology adjustment \nis required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.  \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nTelmisartan Teva is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the posology should not exceed 40 mg once daily (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Telmisartan Teva in children and adolescents aged below 18 have not been \nestablished.  \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \n \nMethod of administration \nTelmisartan tablets are for once-daily oral administration and should be taken with liquid, with or without \nfood. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n• Biliary obstructive disorders \n• Severe hepatic impairment \n \nThe concomitant use of Telmisartan Teva with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients \nwith diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPregnancy \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nHepatic impairment \nTelmisartan Teva is not to be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or severe \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile. These patients can \nbe expected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan. Telmisartan Teva should be used only with \ncaution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. \n \nRenovascular hypertension \nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal \nartery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal products that \naffect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \nWhen Telmisartan Teva is used in patients with impaired renal function, periodic monitoring of potassium \nand creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of \nTelmisartan Teva in patients with recent kidney transplantation. \n \nIntravascular hypovolaemia \nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose of Telmisartan Teva, may occur in patients who are \nvolume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea, or vomiting. \nSuch conditions should be corrected before the administration of Telmisartan Teva. Volume and/or sodium \ndepletion should be corrected prior to administration of Telmisartan Teva. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren \nincreases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). \nDual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with \ndiabetic nephropathy. \n \nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, \nincluding renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system such as telmisartan \nhas been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPrimary aldosteronism \nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products acting \nthrough inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not recommended. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or \nobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nDiabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics  \nIn these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an \napproptiate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics \nmay be required, when indicated. \n \nHyperkalaemia \nThe use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause \nhyperkalaemia. \nIn the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic patients, in patients concomitantly treated with \nother medicinal products that may increase potassium levels, and/or in patients with intercurrent events, \nhyperkalaemia may be fatal. \n \nBefore considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensinaldosterone \nsystem, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated. \nThe main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are: \n- Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years) \n- Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \n\nsystem and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of medicinal products \nthat may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti-inflammatory \n\n\n\n19 \n\nmedicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives \n(cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim. \n\n- Intercurrent events, in particular dehydratation, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis, \nworsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious diseases), \ncellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extend trauma). \n\n \nClose monitoring of serum potassium in at risk patients is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nSorbitol \nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take Telmisartan Teva. \n \nEthnic differences \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, telmisartan and the other angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population. \n \nOther \nAs with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic \ncardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nDigoxin \n \nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma concentration \n(49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing \ntelmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic range. \n \nAs with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, telmisartan may \nprovoke hyperkalaemia (see section 4.4). The risk may increase in case of treatment combination with other \nmedicinal products that may also provoke hyperkalaemia (salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-\nsparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives \n(cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim). \n \nThe occurrence of hyperkalaemia depends on associated risk factors. The risk is increased in case of the \nabove-mentioned treatment combinations. The risk is particularly high in combination with potassium \nsparing-diuretics, and when combined with salt substitutes containing potassium. A combination with ACE \ninhibitors or NSAIDs, for example, presents a lesser risk provided that precautions for use are strictly \nfollowed. \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \n \nPotassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. Potassium \nsparing diuretics e.g. spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium supplements, or \npotassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum potassium. If concomitant \nuse is indicated because of documented hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent \nmonitoring of serum potassium. \n \nLithium \nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant \nadministration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with angiotensin II receptor \n\n\n\n20 \n\nantagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum \nlithium levels is recommended. \n \nConcomitant use requiring caution \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products \nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective \nNSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists. In some patients with \ncompromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised renal function), \nthe co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may \nresult in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually \nreversible. Therefore, the combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients \nshould be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after \ninitiation of concomitant therapy and periodically thereafter. \n \nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known. \n \nDiuretics (thiazide or loop diuretics) \nPrior treatment with high dose diuretics such as furosemide (loop diuretic) and hydrochlorothiazide (thiazide \ndiuretic) may result in volume depletion, and in a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with \ntelmisartan. \n \nTo be taken into account with concomitant use \n \nOther antihypertensive agents \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan can be increased by concomitant use of other \nantihypertensive medicinal products. \n \nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) through \nthe combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher \nfrequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including \nacute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products may \npotentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan: Baclofen, amifostine. \nFurthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics, or \nantidepressants. \n \nCorticosteroïds (systemic route) \nReduction of the antihypertensive effect. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy \n(see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and \nthird trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Telmisartan Teva in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during \nthe first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. \nWhilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, \n\n\n\n21 \n\nsimilar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is \nconsidered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive \ntreatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped \nimmediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started. \nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to \ninduce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and \nneonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). Should exposure to \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. Infants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Telmisartan Teva during breast-feeding, \nTelmisartan Teva is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles \nduring breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nFertility  \nIn preclinical studies, no effects of telmisartan on male and female fertility were observed. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nWhen driving vehicles or operating machinery it should be taken into account that dizziness or drowsiness \nmay occasionally occur when taking antihypertensive therapy such as Telmisartan Teva. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nSerious adverse drug reactions include anaphylactic reaction and angioedema which may occur rarely \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), and acute renal failure. \n \nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions reported with telmisartan was usually comparable to placebo \n(41.4% vs 43.9 %) in controlled trials in patients treated for hypertension. The incidence of adverse reactions \nwas not dose related and showed no correlation with gender, age or race of the patients. The safety profile of \ntelmisartan in patients treated for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity was consistent with that obtained \nin hypertensive patients. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed below have been accumulated from controlled clinical trials in patients treated \nfor hypertension and from post-marketing reports. The listing also takes into account serious adverse \nreactions and adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported in three clinical long-term studies \nincluding 21642 patients treated with telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity for up to six \nyears.  \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: \nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInfections and infestations \nUncommon: Urinary tract infection including cystitis, upper \n\nrespiratory tract infection including pharyngitis \n\n\n\n22 \n\nand sinusitis, \nRare: Sepsis including fatal outcome1 \n  \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon Anaemia \nRare: Eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia \n  \nImmune system disorders \nRare: Anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity  \n  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nUncommon Hyperkalaemia \nRare: Hypoglycaemia (in diabetic patients) \n  \nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: Insomnia, depression \nRare: Anxiety \n  \nNervous system disorders \nUncommon: Syncope \nRare: Somnolence \n  \nEye disorders \nRare: Visual disturbance \n  \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nUncommon: Vertigo \n  \nCardiac disorders \nUncommon: Bradycardia \nRare: Tachycardia \n  \nVascular disorders \nUncommon: Hypotension2, orthostatic hypotension \n  \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: Dyspnoea, cough \nVery rare: Interstinal lung disease4 \n  \nGastrointestinal disorders \nUncommon: Abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, flatulence, \n\nvomiting \nRare: Dry mouth, stomach discomfort, dysgeusia \n  \nHepato-biliary disorders \nRare: Hepatic function abnormal/liver disorder 3 \n  \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon: Pruritus, hyperhidrosis, rash \nRare: Angioedema (also with fatal outcome), eczema, \n\nerythema, urticaria, drug eruption, toxic skin \neruption \n\n  \nMuscoloskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n\n\n23 \n\nUncommon: Back pain (e.g. sciatica), muscle spasms, myalgia \nRare: Arthralgia, pain in extremetis, tendon pain \n\n(tendenitis like symptoms) \n  \nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon: Renal impairment including acute renal failure \n  \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nUncommon: Chest pain, asthenia (weakness) \nRare: Influenza-like illness \n  \nInvestigations \nUncommon: Blood creatinine increased \nRare: Haemoglobin decreased, blood uric acid \n\nincreased, hepatic enzyme increased, blood \ncreatine phosphokinase increased \n\n \n1, 2, 3, 4: for further descriptions, please see sub-section “Description of selected adverse reactions”. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nSepsis \nIn the PRoFESS trial, an increased incidence of sepsis was observed with telmisartan compared with \nplacebo. The event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known (see also section \n5.1). \n \nHypotension \nThis adverse reaction was reported as common in patients with controlled blood pressure who were treated \nwith telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity on top of standard care. \n \nHepatic function abnormal / liver disorder \nMost cases of hepatic function abnormal / liver disorder from post-marketing experience occurred in \nJapanese patients. Japanese patients are more likely to experience these adverse reactions. \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nCases of interstitial lung disease have been reported from post-marketing experience in temporal association \nwith the intake of telmisartan. However, a causal relationship has not been established. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited information available with regard to overdose in humans. \n \nSymptoms \nThe most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose were hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia \ndizziness, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been reported. \n \nTreatment \nTelmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment \nshould be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of \nthe symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n24 \n\nmay be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored \nfrequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume \nreplacement given quickly. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II Antagonists, plain, ATC Code: C09CA07. \n \nMechanism of action \nTelmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan \ndisplaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is \nresponsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity \nat the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is long-lasting. Telmisartan \ndoes not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised AT receptors. The \nfunctional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible overstimulation by \nangiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma aldosterone levels are decreased by \ntelmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels. Telmisartan does not \ninhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the enzyme which also degrades bradykinin. Therefore it \nis not expected to potentiate bradykininmediated adverse effects. \n \nIn human, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood pressure \nincrease. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 48 hours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension \nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within 3 hours. \nThe maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of treatment and \nis sustained during long-term therapy. \n \nThe antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours before \nthe next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by trough to peak \nratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo controlled clinical \nstudies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to recovery of baseline systolic blood \npressure (SBP). In this respect data concerning diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are inconsistent. \n \nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without affecting \npulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its hypotensive \nactivity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents \nrepresentative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials \ncomparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril). \n \nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment values \nover a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension. \n \nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those given \nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two antihypertensive \ntreatments. \n \nCardiovascular prevention \n \nONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) \ncompared the effects of telmisartan, ramipril and the combination of telmisartan and ramipril on \n\n\n\n25 \n\ncardiovascular outcomes in 25620 patients aged 55 years or older with a history of coronary artery disease, \nstroke, TIA, peripheral arterial disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ \ndamage (e.g. retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, macro- or microalbuminuria), which is a population at \nrisk for cardiovascular events. \n \nPatients were randomized to one of the three following treatment groups: telmisartan 80 mg (n = 8542), \nramipril 10 mg (n = 8576), or the combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus ramipril 10 mg (n = 8502), and \nfollowed for a mean observation time of 4.5 years.  \n \nTelmisartan showed a similar effect to ramipril in reducing the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular \ndeath, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure. The \nincidence of the primary endpoint was similar in the telmisartan (16.7 %) and ramipril (16.5 %) groups. The \nhazard ratio for telmisartan vs. ramipril was 1.01 (97.5 % CI 0.93 - 1.10, p (non-inferiority) = 0.0019 at a \nmargin of 1.13). The all-cause mortality rate was 11.6 % and 11.8 % among telmisartan and ramipril treated \npatients, respectively. \n \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with \nRamipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes)) \nhave examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an angiotensin II receptor blocker. \nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, \nor type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in \npatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as compared to \nmonotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also relevant \nfor other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients \nwith diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was a \nstudy designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor or an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, \ncardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse \noutcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than \nin the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, hypotension \nand renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group. \n \nTelmisartan was found to be similarly effective to ramipril in the pre-specified secondary endpoint of \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.99 (97.5 % CI 0.90 - 1.08), p \n(non-inferiority) = 0.0004], the primary endpoint in the reference study HOPE (The Heart Outcomes \nPrevention Evaluation Study), which had investigated the effect of ramipril vs. placebo.  \n \nTRANSCEND randomized ACE-I intolerant patients with otherwise similar inclusion criteria as \nONTARGET to telmisartan 80 mg (n=2954) or placebo (n=2972), both given on top of standard care. The \nmean duration of follow up was 4 years and 8 months. No statistically significant difference in the incidence \nof the primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or \nhospitalization for congestive heart failure) was found [15.7 % in the telmisartan and 17.0 % in the placebo \ngroups with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95 % CI 0.81 - 1.05, p = 0.22)]. There was evidence for a benefit of \ntelmisartan compared to placebo in the pre-specified secondary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, \nnon-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.87 (95 % CI 0.76 - 1.00, p = 0.048)]. There was no \nevidence for benefit on cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.03, 95 % CI 0.85 - 1.24). \n \nCough and angioedema were less frequently reported in patients treated with telmisartan than in patients \ntreated with ramipril, whereas hypotension was more frequently reported with telmisartan.  \n \nCombining telmisartan with ramipril did not add further benefit over ramipril or telmisartan alone. CV \nmortality and all cause mortality were numerically higher with the combination. In addition, there was a \n\n\n\n26 \n\nsignificantly higher incidence of hyperkalaemia, renal failure, hypotension and syncope in the combination \narm. Therefore the use of a combination of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended in this population. \n \nIn the “Prevention Regimen For Effectively avoiding Second Strokes” (PRoFESS) trial in patients 50 years \nand older, who recently experienced stroke, an increased incidence of sepsis was noted for telmisartan \ncompared with placebo, 0.70 % vs. 0.49 % [RR 1.43 (95 % confidence interval 1.00 - 2.06)]; the incidence \nof fatal sepsis cases was increased for patients taking telmisartan (0.33 %) vs. patients taking placebo (0.16 \n%) [RR 2.07 (95 % confidence interval 1.14 - 3.76)]. The observed increased occurrence rate of sepsis \nassociated with the use of telmisartan may be either a chance finding or related to a mechanism not currently \nknown. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety and efficacy of Telmisartan Teva in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of two doses of telmisartan were assessed in 76 hypertensive, largely \noverweight patients aged 6 to < 18 years (body weight ≥ 20 kg and ≤ 120 kg, mean 74.6 kg), after taking \ntelmisartan 1 mg/kg (n = 29 treated) or 2 mg/kg (n = 31 treated) over a four-week treatment period. By \ninclusion the presence of secondary hypertension was not investigated. In some of the investigated patients \nthe doses used were higher than those recommended in the treatment of hypertension in the adult population, \nreaching a daily dose comparable to160 mg, which was tested in adults. After adjustment for age group \neffects mean SBP changes from baseline (primary objective) were -14.5 (1.7) mm Hg in the telmisartan \n2 mg/kg group, -9.7 (1.7) mm Hg in the telmisartan 1 mg/kg group, and -6.0 (2.4) in the placebo group. The \nadjusted DBP changes from baseline were -8.4 (1.5) mm Hg, -4.5 (1.6) mm Hg and -3.5 (2.1) mm Hg \nrespectively. The change was dose dependent. The safety data from this study in patients aged 6 to < 18 \nyears appeared generally similar to that observed in adults. The safety of long term treatment of telmisartan \nin children and adolescents was not evaluated. \nAn increase in eosinophils reported in this patient population has not been recorded in adults. Its clinical \nsignificance and relevance is unknown. \nThese clinical data do not allow to make conclusions on the efficacy and safety of telmisartan in \nhypertensive paediatric population. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAbsorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute bioavailability \nfor telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the area under the \nplasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately 6 % (40 mg dose) to \napproximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma concentrations are similar \nwhether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy. There is no \nlinear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent AUC increase \ndisproportionately at doses above 40 mg. \n \nDistribution \nTelmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. \nThe mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l. \n \nBiotransformation \nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No pharmacological \nactivity has been shown for the conjugate. \n \nElimination \n\n\n\n27 \n\nTelmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination half-life of \n>20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area under the plasma \nconcentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no evidence of clinically \nrelevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma concentrations were higher in \nfemales than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy. \n \nAfter oral (and intravenous) administration, telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, mainly \nas unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma clearance (Cltot) is \nhigh (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about 1,500 ml/min). \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of two doses of telmisartan were assessed as a secondary objective in hypertensive \npatients (n = 57) aged 6 to < 18 years after taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg over a four-week treatment \nperiod. Pharmacokinetic objectives included the determination of the steady-state of telmisartan in children \nand adolescents, and investigation of age-related differences. Although the study was too small for a \nmeaningful assessment of the pharmacokinetics of children under 12 years of age, the results are generally \nconsistent with the findings in adults and confirm the non-linearity of telmisartan, particularly for Cmax. \n \nGender \nDifferences in plasma concentrations were observed, with Cmax and AUC being approximately 3- and 2-fold \nhigher, respectively, in females compared to males. \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations was \nobserved. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal insufficiency \nundergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient patients and cannot \nbe removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute bioavailability \nup to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range \ncaused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal \nhaemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium in \nnormotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal injury \n(erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-mediated \nundesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation. \n \nIn both species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular \ncells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance. \n \nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an effect \non the postnatal development of the offsprings such as lower body weight and delayed eye opening was \nobserved. \n  \n\n\n\n28 \n\nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no evidence \nof carcinogenicity in rats and mice. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHypertension \nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults. \n \nCardiovascular prevention \nReduction of cardiovascular morbidity in adults with: \n• manifest atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral \n\narterial disease) or \n• type 2 diabetes mellitus with documented target organ damage \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension \nThe usually effective dose is 40 mg once daily. Some patients may already benefit at a daily dose of 20 mg. \nIn cases where the target blood pressure is not achieved, the dose of telmisartan can be increased to a \nmaximum of 80 mg once daily. Alternatively, telmisartan may be used in combination with thiazide-type \ndiuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, which has been shown to have an additive blood pressure lowering \neffect with telmisartan. When considering raising the dose, it must be borne in mind that the maximum \nantihypertensive effect is generally attained four to eight weeks after the start of treatment (see section 5.1). \n \nCardiovascular prevention \nThe recommended dose is 80 mg once daily. It is not known whether doses lower than 80 mg of telmisartan \nare effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity. \nWhen initiating telmisartan therapy for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity, close monitoring of blood \npressure is recommended, and if appropriate adjustment of medications that lower blood pressure may be \nnecessary. \n \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \nLimited experience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. \nA lower starting dose of 20 mg is recommended in these patients (see section 4.4). No posology adjustment \nis required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.  \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nTelmisartan Teva is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the posology should not exceed 40 mg once daily (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Telmisartan Teva in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished.  \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \n \nMethod of administration \nTelmisartan tablets are for once-daily oral administration and should be taken with liquid, with or without \nfood. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n• Biliary obstructive disorders \n• Severe hepatic impairment \n \nThe concomitant use of Telmisartan Teva with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients \nwith diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPregnancy \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nHepatic impairment \nTelmisartan Teva is not to be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or severe \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile. These patients can \nbe expected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan. Telmisartan Teva should be used only with \ncaution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. \n \nRenovascular hypertension \nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal \nartery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal products that \naffect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \nWhen Telmisartan Teva is used in patients with impaired renal function, periodic monitoring of potassium \nand creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of \nTelmisartan Teva in patients with recent kidney transplantation. \n \nIntravascular hypovolaemia \nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose of Telmisartan Teva, may occur in patients who are \nvolume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea, or vomiting. \nSuch conditions should be corrected before the administration of Telmisartan Teva. Volume and/or sodium \ndepletion should be corrected prior to administration of Telmisartan Teva. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren \nincreases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal \nfailure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor \nblockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with \ndiabetic nephropathy. \n\n \nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, \nincluding renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system such as telmisartan \nhas been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPrimary aldosteronism \nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products acting \nthrough inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not recommended. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or \nobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nDiabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics  \nIn these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an \napproptiate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics may be \nrequired, when indicated. \n \nHyperkalaemia \nThe use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause \nhyperkalaemia. \nIn the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic patients, in patients concomitantly treated with \nother medicinal products that may increase potassium levels, and/or in patients with intercurrent events, \nhyperkalaemia may be fatal. \n \nBefore considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated. \nThe main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are: \n- Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years) \n- Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \n\nsystem and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of medicinal products \nthat may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing \n\n\n\n33 \n\ndiuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives \n(cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim. \n\n- Intercurrent events, in particular dehydratation, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis, \nworsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious diseases), \ncellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extend trauma). \n\n \nClose monitoring of serum potassium in at risk patients is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nSorbitol \nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take Telmisartan Teva. \n \nEthnic differences \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, telmisartan and the other angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population. \n \nOther \nAs with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic \ncardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nDigoxin \n \nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma concentration \n(49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing \ntelmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic range. \n \nAs with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, telmisartan may \nprovoke hyperkalaemia (see section 4.4). The risk may increase in case of treatment combination with other \nmedicinal products that may also provoke hyperkalaemia (salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-\nsparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives \n(cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim). \n \nThe occurrence of hyperkalaemia depends on associated risk factors. The risk is increased in case of the \nabove-mentioned treatment combinations. The risk is particularly high in combination with potassium \nsparing-diuretics, and when combined with salt substitutes containing potassium. A combination with ACE \ninhibitors or NSAIDs, for example, presents a lesser risk provided that precautions for use are strictly \nfollowed. \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \n \nPotassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. Potassium \nsparing diuretics e.g. spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium supplements, or \npotassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum potassium. If concomitant \nuse is indicated because of documented hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent \nmonitoring of serum potassium. \n \nLithium \nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant \nadministration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with angiotensin II receptor \n\n\n\n34 \n\nantagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum \nlithium levels is recommended. \n \nConcomitant use requiring caution \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products \nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective \nNSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists. In some patients with \ncompromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised renal function), \nthe co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may \nresult in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually \nreversible. Therefore, the combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients \nshould be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after \ninitiation of concomitant therapy and periodically thereafter. \n \nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known. \n \nDiuretics (thiazide or loop diuretics) \n \nPrior treatment with high dose diuretics such as furosemide (loop diuretic) and hydrochlorothiazide (thiazide \ndiuretic) may result in volume depletion, and in a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with \ntelmisartan. \n \nTo be taken into account with concomitant use \n \nOther antihypertensive agents \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan can be increased by concomitant use of other \nantihypertensive medicinal products. \n \nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) through \nthe combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher \nfrequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including \nacute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products may \npotentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan: Baclofen, amifostine. \nFurthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics, or \nantidepressants. \n \nCorticosteroïds (systemic route) \nReduction of the antihypertensive effect. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy \n(see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and \nthird trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Telmisartan Teva in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during \nthe first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. \n\n\n\n35 \n\nWhilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, \nsimilar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is \nconsidered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive \ntreatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped \nimmediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started. \nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to \ninduce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and \nneonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). Should exposure to \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. Infants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Telmisartan Teva during breast-feeding, \nTelmisartan Teva is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles \nduring breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nFertility  \nIn preclinical studies, no effects of telmisartan on male and female fertility were observed. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nWhen driving vehicles or operating machinery it should be taken into account that dizziness or drowsiness \nmay occasionally occur when taking antihypertensive therapy such as Telmisartan Teva. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nSerious adverse drug reactions include anaphylactic reaction and angioedema which may occur rarely \n(≥1/10,000 to < 1/1000), and acute renal failure. \n \nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions reported with telmisartan was usually comparable to placebo \n(41.4% vs 43.9 %) in controlled trials in patients treated for hypertension. The incidence of adverse reactions \nwas not dose related and showed no correlation with gender, age or race of the patients. The safety profile of \ntelmisartan in patients treated for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity was consistent with that obtained \nin hypertensive patients. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed below have been accumulated from controlled clinical trials in patients treated \nfor hypertension and from post-marketing reports. The listing also takes into account serious adverse \nreactions and adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported in three clinical long-term studies \nincluding 21642 patients treated with telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity for up to six \nyears.  \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: \nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInfections and infestations \nUncommon: Urinary tract infection including cystitis, upper \n\n\n\n36 \n\nrespiratory tract infection including pharyngitis \nand sinusitis, \n\nRare: Sepsis including fatal outcome1 \n  \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon Anaemia \nRare: Eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia \n  \nImmune system disorders \nRare: Anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity \n  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nUncommon Hyperkalaemia \nRare: Hypoglycaemia (in diabetic patients) \n  \nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: Insomnia, depression \nRare: Anxiety \n  \nNervous system disorders \nUncommon: Syncope \nRare: Somnolence \n  \nEye disorders \nRare: Visual disturbance \n  \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nUncommon: Vertigo \n  \nCardiac disorders \nUncommon: Bradycardia \nRare: Tachycardia \n  \nVascular disorders \nUncommon: Hypotension2, orthostatic hypotension \n  \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: Dyspnoea, cough \nVery rare: Interstinal lung disease4 \n  \nGastrointestinal disorders \nUncommon: Abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, flatulence, \n\nvomiting \nRare: Dry mouth, stomach discomfort, dysgeusia \n  \nHepato-biliary disorders \nRare: Hepatic function abnormal/liver disorder 3 \n  \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon: Pruritus, hyperhidrosis, rash \nRare: Angioedema (also with fatal outcome), eczema, \n\nerythema, urticaria, drug eruption, toxic skin \neruption \n\n  \n\n\n\n37 \n\nMuscoloskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nUncommon: Back pain (e.g. sciatica), muscle spasms, myalgia \nRare: Arthralgia, pain in extremetis, tendon pain \n\n(tendenitis like symptoms) \n  \nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon: Renal impairment including acute renal failure \n  \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nUncommon: Chest pain, asthenia (weakness) \nRare: Influenza-like illness \n  \nInvestigations \nUncommon: Blood creatinine increased \nRare: Haemoglobin decreased, blood uric acid \n\nincreased, hepatic enzyme increased, blood \ncreatine phosphokinase increased \n\n \n1, 2, 3, 4: for further descriptions, please see sub-section ”Description of selected adverse reactions”. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nSepsis \nIn the PRoFESS trial, an increased incidence of sepsis was observed with telmisartan compared with \nplacebo. The event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known (see also section \n5.1). \n \nHypotension \nThis adverse reaction was reported as common in patients with controlled blood pressure who were treated \nwith telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity on top of standard care. \n \nHepatic function abnormal / liver disorder \nMost cases of hepatic function abnormal / liver disorder from post-marketing experience occurred in \nJapanese patients. Japanese patients are more likely to experience these adverse reactions. \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nCases of interstitial lung disease have been reported from post-marketing experience in temporal association \nwith the intake of telmisartan. However, a causal relationship has not been established. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited information available with regard to overdose in humans. \n \nSymptoms \nThe most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose were hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia \ndizziness, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been reported. \n \nTreatment \nTelmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment \nshould be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n38 \n\nthe symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal \nmay be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored \nfrequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume \nreplacement given quickly. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II Antagonists, plain, ATC Code: C09CA07. \n \nMechanism of action \nTelmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan \ndisplaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is \nresponsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity \nat the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is long-lasting. Telmisartan \ndoes not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised AT receptors. The \nfunctional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible overstimulation by \nangiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma aldosterone levels are decreased by \ntelmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels. Telmisartan does not \ninhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the enzyme which also degrades bradykinin. Therefore it \nis not expected to potentiate bradykininmediated adverse effects. \n \nIn human, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood pressure \nincrease. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 48 hours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension \nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within 3 hours. \nThe maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of treatment and \nis sustained during long-term therapy. \n \nThe antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours before \nthe next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by trough to peak \nratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo controlled clinical \nstudies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to recovery of baseline systolic blood \npressure (SBP). In this respect data concerning diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are inconsistent. \n \nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without affecting \npulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its hypotensive \nactivity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents \nrepresentative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials \ncomparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril). \n \nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment values \nover a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension. \n \nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those given \nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two antihypertensive \ntreatments. \n \nCardiovascular prevention \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) \ncompared the effects of telmisartan, ramipril and the combination of telmisartan and ramipril on \ncardiovascular outcomes in 25620 patients aged 55 years or older with a history of coronary artery disease, \nstroke, TIA, peripheral arterial disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ \ndamage (e.g. retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, macro- or microalbuminuria), which is a population at \nrisk for cardiovascular events. \n \nPatients were randomized to one of the three following treatment groups: telmisartan 80 mg (n = 8542), \nramipril 10 mg (n = 8576), or the combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus ramipril 10 mg (n = 8502), and \nfollowed for a mean observation time of 4.5 years.  \n \nTelmisartan showed a similar effect to ramipril in reducing the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular \ndeath, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure. The \nincidence of the primary endpoint was similar in the telmisartan (16.7 %) and ramipril (16.5 %) groups. The \nhazard ratio for telmisartan vs. ramipril was 1.01 (97.5 % CI 0.93 - 1.10, p (non-inferiority) = 0.0019 at a \nmargin of 1.13). The all-cause mortality rate was 11.6 % and 11.8 % among telmisartan and ramipril treated \npatients, respectively. \n \nTelmisartan was found to be similarly effective to ramipril in the pre-specified secondary endpoint of \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.99 (97.5 % CI 0.90 - 1.08), p \n(non-inferiority) = 0.0004], the primary endpoint in the reference study HOPE (The Heart Outcomes \nPrevention Evaluation Study), which had investigated the effect of ramipril vs. placebo.  \n \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with \nRamipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes)) \nhave examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an angiotensin II receptor blocker. \nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, \nor type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in \npatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as compared to \nmonotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also relevant \nfor other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients \nwith diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was a \nstudy designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor or an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, \ncardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse \noutcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than \nin the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, hypotension \nand renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group. \n \nTRANSCEND randomized ACE-I intolerant patients with otherwise similar inclusion criteria as \nONTARGET to telmisartan 80 mg (n=2954) or placebo (n=2972), both given on top of standard care. The \nmean duration of follow up was 4 years and 8 months. No statistically significant difference in the incidence \nof the primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or \nhospitalization for congestive heart failure) was found [15.7 % in the telmisartan and 17.0 % in the placebo \ngroups with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95 % CI 0.81 - 1.05, p = 0.22)]. There was evidence for a benefit of \ntelmisartan compared to placebo in the pre-specified secondary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, \nnon-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.87 (95 % CI 0.76 - 1.00, p = 0.048)]. There was no \nevidence for benefit on cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.03, 95 % CI 0.85 - 1.24). \n \nCough and angioedema were less frequently reported in patients treated with telmisartan than in patients \ntreated with ramipril, whereas hypotension was more frequently reported with telmisartan.  \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nCombining telmisartan with ramipril did not add further benefit over ramipril or telmisartan alone. CV \nmortality and all cause mortality were numerically higher with the combination. In addition, there was a \nsignificantly higher incidence of hyperkalaemia, renal failure, hypotension and syncope in the combination \narm. Therefore the use of a combination of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended in this population. \n \nIn the “Prevention Regimen For Effectively avoiding Second Strokes” (PRoFESS) trial in patients 50 years \nand older, who recently experienced stroke, an increased incidence of sepsis was noted for telmisartan \ncompared with placebo, 0.70 % vs. 0.49 % [RR 1.43 (95 % confidence interval 1.00 - 2.06)]; the incidence \nof fatal sepsis cases was increased for patients taking telmisartan (0.33 %) vs. patients taking placebo (0.16 \n%) [RR 2.07 (95 % confidence interval 1.14 - 3.76)]. The observed increased occurrence rate of sepsis \nassociated with the use of telmisartan may be either a chance finding or related to a mechanism not currently \nknown. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety and efficacy of Telmisartan Teva in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of two doses of telmisartan were assessed in 76 hypertensive, largely \noverweight patients aged 6 to < 18 years (body weight ≥ 20 kg and ≤ 120 kg, mean 74.6 kg), after taking \ntelmisartan 1 mg/kg (n = 29 treated) or 2 mg/kg (n = 31 treated) over a four-week treatment period. By \ninclusion the presence of secondary hypertension was not investigated. In some of the investigated patients \nthe doses used were higher than those recommended in the treatment of hypertension in the adult population, \nreaching a daily dose comparable to160 mg, which was tested in adults. After adjustment for age group \neffects mean SBP changes from baseline (primary objective) were -14.5 (1.7) mm Hg in the telmisartan \n2 mg/kg group, -9.7 (1.7) mm Hg in the telmisartan 1 mg/kg group, and -6.0 (2.4) in the placebo group. The \nadjusted DBP changes from baseline were -8.4 (1.5) mm Hg, -4.5 (1.6) mm Hg and -3.5 (2.1) mm Hg \nrespectively. The change was dose dependent. The safety data from this study in patients aged 6 to < 18 \nyears appeared generally similar to that observed in adults. The safety of long term treatment of telmisartan \nin children and adolescents was not evaluated. \nAn increase in eosinophils reported in this patient population has not been recorded in adults. Its clinical \nsignificance and relevance is unknown. \nThese clinical data do not allow to make conclusions on the efficacy and safety of telmisartan in \nhypertensive paediatric population. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAbsorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute bioavailability \nfor telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the area under the \nplasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately 6 % (40 mg dose) to \napproximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma concentrations are similar \nwhether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy. There is no \nlinear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent AUC increase \ndisproportionately at doses above 40 mg. \n \nDistribution \nTelmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. \nThe mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l. \n \nBiotransformation \nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No pharmacological \nactivity has been shown for the conjugate. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nElimination \nTelmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination half-life of \n>20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area under the plasma \nconcentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no evidence of clinically \nrelevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma concentrations were higher in \nfemales than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy. \n \nAfter oral (and intravenous) administration, telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, mainly \nas unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma clearance (Cltot) is \nhigh (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about 1,500 ml/min). \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of two doses of telmisartan were assessed as a secondary objective in hypertensive \npatients (n = 57) aged 6 to < 18 years after taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg over a four-week treatment \nperiod. Pharmacokinetic objectives included the determination of the steady-state of telmisartan in children \nand adolescents, and investigation of age-related differences. Although the study was too small for a \nmeaningful assessment of the pharmacokinetics of children under 12 years of age, the results are generally \nconsistent with the findings in adults and confirm the non-linearity of telmisartan, particularly for Cmax. \n \nGender \nDifferences in plasma concentrations were observed, with Cmax and AUC being approximately 3- and 2-fold \nhigher, respectively, in females compared to males. \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations was \nobserved. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal insufficiency \nundergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient patients and cannot \nbe removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute bioavailability \nup to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range \ncaused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal \nhaemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium in \nnormotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal injury \n(erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-mediated \nundesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation. \n \nIn both species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular \ncells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance. \n \nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an effect \non the postnatal development of the offsprings such as lower body weight and delayed eye opening was \nobserved. \n  \n\n\n\n42 \n\nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no evidence \nof carcinogenicity in rats and mice. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if \n\ntheir signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If  you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Telmisartan Teva is and what it is used for \n2.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Telmisartan Teva is and what it is used for \n \nTelmisartan Teva belongs to a class of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin II is a substance occurring in the body, which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus \nincreasing your blood pressure. Telmisartan Teva blocks this effect of angiotensin II so that the blood vessels \nrelax, and your blood pressure is lowered. \n \nTelmisartan Teva is used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults. ‘Essential’ means \nthat the high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition. \n \nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs,  which could lead sometimes \nto heart attacks, heart or kidney failure, strokes or blindness. There are usually no symptoms of high blood \npressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure to verify if it is \nwithin the normal range. \n \nTelmisartan Teva is also used to reduce cardiovascular events (i.e. heart attack or stroke) in adults who are at \nrisk because they have a reduced or blocked blood supply to the heart or legs, or have had a stroke or have \nhigh risk diabetes. Your doctor can tell you if you are at high risk for such events. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Telmisartan Teva \n \nDo not take Telmisartan Teva \n- if you are allergic  to telmisartan or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant (It is also better to avoid Telmisartan Teva in early pregnancy \n\n– see pregnancy section). \n- if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with the \n\ndrainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease. \n- if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure lowering \n\nmedicine containing aliskiren.   \n \nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Telmisartan Teva. \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or \nillnesses: \n- Kidney disease or kidney transplant \n-  Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys) \n- Liver disease \n- Heart trouble \n- Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various blood \n\nminerals) \n- Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body water) \n\nor have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (‘water tablets’), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or vomiting. \n- Elevated potassium levels in your blood \n- Diabetes \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Telmisartan Teva: \n• if you are taking digoxin. \n• if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-\nrelated kidney problems. \n- aliskiren \n\n \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. potassium) \nin your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading “Do not take Telmisartan Teva”. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant. Telmisartan Teva is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n \nIn case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Telmisartan Teva. \n \nTelmisartan Teva may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Telmisartan Teva in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Telmisartan Teva \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  \n \nYour doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other precautions. In some cases \nyou may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed below taken \nat the same time with Telmisartan Teva. \n \n\n• If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take \nTelmisartan Teva” and “Warnings and precautions”). \n\n• Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression. \n• Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing potassium, \n\npotassium-sparing diuretics (certain ‘water tablets’), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen), heparin, \nimmunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim. \n\n• Diuretics (‘water tablets’), especially if taken in high doses together with Telmisartan Teva, may lead \nto excessive loss of body water and low blood pressure (hypotension). \n\n• Digoxin. \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \nThe effect of Telmisartan Teva may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen) or corticosteroids. \n \nTelmisartan Teva may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood \npressure. \n \nIf you suffer from a condition called “orthostatic hypotension” (a drop in blood pressure on standing up from \na sitting or lying position resulting in dizziness or faintness) your condition may worsen if you take \nTelmisartan Teva in combination with: \n\n• Other medicines used to treat high blood pressure \n• Baclofen (a muscle relaxant) \n• Amifostine (a protective medicine during radiotherapy for cancer treatment) \n• Alcohol \n• Barbiturates (strong sleeping tablets) \n• Narcotics (strong pain killers) \n• Antidepressants \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally advise \nyou to stop taking Telmisartan Teva before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are pregnant \nand will advise you to take another medicine instead of Telmisartan Teva.  Telmisartan Teva is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause \nserious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding.  Telmisartan Teva is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if \nyou wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome people feel dizzy or tired when taking Telmisartan Teva. If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or \noperate machinery. \n \nTelmisartan Teva contains sorbitol.  \nIf you are intolerant to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking Telmisartan Teva. \n \n \n3. How to take Telmisartan Teva \n \nAlways take Telmisartan Teva exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose of Telmisartan Teva is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each \nday. You can take Telmisartan Teva with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water \nor other non-alcoholic drink.  It is important that you take Telmisartan Teva every day until your doctor tells \nyou otherwise.  If you have the impression that the effect of Telmisartan Teva is too strong or too weak, talk \nto your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nFor treament of high blood pressure, the usual dose of Telmisartan Teva for most patients is 40 mg once a \nday to control your blood pressure over the 24-hour period. Your doctor has recommended a lower dose of \none 20 mg tablet daily.  Alternatively, Telmisartan Teva may be used in combination with diuretics (“water” \ntablets) such as hydrochlorothiazide which has been shown to have an additive blood pressure lowering \neffect with Telmisartan Teva. \n \n\n\n\n74 \n\nFor reduction of cardiovascular events, the usual dose of Telmisartan Teva is one 80 mg tablet once a day. At \nthe beginning of the preventive therapy with Telmisartan Teva 80 mg, blood pressure should be frequently \nmonitored. \n \nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg once a day. \n \nIf you take more Telmisartan Teva than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Telmisartan Teva \nIf you forget to take a dose, do not worry.  Take it as soon as you remember then carry on as before. If you \ndo not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double dose to make \nup for forgotten individual doses. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Telmisartan Teva is and what it is used for \n \nTelmisartan Teva belongs to a class of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin II is a substance occurring in the body, which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus \nincreasing your blood pressure. Telmisartan Teva blocks this effect of angiotensin II so that the blood vessels \nrelax, and your blood pressure is lowered. \n \nTelmisartan Teva is used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults. ‘Essential’ means \nthat the high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition. \n \nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs,  which could lead sometimes \nto heart attacks, heart or kidney failure, strokes or blindness. There are usually no symptoms of high blood \npressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure to verify if it is \nwithin the normal range. \n \nTelmisartan Teva is also used to reduce cardiovascular events (i.e. heart attack or stroke) in adults who are at \nrisk because they have a reduced or blocked blood supply to the heart or legs, or have had a stroke or have \nhigh risk diabetes. Your doctor can tell you if you are at high risk for such events. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Telmisartan Teva \n \nDo not take Telmisartan Teva \n- if you are allergic to telmisartan or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant (It is also better to avoid Telmisartan Teva in early pregnancy \n\n– see pregnancy section). \n- if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with the \n\ndrainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.   \n- if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure lowering \n\nmedicine containing aliskiren. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Telmisartan Teva. \n \n\n\n\n79 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or \nillnesses: \n- Kidney disease or kidney transplant \n-  Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys) \n- Liver disease \n- Heart trouble \n- Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various blood \n\nminerals) \n- Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body water) \n\nor have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (‘water tablets’), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or vomiting. \n- Elevated potassium levels in your blood \n- Diabetes \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Telmisartan Teva: \n• if you are taking digoxin. \n• if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-\nrelated kidney problems. \n- aliskiren. \n\n \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. potassium) \nin your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading “Do not Telmisartan Teva”. \n\n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant. Telmisartan Teva is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n \nIn case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Telmisartan Teva. \n \nTelmisartan Teva may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Telmisartan Teva in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Telmisartan Teva \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  \n \nYour doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other precautions. In some cases \nyou may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed below taken \nat the same time with Telmisartan Teva. \n \n\n• If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take \nTelmisartan Teva” and “Warnings and precautions”). \n\n• Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression. \n• Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing potassium, \n\npotassium-sparing diuretics (certain ‘water tablets’), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen), heparin, \nimmunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim. \n\n• Diuretics (‘water tablets’), especially if taken in high doses together with Telmisartan Teva, may lead \nto excessive loss of body water and low blood pressure (hypotension). \n\n• Digoxin. \n \n\n\n\n80 \n\nThe effect of Telmisartan Teva may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen) or corticosteroids. \n \nTelmisartan Teva may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood \npressure. \n \nIf you suffer from a condition called “orthostatic hypotension” (a drop in blood pressure on standing up from \na sitting or lying position resulting in dizziness or faintness) your condition may worsen if you take \nTelmisartan Teva in combination with: \n\n• Other medicines used to treat high blood pressure \n• Baclofen (a muscle relaxant) \n• Amifostine (a protective medicine during radiotherapy for cancer treatment) \n• Alcohol \n• Barbiturates (strong sleeping tablets) \n• Narcotics (strong pain killers) \n• Antidepressants \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally advise \nyou to stop taking Telmisartan Teva before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are pregnant \nand will advise you to take another medicine instead of Telmisartan Teva.  Telmisartan Teva is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause \nserious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding.  Telmisartan Teva is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if \nyou wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome people feel dizzy or tired when taking Telmisartan Teva. If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or \noperate machinery. \n \nTelmisartan Teva contains sorbitol.  \nIf you are intolerant to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking Telmisartan Teva. \n \n \n3. How to take Telmisartan Teva \n \nAlways take Telmisartan Teva exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose of Telmisartan Teva is one tablet. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day. \nYou can take Telmisartan Teva with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or \nother non-alcoholic drink.  It is important that you take Telmisartan Teva every day until your doctor tells \nyou otherwise.  If you have the impression that the effect of Telmisartan Teva is too strong or too weak, talk \nto your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nFor treatment of high blood pressure, the usual dose of Telmisartan Teva for most patients is 40 mg once a \nday to control your blood pressure over the 24-hour period. However, your doctor may recommend a lower \ndose of 20 mg or a higher dose of 80 mg. Alternatively, Telmisartan Teva may be used in combination with \ndiuretics (“water” tablets) such as hydrochlorothiazide which has been shown to have an additive blood \npressure lowering effect with Telmisartan Teva. \n \n\n\n\n81 \n\nFor reduction of cardiovascular events, the usual dose of Telmisartan Teva is one 80 mg tablet once a day. At \nthe beginning of the preventive therapy with Telmisartan Teva 80 mg, blood pressure should be frequently \nmonitored. \n \nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg once a day. \n \nIf you take more Telmisartan Teva than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Telmisartan Teva \nIf you forget to take a dose, do not worry.  Take it as soon as you remember then carry on as before. If you \ndo not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double dose to make \nup for forgotten individual doses. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

What you need to know before you take Telmisartan Teva \n \nDo not take Telmisartan Teva \n- if you are allergic  to telmisartan or any other ingredients of medicine (listed in section 6). \n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant (It is also better to avoid Telmisartan Teva in early pregnancy \n\n– see pregnancy section). \n- if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with the \n\ndrainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.   \n- if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure lowering \n\nmedicine containing aliskiren. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Telmisartan Teva. \n \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \nWarnings and  precautions \nTalk to your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or \nillnesses: \n- Kidney disease or kidney transplant \n-  Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys) \n- Liver disease \n- Heart trouble \n- Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various blood \n\nminerals) \n- Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body water) \n\nor have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (‘water tablets’), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or vomiting. \n- Elevated potassium levels in your blood \n- Diabetes \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Telmisartan Teva: \n• if you are taking digoxin. \n• if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-\nrelated kidney problems. \n- aliskiren. \n\n \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. potassium) \nin your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading “Do not take Telmisartan Teva”. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant. Telmisartan Teva is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n \nIn case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Telmisartan Teva. \n \nTelmisartan Teva may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Telmisartan Teva in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Telmisartan Teva \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  \n \nYour doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other precautions. In some cases \nyou may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed below taken \nat the same time with Telmisartan Teva. \n \n\n• If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take \nTelmisartan Teva” and “Warnings and precautions”). \n\n• Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression. \n• Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing potassium, \n\npotassium-sparing diuretics (certain ‘water tablets’), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen), heparin, \nimmunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim. \n\n• Diuretics (‘water tablets’), especially if taken in high doses together with Telmisartan Teva, may lead \nto excessive loss of body water and low blood pressure (hypotension). \n\n• Digoxin. \n \n\n\n\n87 \n\nThe effect of Telmisartan Teva may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen) or corticosteroids. \n \nTelmisartan Teva may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood \npressure. \n \nIf you suffer from a condition called “orthostatic hypotension” (a drop in blood pressure on standing up from \na sitting or lying position resulting in dizziness or faintness) your condition may worsen if you take \nTelmisartan Teva in combination with: \n\n• Other medicines used to treat high blood pressure \n• Baclofen (a muscle relaxant) \n• Amifostine (a protective medicine during radiotherapy for cancer treatment) \n• Alcohol \n• Barbiturates (strong sleeping tablets) \n• Narcotics (strong pain killers) \n• Antidepressants \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally advise \nyou to stop taking Telmisartan Teva before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are pregnant \nand will advise you to take another medicine instead of Telmisartan Teva.  Telmisartan Teva is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause \nserious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding.  Telmisartan Teva is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if \nyou wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome people feel dizzy or tired when taking Telmisartan Teva. If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or \noperate machinery. \n \nTelmisartan Teva contains sorbitol.  \nIf you are intolerant to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking Telmisartan Teva. \n \n \n3.

Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose of Telmisartan Teva is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each \nday. You can take Telmisartan Teva with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water \nor other non-alcoholic drink.  It is important that you take Telmisartan Teva every day until your doctor tells \nyou otherwise.  If you have the impression that the effect of Telmisartan Teva is too strong or too weak, talk \nto your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nFor treatment of high blood pressure, the usual dose of Telmisartan Teva for most patients is 40 mg once a \nday to control your blood pressure over the 24-hour period. Your doctor has recommended a higher dose of \none 80 mg tablet daily. Alternatively, Telmisartan Teva may be used in combination with diuretics (“water” \ntablets) such as hydrochlorothiazide which has been shown to have an additive blood pressure lowering \neffect with Telmisartan Teva. \n \n\n\n\n88 \n\nFor reduction of cardiovascular events, the usual dose of Micardis is one 80 mg tablet once a day. At the \nbeginning of the preventive therapy with Micardis 80 mg, blood pressure should be frequently monitored. \n \nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg once a day. \n \nIf you take more Telmisartan Teva than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Telmisartan Teva \nIf you forget to take a dose, do not worry.  Take it as soon as you remember then carry on as before. If you \ndo not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double dose to make \nup for forgotten individual doses. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
