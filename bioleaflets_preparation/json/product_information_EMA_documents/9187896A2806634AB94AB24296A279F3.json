NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVelosulin 100 IU/ml  solution for injection or infusion in a vial. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nInsulin human, rDNA (produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). \n \n1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human.  \n1 vial contains 10 ml equivalent to 1000 IU. \n \nOne IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection or infusion in a vial. \n \nClear, colourless, aqueous solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of diabetes mellitus. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThis phosphate-buffered soluble insulin is intended for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion \n(CSII) in external insulin infusion pumps. \n \nVelosulin is a fast-acting insulin and may be used in combination with certain long-acting insulin \nproducts. For incompatibilities see section 6.2. \n \nDosage \nDosage is individual and determined by the physician in accordance with the needs of the patient. \nUsually, 40-60% of the total daily dose is given as a continuous basal rate and the remaining 40-60% \nas boluses divided between the three main meals. \n \nIn general, when patients are transferred from injection to infusion therapy, it may be advisable to \nreduce the dosage by initiating the patient at 90% of the previous total daily dosage, with 40% as \nbasal rate and 50% as boluses divided between the three main meals. \n \nDosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. The individual \ninsulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/kg/day. The daily insulin requirement may be \nhigher in patients with insulin resistance (e.g. during puberty or due to obesity) and lower in patients \nwith residual, endogenous insulin production.  \n \nIn patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic \ncomplications. Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 3 \n\nAn injection or infusion should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing \ncarbohydrates. \n \nDosage adjustment \nConcomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient's \ninsulin requirement. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement. \n \nAdjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet. \nDosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to \nanother (see section 4.4 ). \n \nAdministration \nFor subcutaneous or intravenous use. \n \nInsulin infusion (CSII): \nContinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in external insulin infusion pumps is usually \nadministered in the abdominal wall. Velosulin should never be mixed with any other insulin products \nwhen used in a pump. \n \nPatients started on CSII must receive comprehensive instruction in the use of the pump, and the \nnecessary actions in case of illness, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia or pump failure. \nThe patient should read and follow the instructions that accompany the infusion pump and use the \ncorrect reservoir and catheter for the pump (see section 6.6). \nThe infusion set should be changed every 48 hours using aseptic technique when inserting the \ninfusion set. \nWhen filling a new syringe, no large air bubbles should be left in either the syringe or the catheter. \nThe patient should follow the instructions from the physician about the basal infusion rate and the \nmealtime insulin boluses to be taken. \n \nTo get the benefit of insulin infusion, and to detect possible malfunction of the pump, the patient \nshould measure his blood glucose level regularly. \nIn the event of a hypoglycaemic episode, the infusion should be stopped until the episode is resolved. \nIf repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur, the patient should notify the health care \nprofessional and the need to reduce or stop the insulin administration should be considered. A pump \nmalfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels. If the patient \nsuspects an interruption to insulin flow the patient should notify the health care professional. \n \nPatients administering Velosulin by CSII must have injection syringes and alternative insulin readily \navailable in case of emergency or pump interruption or failure, in order that insulin can be \nadministered by subcutaneous injection. \n \nInsulin injection: \nAdministration of Velosulin is also possible by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Intravenous \nadministration should only be carried out by health care professionals. \n \nVelosulin is administered subcutaneously in the abdominal wall. The thigh, the gluteal region or the \ndeltoid region may also be used.  \n \nSubcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection \nsites. \n \nInjection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection. \nThe needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is \ninjected. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 4 \n\n \nInjection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy. \n \nThe vials may be used with insulin syringes with a corresponding unit scale. When two types of \ninsulin are mixed, draw the amount of fast-acting insulin first, followed by the amount of long-acting \ninsulin. \n \nVelosulin is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed. \n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). \nHypoglycaemia. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nInadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to \nhyperglycaemia. \nUsually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually, over a period of hours or days. They \ninclude thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry \nmouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. \nIn type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is \npotentially lethal. \n \nDue to the lack of long-acting insulin, patients receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion via \nan insulin pump are at risk of fast development of ketoacidosis in case of prolonged interruption of \ncontinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement (see \nsections 4.8 and 4.9). \nOmission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. \nPatients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may \nexperience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised \naccordingly.  \nUsual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. \n \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (fast-, dual-, long-acting insulin etc.), \norigin (animal, human or analogue insulin) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus \nanimal source insulin) may result in a need for a change in dosage. If an adjustment is needed when \nswitching the patients to Velosulin, it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks \nor months. \n \nAs with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, itching, hives, \nswelling and inflammation. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to \nreduce or prevent these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. On rare \noccasions, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Velosulin. \n \nA few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source \ninsulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or \ndifferent from those experienced with their previous insulin. \n \nBefore travelling between different time zones, the patient should be advised to consult the physician, \nsince this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 5 \n\nPatients using CSII may be more prone to infection at the site of infusion. Infections can be minimised \nby careful attention to personal hygiene of the hands and infusion site and by frequent changes of \ncatheter (maximum usage 2 days). \n \nVelosulin contains metacresol, which may cause allergic reactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism. The physician must \ntherefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any \nmedicinal products they take. \n \nThe following substances may reduce insulin requirement: \nOral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), non-selective beta-\nblocking agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, alcohol, anabolic \nsteroids or sulphonamides. \n \nThe following substances may increase insulin requirement: \nOral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics, growth \nhormone and danazol. \n \nBeta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nOctreotide/lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement. \n \nAlcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy, as insulin does not \npass the placental barrier. \n \nBoth hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes \ntherapy, increase the risk of malformations and death in utero. Intensified control in the treatment of \npregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when \ncontemplating pregnancy. \nInsulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and \nthird trimesters. \nAfter delivery, insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values. \n \nInsulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the Velosulin dosage \nmay need to be adjusted. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or \noperating machinery). \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 6 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAs for other insulin products, in general, hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable \neffect. It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical \ntrials and during marketed use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. \nTherefore, no specific frequency can be presented. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to \nunconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain \nfunction or even death.  \n \nFrequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to fast-acting \nhuman insulin (Actrapid) are listed below. The frequencies are defined as: uncommon (≥≥≥≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100). Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as <1/10,000 including isolated \nreports. \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nNervous system disorders  \nUncommon - Peripheral neuropathy  \nFast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed “acute painful \nneuropathy”, which is usually reversible. \n \nEye disorders  \nUncommon - Refraction disorders  \nRefraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy. These symptoms are usually of \ntransitory nature.  \n \nVery rare - Diabetic retinopathy  \nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.  \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon – Lipodystrophy \nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites \nwithin an area. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nUncommon - Injection site reactions  \nInjection site reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma at the injection site) may \noccur during treatment with insulin. Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued \ntreatment. \n \nUncommon - Oedema  \nOedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy. These symptoms are usually of transitory \nnature. \n \nImmune system disorders  \nUncommon - Urticaria, rash  \nVery rare - Anaphylactic reactions \nSymptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash, itching, sweating, \ngastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulties in breathing, palpitation, reduction in blood \npressure and fainting/loss of consciousness. Generalised hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life-\nthreatening. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 7 \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nA specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined. However, hypoglycaemia may develop over \nsequential stages: \n• Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary \n\nproducts. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps, sweets, \nbiscuits or sugary fruit juice. \n\n• Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by \nglucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received \nappropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional. Glucose \nmust also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to \n15 minutes. \nUpon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the \npatient in order to prevent relapse. \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, insulin (human). ATC \ncode: A10A B01. \n \nThe blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following \nbinding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose \noutput from the liver. \n \nA clinical trial in a single intensive care unit treating hyperglycaemia (blood glucose above \n10 mmol/l) in 204 diabetic and 1344 non-diabetic patients undergoing major surgery showed that \nnormoglycaemia (blood glucose 4.4 – 6.1 mmol/l) induced by intravenous treatment  with another fast \nacting human insulin (Actrapid) reduced mortality by 42% (8% versus 4.6%). \n \nVelosulin is a fast-acting insulin. \nWhen Velosulin is administered as a bolus injection onset of action is within ½ hour, reaches a \nmaximum effect within 1.5-3.5 hours and the entire duration of action is approximately 7-8 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nInsulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes. Consequently, the time-action profile of \nan insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics. \n \nThis process is influenced by several factors (e.g. insulin dosage, injection route and site, thickness of \nsubcutaneous fat, type of diabetes). The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected \nby significant intra- and inter-individual variation. \n \nContinuous subcutaneous infusion eliminates some of the variations/fluctuations inherent to injection \ntherapy. \nThe relatively fast absorption of soluble insulin ensures a constant supply of insulin to the blood from \na relatively small pool under the skin. \n \nAbsorption \nThe maximum plasma concentration is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous \nadministration. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 8 \n\n \nDistribution \nNo profound binding to plasma proteins, except circulating insulin antibodies (if present) has been \nobserved. \n \nMetabolism \nHuman insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and \npossibly protein disulfide isomerase. A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) sites on the human insulin \nmolecule have been proposed; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active. \n \nElimination \nThe terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue. The \nterminal half-life (t½) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of \ninsulin from plasma (insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes). Trials have indicated a t½ \nof about 2-5 hours. \n \nChrildren and adolescents \nThe pharmacokinetic profile has been studied in a small number (n=18) of diabetic children (aged 6-\n12 years) and adolescents (aged 13-17 years) using another fast-acting human insulin, (Actrapid). The \ndata are limited but suggest that the pharmacokinetic profile in children and adolescents may be \nsimilar to that in adults. However, there were differences between age groups in Cmax, stressing the \nimportance of individual dose titration. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nZinc chloride \nGlycerol \nMetacresol \nDisodium phosphate dihydrate \nSodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) \nHydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) \nWater for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nInsulin products should only be added to compounds with which it is known to be compatible. \nMedicinal products added to the insulin solution may cause degradation of the insulin, e.g. if the \nmedicinal products contain thiols or sulphites.  \n \nConcerning compatibility with insulin infusion pumps, reservoirs, catheters and needles, see section \n6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n30 months when stored between 2°C - 8°C. \n \n6 weeks when used or stored at room temperature (below 25°C). \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 9 \n\nAfter first use as infusion, the insulin solution may be stored in the pump reservoir for six days at up \nto 37°C (close to the body). \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nBefore use: store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). \nDo not store them in or too near the freezer section or cooling element. \nDo not freeze. \n \nDuring use: do not refrigerate. Do not store above 25°C. \nAfter first use as infusion: the insulin solution may be stored in the pump reservoir at up to 37°C \n(close to the body). \n \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \nProtect from excessive heat and sunlight. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n10 ml glass vial (type 1) closed with a bromobutyl/polyisoprene rubber stopper and a protective \ntamper-proof cap. \nPack sizes: 1 and 5 vials x 10 ml and a multipack with 5 x (1 x 10 ml) vials. \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nUpon mixing Velosulin with infusion fluids an unpredictable amount of insulin will be absorbed to \nthe infusion material. Monitoring of the patient's blood glucose during infusion is therefore \nrecommended. \n \nWhen administered by CSII no other medicinal products or other insulin products should be mixed in \nthe reservoir of the infusion pump with Velosulin. \n \nWhen combination with long-acting insulin is necessary it is only possible to mix Velosulin with \nisophane or premixed insulin products. Velosulin should not be mixed with insulin zinc suspensions \nsince the phosphate buffer may interact with the zinc in the suspension and alter the timing of action \nof the insulin in an unpredictable way. \n \nInsulin preparations which have been frozen must not be used. \nInsulin solutions should not be used if they do not appear water clear and colourless. \n \nInsulin infusion (CSII): \nUse only syringes made of polyethylene, polypropylene or glass. \nUse only catheters where the material in contact with the insulin is made of polyethylene or \npolypropylene. \nUse only teflon-coated or stainless steel needles. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again. \n– If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, diabetes nurse or your pharmacist.  \n– This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours.  \n– If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor, diabetes nurse or your pharmacist. \n \n \n1. WHAT VELOSULIN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nVelosulin is human insulin to treat diabetes. Velosulin is a fast-acting insulin. This means that it \nwill start to lower your blood sugar about half an hour after you take it. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE VELOSULIN \n \nDo not use Velosulin \n \n� If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to this insulin product, metacresol or any of the other \n\ningredients (see 7 Further information). Look out for the signs of allergy in 5 Possible side \neffects \n\n� If you feel a hypo coming on (a hypo is short for a hypoglycaemic reaction and is a symptom \nof low blood sugar). See 4 What to do in an emergency for more about hypos. \n\n \nTake special care with Velosulin  \n \n� If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands \n� If you are drinking alcohol: watch for signs of a hypo and never drink alcohol on an empty \n\nstomach \n� If you are exercising more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet \n� If you are ill: carry on taking your insulin \n� If you are going abroad: travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the \n\ntiming of your injections. \n \nUsing other medicines \n \nMany medicines affect the way glucose works in your body and they may influence your insulin dose. \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. Talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you take or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not \nprescribed. \nYour need for insulin may change if you also take: oral antidiabetic products; monoamine oxidase \ninhibitors (MAOI); beta-blockers; ACE-inhibitors; acetylsalicylic acid; anabolic steroids; \nsulphonamides; oral contraceptives; thiazides; glucocorticoids; thyroid hormone therapy; beta-\nsympathomimetics; growth hormone; danazol; octreotide or lanreotide. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant, planning a pregnancy or breast-feeding: please contact your doctor for \nadvice. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 24 \n\nDriving and using machines \n \nIf you drive or use tools or machines: watch out for signs of a hypo. Your ability to concentrate or \nto react will be less during a hypo. Never drive or use machinery if you feel a hypo coming on. \nDiscuss with your doctor whether you can drive or use machines at all, if you have a lot of hypos or if \nyou find it hard to recognise hypos. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE VELOSULIN \n \nTalk about your insulin needs with your doctor and diabetes nurse. Follow their advice carefully. This \nleaflet is a general guide. \nIf your doctor has switched you from one type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to \nbe adjusted by your doctor. \nEat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of administration. \nIt is recommended that you measure your blood glucose regularly. \n \nBefore using Velosulin \n \n� Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin \n� Disinfect the rubber membrane with a medicinal swab. \n \nDo not use Velosulin \n \n� If the protective cap is loose or missing. Each vial has a protective, tamper-proof plastic cap. \n\nIf it isn’t in perfect condition when you get the vial, return the vial to your supplier \n� If it hasn’t been stored correctly or been frozen (see 6 How to store Velosulin) \n� If it does not appear water clear and colourless. \n \nUse in infusion pump \n \nFollow the instructions and recommendations from your doctor regarding the use of Velosulin in a \npump. \nVelosulin should never be mixed with any other insulin when used in a pump. \nRead and follow carefully the instructions that accompany your insulin pump. \nAlways have ordinary syringes available in case of pump interruption or failure. \n \nUse in syringes \n \nVelosulin is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Always vary the sites you inject, to avoid \nlumps (see 5 Possible side effects). The best places to give yourself an injection are: the front of your \nwaist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms. Your insulin will work more \nquickly if you inject it around the waist. \nVelosulin vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale. \n \nVelosulin may also be administered intravenously in special situations by medical professionals. \n \nTo inject Velosulin on its own \n \n1. Draw air into the syringe, in the same amount as the dose of insulin you need \n2. Inject the air into the vial: push the needle through the rubber stopper and press the plunger  \n3. Turn the vial and syringe upside down \n4. Draw the right dose of insulin into the syringe \n5. Pull the needle out of the vial \n6. Make sure there is no air left in the syringe: point the needle upwards and push the air out \n7. Check you have the right dose \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 25 \n\n8. Inject the insulin straight away under the skin. Use the injection technique advised by your \ndoctor or diabetes nurse \n\n9. Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure that the full dose has been \ndelivered. \n\n \nTo mix Velosulin with long acting insulin \n \nFollow the instructions of your doctor or diabetes nurse concerning the correct mixing procedure. \n \n \n4. WHAT TO DO IN AN EMERGENCY \n \nIf you get a hypo \n \nA hypo means your blood sugar level is too low. \nThe warning signs of a hypo may come on suddenly and can include: cold sweat; cool pale skin; \nheadache; rapid heart beat; feeling sick; feeling very hungry; temporary changes in vision; \ndrowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling \nconfused; difficulty in concentrating. \nIf you get any of these signs, eat glucose tablets or a high sugar snack (sweets, biscuits, fruit juice), \nthen rest. \nDon’t take any insulin if you feel a hypo coming on. \nCarry glucose tablets, sweets, biscuits or fruit juice with you, just in case. \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues that if you pass out (become unconscious), they \nmust: turn you on your side and seek medical advice straight away. They must not give you any food \nor drink as it could choke you. \n� If severe hypoglycaemia is not treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) \n\nand even death \n� If you have a hypo that makes you pass out, or a lot of hypos, talk to your doctor. The amount \n\nor timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n \nUsing glucagon \n \nYou may recover more quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by \nsomeone who knows how to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugary snack \nas soon as you are conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated \nin a hospital. Seek medical advice after an injection of glucagon; you need to find the reason for your \nhypo to avoid getting more. \n \nCauses of a hypo \n \nYou get a hypo if your blood sugar gets too low. This might happen: \n• If you take too much insulin \n• If you eat too little or miss a meal \n• If you exercise more than usual. \n \nIf your blood sugar gets too high \n \nYour blood sugar may get too high (this is called hyperglycaemia).  \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed, dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \nIf you get any of these signs, test your blood sugar level and test your urine for ketones if you can. \nThen seek medical advice straight away. \nThese may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. If you don’t treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and death. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 26 \n\n \nCauses of hyperglycaemia  \n \n• Having forgotten to take your insulin \n• Repeatedly taking less insulin than you need \n• An infection or a fever \n• Eating more than usual \n• Less exercise than usual. \n \n \n5. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Velosulin can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Velosulin \nmay cause hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). See the advice in 4 What to do in an emergency. \n \nSide effects reported uncommonly (in less than 1 patient in 100) \n \nVision problems. When you first start your treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the reaction \nusually disappears. \n \nChanges at the injection site (Lipodystrophy). If you inject yourself too often at the same site, fatty \ntissue under the skin at this site may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the \nsite with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes.
