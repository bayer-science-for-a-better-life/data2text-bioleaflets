CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). \n \nELOCTA can be used for all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia. \n \nTreatment monitoring \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels (by one-stage clotting or \nchromogenic assays) is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. \nIndividual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and \nrecoveries. Dose based on bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight and overweight patients. In \nthe case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means \nof coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.  \n \nWhen using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining \nfactor VIII activity in patients\u2019 blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can be significantly \naffected by both the type of the aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. Also there can be \nsignificant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aPTT-based one stage clotting assay and the \nchromogenic assay according to Ph. Eur. This is of importance particularly when changing the laboratory \nand/or reagent used in the assay. \n \nPosology \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the \nlocation and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition.  \n \nThe number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in IU, which are related to the current WHO \nstandard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative \nto normal human plasma) or in IU (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne IU of recombinant factor VIII Fc activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one mL of \nnormal human plasma. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nOn-demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of recombinant factor VIII Fc is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU \nfactor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dL. The required dose is \ndetermined using the following formula:  \n \nRequired units = body weight (kg) \u00d7 desired factor VIII rise (%) (IU/dL) \u00d7 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dL) \n \nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical \neffectiveness in the individual case. \n \nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dL) in the corresponding period. Table 1 can be used to guide \ndosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \nTable 1: Guide to ELOCTA dosing for treatment of bleeding episodes and surgery \n \n\nDegree of haemorrhage / \nType of surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (%) (IU/dL)  \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of \ntherapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage   \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding \n\n20-40 Repeat injection every 12 to 24 hours for at \nleast 1 day, until the bleeding episode as \nindicated by pain is resolved or healing is \nachieved. 1 \n \n\nMore extensive \nhaemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or haematoma \n\n30-60 Repeat injection every 12 to 24 hours for 3-4 \ndays or more until pain and acute disability \nare resolved. 1 \n \n\nLife threatening \nhaemorrhages \n\n60-100 Repeat injection every 8 to 24 hours until \nthreat is resolved. \n \n\nSurgery   \nMinor surgery including \ntooth extraction \n\n30-60 Repeat injection every 24 hours, for at least 1 \nday, until healing is achieved. \n \n\nMajor surgery 80-100 \n(pre- and post-\noperative) \n\nRepeat injection every 8 to 24 hours as \nnecessary until adequate wound healing, then \ntherapy at least for another 7 days to maintain \na factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dL). \n \n\n1 In some patients and circumstances the dosing interval can be prolonged up to 36 hours. See section 5.2 for \npharmacokinetic data. \n \nProphylaxis  \nFor long term prophylaxis, the recommended dose is 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of  \n3 to 5 days. The dose may be adjusted based on patient response in the range of 25 to 65 IU/kg (see section \n5.1 and 5.2).  \nIn some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary. \n \nElderly \nThere is limited experience in patients \u226565 years. \n \nPaediatric population \nFor children below the age of 12, more frequent or higher doses may be required (see section 5.1). For \nadolescents of 12 years of age and above, the dose recommendations are the same as for adults.  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nMethod of administration  \nELOCTA is for intravenous use. \n \nELOCTA should be injected intravenously over several minutes. The rate of administration should be \ndetermined by the patient\u2019s comfort level and should not exceed 10 mL/min.  \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with ELOCTA. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, \npatients should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact their \nphysician. Patients should be informed of the signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised \nurticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.  \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins directed \nagainst the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per mL of plasma \nusing the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of the disease as well \nas the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 exposure days but continues \nthroughout life although the risk is uncommon. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre posing \nless of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for the \ndevelopment of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, \ntesting for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of inhibitor, \nfactor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. Management of \nsuch patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of haemophilia and factor VIII \ninhibitors. \n \nCardiovascular events \nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FVIII may increase the \ncardiovascular risk. \n \nCatheter-related complications \nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including local \ninfections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nTraceability  \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults, children and adolescents. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nExcipient related considerations \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \nHowever, depending on the body weight and posology, the patient could receive more than one vial (see \nsection 2 for information on content per vial). This should be taken into consideration by patients on a \ncontrolled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) with other medicinal products have been reported. \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. A placental transfer study in mice \nwas conducted with ELOCTA (see section 5.3). Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, \nexperience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, \nfactor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nELOCTA has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion \nsite, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, \ntachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed rarely and may in some \ncases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated with \nfactor VIII, including with ELOCTA. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an \ninsufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be \ncontacted. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe frequencies in Table 2 below were observed in a total of 276 patients with severe haemophilia A in \nphase III clinical studies and an extension study with a duration of up to four years. Adverse reactions were \nmonitored for a total of 893.72 subject-years. The total number of exposure days was 80,848 with a median \nof 294 (range 1-735) exposure days per subject. \n \nThe Table 2 presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and Preferred \nTerm Level). \n \nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported for ELOCTA in clinical trials \nMedDRA System Organ Class Adverse reactions Frequency category \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders FVIII inhibition Uncommon (PTPs)1 \n\nVery common (PUPs)1 \nNervous system disorders Headache \n\nDizziness \nDysgeusia \n\nUncommon \n \n\nCardiac disorders Bradycardia Uncommon \nVascular disorders Hypertension  \n\nHot flush \nAngiopathy2 \n\nUncommon \n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders Cough Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain, lower Uncommon \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash Uncommon \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Arthralgia \n\nMyalgia \nBack pain \nJoint swelling \n\nUncommon \n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions Malaise \nChest pain \nFeeling cold \nFeeling hot \n\nUncommon \n \n\nInjury, poisoning, and procedural complications Procedural hypotension Uncommon \n 1 Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe haemophilia A. \n\nPTPs= previously treated patients, PUPs= previously untreated patients. \n2 Investigator term: vascular pain after injection of ELOCTA \n \nPaediatric population \nNo age-specific differences in adverse reactions were observed between paediatric and adult subjects. \nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02 \n \nMechanism of action \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von Willebrand \nfactor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds to \nvon Willebrand factor in the patient\u2019s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated \nfactor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts \nprothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. \n \nHaemophilia A is an X-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of functional \nfactor VIII:C and results in bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nresult of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, \nthereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. \n \nOf note, annualized bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and \nbetween different clinical studies. \n \nELOCTA (efmoroctocog alfa) is a fully recombinant fusion protein with extended half-life. ELOCTA is \ncomprised of recombinant B-domain deleted human coagulation factor VIII covalently linked to the \nFc domain of human immunoglobulin G1. The Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1 binds to the neonatal \nFc receptor. This receptor is expressed throughout life and is part of a naturally occurring pathway that \nprotects immunoglobulins from lysosomal degradation by cycling these proteins back into circulation, \nresulting in their long plasma half-life. Efmoroctocog alfa binds to neonatal Fc receptor thereby utilising this \nsame naturally occurring pathway to delay lysosomal degradation and allow for longer plasma half-life than \nendogenous factor VIII. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ELOCTA were evaluated in 2 multinational, open-label, \npivotal studies; a phase 3 study, referred to as Study I and a phase 3 paediatric study, referred to as Study II \n(see Paediatric population). \n \nStudy I enrolled 165 previously treated male patients (12 to 65 years of age) with severe haemophilia A. \nSubjects on prophylaxis regimens prior to entering the study were assigned to the individualised prophylaxis \narm. Subjects on on-demand therapy prior to entry either entered the individualised prophylaxis arm or were \nrandomised to the weekly prophylaxis or on-demand arms. \n \nProphylaxis regimens: \nIndividualised prophylaxis: 25 to 65 IU/kg every 3 to 5 days. \nWeekly prophylaxis: 65 IU/kg \n \nOut of 153 subjects who completed Study I, 150 were enrolled onto Study III (extension study). Median total \ntime on Study I+III was 4.2 years and median no of exposure days was 309. \n \nIndividualised prophylaxis: Median annual factor consumption was 4212 IU/kg (min. 2877, max. 7943) in \nStudy I and 4223 IU/kg (min. 2668, max 8317) in Study III. Respective median Annualized Bleed Rate \n(ABR) was 1.60 (min. 0, max. 18.2) and 0.74 (min. 0, max. 15.6). \n \nWeekly prophylaxis: Median annual factor consumption was 3805 IU/kg (min. 3353, max. 6196) in Study I \nand 3510 IU/kg (min. 2758, max. 3984) in Study III. Respective median ABR was 3.59 (min. 0, max. 58.0) \nand 2.24 (min. 0, max. 17.2). \n \nOn-demand treatment: Median annual factor consumption was 1039 IU/kg (min. 280, max. 3571) for \n23 patients randomised to the on-demand treatment arm in Study I and 671 IU/kg (min. 286, max. 913) for \n6 patients remaining on on-demand treatment for at least one year in Study III. \n \nSubjects that switched from on-demand treatment to weekly prophylaxis during Study III had a median ABR \nof 1.67. \n \nTreatment of bleeding: 2490 bleeding events were treated during Study I and III with a median dose of \n43.8 IU/kg (min. 13.0, max. 172.8) to control each bleed. 79.2 % of first injections were rated as excellent or \ngood by the patients. \n \nPerioperative management (surgical prophylaxis): A total of 48 major surgical procedures were performed \nand assessed in 34 subjects in Study I and Study III. The haemostatic response was rated by the physicians as \nexcellent in 41 and as good in 3 of 44 major surgeries. Median dose to maintain haemostasis during surgery \nwas 60.6 IU/kg (min. 38, max. 158).  \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nPaediatric population \nStudy II enrolled a total of 71 previously treated male paediatric patients <12 years of age with severe \nhaemophilia A. Of the 71 enrolled subjects, 69 received at least 1 dose of ELOCTA and were evaluable for \nefficacy (35 were <6 years of age and 34 were 6 to <12 years of age). The starting prophylactic regimen \nconsisted of 25 IU/kg on the first day followed by 50 IU/kg on the fourth day. Dosing of up to 80 IU/kg and \na dosing interval as short as 2 days was allowed and used in a limited number of patients. Out of 67 subjects \nhaving completed Study II, 61 enrolled onto Study III (extension study). Median total time on study II+III \nwas 3.4 years and median no of exposure days was 332. \n \nProphylaxis, age <6 years: Median dose interval was 3.50 days in Study II and Study III. Median annual \nfactor consumption was 5146 IU/kg (min. 3695, max 8474) in Study II and 5418 IU/kg (min. 3435, max. \n9564) in Study III. Respective median Annualized Bleed Rate (ABR) was 0.00 (min. 0, max. 10.5) and 1.18 \n(min. 0, max. 9.2). \n \nProphylaxis, age 6 up to 12 years: Median dose interval was 3.49 days in Study II and 3.50 days in Study III. \nMedian annual factor consumption was 4700 IU/kg (min. 3819, max. 8230 IU/kg) in Study II and \n4990 IU/kg (min. 3856, max. 9527) in Study III. Respective median ABR was 2.01 (min. 0, max. 27.2) and \n1.59 (min. 0, max. 8.0). \n \n12 adolescent subjects age 12 up to 18 years were included in the adult study population on prophylactic \ntreatment. Median annual factor consumption was 5572 IU/kg (min. 3849, max. 7035) in Study I and \n4456 IU/kg (min. 3563, max. 8011) in Study III. Respective median ABR was 1.92 (min. 0, max. 7.1) and \n1.25 (min. 0, max. 9.5). \n \nTreatment of bleeding: 447 bleeding events were treated during Study II and III with a median dose of \n63 IU/kg (min. 28, max. 186) to control each bleed. 90.2 % of first injections were rated as excellent or good \nby the patients and their caregivers. \n \nImmunogenicity \nThe immunogenicity of ELOCTA was evaluated in the clinical trial programme in 276 previously treated \npatients with severe haemophilia A (207 adolescents and adult and 69 paediatric patients). None of these \npatients developed inhibitors. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with ELOCTA \nin one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of hereditary Factor VIII deficiency (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAll pharmacokinetic studies with ELOCTA were conducted in previously treated patients with severe \nhaemophilia A. Data presented in this section were obtained by chromogenic and one-stage clotting assays. \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters from the chromogenic assay data were similar to those derived for the \none-stage assay. \n \nPharmacokinetic properties were evaluated in 28 subjects (\u226515 years) receiving ELOCTA (rFVIIIFc). \nFollowing a washout period of at least 96 hours (4 days), the subjects received a single dose of 50 IU/kg of \nELOCTA.

The solution should be clear to slightly opalescent and colourless. Do not use solutions that \nare cloudy or have deposits. \n \nAdditional information on reconstitution and administration: \n \nELOCTA is administered by intravenous (IV) injection after dissolving the powder for injection with the \nsolvent supplied in the pre-filled syringe. ELOCTA pack contains: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nELOCTA should not be mixed with other solutions for injection or infusion. \n \nWash your hands before opening the pack \n \nPreparation: \n \n\n1. Check the name and strength of the package, to make sure it contains the correct medicine. \nCheck the expiry date on the ELOCTA carton. Do not use if the medicine has expired. \n\n \n\nA) 1 Powder vial \nB) 3 mL solvent in pre-filled syringe \nC) 1 Plunger rod  \nD) 1 Vial adapter \nE) 1 Infusion set \nF) 2 Alcohol swabs \nG) 2 Plasters  \nH) 1 Gauze pad \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n2. If ELOCTA has been stored in a refrigerator, allow the vial of ELOCTA (A) and the syringe \n with solvent (B) to reach room temperature before use. Do not use external heat. \n \n3. Place the vial on a clean flat surface. Remove the plastic flip-top \n cap from the ELOCTA vial. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n4. Wipe the top of the vial with one of the alcohol swabs (F) \n provided in the pack, and allow to air dry. Do not touch the top of \n the vial or allow it to touch anything else once wiped. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n5. Peel back the protective paper lid from the clear plastic vial adapter (D). Do not remove the \n adapter from its protective cap. Do not touch the inside of the vial adapter package. \n \n6. Hold the vial adapter in its protective cap and place it squarely \n over the top of the vial. Press down firmly until the adapter snaps \n into place on top of the vial, with the adapter spike penetrating the \n vial stopper. \n\n \n \n\n \n7. Attach the plunger rod (C) to the solvent syringe by inserting the \n tip of the plunger rod into the opening in the syringe plunger. Turn \n the plunger rod firmly clockwise until it is securely seated in the \n syringe plunger. \n\n \n\n8. Break off the white, tamper-resistant, plastic cap from the solvent \n syringe by bending at the perforation cap until it snaps off. Set the \n cap aside by placing it with the top down on a flat surface. Do not \n touch the inside of the cap or the syringe tip. \n \n\n \n\n9. Lift the protective cap away from the adapter and discard.  \n\n10.  Connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by inserting the tip \n of the syringe into the adapter opening. Firmly push and turn the \n syringe clockwise until it is securely connected. \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n11. Slowly depress the plunger rod to inject all the solvent into the  \n ELOCTA vial. \n\n \n\n12. With the syringe still connected to the adapter and the plunger rod \n pressed down, gently swirl the vial until the powder is dissolved.  \n Do not shake. \n\n \n\n13. The final solution must be inspected visually before administration. The solution should appear \n clear to slightly opalescent and colourless. Do not use the solution if cloudy or contains visible \n particles. \n \n14. Ensuring that the syringe plunger rod is still fully pressed down, \n invert the vial. Slowly pull on the plunger rod to draw back all the \n solution through the vial adapter into the syringe. \n \n\n \n\n15. Detach the syringe from the vial adapter by gently pulling and \n turning the vial counterclockwise. \n \n\n \n\nNote: If you use more than one vial of ELOCTA per injection, each vial should be prepared separately \nas per the previous instructions (steps 1 to 13) and the solvent syringe should be removed, leaving the \nvial adapter in place. A single large luer lock syringe may be used to draw back the prepared contents \nof each of the individual vials. \n \n16. Discard the vial and the adapter. \n \nNote: If the solution is not to be used immediately, the syringe cap should be carefully put back on the \nsyringe tip. Do not touch the syringe tip or the inside of the cap. \n \nAfter preparation, ELOCTA can be stored at room temperature for up to 6 hours before administration. \nAfter this time, the prepared ELOCTA should be discarded. Protect from direct sunlight. \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nAdministration (Intravenous injection): \n \nELOCTA should be administered using the infusion set (E) provided in this pack. \n \n\n1. Open the infusion set package and remove the cap at the end of \n the tubing. Attach the syringe with the prepared ELOCTA \n solution to the end of the infusion set tubing by turning \n clockwise. \n\n \n\n2. If needed apply a tourniquet and prepare the injection site by wiping the skin well with the \n other alcohol swab provided in the pack. \n\n \n\n3. Remove any air in the infusion set tubing by slowly depressing on the plunger rod until liquid \n has reached the infusion set needle. Do not push the solution through the needle. Remove the \n clear plastic protective cover from the needle. \n\n4. Insert the infusion set needle into a vein as instructed by your doctor or nurse and remove the \n tourniquet. If preferred, you may use one of the plasters (G) provided in the pack to hold the \n plastic wings of the needle in place at the injection site. The prepared product should be \n injected intravenously over several minutes. Your doctor may change your recommended \n injection rate to make it more comfortable for you. \n\n5. After completing the injection and removing the needle, you \n should fold over the needle protector and snap it over the needle. \n\n \n\n6. Please safely dispose of the used needle, any unused solution, the syringe and the empty vial \n in an appropriate medical waste container as these materials may hurt others if not disposed of \n properly. Do not reuse equipment. \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.  \n \n \n7.

Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if \n\ntheir signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Instructions for preparation and administration \n \n \n1. What ELOCTA is and what it is used for \n \nELOCTA contains the active substance efmoroctocog alfa, a recombinant coagulation factor VIII, Fc fusion \nprotein. Factor VIII is a protein produced naturally in the body and is necessary for the blood to form clots \nand stop bleeding.  \n \nELOCTA is a medicine used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in all age groups of patients with \nhaemophilia A (inherited bleeding disorder caused by factor VIII deficiency). \n \nELOCTA is prepared by recombinant technology without addition of any human- or animal-derived \ncomponents in the manufacturing process.  \n \nHow ELOCTA works \nIn patients with haemophilia A, factor VIII is missing or not working properly. ELOCTA is used to replace \nthe missing or deficient factor VIII. ELOCTA increases factor VIII level in the blood and temporarily \ncorrects the bleeding tendency. \n \n \n\n\n\n57 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use ELOCTA \n \nDo not use ELOCTA: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to efmoroctocog alfa or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using ELOCTA. \n \n\u2022 There is a small chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic \n\nreaction) to ELOCTA. Signs of allergic reactions may include generalised itching, hives, tightness of \nthe chest, difficulty breathing and low blood pressure. If any of these symptoms occur, stop the \ninjection immediately and contact your doctor. \n\n \n\u2022 The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with \n\nall factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working \nproperly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If \nyour or your child\u2019s bleeding is not being controlled with ELOCTA, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \nCardiovascular events \nIf you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, take special care when using factor VIII medicines \nand talk to your doctor. \nCatheter-related complications \nIf you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including local \ninfections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nDocumentation \nIt is strongly recommended that every time ELOCTA is given, the name and batch number of the product are \nrecorded. \n \nOther medicines and ELOCTA \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nNo effects on ability to drive or use of machines have been observed. \n \nELOCTA contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \nHowever, depending on your body weight and dose, you could receive more than one vial. This should be \ntaken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How to use ELOCTA \n \nTreatment with ELOCTA will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you (see section 7). Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nELOCTA is given as an injection into a vein. Your doctor will calculate the dose of ELOCTA (in \nInternational Units or \u201cIU\u201d) depending on your individual needs for factor VIII replacement therapy and on \nwhether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. Talk to your doctor if you think that your bleeding \nis not being controlled with the dose you receive. \n \n\n\n\n58 \n\nHow often you need an injection will depend on how well ELOCTA is working for you. Your doctor will \nperform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII levels in your blood.  \n \nTreatment of bleeding  \nThe dose of ELOCTA is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be achieved. \nThe target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. \n \nPrevention of bleeding \nThe usual dose of ELOCTA is 50 IU per kg of body weight, given every 3 to 5 days. The dose may be \nadjusted by your doctor in the range of 25 to 65 IU per kg of body weight. In some cases, especially in \nyounger patients, shorter dosing intervals or higher doses may be necessary. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nELOCTA can be used in children and adolescents of all ages. In children below the age of 12, higher doses \nor more frequent injections may be needed. \n \nIf you use more ELOCTA than you should \nTell your doctor as soon as possible. You should always use ELOCTA exactly as your doctor has told you, \ncheck with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nIf you forget to use ELOCTA \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take your dose as soon as you remember and \nthen resume your normal dosing schedule. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you stop using ELOCTA \nDo not stop using ELOCTA without consulting your doctor. If you stop using ELOCTA you may no longer \nbe protected against bleeding or a current bleed may not stop. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects  \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic reaction) occur, the injection must be stopped immediately. \nYou must contact your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms of allergic \nreactions: swelling of the face, rash, generalised itching, hives, tightness of the chest, difficulty breathing, \nburning and stinging at the injection site, chills, flushing, headache, low blood pressure, general feeling of \nbeing unwell, nausea, restlessness and fast heartbeat, feeling dizzy or loss of consciousness. \n \nFor children previously untreated with factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) may form \nvery commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients); however, patients who have received previous treatment with \nfactor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 patients). If this \nhappens the medicines may stop working properly and you may experience persistent bleeding. If this \nhappens, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n \nThe following side effects may occur with this medicine. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nHeadache, dizziness, taste alteration, slow heartbeat, high blood pressure, hot flushes, vascular pain after \ninjection, cough, lower abdominal pain, rash, joint swelling, muscle pain, back pain, joint pain, general \ndiscomfort, chest pain, feeling cold, feeling hot and low blood pressure. \n \n\n\n\n59 \n\nReporting of side effects  \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store ELOCTA \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and the vial label after \u201cEXP\u201d. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. Do not use this medicine if it has been stored at room \ntemperature for longer than 6 months. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nAlternatively, ELOCTA may be stored at room temperature (up to 30\u00b0C) for a single period not exceeding \n6 months. Record on the carton the date that ELOCTA is removed from the refrigerator and set at room \ntemperature. After storage at room temperature, the product must not be put back in the refrigerator. \n \nOnce you have prepared ELOCTA it should be used right away. If you cannot use the prepared ELOCTA \nsolution immediately, it should be used within 6 hours. Do not refrigerate the prepared solution. Protect the \nprepared solution from direct sunlight. \n \nThe prepared solution will be clear to slightly opalescent and colourless. Do not use this medicine if you \nnotice that it is cloudy or contains visible particles. \n \nDiscard any unused solution appropriately. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household \nwaste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help \nprotect the environment. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat ELOCTA contains \n \n\u2022 The active substance is efmoroctocog alfa (recombinant coagulation factor VIII, Fc fusion protein). \n\nEach vial of ELOCTA contains nominally 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000 or 4000 IU \nefmoroctocog alfa. \n\n\u2022 The other ingredients are sucrose, sodium chloride, histidine, calcium chloride dihydrate, polysorbate \n20, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and water for injections. If you are on a controlled sodium \ndiet, see section 2. \n\n \nWhat ELOCTA looks like and contents of the pack \n \nELOCTA is provided as a powder and solvent for solution for injection. The powder is a white to off-white \npowder or cake. The solvent provided for preparation of the solution to inject, is a clear, colourless solution. \nAfter preparation, the solution to inject is clear to slightly opalescent and colourless. \n \nEach pack of ELOCTA contains 1 powder vial, 3 mL solvent in pre-filled syringe, 1 plunger rod, 1 vial \nadapter, 1 infusion set, 2 alcohol swabs, 2 plasters and 1 gauze pad. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n60 \n\nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \nSwedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ)  \nSE-112 76 Stockholm, \nSweden \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in  \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \n \nTurn the leaflet over for instructions for preparation and administration \n\n\n\n61 \n\nInstructions for preparation and administration \n \nELOCTA is administered by intravenous (IV) injection after dissolving the powder for injection with the \nsolvent supplied in the pre-filled syringe. ELOCTA pack contains: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nELOCTA should not be mixed with other solutions for injection or infusion. \n \nWash your hands before opening the pack \n \nPreparation: \n \n\n1. Check the name and strength of the package, to make sure it contains the correct medicine. \nCheck the expiry date on the ELOCTA carton. Do not use if the medicine has expired. \n\n \n2. If ELOCTA has been stored in a refrigerator, allow the vial of ELOCTA (A) and the syringe \n with solvent (B) to reach room temperature before use. Do not use external heat. \n \n3. Place the vial on a clean flat surface. Remove the plastic flip-top \n cap from the ELOCTA vial. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n4. Wipe the top of the vial with one of the alcohol swabs (F) \n provided in the pack, and allow to air dry. Do not touch the top of \n the vial or allow it to touch anything else once wiped. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n5. Peel back the protective paper lid from the clear plastic vial adapter (D). Do not remove the \n adapter from its protective cap. Do not touch the inside of the vial adapter package. \n \n6. Hold the vial adapter in its protective cap and place it squarely \n over the top of the vial. Press down firmly until the adapter snaps \n into place on top of the vial, with the adapter spike penetrating the \n vial stopper. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nA) 1 Powder vial \nB) 3 mL solvent in pre-filled syringe \nC) 1 Plunger rod  \nD) 1 Vial adapter \nE) 1 Infusion set \nF) 2 Alcohol swabs \nG) 2 Plasters  \nH) 1 Gauze pad \n \n\n\n\n62 \n\n7. Attach the plunger rod (C) to the solvent syringe by inserting the \n tip of the plunger rod into the opening in the syringe plunger. Turn \n the plunger rod firmly clockwise until it is securely seated in the \n syringe plunger. \n\n \n\n8. Break off the white, tamper-resistant, plastic cap from the solvent \n syringe by bending at the perforation cap until it snaps off. Set the \n cap aside by placing it with the top down on a flat surface. Do not \n touch the inside of the cap or the syringe tip. \n \n\n \n\n9. Lift the protective cap away from the adapter and discard.  \n\n10.  Connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by inserting the tip \n of the syringe into the adapter opening. Firmly push and turn the \n syringe clockwise until it is securely connected. \n\n \n\n11. Slowly depress the plunger rod to inject all the solvent into the  \n ELOCTA vial. \n\n \n\n12. With the syringe still connected to the adapter and the plunger rod \n pressed down, gently swirl the vial until the powder is dissolved.  \n Do not shake. \n\n \n\n13. The final solution must be inspected visually before administration. The solution should appear \n clear to slightly opalescent and colourless. Do not use the solution if cloudy or contains visible \n particles. \n \n14. Ensuring that the syringe plunger rod is still fully pressed down, \n invert the vial. Slowly pull on the plunger rod to draw back all the \n solution through the vial adapter into the syringe. \n \n\n \n\n15. Detach the syringe from the vial adapter by gently pulling and \n turning the vial counterclockwise. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n63 \n\nNote: If you use more than one vial of ELOCTA per injection, each vial should be prepared separately \nas per the previous instructions (steps 1 to 13) and the solvent syringe should be removed, leaving the \nvial adapter in place. A single large luer lock syringe may be used to draw back the prepared contents \nof each of the individual vials. \n \n16. Discard the vial and the adapter. \n \nNote: If the solution is not to be used immediately, the syringe cap should be carefully put back on the \nsyringe tip. Do not touch the syringe tip or the inside of the cap. \n \nAfter preparation, ELOCTA can be stored at room temperature for up to 6 hours before administration. \nAfter this time, the prepared ELOCTA should be discarded. Protect from direct sunlight. \n \n\n \n \nAdministration (Intravenous injection): \n \nELOCTA should be administered using the infusion set (E) provided in this pack. \n \n\n1. Open the infusion set package and remove the cap at the end of the \ntubing. Attach the syringe with the prepared ELOCTA solution to \nthe end of the infusion set tubing by turning clockwise. \n\n \n\n2. If needed apply a tourniquet and prepare the injection site by wiping the skin well with the other \nalcohol swab provided in the pack. \n\n \n\n3. Remove any air in the infusion set tubing by slowly depressing on the plunger rod until liquid \n has reached the infusion set needle. Do not push the solution through the needle. Remove the \n clear plastic protective cover from the needle. \n\n4. Insert the infusion set needle into a vein as instructed by your doctor or nurse and remove the \n tourniquet. If preferred, you may use one of the plasters (G) provided in the pack to hold the \n plastic wings of the needle in place at the injection site. The prepared product should be \n injected intravenously over several minutes. Your doctor may change your recommended \n injection rate to make it more comfortable for you. \n\n5. After completing the injection and removing the needle, you \n should fold over the needle protector and snap it over the needle. \n\n \n\n\n\n64 \n\n6. Please safely dispose of the used needle, any unused solution, the syringe and the empty vial \n in an appropriate medical waste container as these materials may hurt others if not disposed of \n properly. Do not reuse equipment. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURERS OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVE SUBSTANCE AND MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.
