NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRevasc 15mg/0.5ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 15 mg desirudin. \nAfter reconstitution one vial contains 15 mg** desirudin* per 0.5 ml \n \nDesirudin consists in a single chain polypeptide of 65 amino acid residues and 3 disulphide bridges. \n \n* produced by recombinant DNA technology in yeast cells. \n** corresponding to approximately 270,000 antithrombin units (ATU) or 18,000 ATU per mg of \ndesirudin with reference to the WHO Second International Standard for alpha-thrombin. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nWhite powder and clear, colourless solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrevention of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement \nsurgery. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Revasc should be initiated under the guidance of a physician with experience in \ncoagulation disorders.  Instructions for the preparation of Revasc are provided in section 6.6. \n \nAdult and elderly patients \n \nThe recommended dose is 15 mg twice daily.  The first injection should be initiated 5 to 15 minutes \nbefore surgery but after induction of regional block anaesthesia, if used.  Treatment with desirudin is \nthen continued twice daily post-operatively for 9 days up to a maximum of 12 days or until the patient \nis fully ambulant, whichever occurs first.  Currently, there is no clinical experience to support the use \nof desirudin beyond 12 days. \n \nAdministration is by subcutaneous injection, preferably at an abdominal site.  Injections should be \nrotated between at least four different sites. \n \nChildren \n \nThere is no experience in children.  \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nDesirudin is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less \nthan 30ml/min corresponding to a serum creatinine > 2.5mg/dl or 221\u03bcmol/l; see section 4.3).  In \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 3 \n\npatients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance between 31 and 90 ml/min; see \nsection 4.4) activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) should be monitored. \n \nPatients with liver impairment \n \nDesirudin is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).  In patients with mild to \nmoderate liver impairment (see section 4.4) aPTT monitoring is recommended. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nDesirudin is contraindicated in patients: \n- with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients \n- with active bleeding and/or irreversible coagulation disorders \n- with severe renal and hepatic impairment \n- during pregnancy (see section 4.6) \n- with severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWarnings \n \nAnaphylaxis: Revasc may cause allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and shock (see section 4.8).  \nFatal anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients re-exposed to hirudin product therapy in a \nsecond or subsequent treatment course.  Although fatal reactions have not been reported with \ndesirudin, alternative treatment options must be considered before the decision to re-expose a patient \nto Revasc.  As these reactions are immune-mediated, patients with previous exposure to hirudin or \nhirudin analogue may be at an increased risk.  Treatment initiation with Revasc should be undertaken \nonly in a setting where medical assistance is readily available and where there is access to treatment \nfor anaphylactic reactions.  Patients should be informed that they have received Revasc. \n \nDesirudin should not be administered by intramuscular injection owing to the risk of local \nhaematoma. \n \nDesirudin should be used with caution in conditions with increased risks of haemorrhage such as \nmajor surgery, biopsy or puncture of a non-compressible vessel within the last month; a history of \nhaemorrhagic stroke, intracranial or intraocular bleeding including diabetic (haemorrhagic) \nretinopathy; a cerebral ischaemic attack within the last 6 months, a known haemostatic disorder \n(congenital or acquired, e.g. haemophilia, liver disease) or a history of gastrointestinal or pulmonary \nbleeding within the past 3 months. \n \nPrecautions \n \nWhen desirudin is administered in patients with increased risk of bleeding complications, mild to \nmoderate hepatic dysfunction and/or mild to moderate renal impairment, aPTT should be monitored \nand peak aPTT should not exceed twice the control value.  If necessary, therapy with desirudin should \nbe interrupted until aPTT returns to less than twice the control value at which time treatment with \ndesirudin can be resumed at a reduced dose. \n \nDesirudin should be used with care in patients receiving anticoagulants, and/or platelet inhibitors, \nand/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products.  Monitoring for evidence of bleeding is \nadvised (see section 4.5).  The concomitant use of desirudin with thrombolytics and ticlopidine has \nnot been investigated in this patient population. \n \nThe anticoagulant effect of desirudin is poorly reversible.  aPTT levels can, however, be reduced by \nintravenous administration of DDAVP (desmopressin). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 4 \n\nLaboratory Tests: Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) should be monitored in patients with \nincreased risk of bleeding and/or renal or hepatic impairment.  Peak aPTT should not exceed twice the \ncontrol value.  If necessary, therapy with desirudin should be interrupted until aPTT falls to less than \ntwice the control at which time treatment with desirudin can be resumed at a reduced dose (see also \nsection 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAny agent which may enhance the risk of haemorrhage should be discontinued prior to initiation of \ndesirudin therapy.  If co-administration cannot be avoided, close clinical and laboratory monitoring \nshould be conducted (see section 4.4). \n \nDuring prophylaxis, concomitant use of medicinal products containing heparins (unfractionated and \nlow-molecular weight heparins) and dextrans is not recommended.  The effects of desirudin and \nunfractionated heparins on prolongation of aPTT have been shown to be additive (see section 4.4). \n \nAs with other anticoagulants desirudin should be used with caution in conjunction with medicinal \nproducts which affect platelet function these medicinal products include: acetylsalicylic acid and \nNSAIDs, ticlopidine and clopidogrel, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (abciximab, eptifibatide, \ntirofiban) and iloprost. \n \nIf a patient is switched from oral anticoagulants to desirudin therapy or from desirudin to oral \nanticoagulants, the anticoagulant activity should continue to be closely monitored with appropriate \nmethods.  That activity should be taken into account in the evaluation of the overall coagulation status \nof the patient during the switch (see section 4.2). \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of desirudin in pregnant women.  Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  The potential risk for humans is unknown.  Revasc is \ncontraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3).  It is not known whether desirudin is excreted in \nhuman milk.  However, lactating mothers should be advised to avoid breast feeding or alternative \nmedicinal products used. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRevasc has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn controlled clinical trials investigating desirudin 15 mg twice daily and a standard dose of \nunfractionated heparin, the nature of the hip surgery operation and the mode of action of the two \ndrugs studied account for most of the adverse experiences reported.  As with other anticoagulants, \nbleeding is the most common adverse reaction. \n \nThe following related adverse reactions were listed below by system organ class and within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness: common (\u2265 \n1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). \n \nInvestigations \nUncommon:  Increase in serum transaminases \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 5 \n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nCommon:  Anaemia \n \nNervous system disorders \nUncommon:  Dizziness, insomnia, confusion \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon:  Dyspnoea \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon:  Nausea \nUncommon:  Haematemesis, vomiting, constipation \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon:  Haematuria, urinary retention \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon:  Rash, urticaria \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nUncommon:  Hypokalaemia \n \nInfections and infestations \nUncommon:  Urinary tract infection, cystitis \n \nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \nCommon:  Wound secretion \nUncommon:  Impaired wound healing \n \nVascular disorders \nCommon:  Hypotension, deep thrombophlebitis \nUncommon:  Epistaxis, hypertension \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon:  Fever, injection site mass, haematomas, oedema in legs \nUncommon:  Pain in legs, pain, abdominal and chest pain \n \nImmune system disorders \nCommon: Allergic reactions have been reported in the same proportion (1.6%) of patients \n\ntreated with desirudin (N=2,367) or with unfractionated heparin (N=1,1 34) in \nclinical trials, regardless of causality. \n\nRare:  Anti-hirudin antibodies have been detected upon re-exposure to desirudin in \nclinical trials. \n\n \nAdverse reactions irrespective of trial drug relationship reported during clinical trials were bleeding \nepisodes, oliguria, hyperpyrexia and joint dislocation. \n \nIn post-marketing surveillance, rare reports of major haemorrhages, some of which were fatal; and \nrare reports of non-fatal anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions leading to shock have been received. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 6 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no antidote for desirudin.  Overdosage of desirudin could lead to bleeding complications.  In \nsuch cases desirudin should be discontinued.  If necessary, plasma expanders and/or blood transfusion \nmay be used. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anticoagulant, ATC code: B01AE01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDesirudin is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of free circulating and clot-bound thrombin.  A \nmean peak aPTT prolongation of around 1.4 times baseline value is observed following a \nsubcutaneous (SC) b.i.d. injection of 15mg desirudin.  At therapeutic serum concentrations it has no \neffect on other enzymes of the haemostatic system such as factors IXa, Xa, kallikrein, plasmin, tPA, \nor activated protein C.  In addition, it does not display any effect on other serine proteases, such as the \ndigestive enzymes trypsin or chymotrypsin, or on complement activation by the classical or \nalternative pathways. \nIn two controlled double blind clinical trials, the overall rate of thromboembolic events in patients \ntreated with desirudin 15mg s.c. b.i.d. (N=370) was half that in patients treated with a standard dose \nof unfractionated heparin (N=396) (p<0.0001); the rate of proximal deep venous thrombosis was only \none fifth that observed with the heparin (p<0.0001).  To date clinical data are available on hip surgery \nonly. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe anticoagulant properties of desirudin are demonstrated by its ability to prolong the clotting time \nof human or rat plasma whether induced directly (thrombin time) or via the intrinsic (aPTT) or \nextrinsic (PT) pathways.  Desirudin has no profibrinolytic activity. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nMean absorption time of subcutaneous (SC) desirudin is 4.1, 4.5 and 5.4 h for dose levels of 0.1, 0.3 \nand 0.5 mg/kg, respectively (overall mean = 4.6 h).  Absorption is complete based on mean area under \nthe curve (AUC) values. \n \nFollowing administration of single SC doses of 0.1-0.75 mg/kg, plasma concentrations of desirudin \nincreased rapidly to maximum levels (Cmax) between 1 and 3 h.  Both Cmax and AUC values are dose \nproportional. \n \nDistribution \n \nDesirudin is distributed in the extracellular space with a distribution volume at steady state of \n0.251/kg independently of the dose. \n \nMetabolism and elimination \n \nThe disappearance of desirudin from plasma is rapid in the first phase with approximately 90% of an \nintravenous (IV) bolus dose disappearing from the circulation within 2 hours of the injection.  A \nslower terminal elimination phase follows with a dose-independent mean terminal elimination half-\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 7 \n\nlife of 2 to 3 h. The mean residence times are 1.7-2 h and 6-7 h after IV and SC administration, \nrespectively. \n \nThe total urinary excretion of unchanged desirudin amounts to 40-50 % of the administered dose. \nMetabolites lacking one or two C-terminal amino acids constitute a minor proportion of the material \nrecovered from urine (<7%).  In vitro and in vivo animal data indicate that desirudin is for the most \npart eliminated and metabolised by the kidney.  Hepatic elimination of desirudin or the thrombin-\ndesirudin complex does not appear to be significant. \n \nTotal clearance of desirudin has been found to be in the same range following either SC or IV \nadministration (ca 1.95-2.20ml/min/kg) and was dose-independent.  The total and renal clearances of \ndesirudin are slightly reduced in elderly subjects compared to young volunteers.  This decrease can be \nconsidered unlikely to be of clinical significance, thus requiring no dose reduction. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nReproductive toxicology studies in animals showed desirudin to be teratogenic with changes \ncomprising spina bifida in rabbits and omphaloceles in rats.  Non-clinical data reveal no special \nhazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, \ngenotoxicity and carcinogenic potential.   \n \n \n6.

What Revasc is and what it is used for \n2. Before you use Revasc \n3. How to use Revasc \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Revasc \n6. Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT REVASC IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nThe common name of the active substance in Revasc is desirudin.  Desirudin is a recombinant DNA \nproduct derived from yeast cells.  Desirudin belongs to a group of medicines called anticoagulants, \nwhich prevent blood clots from forming in the blood vessels. \n \nRevasc is used to prevent blood clotting after elective hip or knee replacement surgery, as harmful \nblood clots can form in the blood vessels of the legs.  It is often given for several days after operations \nbecause blood clots are most likely to form when you are resting in bed. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE REVASC \n \nYou must not be given Revasc \n \n-  if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to natural or synthetic hirudin, including desirudin or any of the \n\nother ingredients of Revasc \n- if you are bleeding a lot or have any serious bleeding disorder (e.g. haemophilia) \n- if you have serious kidney or liver disease \n- if you have a heart infection \n- if you have an uncontrolled high blood pressure \n- if you are pregnant. \n \nTake special care with Revasc \n \nMake sure you tell your doctor if you are likely to have an increased risk of bleeding, which may be \nthe case if you have, or have had: \n- bleeding disorders or a family history of bleeding disorder \n- stomach ulcers or any other bleeding disease of the gut \n- history of a stroke, or bleeding within the brain or eye \n- a recent operation (including dental surgery) or biopsy or pricking of a blood vessel within the last \n\nmonth \n- recently a brief shortage of blood supply to a part of the brain within the last six months \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 23 \n\n- bleeding in the gut or lung within the past three months. \n \nYour risk of bleeding may also be increased: \n- if you have recently given birth, fallen, or suffered a blow to the body or head \n- if you are already taking medicines, especially blood-thinners (see below). \n \nIf any of the above apply to you, the doctor or nurse will monitor your blood for clotting activity and \nmay change your dose or dosing schedule accordingly. \n \nCross-sensitivity to other hirudin products is possible.  You should also inform your doctor if you \nhave ever received Revasc, hirudin or an hirudin analogue. \n \nChildren \nThere is no experience with Revasc in children.  \n \nTaking other medicines \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \nIt may be necessary to change the dose, to take other precautions, or in some cases to stop taking one \nof the medicines.  This applies to both prescription and non-prescription medicines, especially: \n \n- medicines used to prevent blood-clotting (warfarin, heparin and dicoumarol) \n- medicines which affect the function of platelets (particles in the blood involved in blood- \n\nclotting), e.g. acetylsalicylic acid, a substance present in many medicinal products used to \nrelieve pain and lower fever, and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nYou should not be given Revasc if you are pregnant.  Revasc can cause serious harm to your baby.  It \nis therefore important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.  If you \nare of a child-bearing age, a pregnancy test may be done by your doctor to make sure you are not \npregnant. \n \nIt is advisable not to breast-feed during treatment. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE REVASC \n \nYou will be given Revasc as an injection under the skin. \n \nAdministration is by subcutaneous injection, preferably at an abdominal site.  Injections should be \nrotated between at least four different sites.  The first injection should be initiated 5 to 15 minutes \nbefore surgery but after induction of regional block anaesthesia, if used.  Treatment with desirudin is \nthen continued twice daily post-operatively for 9 to a maximum of 12 days or until the patient is fully \nmobile, whichever occurs first.  Currently, there is no clinical experience to support the use of Revasc \nbeyond 12 days. \n \nUsual dosage \n \nAlways take Revasc exactly as your doctor has instructed you.  You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are unsure.  The usual dosage is 15mg injected twice a day for 9 days to a maximum \nof 12 days.  You will be given the first injection within 5 to 15 minutes before the operation.  If you \nneed treatment for longer than 12 days, the doctor may switch you to another similar medicine. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 24 \n\nIf you have a kidney or liver disease, the doctor or nurse will monitor your blood for clotting activity \nand may change your dose or dosing schedule accordingly. \n \nIf you are given more than you should \n \nOverdose with Revasc may lead to bleeding.  If this occurs, Revasc will be stopped and treatment \ngiven for the bleeding. \n \nIf a dose is missed \n \nIf a dose of this medicine is missed, it should be given to you as soon as possible.  If it is almost time \nfor the next dose you will skip the missed dose and go back to the normal dosage schedule.  The dose \nshould not be doubled. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Revasc can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  Some of these \nside effects may be similar to the effects of surgery.  The most likely side effect is bleeding. \n \nTell the doctor or nurse as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur, some of which \nmay be confused with side effects of surgery: \n \nCommon reported side effects (likely to affect between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 patients): \nUnusual tiredness or weakness (anaemia), nausea, oozing of fluid from wounds, low blood pressure, \nfever, inflammation of veins sometimes accompanied by a clot, lumps at injection sites, bruising, \nswelling of the legs caused by fluid retention, non-fatal allergic reactions. \n \nUncommon side effects (likely to affect between 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 patients):  \nIncrease in liver enzymes, dizziness, sleeplessness, confusion, feeling breathless, vomiting (with or \nwithout blood), constipation, blood in your urine, difficulty in urinating, rash, itching (urticaria), low \nlevels of potassium in the blood, burning feeling when passing urine with also an increased frequency \nof urination, slow healing of wounds, nose bleeds, high blood pressure, pain (including pain in legs, \nstomach and/or chest). \n \nRare side effects (likely to affect between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000 patients): \nAnti-hirudin antibodies have been detected upon re-exposure   \n \nIsolated cases of fatal bleeding have been reported. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE REVASC \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use Revasc after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and the pack. \n \nDo not store above 25\u00b0C.  Keep the vial and ampoule in the outer carton. \n \nAfter reconstitution, immediate use is recommended.  However, the in-use stability has been \ndemonstrated for 24 hours between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (in a refrigerator). \n \nDo not use Revasc if you notice that the solution for injection contains visible particles. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 25 \n\n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.

unsure. the usual dosage is 15mg injected twice a day for 9 days to a maximum of 12 days. you will be given the first injection within 5 to 15 minutes before the operation. if you need treatment for longer than 12 days, the doctor may switch you to another similar medicine. if you have a kidney or liver disease, the doctor or nurse will monitor your blood for clotting activity and may change your dose or dosing schedule accordingly. if you are given more than you should overdose with revasc may lead to bleeding. if this occurs, revasc will be stopped and treatment given for the bleeding. if a
