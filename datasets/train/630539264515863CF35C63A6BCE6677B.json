CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSiklos is indicated for the prevention of recurrent painful vaso-occlusive crises including acute chest \nsyndrome in adults, adolescents and children older than 2 years suffering from symptomatic sickle cell \nsyndrome (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Siklos should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of patients \nwith sickle cell syndrome. \n \nPosology \n \nIn adults, adolescents and children older than 2 years \nThe posology should be based on the patient\u2019s body weight (b.w.). \nThe starting dose of hydroxycarbamide is 15 mg/kg b.w. and the usual dose is between 15 and \n30 mg/kg b.w./day.  \nAs long as the patient responds to therapy either clinically or haematologically (e.g. increase in \nhaemoglobin F (HbF), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), decrease in neutrophil count), the dose of \nSiklos should be maintained. \nIn case of non-response (re-occurrence of crises or lack of reduction in crisis rate), the daily dose may \nbe increased by steps of 2.5 to 5 mg/kg b.w./day using the most appropriate strength. \nUnder exceptional circumstances a maximum dose of 35 mg/kg b.w./day may be justified under close \nhaematological monitoring (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n3 \n\nIf the patient does not respond to the maximum dose of hydroxycarbamide (35 mg/kg b.w./day) given \nover three to six months, permanent discontinuation of Siklos should be considered. \n \nIf blood counts are within the toxic range, Siklos should be temporarily discontinued until blood \ncounts recover. Haematological recovery usually occurs within two weeks. Treatment may then be \nreinstated at a reduced dose. The dose of Siklos may then be increased again under close \nhaematological monitoring. A dose producing haematological toxicity should not be tried more than \ntwo times. \n \nThe toxic range may be characterised by the following results of blood tests: \n\nNeutrophils < 1,500/mm3 \nPlatelets  < 80,000/mm3 \nHaemoglobin < 4.5 g/dl \nReticulocytes < 80,000/mm3 if the haemoglobin concentration < 9 g/dl \n\n \nLong-term data on the continued use of hydroxycarbamide in patients with sickle cell syndrome are \navailable in children and adolescents, with a follow-up of 12 years in children and adolescents and \nover 13 years in adults. It is currently unknown how long patients should be treated with Siklos. The \nduration of treatment is the responsibility of the prescribing physician and should be based on the \nclinical and haematological status of each patient. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nChildren less than 2 years of age \nBecause of the scarce long term data on the treatment with hydroxycarbamide in children less than \n2 years of age, dose regimens have not been established and thus, in this population, the treatment with \nhydroxycarbamide is not recommended. \n \nRenal impairment \nAs renal excretion is a main pathway of elimination, a dose reduction of Siklos should be considered \nin patients with renal impairment. In patients with creatinine clearance \u2264 60 ml/min, the initial Siklos \ndose should be decreased by 50%. Close monitoring of blood parameters is advised in these patients. \nSiklos must not be administered to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThere are no data that support specific dose adjustments in patients with hepatic impairment. Close \nmonitoring of blood parameters is advised in these patients. Due to safety considerations, Siklos is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nConforming to the individual prescribed dose, the tablet or the half or quarter of the tablet should be \ntaken once daily, preferably in the morning before breakfast and, when necessary, with a glass of \nwater or a very small amount of food. \n \nFor patients who are not able to swallow the tablets, these can be disintegrated immediately before \nuse in a small quantity of water in a teaspoon. Adding a drop of syrup or mixing with food can mask a \npossible bitter taste. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification C). \n \nSevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nToxic ranges of myelosuppression as described in section 4.2. \n \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBone marrow depression \nTreatment with Siklos requires close clinical monitoring. The haematological status of the patient, as \nwell as renal and hepatic functions should be determined prior to, and repeatedly during treatment. \nDuring treatment with Siklos, blood counts must be monitored once a month at treatment initiation \n(i.e. for the first two months) and if the daily dose of hydroxycarbamide is up to 35 mg/kg b.w. \nPatients who are stable on lower doses should be monitored every 2 months. \n \nTreatment with Siklos should be discontinued if bone marrow function is markedly depressed. \nNeutropenia is generally the first and most common manifestation of haematological suppression. \nThrombocytopenia and anaemia occur less frequently, and are rarely seen without preceding \nneutropenia. Recovery from myelosuppression is usually rapid when therapy is discontinued. Siklos \ntherapy can then be re-initiated at a lower dose (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nSiklos should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see section \n4.2). \nSince there are limited data in patients with mild to moderate liver impairment, Siklos should be used \nwith caution (see section 4.2). \n \nLeg ulcers and cutaneous vasculitis toxicities \nIn patients with leg ulcers, Siklos should be used with caution. Leg ulcers are a common complication \nof sickle cell syndrome, but have also been reported in patients treated with hydroxycarbamide. \nCutaneous vasculitic toxicities, including vasculitic ulcerations and gangrene, have occurred in \npatients with myeloproliferative disorders during therapy with hydroxycarbamide. These vasculitic \ntoxicities were reported most often in patients with a history of, or currently receiving, interferon \ntherapy. Due to potentially severe clinical outcomes for the cutaneous vasculitic ulcers reported in \npatients with myeloproliferative disease, hydroxycarbamide should be discontinued and/or its dose \nreduced if cutaneous vasculitic ulcerations develop. Rarely, ulcers are caused by leukocytoclastic \nvasculitis. \n \nMacrocytosis \nHydroxycarbamide causes macrocytosis, which may mask the incidental development of folic acid \nand vitamin B12 deficiency. Prophylactic administration of folic acid is recommended. \n \nCarcinogenicity \nHydroxycarbamide is unequivocally genotoxic in a wide range of test systems. Hydroxycarbamide is \npresumed to be a transspecies carcinogen. In patients receiving long-term hydroxycarbamide for \nmyeloproliferative disorders, secondary leukaemia has been reported. It is unknown whether this \nleukaemogenic effect is secondary to hydroxycarbamide or is associated with the patient\u2019s underlying \ndisease. Skin cancer has also been reported in patients receiving long-term hydroxycarbamide. \n \nSafe administration and monitoring \nPatients and/or parents or the legal responsible person must be able to follow directions regarding the \nadministration of this medicinal product, their monitoring and care. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nSpecific interaction studies have not been performed with hydroxycarbamide. \n \nPotentially fatal pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, and severe peripheral neuropathy have been reported \nin HIV-infected patients who received hydroxycarbamide in combination with first generation \nantiretroviral medicinal products, particularly didanosine plus stavudine. Patients treated with \nhydroxycarbamide in combination with didanosine, stavudine, and indinavir showed a median decline \nin CD4 cells of approximately 100/mm3. \n \nConcurrent use of hydroxycarbamide and other myelosuppressive medicinal products or radiation \ntherapy may increase bone marrow depression, gastro-intestinal disturbances or mucositis. An \nerythema caused by radiation therapy may be aggravated by hydroxycarbamide. \n \nConcomitant use of hydroxycarbamide with a live virus vaccine may potentiate the replication of the \nvaccine virus and/or may increase the adverse reaction of the vaccine virus, because normal defence \nmechanisms may be suppressed by hydroxycarbamide therapy. Vaccination with a live vaccine in a \npatient taking hydroxycarbamide may result in severe infections. Generally, the patient's antibody \nresponse to vaccines may be decreased. Treatment with Siklos and concomitant immunisation with \nlive virus vaccines should only be performed if benefits clearly outweigh potential risks. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females  \nWomen of childbearing age receiving hydroxycarbamide should be advised to avoid becoming \npregnant, and to inform the treating physician immediately should this occur. \nAn effective method of contraception is strongly recommended in women of childbearing potential. \nMale and female patients on hydroxycarbamide wishing to conceive should stop treatment 3 to 6 \nmonths before pregnancy if possible. The evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio should be made on an \nindividual basis taking into consideration the respective risk of hydroxycarbamide therapy against the \nswitch to a blood transfusion programme.  \n \nPregnancy  \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients on hydroxycarbamide \nshould be made aware of the theoretical risks to the foetus. \n \nIn humans, according to a prospective study including 635 females of childbearing potential treated \nwith hydroxycarbamide, 110 pregnancies were reported in 101 women exposed to hydroxycarbamide \nduring pregnancy. Additionally,  12 partners of men treated with hydroxycarbamide became pregnant. \nMost (64%) resulted in live birth. Thus, based on the data from a limited number of exposed \npregnancies, no adverse effects on the mother or on the foetus/newborn was evidenced. \n \nBecause of limited information, in case of an exposure to hydroxycarbamide of pregnant female \npatients or pregnant partners of male patients, treated by hydroxycarbamide, careful follow-up with \nadequate clinical, biological and ultrasonographic examinations should be considered.  \n \nBreast-feeding  \nHydroxycarbamide is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in \ninfants, breastfeeding must be discontinued while taking Siklos. \n \nFertility  \nFertility in males might be affected by treatment. Very common reversible oligo- and azoospermia \nhave been observed in man, although these disorders are also associated with the underlying disease. \nImpaired fertility was observed in male rats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSiklos has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not to \ndrive or operate machines, if dizziness is experienced while taking Siklos. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety profile of hydroxycarbamide in sickle cell syndrome was established from clinical trials \nand confirmed with long-term cohort studies including up to 1903 adults and children of more than 2 \nyears of age. \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction is myelosuppression with neutropenia as the most \ncommon manifestation. Bone marrow depression is the dose-limiting toxic effect of \nhydroxycarbamide. When the maximum tolerated dose is not reached, transient myelotoxicity usually \noccurs in less than 10% of patients, while under the maximum tolerated dose more than 50% can \nexperience reversible bone marrow suppression. These adverse reactions are expected based on the \npharmacology of hydroxycarbamide. Gradual dose titration may help diminish these effects (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \nThe clinical data obtained in patients with sickle cell syndrome have not shown evidence of adverse \nreactions of hydroxycarbamide on hepatic and renal function. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as very common (>1/10), common (>1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (>1/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n(>1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness: \n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nNeoplasms, benign, malignant and unspecified: \n Not known: Leukaemia and in elderly patients, skin cancers \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: \n Very common: Bone marrow depression1 including neutropenia (< 1.5 x 109/L), \n\nreticulocytopenia (< 80 x 109/L), macrocytosis2 \n Common: Thrombocytopenia (< 80 x 109/L), anaemia (haemoglobin \n\n< 4.5 g/dl)3 \nNervous system disorders: \n Common: Headache  \n Uncommon: Dizziness \nVascular disorders: \n Not known: Bleeding \nGastrointestinal disorders: \n Uncommon: Nausea \n Not known: Gastrointestinal disturbances, vomiting, gastrointestinal ulcer, \n\nsevere hypomagnesaemia \nHepatobiliary disorders: \n Rare: Elevated liver enzymes \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \n Common Skin reactions (for example oral, ungual and cutaneous \n\npigmentation) and oral mucositis. \n Uncommon: Rash, melanonychia, alopecia \n Rare: Leg ulcers \n                        Very rare: Systemic and cutaneous lupus erythematous \n Not known: Cutaneous dryness \nReproductive system and breast disorders: \n Very common: Oligospermia , azoospermia4 \n Not known: Amenorrhea \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \n Not known: Fever \nInvestigations: \n Not known: Weight gain5 \n\n1 Haematological recovery usually occurs within two weeks of withdrawal of hydroxycarbamide.  \n2 The macrocytosis caused by hydroxycarbamide is not vitamin B12 or folic acid dependent. \n3 Mainly due to infection with Parvovirus, splenic or hepatic sequestration, renal impairment.  \n4 Oligospermia and azoospermia are in general reversible but have to be taken into account when \n\nfatherhood is desired (see section 5.3). These disorders are also associated with the underlying \ndisease. \n\n5 Weight gain may be an effect of improved general conditions. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAcute mucocutaneous toxicity has been reported in patients receiving hydroxycarbamide at doses  \nseveral times above the therapeutic dose. Soreness, violet erythema, oedema on palms and soles \nfollowed by scaling of hand and feet, severe generalised hyperpigmentation of the skin and stomatitis \nhave been observed. \n \nIn patients with sickle cell syndrome, severe bone marrow depression was reported in isolated cases of \nhydroxycarbamide overdose between 2 and 10 times the prescribed dose (up to 8.57 times of the \nmaximum recommended dose of 35 mg/kg b.w./day). It is recommended that blood counts are \nmonitored for several weeks after overdose since recovery may be delayed. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\n \nTreatment of overdose consists of gastric lavage, followed by symptomatic treatment and control of \nbone marrow function. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX05. \n \nMechanism of action \nAll mechanisms of action of hydroxycarbamide are not fully understood. One of the mechanisms is the \nincrease in foetal haemoglobin (HbF) concentrations in sickle cell patients. HbF interferes with the \npolymerisation of HbS and thus impedes the sickling of red blood cell, and in turn decreases \nvasocclusion and haemolysis. In all clinical studies, there was a significant increase in HbF from \nbaseline after hydroxycarbamide use.  \n \nRecently, hydroxycarbamide has shown to be associated with the generation of nitric oxide suggesting \nthat nitric oxide stimulates cyclic guanosine monophosphatase (cGMP) production, which then \nactivates a protein kinase and increases the production of HbF. Other known pharmacological effects \nof hydroxycarbamide which may contribute to its beneficial effects in sickle cell syndrome include \ndecrease in neutrophils, increase in water content of red blood cells, increased deformability of sickled \ncells, and altered adhesion of red blood cells to the endothelium. \n \nIn addition hydroxycarbamide causes an immediate inhibition of DNA synthesis by acting as a \nribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, without interfering with the synthesis of ribonucleic acid or protein. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nBeside the inconstant correlation between reduction of crisis rate and the increase in HbF, the \ncytoreductive effect of hydroxycarbamide, particularly the decrease in neutrophils, was the factor with \nthe strongest correlation with the reduction in crisis rate. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn nearly all clinical studies conducted in sickle cell syndrome, hydroxycarbamide reduced the \nfrequency of vaso-occlusive episodes by 66% to 80%, in children and in adults. The same decrease \nwas observed for the number of hospital admissions and the number of days of hospitalisation in the \ntreated groups. The yearly frequency of acute chest syndrome was also reduced by 25 to 33% under \nhydroxycarbamide in several studies. Acute chest syndrome is a frequent life-threatening complication \nof sickle cell syndrome and is characterised by chest pain or fever or dyspnoea with recent infiltrate on \nchest X-ray. \nA sustained clinical benefit was demonstrated in patients remaining on hydroxycarbamide treatment \nfor more than 8 years.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \nAfter oral administration of 20 mg/kg of hydroxycarbamide, a rapid absorption is observed with peak \nplasma levels of about 30 mg/L occurring after 0.75 and 1.2 h in children and adult patients with sickle \ncell syndrome, respectively. The total exposure up to 24 h post-dose is 124 mg*h/L in children and \nadolescents and 135 mg*h/L in adult patients. The oral bioavailability of hydroxycarbamide is almost \ncomplete as assessed in indications other than sickle cell syndrome. \n \nDistribution  \nHydroxycarbamide distributes rapidly throughout the human body, enters the cerebrospinal fluid, \nappears in peritoneal fluid and ascites, and concentrates in leukocytes and erythrocytes. The estimated \nvolume of distribution of hydroxycarbamide approximates total body water. The volume of \n\n\n\n9 \n\ndistribution at steady state adjusted for bioavailability is 0.57 L/kg in patients with sickle cell \nsyndrome (amounting to approximately 72 and 90 L in children and adults, respectively). The extent \nof protein binding of hydroxycarbamide is unknown. \n \nBiotransformation  \nThe biotransformation pathways as well as the metabolites are not fully characterised. Urea is one \nmetabolite of hydroxycarbamide. \nHydroxycarbamide at 30, 100 and 300 \u00b5M is not metabolised in vitro by cytochrome P450s of human \nliver microsomes. At concentrations ranging from 10 to 300 \u00b5M, hydroxycarbamide does not \nstimulate the in vitro ATPase activity of recombinant human P glycoprotein (PGP), indicating that \nhydroxycarbamide is not a PGP substrate. Hence, no interaction is to be expected in case of \nconcomitant administration with substances being substrates of cytochromes P450 or P-glycoprotein. \n \nElimination  \nIn a repeated dose study in adult patients with sickle cell syndrome approximately 60% of the \nhydroxycarbamide dose was detected in urine at steady state. In adults, the total clearance adjusted for \nbioavailability was 9.89 L/h (0.16 L/h/kg) thereof 5.64 and 4.25 L/h by renal and non-renal clearance, \nrespectively. The respective value for total clearance in children was 7.25 L/h (0.20 L/h/kg) with 2.91 \nand 4.34 L/h by renal and non-renal pathways. \nIn adults with sickle cell syndrome, mean cumulative urinary hydroxycarbamide excretion was 62% of \nthe administered dose at 8 hours, and thus higher than in cancer patients (35\u201340%). In patients with \nsickle cell syndrome hydroxycarbamide was eliminated with a half-life of approximately six to seven \nhours, which is longer than reported in other indications. \n \nGeriatric, gender, race  \nNo information is available regarding pharmacokinetic differences due to age (except paediatric \npatients), gender or race. \n \nPaediatric population  \nIn paediatric and adult patients with sickle cell syndrome the systemic exposure to hydroxycarbamide \nat steady state was similar by means of the area under the curve. The maximum plasma levels and the \napparent volume of distribution related to body weight were well comparable between age groups. The \ntime to reach maximum plasma concentration and the percentage of the dose excreted in urine were \nincreased in children compared to adults. In paediatric patients, the half-life was slightly longer and \nthe total clearance related to body weight slightly higher than in adult patients (see section 4.2).  \n \nRenal impairment  \nAs renal excretion is a pathway of elimination, consideration should be given to decreasing the dose of \nSiklos in patients with renal impairment. In an open single-dose study in adult patients with sickle cell \nsyndrome (Yan JH et al, 2005) the influence of renal function on pharmacokinetics of \nhydroxycarbamide was assessed. Patients with normal (creatinine clearance CrCl>80 ml/min), mild \n(CrCl 60\u201380 ml/min), moderate (CrCl 30 - 60 ml/min), or severe (<30 ml/min) renal impairment \nreceived hydroxycarbamide as a single dose of 15 mg/kg b.w. by using 200 mg, 300 mg, or 400 mg \ncapsules. In patients, whose CrCl was below 60 ml/min or patients with end-stage renal disease the \nmean exposure to hydroxycarbamide was approximately 64% higher than in patients with normal \nrenal function. As evaluated in a further study, in patients with a CrCl<60 ml/min the area under the \ncurve was approximately 51% higher than in patients with a CrCl \u226560 ml/min, which suggests that a \ndose reduction of hydroxycarbamide by 50% may be appropriate in patients with a CrCl < 60 ml/min. \nHaemodialysis reduced the exposure to hydroxycarbamide by 33% (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \nClose monitoring of blood parameters is advised in these patients. \n \nHepatic impairment  \nThere are no data that support specific guidance for dose adjustment in patients with hepatic \nimpairment, but, due to safety considerations, Siklos is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see section 4.3). Close monitoring of blood parameters is advised in patients with hepatic \nimpairment.  \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn preclinical toxicity studies the most common effects noted included bone marrow depression, \nlymphoid atrophy and degenerative changes in the epithelium of the small and large intestines. \nCardiovascular effects and haematological changes were observed in some species. Also, in rats \ntesticular atrophy with decreased spermatogenesis occurred, while in dogs reversible spermatogenic \narrest was noted. \n \nHydroxycarbamide is unequivocally genotoxic in a wide range of test systems. \nConventional long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydroxycarbamide have not \nbeen performed. However, hydroxycarbamide is presumed to be a transspecies carcinogen. \n \nHydroxycarbamide crosses the placenta barrier and has been demonstrated to be a potent teratogen and \nembryotoxic in a wide variety of animal models at or below the human therapeutic dose. \nTeratogenicity was characterised by partially ossified cranial bones, absence of eye sockets, \nhydrocephaly, bipartite sternebrae, missing lumbar vertebrae. Embryotoxicity was characterized by \ndecreased foetal viability, reduced live litter sizes, and developmental delays. \n \nHydroxycarbamide administered to male rats at 60 mg/kg b.w./day (about double the recommended \nusual maximum dose in humans) produced testicular atrophy, decreased spermatogenesis and \nsignificantly reduced their ability to impregnate females. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, or pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, or pharmacist or nurse. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n \n1. What Siklos is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Siklos \n3. How to take Siklos \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store Siklos \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Siklos is and what it is used for \n \nSiklos is used to prevent painful crises, including sudden chest pain, caused by sickle cell disease, in \nadults, adolescents and children older than 2 years.  \n \nSickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects the disc shaped red cells of the blood.  \nSome cells become abnormal, rigid and take a crescent or sickle shape which leads to anemia. \nThe sickle cells also get stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow. This can cause acute pain crises \nand organ damage. \n \nFor severe painful crises, most patients require hospitalisation. Siklos will decrease the number of \npainful crises as well as the need for hospitalisation linked with the disease.  \n \nThe active substance of Siklos, hydroxycarbamide, is a substance which inhibits growth and \nproliferation of some cells, such as blood cells. These effects lead to a reduction of circulating red, \nwhite and coagulation blood cells (myelosuppressive effect). In sickle cell disease, hydroxycarbamide \nhelps also to prevent red blood cells from taking abnormal shape. \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Siklos \n \nDo not take Siklos \n- if you are allergic to hydroxycarbamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6), \n- if you suffer from severe liver disease, \n- if you suffer from severe kidney disease, \n- if you are myelosuppressed (if you have decreased production of red, white, or coagulating \n\nblood cells) as described in section 3 \u201cHow to take Siklos, Treatment follow-up\u201d, \n- if you are breast-feeding (see section \u201cPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\u201d). \n \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse before taking Siklos \n \n- if you have a liver disease, \n- if you have a kidney disease, \n- if you have leg ulcers, \n- if you are taking other myelosuppressive medicines (decrease production of red, white, or \n\ncoagulating blood cells) or receiving radiation therapy, \n- if you have a known lack of vitamin B12 or folate. \n \nIf you experience (or have experienced) any of the above, please tell your doctor. If you have any \nquestion, please ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n \nPatients and/or parents or the legal responsible person must be able to follow directions regarding the \nadministration of this medicine, their monitoring and care. \n \nOther medicines and Siklos \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nInformation sharing is especially required for \n- some antiretroviral medicines (those that inhibit or destroy a retrovirus such as HIV), e.g. \n\ndidanosine, stavudine and indinavir(a drop in your white cell count may occur) , \n- myelosuppressive medicines (those that decrease production of red, white, or coagulating blood \n\ncells) and radiation therapy, \n- some vaccines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nSiklos is not recommended during pregnancy. Please contact your doctor if you think you may be \npregnant. The use of effective contraception is strongly recommended. \n \nIf you become pregnant or plan to become pregnant while taking Siklos, your doctor will discuss with \nyou the potential benefits and risks of continuing using Siklos.  \n \nFor male patients taking Siklos, if your partner becomes pregnant or plans to become pregnant, your \ndoctor will discuss with you the potential benefits and risks of continuing using Siklos. \n \nThe active substance of Siklos passes into human breast-milk. You must not breast-feed while taking \nSiklos. \n \nHydroxycarbamide may decrease sperm production in male patients while they are being treated. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nSome people may experience dizziness when using Siklos. Do not drive or use any tools or machines if \nyou experience dizziness whilst taking Siklos. \n \n3. How to take Siklos \n \nAlways take Siklos exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nDose \n \nYour doctor will tell you how much of Siklos to take each day and will describe the dose in \nwhole, half or quarter tablets. \n \nThe prescribed dose of Siklos must be taken once daily, preferably in the morning before breakfast.  \nIt can be taken with a glass of water or a very small amount of food. \nIf you cannot swallow the tablets, you can disintegrate them in water immediately before use: \n\u2022 Place the required dose (preferably broken if Siklos 1000 mg tablet is used) in a teaspoon and add \n\nsome water. \n\u2022 As soon as the tablet is disintegrated, swallow the content of the teaspoon. You can add a drop of \n\nsyrup or mix the content with food to mask a possible bitter taste. \n\u2022 Then drink a large glass of water or any other drink. \n \nHandling \n \nSiklos is a cytotoxic medicine that must be handled with care. \nAny person, in particular pregnant women, who are not taking Siklos should avoid direct contact with \nthe parts when breaking a tablet. Wash your hands before and after contact with the tablets. \nIn case the prescribed dose requires breaking the tablet in halves or quarters, this should be done out of \nthe reach of food. Powder spilled from the broken tablet should be wiped up with a damp disposable \ntowel which must be thrown out. For the storage of unused broken tablets, see section 5 \u201cHow to store \nSiklos\u201d. \n \nTreatment follow-up \n \nYour doctor will tell you how long to take Siklos. \n \nWhen taking Siklos you will have regular blood tests and check your liver and kidney. \nDepending on the dose you take, these tests may be performed monthly or every two months.  \n \nDepending on these results your doctor will adjust your dose of Siklos. \n \nIf you take more Siklos than you should \n \nIf you take more Siklos than you should or if a child has taken any, contact your doctor or the nearest \nhospital immediately as you may need urgent medical treatment. The most common symptoms of \noverdose with Siklos are: \n- Redness of the skin, \n- Soreness (touch is painful) and swelling of the palms of hands and soles of feet followed by the \n\nhands and feet becoming scaly, \n- Skin becoming strongly pigmented (locally changes of colour), \n- Soreness or swelling in the mouth. \n \nIf you forget to take Siklos \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. Continue as normal when it is time to take \nthe next dose as prescribed by your doctor. \n \nIf you stop taking Siklos \n \nDo not stop your treatment unless advised by your doctor. \nIf you have any further question on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n4.

disease, in adults, adolescents and children older than 2 years. sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects the disc shaped red cells of the blood. some cells become abnormal, rigid and take a crescent or sickle shape which leads to anemia. the sickle cells also get stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow. this can cause acute pain crises and organ damage. for severe painful crises, most patients require hospitalisation. siklos will decrease the number of painful crises as well as the need for hospitalisation linked with the disease. the active substance of siklos, hydroxycarbamide, is a substance which inhibits growth and proliferation of some cells, such as blood cells. these effects lead to a reduction of circulating red, white and coagulation blood cells (myelosuppressive effect). in sickle cell disease, hydroxycarbamide helps also to prevent red blood cells from taking abnormal shape.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "siklos", "Type":
