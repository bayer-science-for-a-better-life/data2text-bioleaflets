NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIrbesartan BMS 75 mg tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 75 mg of irbesartan. \n \nExcipient: 15.37 mg of lactose monohydrate per tablet. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \nWhite to off-white, biconvex, and oval-shaped with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2771 \nengraved on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nTreatment of renal disease in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of an \nantihypertensive medicinal product regimen (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily, with or without food. \nIrbesartan BMS at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure \ncontrol than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in \nhaemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. \n \nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan BMS can be \nincreased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive agents can be added. In particular, the addition of a \ndiuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive effect with Irbesartan BMS \n(see section 4.5). \n \nIn hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily \nand titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. \nThe demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan BMS in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based \non studies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach \ntarget blood pressure (see section 5.1). \n \nRenal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower \nstarting dose (75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly patients: although consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients \nover 75 years of age, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary for the elderly. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 3\n\nPaediatric patients: irbesartan is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to \ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in \npatients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, \ndiarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan \nBMS. \n \nRenovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency \nwhen patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney \nare treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is \nnot documented with Irbesartan BMS, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan BMS is used in patients with impaired \nrenal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There \nis no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan BMS in patients with a recent kidney \ntransplantation. \n \nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and \ncardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study \nwith patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and \nnon-white subjects (see section 5.1). \n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, \nhyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Irbesartan BMS, especially in the presence of \nrenal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring \nof serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan BMS is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan BMS is not recommended. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive \nagent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic \ncardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see \nsection 5.1). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 4\n\n \nPregnancy: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nLactose: this medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric patients: irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but the \ncurrent data are insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become \navailable (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the \nhypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan BMS has been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide \ndiuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of \nhypotension when initiating therapy with Irbesartan BMS (see section 4.4). \n \nPotassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and \nis, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \nrecommended. \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of \nirbesartan. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 5\n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nLactation: \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan BMS during breast-feeding, \nIrbesartan BMS is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles \nduring breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on its \npharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect this ability. When driving vehicles or \noperating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness or weariness may occur during \ntreatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did \nnot differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation due to any \nclinical or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for \nplacebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the \nrecommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. \n \nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic \ndizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon) but in \nexcess of placebo. \n \nThe following table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials \nin which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the \nadverse reactions that were additionally reported in > 2% of diabetic hypertensive patients with \nchronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria and in excess of placebo. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 6\n\nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100, < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000, < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000, \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInvestigations: \nVery common: Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan than \n\nwith placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal \nrenal function, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the \nirbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic \nhypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria, \nhyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group \nand 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. \n\nCommon: significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in \nirbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable \nclinical musculoskeletal events. \n\n  In 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with \nirbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been \nobserved. \n\n \nCardiac disorders: \nUncommon: tachycardia \n \nNervous system disorders: \nCommon: dizziness, orthostatic dizziness* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \nUncommon: cough \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nCommon: musculoskeletal pain* \n \nVascular disorders: \nCommon: orthostatic hypotension* \nUncommon: flushing \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nCommon: fatigue \nUncommon: chest pain \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders: \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction \n \nThe following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post\u2013marketing \nexperience; they are derived from spontaneous reports and therefore, the frequency of these \nadverse reactions is not known: \n \nNervous system disorders: \nHeadache \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders: \nTinnitus  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 7\n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \nDysgeusia \n \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nImpaired renal function including cases of renal failure in patients at risk (see section 4.4) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nLeukocytoclastic vasculitis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nArthralgia, myalgia (in some cases associated with increased plasma creatine kinase levels), muscle \ncramps \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nHyperkalaemia \n \nImmune system disorders: \nHypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, rash, urticaria \n \nHepato-biliary disorders: \nHepatitis, abnormal liver function \n \nPaediatric patients: in a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to \n16 years, the following related adverse events occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache \n(7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), dizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label period of this \ntrial the most frequent laboratory abnormalities observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and \nelevated CK values in 2% of child recipients. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most \nlikely manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might \nalso occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with \nIrbesartan BMS. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated \ncharcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin-II antagonists, plain. \nATC code: C09C A04. \n \nMechanism of action: Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) \nantagonist. It is expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, \nregardless of the source or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the \nangiotensin-II (AT1) receptors results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and \na decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected \nby irbesartan alone at the recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an \nenzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. \nIrbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its activity. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 8\n\nClinical efficacy: \n \nHypertension \nIrbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is \ndose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of \n150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing) by \nan average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo. \nPeak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood \npressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood \npressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended \ndoses. Once daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar to twice \ndaily dosing on the same total dose. \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Irbesartan BMS is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal \neffect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are maintained during \nlong term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns toward baseline. \nRebound hypertension has not been observed. \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In patients \nnot adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide \n(12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at \ntrough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). \nThe efficacy of Irbesartan BMS is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably less \nresponse to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low dose \nof hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients approaches \nthat of white patients. \nThere is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion. \n \nReduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low), 1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high) target \ntitrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of \nhypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the \nthree weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable, trough seated systolic \nblood pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium dose), 13.2 mmHg (high \ndose). No significant difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough \nseated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium \ndose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized \nto either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg \nin SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of \nirbesartan (see section 4.2). \n \nHypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease \nThe \u201cIrbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)\u201d shows that irbesartan decreases the progression \nof renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double \nblind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing Irbesartan BMS, amlodipine and placebo. In \n1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria \u2265 900 mg/day and serum creatinine \nranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan BMS on the \nprogression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg \nto a maintenance dose of 300 mg Irbesartan BMS, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine, or placebo as \ntolerated. Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents \n(e.g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of \n\u2264 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg. Sixty per \ncent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was \n76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced \nthe relative risk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal \ndisease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality. Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached \nthe primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine \ngroups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction \ncompared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 9\n\nanalysed, no effect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in \nESRD and a significant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed. \n \nSubgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum \ncreatinine, and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black \nsubgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall study population respectively, a renal \nbenefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary \nendpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups \nin the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a \ndecreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo-\nbased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the \nirbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart \nfailure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in \nwomen has been identified. \n \nThe study of the \u201cEffects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 \nDiabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)\u201d shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in \npatients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double blind morbidity study in \n590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function \n(serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl in males and < 1.1 mg/dl in females). The study examined the long-term \neffects (2 years) of Irbesartan BMS on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria (urinary albumin \nexcretion rate (UAER) > 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from baseline). The \npredefined blood pressure goal was \u2264 135/85 mmHg. Additional antihypertensive agents (excluding \nACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium blockers) were added \nas needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal. While similar blood pressure was achieved in all \ntreatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or \nin the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% \nrelative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An accompanying \nimprovement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first three months of \ntreatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early as three months \nand continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day) was more \nfrequent in the Irbesartan BMS 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of \napproximately 60-80%. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability of \nirbesartan. Plasma protein binding is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution is 53-93 litres. Following oral or intravenous administration \nof 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma radioactivity is attributable to unchanged \nirbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major \ncirculating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide (approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that \nirbesartan is primarily oxidised by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has \nnegligible effect. \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal \nrecommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations \nare attained at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are \n157-176 and 3-3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. \nSteady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing \nregimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily \ndosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female \nhypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of \nirbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values \nwere also somewhat greater in elderly subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 10\n\nHowever the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in \nelderly patients. \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children after the administration \nof single and multiple daily doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg for \nfour weeks. Of those 23 children, 21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults \n(twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that Cmax, AUC \nand clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan \ndaily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily \ndosing. \n \nRenal impairment: in patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the \npharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by \nhaemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment: in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nirbesartan are not significantly altered. \nStudies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ \nhypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIrbesartan BMS 150 mg tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 150 mg of irbesartan. \n \nExcipient: 30.75 mg of lactose monohydrate per tablet. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \nWhite to off-white, biconvex, and oval-shaped with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2772 \nengraved on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nTreatment of renal disease in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of an \nantihypertensive medicinal product regimen (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily, with or without food. \nIrbesartan BMS at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure \ncontrol than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in \nhaemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. \n \nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan BMS can be \nincreased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive agents can be added. In particular, the addition of a \ndiuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive effect with Irbesartan BMS \n(see section 4.5). \n \nIn hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily \nand titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. \nThe demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan BMS in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based \non studies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach \ntarget blood pressure (see section 5.1). \n \nRenal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower \nstarting dose (75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly patients: although consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients \nover 75 years of age, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary for the elderly. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 13\n\nPaediatric patients: irbesartan is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to \ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in \npatients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, \ndiarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan \nBMS. \n \nRenovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency \nwhen patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney \nare treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is \nnot documented with Irbesartan BMS, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan BMS is used in patients with impaired \nrenal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There \nis no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan BMS in patients with a recent kidney \ntransplantation. \n \nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and \ncardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study \nwith patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and \nnon-white subjects (see section 5.1). \n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, \nhyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Irbesartan BMS, especially in the presence of \nrenal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring \nof serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan BMS is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan BMS is not recommended. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive \nagent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic \ncardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see \nsection 5.1). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 14\n\n \nPregnancy: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nLactose: this medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric patients: irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but the \ncurrent data are insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become \navailable (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the \nhypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan BMS has been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide \ndiuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of \nhypotension when initiating therapy with Irbesartan BMS (see section 4.4). \n \nPotassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and \nis, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \nrecommended. \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of \nirbesartan. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 15\n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nLactation: \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan BMS during breast-feeding, \nIrbesartan BMS is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles \nduring breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on its \npharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect this ability. When driving vehicles or \noperating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness or weariness may occur during \ntreatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did \nnot differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation due to any \nclinical or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for \nplacebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the \nrecommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. \n \nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic \ndizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon) but in \nexcess of placebo. \n \nThe following table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials \nin which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the \nadverse reactions that were additionally reported in > 2% of diabetic hypertensive patients with \nchronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria and in excess of placebo. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 16\n\nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100, < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000, < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000, \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInvestigations: \nVery common: Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan than \n\nwith placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal \nrenal function, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the \nirbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic \nhypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria, \nhyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group \nand 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. \n\nCommon: significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in \nirbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable \nclinical musculoskeletal events. \n\n  In 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with \nirbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been \nobserved. \n\n \nCardiac disorders: \nUncommon: tachycardia \n \nNervous system disorders: \nCommon: dizziness, orthostatic dizziness* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \nUncommon: cough \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nCommon: musculoskeletal pain* \n \nVascular disorders: \nCommon: orthostatic hypotension* \nUncommon: flushing \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nCommon: fatigue \nUncommon: chest pain \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders: \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction \n \nThe following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post\u2013marketing \nexperience; they are derived from spontaneous reports and therefore, the frequency of these \nadverse reactions is not known: \n \nNervous system disorders: \nHeadache \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders: \nTinnitus  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 17\n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \nDysgeusia \n \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nImpaired renal function including cases of renal failure in patients at risk (see section 4.4) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nLeukocytoclastic vasculitis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nArthralgia, myalgia (in some cases associated with increased plasma creatine kinase levels), muscle \ncramps \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nHyperkalaemia \n \nImmune system disorders: \nHypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, rash, urticaria \n \nHepato-biliary disorders: \nHepatitis, abnormal liver function \n \nPaediatric patients: in a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to \n16 years, the following related adverse events occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache \n(7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), dizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label period of this \ntrial the most frequent laboratory abnormalities observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and \nelevated CK values in 2% of child recipients. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most \nlikely manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might \nalso occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with \nIrbesartan BMS. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated \ncharcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin-II antagonists, plain. \nATC code: C09C A04. \n \nMechanism of action: Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) \nantagonist. It is expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, \nregardless of the source or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the \nangiotensin-II (AT1) receptors results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and \na decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected \nby irbesartan alone at the recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an \nenzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. \nIrbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its activity. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 18\n\nClinical efficacy: \n \nHypertension \nIrbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is \ndose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of \n150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing) by \nan average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo. \nPeak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood \npressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood \npressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended \ndoses. Once daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar to twice \ndaily dosing on the same total dose. \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Irbesartan BMS is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal \neffect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are maintained during \nlong term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns toward baseline. \nRebound hypertension has not been observed. \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In patients \nnot adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide \n(12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at \ntrough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). \nThe efficacy of Irbesartan BMS is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably less \nresponse to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low dose \nof hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients approaches \nthat of white patients. \nThere is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion. \n \nReduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low), 1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high) target \ntitrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of \nhypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the \nthree weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable, trough seated systolic \nblood pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium dose), 13.2 mmHg (high \ndose). No significant difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough \nseated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium \ndose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized \nto either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg \nin SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of \nirbesartan (see section 4.2). \n \nHypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease \nThe \u201cIrbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)\u201d shows that irbesartan decreases the progression \nof renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double \nblind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing Irbesartan BMS, amlodipine and placebo. In \n1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria \u2265 900 mg/day and serum creatinine \nranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan BMS on the \nprogression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg \nto a maintenance dose of 300 mg Irbesartan BMS, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine, or placebo as \ntolerated. Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents \n(e.g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of \n\u2264 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg. Sixty per \ncent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was \n76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced \nthe relative risk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal \ndisease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality. Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached \nthe primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine \ngroups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction \ncompared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 19\n\nanalysed, no effect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in \nESRD and a significant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed. \n \nSubgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum \ncreatinine, and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black \nsubgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall study population respectively, a renal \nbenefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary \nendpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups \nin the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a \ndecreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo-\nbased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the \nirbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart \nfailure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in \nwomen has been identified. \n \nThe study of the \u201cEffects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 \nDiabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)\u201d shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in \npatients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double blind morbidity study in \n590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function \n(serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl in males and < 1.1 mg/dl in females). The study examined the long-term \neffects (2 years) of Irbesartan BMS on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria (urinary albumin \nexcretion rate (UAER) > 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from baseline). The \npredefined blood pressure goal was \u2264 135/85 mmHg. Additional antihypertensive agents (excluding \nACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium blockers) were added \nas needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal. While similar blood pressure was achieved in all \ntreatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or \nin the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% \nrelative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An accompanying \nimprovement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first three months of \ntreatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early as three months \nand continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day) was more \nfrequent in the Irbesartan BMS 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of \napproximately 60-80%. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability of \nirbesartan. Plasma protein binding is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution is 53-93 litres. Following oral or intravenous administration \nof 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma radioactivity is attributable to unchanged \nirbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major \ncirculating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide (approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that \nirbesartan is primarily oxidised by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has \nnegligible effect. \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal \nrecommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations \nare attained at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are \n157-176 and 3-3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. \nSteady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing \nregimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily \ndosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female \nhypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of \nirbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values \nwere also somewhat greater in elderly subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 20\n\nHowever the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in \nelderly patients. \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children after the administration \nof single and multiple daily doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg for \nfour weeks. Of those 23 children, 21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults \n(twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that Cmax, AUC \nand clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan \ndaily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily \ndosing. \n \nRenal impairment: in patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the \npharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by \nhaemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment: in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nirbesartan are not significantly altered. \nStudies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ \nhypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIrbesartan BMS 300 mg tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 300 mg of irbesartan. \n \nExcipient: 61.50 mg of lactose monohydrate per tablet. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \nWhite to off-white, biconvex, and oval-shaped with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2773 \nengraved on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nTreatment of renal disease in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of an \nantihypertensive medicinal product regimen (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily, with or without food. \nIrbesartan BMS at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure \ncontrol than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in \nhaemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. \n \nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan BMS can be \nincreased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive agents can be added. In particular, the addition of a \ndiuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive effect with Irbesartan BMS \n(see section 4.5). \n \nIn hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily \nand titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. \nThe demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan BMS in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based \non studies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach \ntarget blood pressure (see section 5.1). \n \nRenal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower \nstarting dose (75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly patients: although consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients \nover 75 years of age, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary for the elderly. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 23\n\nPaediatric patients: irbesartan is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to \ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in \npatients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, \ndiarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan \nBMS. \n \nRenovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency \nwhen patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney \nare treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is \nnot documented with Irbesartan BMS, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan BMS is used in patients with impaired \nrenal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There \nis no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan BMS in patients with a recent kidney \ntransplantation. \n \nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and \ncardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study \nwith patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and \nnon-white subjects (see section 5.1). \n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, \nhyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Irbesartan BMS, especially in the presence of \nrenal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring \nof serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan BMS is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan BMS is not recommended. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive \nagent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic \ncardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see \nsection 5.1). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 24\n\n \nPregnancy: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nLactose: this medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric patients: irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but the \ncurrent data are insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become \navailable (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the \nhypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan BMS has been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide \ndiuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of \nhypotension when initiating therapy with Irbesartan BMS (see section 4.4). \n \nPotassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and \nis, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \nrecommended. \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of \nirbesartan. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 25\n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nLactation: \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan BMS during breast-feeding, \nIrbesartan BMS is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles \nduring breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on its \npharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect this ability. When driving vehicles or \noperating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness or weariness may occur during \ntreatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did \nnot differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation due to any \nclinical or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for \nplacebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the \nrecommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. \n \nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic \ndizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon) but in \nexcess of placebo. \n \nThe following table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials \nin which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the \nadverse reactions that were additionally reported in > 2% of diabetic hypertensive patients with \nchronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria and in excess of placebo. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 26\n\nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100, < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000, < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000, \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInvestigations: \nVery common: Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan than \n\nwith placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal \nrenal function, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the \nirbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic \nhypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria, \nhyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group \nand 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. \n\nCommon: significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in \nirbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable \nclinical musculoskeletal events. \n\n  In 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with \nirbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been \nobserved. \n\n \nCardiac disorders: \nUncommon: tachycardia \n \nNervous system disorders: \nCommon: dizziness, orthostatic dizziness* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \nUncommon: cough \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nCommon: musculoskeletal pain* \n \nVascular disorders: \nCommon: orthostatic hypotension* \nUncommon: flushing \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nCommon: fatigue \nUncommon: chest pain \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders: \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction \n \nThe following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post\u2013marketing \nexperience; they are derived from spontaneous reports and therefore, the frequency of these \nadverse reactions is not known: \n \nNervous system disorders: \nHeadache \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders: \nTinnitus  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 27\n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \nDysgeusia \n \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nImpaired renal function including cases of renal failure in patients at risk (see section 4.4) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nLeukocytoclastic vasculitis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nArthralgia, myalgia (in some cases associated with increased plasma creatine kinase levels), muscle \ncramps \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nHyperkalaemia \n \nImmune system disorders: \nHypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, rash, urticaria \n \nHepato-biliary disorders: \nHepatitis, abnormal liver function \n \nPaediatric patients: in a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to \n16 years, the following related adverse events occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache \n(7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), dizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label period of this \ntrial the most frequent laboratory abnormalities observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and \nelevated CK values in 2% of child recipients. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most \nlikely manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might \nalso occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with \nIrbesartan BMS. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated \ncharcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin-II antagonists, plain. \nATC code: C09C A04. \n \nMechanism of action: Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) \nantagonist. It is expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, \nregardless of the source or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the \nangiotensin-II (AT1) receptors results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and \na decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected \nby irbesartan alone at the recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an \nenzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. \nIrbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its activity. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 28\n\nClinical efficacy: \n \nHypertension \nIrbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is \ndose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of \n150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing) by \nan average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo. \nPeak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood \npressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood \npressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended \ndoses. Once daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar to twice \ndaily dosing on the same total dose. \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Irbesartan BMS is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal \neffect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are maintained during \nlong term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns toward baseline. \nRebound hypertension has not been observed. \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In patients \nnot adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide \n(12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at \ntrough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). \nThe efficacy of Irbesartan BMS is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably less \nresponse to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low dose \nof hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients approaches \nthat of white patients. \nThere is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion. \n \nReduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low), 1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high) target \ntitrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of \nhypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the \nthree weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable, trough seated systolic \nblood pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium dose), 13.2 mmHg (high \ndose). No significant difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough \nseated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium \ndose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized \nto either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg \nin SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of \nirbesartan (see section 4.2). \n \nHypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease \nThe \u201cIrbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)\u201d shows that irbesartan decreases the progression \nof renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double \nblind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing Irbesartan BMS, amlodipine and placebo. In \n1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria \u2265 900 mg/day and serum creatinine \nranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan BMS on the \nprogression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg \nto a maintenance dose of 300 mg Irbesartan BMS, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine, or placebo as \ntolerated. Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents \n(e.g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of \n\u2264 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg. Sixty per \ncent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was \n76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced \nthe relative risk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal \ndisease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality. Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached \nthe primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine \ngroups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction \ncompared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 29\n\nanalysed, no effect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in \nESRD and a significant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed. \n \nSubgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum \ncreatinine, and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black \nsubgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall study population respectively, a renal \nbenefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary \nendpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups \nin the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a \ndecreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo-\nbased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the \nirbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart \nfailure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in \nwomen has been identified. \n \nThe study of the \u201cEffects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 \nDiabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)\u201d shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in \npatients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double blind morbidity study in \n590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function \n(serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl in males and < 1.1 mg/dl in females). The study examined the long-term \neffects (2 years) of Irbesartan BMS on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria (urinary albumin \nexcretion rate (UAER) > 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from baseline). The \npredefined blood pressure goal was \u2264 135/85 mmHg. Additional antihypertensive agents (excluding \nACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium blockers) were added \nas needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal. While similar blood pressure was achieved in all \ntreatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or \nin the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% \nrelative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An accompanying \nimprovement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first three months of \ntreatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early as three months \nand continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day) was more \nfrequent in the Irbesartan BMS 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of \napproximately 60-80%. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability of \nirbesartan. Plasma protein binding is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution is 53-93 litres. Following oral or intravenous administration \nof 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma radioactivity is attributable to unchanged \nirbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major \ncirculating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide (approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that \nirbesartan is primarily oxidised by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has \nnegligible effect. \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal \nrecommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations \nare attained at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are \n157-176 and 3-3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. \nSteady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing \nregimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily \ndosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female \nhypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of \nirbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values \nwere also somewhat greater in elderly subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 30\n\nHowever the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in \nelderly patients. \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children after the administration \nof single and multiple daily doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg for \nfour weeks. Of those 23 children, 21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults \n(twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that Cmax, AUC \nand clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan \ndaily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily \ndosing. \n \nRenal impairment: in patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the \npharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by \nhaemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment: in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nirbesartan are not significantly altered. \nStudies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ \nhypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIrbesartan BMS 75 mg film-coated tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 75 mg of irbesartan. \n \nExcipient: 25.50 mg of lactose monohydrate per film-coated tablet. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \nWhite to off-white, biconvex, and oval-shaped with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2871 \nengraved on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nTreatment of renal disease in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of an \nantihypertensive medicinal product regimen (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily, with or without food. \nIrbesartan BMS at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure \ncontrol than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in \nhaemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. \n \nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan BMS can be \nincreased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive agents can be added. In particular, the addition of a \ndiuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive effect with Irbesartan BMS \n(see section 4.5). \n \nIn hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily \nand titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. \nThe demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan BMS in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based \non studies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach \ntarget blood pressure (see section 5.1). \n \nRenal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower \nstarting dose (75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly patients: although consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients \nover 75 years of age, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary for the elderly. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 33\n\nPaediatric patients: irbesartan is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to \ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in \npatients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, \ndiarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan \nBMS. \n \nRenovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency \nwhen patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney \nare treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is \nnot documented with Irbesartan BMS, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan BMS is used in patients with impaired \nrenal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There \nis no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan BMS in patients with a recent kidney \ntransplantation. \n \nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and \ncardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study \nwith patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and \nnon-white subjects (see section 5.1). \n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, \nhyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Irbesartan BMS, especially in the presence of \nrenal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring \nof serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan BMS is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan BMS is not recommended. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive \nagent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic \ncardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see \nsection 5.1). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 34\n\n \nPregnancy: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nLactose: this medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric patients: irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but the \ncurrent data are insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become \navailable (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the \nhypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan BMS has been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide \ndiuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of \nhypotension when initiating therapy with Irbesartan BMS (see section 4.4). \n \nPotassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and \nis, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \nrecommended. \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of \nirbesartan. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 35\n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nLactation: \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan BMS during breast-feeding, \nIrbesartan BMS is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles \nduring breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on its \npharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect this ability. When driving vehicles or \noperating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness or weariness may occur during \ntreatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did \nnot differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation due to any \nclinical or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for \nplacebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the \nrecommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. \n \nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic \ndizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon) but in \nexcess of placebo. \n \nThe following table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials \nin which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the \nadverse reactions that were additionally reported in > 2% of diabetic hypertensive patients with \nchronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria and in excess of placebo. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 36\n\nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100, < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000, < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000, \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInvestigations: \nVery common: Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan than \n\nwith placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal \nrenal function, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the \nirbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic \nhypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria, \nhyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group \nand 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. \n\nCommon: significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in \nirbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable \nclinical musculoskeletal events. \n\n  In 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with \nirbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been \nobserved. \n\n \nCardiac disorders: \nUncommon: tachycardia \n \nNervous system disorders: \nCommon: dizziness, orthostatic dizziness* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \nUncommon: cough \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:  \nCommon: musculoskeletal pain* \n \nVascular disorders: \nCommon: orthostatic hypotension* \nUncommon: flushing \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nCommon: fatigue \nUncommon: chest pain \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders: \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction \n \nThe following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post\u2013marketing \nexperience; they are derived from spontaneous reports and therefore, the frequency of these \nadverse reactions is not known: \n \nNervous system disorders: \nHeadache \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders: \nTinnitus  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 37\n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \nDysgeusia \n \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nImpaired renal function including cases of renal failure in patients at risk (see section 4.4) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nLeukocytoclastic vasculitis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nArthralgia, myalgia (in some cases associated with increased plasma creatine kinase levels), muscle \ncramps \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nHyperkalaemia \n \nImmune system disorders: \nHypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, rash, urticaria \n \nHepato-biliary disorders: \nHepatitis, abnormal liver function \n \nPaediatric patients: in a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to \n16 years, the following related adverse events occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache \n(7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), dizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label period of this \ntrial the most frequent laboratory abnormalities observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and \nelevated CK values in 2% of child recipients. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most \nlikely manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might \nalso occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with \nIrbesartan BMS. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated \ncharcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin-II antagonists, plain. \nATC code: C09C A04. \n \nMechanism of action: Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) \nantagonist. It is expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, \nregardless of the source or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the \nangiotensin-II (AT1) receptors results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and \na decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected \nby irbesartan alone at the recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an \nenzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. \nIrbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its activity. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 38\n\nClinical efficacy: \n \nHypertension \nIrbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is \ndose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of \n150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing) by \nan average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo. \nPeak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood \npressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood \npressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended \ndoses. Once daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar to twice \ndaily dosing on the same total dose. \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Irbesartan BMS is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal \neffect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are maintained during \nlong term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns toward baseline. \nRebound hypertension has not been observed. \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In patients \nnot adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide \n(12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at \ntrough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). \nThe efficacy of Irbesartan BMS is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably less \nresponse to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low dose \nof hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients approaches \nthat of white patients. \nThere is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion. \n \nReduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low), 1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high) target \ntitrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of \nhypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the \nthree weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable, trough seated systolic \nblood pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium dose), 13.2 mmHg (high \ndose). No significant difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough \nseated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium \ndose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized \nto either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg \nin SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of \nirbesartan (see section 4.2). \n \nHypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease \nThe \u201cIrbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)\u201d shows that irbesartan decreases the progression \nof renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double \nblind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing Irbesartan BMS, amlodipine and placebo. In \n1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria \u2265 900 mg/day and serum creatinine \nranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan BMS on the \nprogression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg \nto a maintenance dose of 300 mg Irbesartan BMS, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine, or placebo as \ntolerated. Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents \n(e.g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of \n\u2264 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg. Sixty per \ncent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was \n76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced \nthe relative risk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal \ndisease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality. Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached \nthe primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine \ngroups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction \ncompared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 39\n\nanalysed, no effect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in \nESRD and a significant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed. \n \nSubgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum \ncreatinine, and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black \nsubgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall study population respectively, a renal \nbenefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary \nendpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups \nin the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a \ndecreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo-\nbased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the \nirbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart \nfailure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in \nwomen has been identified. \n \nThe study of the \u201cEffects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 \nDiabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)\u201d shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in \npatients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double blind morbidity study in \n590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function \n(serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl in males and < 1.1 mg/dl in females). The study examined the long-term \neffects (2 years) of Irbesartan BMS on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria (urinary albumin \nexcretion rate (UAER) > 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from baseline). The \npredefined blood pressure goal was \u2264 135/85 mmHg. Additional antihypertensive agents (excluding \nACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium blockers) were added \nas needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal. While similar blood pressure was achieved in all \ntreatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or \nin the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% \nrelative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An accompanying \nimprovement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first three months of \ntreatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early as three months \nand continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day) was more \nfrequent in the Irbesartan BMS 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of \napproximately 60-80%. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability of \nirbesartan. Plasma protein binding is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution is 53 - 93 litres. Following oral or intravenous administration \nof 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma radioactivity is attributable to unchanged \nirbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major \ncirculating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide (approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that \nirbesartan is primarily oxidised by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has \nnegligible effect. \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal \nrecommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations \nare attained at 1.5 - 2 hours after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are \n157 - 176 and 3 - 3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is \n11 - 15 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a \nonce-daily dosing regimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon \nrepeated once-daily dosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were \nobserved in female hypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and \naccumulation of irbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and \nCmax values were also somewhat greater in elderly subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 40\n\n(18 - 40 years). However the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is \nnecessary in elderly patients. \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children after the administration \nof single and multiple daily doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg for \nfour weeks. Of those 23 children, 21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults \n(twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that Cmax, AUC \nand clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan \ndaily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily \ndosing. \n \nRenal impairment: in patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the \npharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by \nhaemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment: in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nirbesartan are not significantly altered.  \nStudies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ \nhypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIrbesartan BMS 150 mg film-coated tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg of irbesartan. \n \nExcipient: 51.00 mg of lactose monohydrate per film-coated tablet. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \nWhite to off-white, biconvex, and oval-shaped with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2872 \nengraved on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nTreatment of renal disease in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of an \nantihypertensive medicinal product regimen (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily, with or without food. \nIrbesartan BMS at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure \ncontrol than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in \nhaemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. \n \nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan BMS can be \nincreased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive agents can be added. In particular, the addition of a \ndiuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive effect with Irbesartan BMS \n(see section 4.5). \n \nIn hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily \nand titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. \nThe demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan BMS in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based \non studies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach \ntarget blood pressure (see section 5.1). \n \nRenal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower \nstarting dose (75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly patients: although consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients \nover 75 years of age, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary for the elderly. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 44\n\nPaediatric patients: irbesartan is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to \ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in \npatients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, \ndiarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan \nBMS. \n \nRenovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency \nwhen patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney \nare treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is \nnot documented with Irbesartan BMS, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan BMS is used in patients with impaired \nrenal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There \nis no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan BMS in patients with a recent kidney \ntransplantation. \n \nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and \ncardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study \nwith patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and \nnon-white subjects (see section 5.1). \n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, \nhyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Irbesartan BMS, especially in the presence of \nrenal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring \nof serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan BMS is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan BMS is not recommended. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive \nagent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic \ncardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see \nsection 5.1). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 45\n\n \nPregnancy: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nLactose: this medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric patients: irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but the \ncurrent data are insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become \navailable (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the \nhypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan BMS has been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide \ndiuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of \nhypotension when initiating therapy with Irbesartan BMS (see section 4.4). \n \nPotassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and \nis, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \nrecommended. \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of \nirbesartan. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 46\n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nLactation: \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan BMS during breast-feeding, \nIrbesartan BMS is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles \nduring breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on its \npharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect this ability. When driving vehicles or \noperating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness or weariness may occur during \ntreatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did \nnot differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation due to any \nclinical or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for \nplacebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the \nrecommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. \n \nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic \ndizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon) but in \nexcess of placebo. \n \nThe following table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials \nin which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the \nadverse reactions that were additionally reported in > 2% of diabetic hypertensive patients with \nchronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria and in excess of placebo. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 47\n\nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100, < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000, < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000, \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInvestigations: \nVery common: Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan than \n\nwith placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal \nrenal function, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the \nirbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic \nhypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria, \nhyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group \nand 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. \n\nCommon: significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in \nirbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable \nclinical musculoskeletal events. \n\n  In 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with \nirbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been \nobserved. \n\n \nCardiac disorders: \nUncommon: tachycardia \n \nNervous system disorders: \nCommon: dizziness, orthostatic dizziness* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \nUncommon: cough \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:  \nCommon: musculoskeletal pain* \n \nVascular disorders: \nCommon: orthostatic hypotension* \nUncommon: flushing \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nCommon: fatigue \nUncommon: chest pain \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders: \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction \n \nThe following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post\u2013marketing \nexperience; they are derived from spontaneous reports and therefore, the frequency of these \nadverse reactions is not known: \n \nNervous system disorders: \nHeadache \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders: \nTinnitus  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 48\n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \nDysgeusia \n \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nImpaired renal function including cases of renal failure in patients at risk (see section 4.4) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nLeukocytoclastic vasculitis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nArthralgia, myalgia (in some cases associated with increased plasma creatine kinase levels), muscle \ncramps \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nHyperkalaemia \n \nImmune system disorders: \nHypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, rash, urticaria \n \nHepato-biliary disorders: \nHepatitis, abnormal liver function \n \nPaediatric patients: in a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to \n16 years, the following related adverse events occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache \n(7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), dizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label period of this \ntrial the most frequent laboratory abnormalities observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and \nelevated CK values in 2% of child recipients. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most \nlikely manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might \nalso occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with \nIrbesartan BMS. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated \ncharcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin-II antagonists, plain. \nATC code: C09C A04. \n \nMechanism of action: Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) \nantagonist. It is expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, \nregardless of the source or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the \nangiotensin-II (AT1) receptors results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and \na decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected \nby irbesartan alone at the recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an \nenzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. \nIrbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its activity. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 49\n\nClinical efficacy: \n \nHypertension \nIrbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is \ndose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of \n150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing) by \nan average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo. \nPeak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood \npressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood \npressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended \ndoses. Once daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar to twice \ndaily dosing on the same total dose. \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Irbesartan BMS is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal \neffect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are maintained during \nlong term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns toward baseline. \nRebound hypertension has not been observed. \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In patients \nnot adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide \n(12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at \ntrough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). \nThe efficacy of Irbesartan BMS is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably less \nresponse to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low dose \nof hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients approaches \nthat of white patients. \nThere is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion. \n \nReduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low), 1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high) target \ntitrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of \nhypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the \nthree weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable, trough seated systolic \nblood pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium dose), 13.2 mmHg (high \ndose). No significant difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough \nseated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium \ndose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized \nto either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg \nin SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of \nirbesartan (see section 4.2). \n \nHypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease \nThe \u201cIrbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)\u201d shows that irbesartan decreases the progression \nof renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double \nblind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing Irbesartan BMS, amlodipine and placebo. In \n1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria \u2265 900 mg/day and serum creatinine \nranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan BMS on the \nprogression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg \nto a maintenance dose of 300 mg Irbesartan BMS, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine, or placebo as \ntolerated. Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents \n(e.g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of \n\u2264 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg. Sixty per \ncent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was \n76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced \nthe relative risk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal \ndisease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality. Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached \nthe primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine \ngroups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction \ncompared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 50\n\nanalysed, no effect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in \nESRD and a significant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed. \n \nSubgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum \ncreatinine, and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black \nsubgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall study population respectively, a renal \nbenefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary \nendpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups \nin the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a \ndecreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo-\nbased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the \nirbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart \nfailure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in \nwomen has been identified. \n \nThe study of the \u201cEffects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 \nDiabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)\u201d shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in \npatients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double blind morbidity study in \n590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function \n(serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl in males and < 1.1 mg/dl in females). The study examined the long-term \neffects (2 years) of Irbesartan BMS on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria (urinary albumin \nexcretion rate (UAER) > 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from baseline). The \npredefined blood pressure goal was \u2264 135/85 mmHg. Additional antihypertensive agents (excluding \nACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium blockers) were added \nas needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal. While similar blood pressure was achieved in all \ntreatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or \nin the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% \nrelative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An accompanying \nimprovement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first three months of \ntreatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early as three months \nand continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day) was more \nfrequent in the Irbesartan BMS 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of \napproximately 60-80%. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability of \nirbesartan. Plasma protein binding is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution is 53 - 93 litres. Following oral or intravenous administration \nof 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma radioactivity is attributable to unchanged \nirbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major \ncirculating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide (approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that \nirbesartan is primarily oxidised by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has \nnegligible effect. \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal \nrecommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations \nare attained at 1.5 - 2 hours after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are \n157 - 176 and 3 - 3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is \n11 - 15 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a \nonce-daily dosing regimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon \nrepeated once-daily dosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were \nobserved in female hypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and \naccumulation of irbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and \nCmax values were also somewhat greater in elderly subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 51\n\n(18 - 40 years). However the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is \nnecessary in elderly patients. \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children after the administration \nof single and multiple daily doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg for \nfour weeks. Of those 23 children, 21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults \n(twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that Cmax, AUC \nand clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan \ndaily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily \ndosing. \n \nRenal impairment: in patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the \npharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by \nhaemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment: in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nirbesartan are not significantly altered.  \nStudies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ \nhypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \nWhite to off-white, biconvex, and oval-shaped with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2873 \nengraved on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nTreatment of renal disease in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of an \nantihypertensive medicinal product regimen (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily, with or without food. \nIrbesartan BMS at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure \ncontrol than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in \nhaemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. \n \nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan BMS can be \nincreased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive agents can be added. In particular, the addition of a \ndiuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive effect with Irbesartan BMS \n(see section 4.5). \n \nIn hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily \nand titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. \nThe demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan BMS in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based \non studies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach \ntarget blood pressure (see section 5.1). \n \nRenal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower \nstarting dose (75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly patients: although consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients \nover 75 years of age, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary for the elderly. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 55\n\nPaediatric patients: irbesartan is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to \ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in \npatients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, \ndiarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan \nBMS. \n \nRenovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency \nwhen patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney \nare treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is \nnot documented with Irbesartan BMS, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan BMS is used in patients with impaired \nrenal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There \nis no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan BMS in patients with a recent kidney \ntransplantation. \n \nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and \ncardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study \nwith patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and \nnon-white subjects (see section 5.1). \n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, \nhyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Irbesartan BMS, especially in the presence of \nrenal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring \nof serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan BMS is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan BMS is not recommended. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive \nagent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic \ncardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see \nsection 5.1). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 56\n\n \nPregnancy: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nLactose: this medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric patients: irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but the \ncurrent data are insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become \navailable (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the \nhypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan BMS has been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide \ndiuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of \nhypotension when initiating therapy with Irbesartan BMS (see section 4.4). \n \nPotassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and \nis, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \nrecommended. \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of \nirbesartan. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 57\n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nLactation: \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan BMS during breast-feeding, \nIrbesartan BMS is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles \nduring breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on its \npharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect this ability. When driving vehicles or \noperating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness or weariness may occur during \ntreatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did \nnot differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation due to any \nclinical or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for \nplacebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the \nrecommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. \n \nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic \ndizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon) but in \nexcess of placebo. \n \nThe following table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials \nin which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the \nadverse reactions that were additionally reported in > 2% of diabetic hypertensive patients with \nchronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria and in excess of placebo. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 58\n\nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100, < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000, < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000, \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInvestigations: \nVery common: Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan than \n\nwith placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal \nrenal function, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the \nirbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic \nhypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria, \nhyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group \nand 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. \n\nCommon: significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in \nirbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable \nclinical musculoskeletal events. \n\n  In 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with \nirbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been \nobserved. \n\n \nCardiac disorders: \nUncommon: tachycardia \n \nNervous system disorders: \nCommon: dizziness, orthostatic dizziness* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \nUncommon: cough \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:  \nCommon: musculoskeletal pain* \n \nVascular disorders: \nCommon: orthostatic hypotension* \nUncommon: flushing \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nCommon: fatigue \nUncommon: chest pain \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders: \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction \n \nThe following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post\u2013marketing \nexperience; they are derived from spontaneous reports and therefore, the frequency of these \nadverse reactions is not known: \n \nNervous system disorders: \nHeadache \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders: \nTinnitus  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 59\n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \nDysgeusia \n \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nImpaired renal function including cases of renal failure in patients at risk (see section 4.4) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nLeukocytoclastic vasculitis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nArthralgia, myalgia (in some cases associated with increased plasma creatine kinase levels), muscle \ncramps \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nHyperkalaemia \n \nImmune system disorders: \nHypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, rash, urticaria \n \nHepato-biliary disorders: \nHepatitis, abnormal liver function \n \nPaediatric patients: in a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to \n16 years, the following related adverse events occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache \n(7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), dizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label period of this \ntrial the most frequent laboratory abnormalities observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and \nelevated CK values in 2% of child recipients. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most \nlikely manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might \nalso occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with \nIrbesartan BMS. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated \ncharcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin-II antagonists, plain. \nATC code: C09C A04. \n \nMechanism of action: Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) \nantagonist. It is expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, \nregardless of the source or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the \nangiotensin-II (AT1) receptors results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and \na decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected \nby irbesartan alone at the recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an \nenzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. \nIrbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its activity. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 60\n\nClinical efficacy: \n \nHypertension \nIrbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is \ndose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of \n150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing) by \nan average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo. \nPeak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood \npressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood \npressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended \ndoses. Once daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar to twice \ndaily dosing on the same total dose. \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Irbesartan BMS is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal \neffect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are maintained during \nlong term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns toward baseline. \nRebound hypertension has not been observed. \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In patients \nnot adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide \n(12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at \ntrough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). \nThe efficacy of Irbesartan BMS is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably less \nresponse to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low dose \nof hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients approaches \nthat of white patients. \nThere is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion. \n \nReduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low), 1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high) target \ntitrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of \nhypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the \nthree weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable, trough seated systolic \nblood pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium dose), 13.2 mmHg (high \ndose). No significant difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough \nseated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium \ndose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized \nto either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg \nin SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of \nirbesartan (see section 4.2). \n \nHypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease \nThe \u201cIrbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)\u201d shows that irbesartan decreases the progression \nof renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double \nblind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing Irbesartan BMS, amlodipine and placebo. In \n1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria \u2265 900 mg/day and serum creatinine \nranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan BMS on the \nprogression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg \nto a maintenance dose of 300 mg Irbesartan BMS, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine, or placebo as \ntolerated. Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents \n(e.g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of \n\u2264 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg. Sixty per \ncent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was \n76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced \nthe relative risk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal \ndisease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality. Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached \nthe primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine \ngroups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction \ncompared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 61\n\nanalysed, no effect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in \nESRD and a significant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed. \n \nSubgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum \ncreatinine, and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black \nsubgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall study population respectively, a renal \nbenefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary \nendpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups \nin the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a \ndecreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo-\nbased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the \nirbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart \nfailure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in \nwomen has been identified. \n \nThe study of the \u201cEffects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 \nDiabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)\u201d shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in \npatients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double blind morbidity study in \n590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function \n(serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl in males and < 1.1 mg/dl in females). The study examined the long-term \neffects (2 years) of Irbesartan BMS on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria (urinary albumin \nexcretion rate (UAER) > 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from baseline). The \npredefined blood pressure goal was \u2264 135/85 mmHg. Additional antihypertensive agents (excluding \nACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium blockers) were added \nas needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal. While similar blood pressure was achieved in all \ntreatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or \nin the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% \nrelative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An accompanying \nimprovement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first three months of \ntreatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early as three months \nand continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day) was more \nfrequent in the Irbesartan BMS 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of \napproximately 60-80%. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability of \nirbesartan. Plasma protein binding is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution is 53 - 93 litres. Following oral or intravenous administration \nof 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma radioactivity is attributable to unchanged \nirbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major \ncirculating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide (approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that \nirbesartan is primarily oxidised by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has \nnegligible effect. \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal \nrecommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations \nare attained at 1.5 - 2 hours after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are \n157 - 176 and 3 - 3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is \n11 - 15 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a \nonce-daily dosing regimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon \nrepeated once-daily dosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were \nobserved in female hypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and \naccumulation of irbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and \nCmax values were also somewhat greater in elderly subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 62\n\n(18 - 40 years). However the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is \nnecessary in elderly patients. \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children after the administration \nof single and multiple daily doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg for \nfour weeks. Of those 23 children, 21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults \n(twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that Cmax, AUC \nand clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan \ndaily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily \ndosing. \n \nRenal impairment: in patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the \npharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by \nhaemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment: in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nirbesartan are not significantly altered.  \nStudies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ \nhypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \n \n6.

Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT IRBESARTAN BMS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nIrbesartan BMS belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan BMS prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nIrbesartan BMS slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and type 2 \ndiabetes. \n \nIrbesartan BMS is used \n to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) \n to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory \n\nevidence of impaired kidney function. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE IRBESARTAN BMS \n \nDo not take Irbesartan BMS \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to irbesartan or any other ingredients of Irbesartan BMS \n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan BMS in early \n\npregnancy \u2013 see pregnancy section) \n \nIrbesartan BMS should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years). \n \nTake special care with Irbesartan BMS \nTell your doctor if any of the following apply to you: \n if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n if you suffer from kidney problems \n if you suffer from heart problems \n if you receive Irbesartan BMS for diabetic kidney disease. In this case your doctor may \n\nperform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor \nkidney function \n\n if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant.

Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT IRBESARTAN BMS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nIrbesartan BMS belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan BMS prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nIrbesartan BMS slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and type 2 \ndiabetes. \n \nIrbesartan BMS is used \n to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) \n to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory \n\nevidence of impaired kidney function. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE IRBESARTAN BMS \n \nDo not take Irbesartan BMS \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to irbesartan or any other ingredients of Irbesartan BMS \n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan BMS in early \n\npregnancy \u2013 see pregnancy section) \n \nIrbesartan BMS should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years). \n \nTake special care with Irbesartan BMS \nTell your doctor if any of the following apply to you: \n if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n if you suffer from kidney problems \n if you suffer from heart problems \n if you receive Irbesartan BMS for diabetic kidney disease. In this case your doctor may \n\nperform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor \nkidney function \n\n if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan BMS is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 95\n\n \nUsing other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nIrbesartan BMS does not usually interact with other medicines. \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n potassium supplements \n salt substitutes containing potassium \n potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) \n medicines containing lithium \n\n \nIf you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan \nmay be reduced. \n \nTaking Irbesartan BMS with food and drink \nIrbesartan BMS can be taken with or without food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant.

Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT IRBESARTAN BMS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nIrbesartan BMS belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan BMS prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nIrbesartan BMS slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and type 2 \ndiabetes. \n \nIrbesartan BMS is used \n to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) \n to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory \n\nevidence of impaired kidney function. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE IRBESARTAN BMS \n \nDo not take Irbesartan BMS \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to irbesartan or any other ingredients of Irbesartan BMS \n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan BMS in early \n\npregnancy \u2013 see pregnancy section) \n \nIrbesartan BMS should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years). \n \nTake special care with Irbesartan BMS \nTell your doctor if any of the following apply to you: \n if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n if you suffer from kidney problems \n if you suffer from heart problems \n if you receive Irbesartan BMS for diabetic kidney disease. In this case your doctor may \n\nperform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor \nkidney function \n\n if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan BMS is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 102\n\n \nUsing other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nIrbesartan BMS does not usually interact with other medicines. \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n potassium supplements \n salt substitutes containing potassium \n potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) \n medicines containing lithium \n\n \nIf you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan \nmay be reduced. \n \nTaking Irbesartan BMS with food and drink \nIrbesartan BMS can be taken with or without food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Irbesartan BMS before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Irbesartan BMS. Irbesartan BMS is \nnot recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding.

Irbesartan \nBMS is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, occasionally dizziness or \nweariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure.

Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT IRBESARTAN BMS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nIrbesartan BMS belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan BMS prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nIrbesartan BMS slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and type 2 \ndiabetes. \n \nIrbesartan BMS is used \n to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) \n to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory \n\nevidence of impaired kidney function. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE IRBESARTAN BMS \n \nDo not take Irbesartan BMS \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to irbesartan or any other ingredients of Irbesartan BMS \n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan BMS in early \n\npregnancy \u2013 see pregnancy section) \n \nIrbesartan BMS should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years). \n \nTake special care with Irbesartan BMS \nTell your doctor if any of the following apply to you: \n if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n if you suffer from kidney problems \n if you suffer from heart problems \n if you receive Irbesartan BMS for diabetic kidney disease.

Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT IRBESARTAN BMS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nIrbesartan BMS belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan BMS prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nIrbesartan BMS slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and type 2 \ndiabetes. \n \nIrbesartan BMS is used \n to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) \n to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory \n\nevidence of impaired kidney function. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE IRBESARTAN BMS \n \nDo not take Irbesartan BMS \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to irbesartan or any other ingredients of Irbesartan BMS \n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan BMS in early \n\npregnancy \u2013 see pregnancy section) \n \nIrbesartan BMS should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years). \n \nTake special care with Irbesartan BMS \nTell your doctor if any of the following apply to you: \n if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n if you suffer from kidney problems \n if you suffer from heart problems \n if you receive Irbesartan BMS for diabetic kidney disease. In this case your doctor may \n\nperform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor \nkidney function \n\n if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan BMS is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 123\n\n \nUsing other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nIrbesartan BMS does not usually interact with other medicines. \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n potassium supplements \n salt substitutes containing potassium \n potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) \n medicines containing lithium \n\n \nIf you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan \nmay be reduced. \n \nTaking Irbesartan BMS with food and drink \nIrbesartan BMS can be taken with or without food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Irbesartan BMS before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Irbesartan BMS. Irbesartan BMS is \nnot recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Irbesartan BMS is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \nyou if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Irbesartan \nBMS is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, occasionally dizziness or \nweariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you experience these, talk to your \ndoctor before attempting to drive or use machines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Irbesartan BMS \nIrbesartan BMS contains lactose.
