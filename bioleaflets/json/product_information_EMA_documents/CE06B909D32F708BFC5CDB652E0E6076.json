NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nCetrotide 0.25 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach vial contains 0.25 mg cetrorelix (as acetate).\nAfter reconstitution with the solvent provided, each mL of the solution contains 0.25 mg cetrorelix. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder and solvent for solution for injection.\n\nAppearance of the powder: white lyophilisate\nAppearance of the solvent: clear and colourless solution\n\nThe pH of the reconstituted solution is 4.0-6.0.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPrevention of premature ovulation in patients undergoing a controlled ovarian stimulation, followed \nby oocyte pick-up and assisted reproductive techniques.\n\nIn clinical trials Cetrotide was used with human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG), however, limited \nexperience with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) suggested similar efficacy.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nCetrotide should only be prescribed by a specialist experienced in this field.\n\nPosology\nThe first administration of Cetrotide should be performed under the supervision of a physician and \nunder conditions where treatment of possible allergic/pseudo-allergic reactions (including \nlife-threatening anaphylaxis) is immediately available. The following injections may be \nself-administered as long as the patient is made aware of the signs and symptoms that may indicate \nhypersensitivity, the consequences of such a reaction and the need for immediate medical intervention. \n\nThe contents of 1 vial (0.25 mg cetrorelix) are to be administered once daily, at 24 h intervals, either in \nthe morning or in the evening. Following the first administration, it is advised that the patient be kept \nunder medical supervision for 30 minutes to ensure there is no allergic/pseudo-allergic reaction to the \ninjection. \n\nElderly\nThere is no relevant use of Cetrotide in the geriatric population.\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of Cetrotide in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\nCetrotide is for subcutaneous injection into the lower abdominal wall. \n\n\n\n3\n\nThe injection site reactions may be minimised by rotating the injection sites, delaying injection at the \nsame site and injecting the medicinal product in a slow rate to facilitate the progressive absorption of \nthe medicinal product.\n\nAdministration in the morning\nTreatment with Cetrotide should commence on day 5 or 6 of ovarian stimulation (approximately 96 to \n120 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or recombinant gonadotropins and is to be \ncontinued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period including the day of ovulation induction.\nThe starting day of Cetrotide is depending on the ovarian response, i.e. the number and size of \ngrowing follicles and/or the amount of circulating oestradiol. The start of Cetrotide may be delayed in \nabsence of follicular growth, although clinical experience is based on starting Cetrotide on day 5 or \nday 6 of stimulation.\n\nAdministration in the evening\nTreatment with Cetrotide should commence on day 5 of ovarian stimulation (approximately 96 to \n108 hours after start of ovarian stimulation) with urinary or recombinant gonadotropins and is to be \ncontinued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period until the evening prior to the day of ovulation \ninduction.\nThe starting day of Cetrotide is depending on the ovarian response, i.e. the number and size of\ngrowing follicles and/or the amount of circulating oestradiol. The start of Cetrotide may be delayed in \nabsence of follicular growth, although clinical experience is based on starting Cetrotide on day 5 or \nday 6 of stimulation.\n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nCetrorelix is not to be used in the presence of any of the conditions listed below:\nï‚· Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any structural analogues of gonadotropin-releasing \n\nhormone (GnRH), extrinsic peptide hormones or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nï‚· During pregnancy and lactation.\nï‚· Patients with severe renal impairment.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAllergic conditions\nCases of allergic/pseudoallergic reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis with the first dose \nhave been reported (see section 4.8).\n\nSpecial care should be taken in women with signs and symptoms of active allergic conditions or \nknown history of allergic predisposition. Treatment with Cetrotide is not advised in women with \nsevere allergic conditions.\n\nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)\nDuring or following ovarian stimulation an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can occur. This event \nmust be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure with gonadotropins\n\nAn OHSS should be treated symptomatically, e.g. with rest, intravenous electrolytes/colloids and \nheparin therapy.\n\nLuteal phase support should be given according to the reproductive medical centreÂ´s practice.\n\nRepeated ovarian stimulation procedure \nThere is limited experience up to now with the administration of cetrorelix during a repeated ovarian \nstimulation procedure. Therefore, cetrorelix should be used in repeated cycles only after a careful \nbenefit/risk evaluation.\n\n\n\n4\n\nCongenital anomalies\nThe prevalence of congenital anomalies after the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) with \nor without GnRH antagonists may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions although it is \nunclear whether this is related to factors inherent to the couple's infertility or the ART procedures. \nLimited data from clinical follow-up studies in 316 newborns of women administered cetrorelix for \ninfertility treatments suggest that cetrorelix does not increase the risk of congenital anomalies in the \noffsprings.\n\nHepatic impairment\nCetrorelix has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and caution is therefore warranted.\n\nRenal impairment\nCetrorelix has not been studied in patients with renal impairment and caution is therefore warranted. \nCetrorelix is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.3).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with cetrorelix. In vitro investigations \nhave shown that interactions are unlikely with medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochrome \nP450 or glucuronised or conjugated in some other way. However, the possibility of interactions with\ngonadotropins or medicinal products that may induce histamine release in susceptible individuals, \ncannot be totally excluded.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nCetrotide is not intended to be used during pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.3).\n\nFertility\nStudies in animals have indicated that cetrorelix exerts a dose related influence on fertility, \nreproductive performance and pregnancy. No teratogenic effects occurred when the medicinal product \nwas administered during the sensitive phase of gestation.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nCetrotide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are local injection site reactions such as erythema, \nswelling and pruritus that are usually transient in nature and mild in intensity. In clinical trials, these \neffects were observed with a frequency of 9.4% following multiple injections of Cetrotide 0.25 mg.\n\nMild to moderate OHSS (WHO grade I or II) have been commonly reported and should be considered \nas an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Inversely, severe OHSS remains uncommon.\n\nUncommonly, cases of hypersensitivity reactions including pseudo-allergic/anaphylactoid reactions \nhave been reported.\n\nList of adverse reactions\nThe adverse reactions reported below are classified according to frequency of occurrence as follows: \nvery common (â‰¥1/10), common (â‰¥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (â‰¥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (â‰¥1/10,000 \nto <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000).\n\n\n\n5\n\nImmune system disorders\nUncommon: Systemic allergic/pseudo-allergic reactions including life-threatening anaphylaxis.\n\nNervous system disorders\nUncommon: Headache\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nUncommon: Nausea\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nCommon: Mild to moderate OHSS (WHO grade I or II) can occur which is an intrinsic risk of \n\nthe stimulation procedure (see section 4.4).\nUncommon: Severe OHSS (WHO grade III)\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon: Local reactions at the injection site (e.g. erythema, swelling and pruritus).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nOverdosage in humans may result in a prolonged duration of action but is unlikely to be associated \nwith acute toxic effects.\n\nIn acute toxicity studies in rodents non-specific toxic symptoms were observed after intraperitoneal \nadministration of cetrorelix doses more than 200 times higher than the pharmacologically effective \ndose after subcutaneous administration.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: anti-gonadotropin-releasing hormones, ATC code: H01CC02.\n\nMechanism of action\nCetrorelix is a luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonist. LHRH binds to membrane \nreceptors on pituitary cells. Cetrorelix competes with the binding of endogenous LHRH to these \nreceptors. Due to this mode of action, cetrorelix controls the secretion of gonadotropins (LH and \nFSH).\n\nCetrorelix dose-dependently inhibits the secretion of LH and FSH from the pituitary gland. The onset \nof suppression is virtually immediate and is maintained by continuous treatment, without initial \nstimulatory effect.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nIn females, cetrorelix delays the LH surge and consequently ovulation. In women undergoing ovarian \nstimulation the duration of action of cetrorelix is dose dependent. At a dose of 0.25 mg per injection \nrepeated injections every 24 hours will maintain the effect of cetrorelix.\n\nIn animals as well as in humans, the antagonistic hormonal effects of cetrorelix were fully reversible \nafter termination of treatment.\n\n\n\n6\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nThe absolute bioavailability of cetrorelix after subcutaneous administration is about 85%.\n\nDistribution\nThe volume of distribution (Vd) is 1.1 L x kg-1.\n\nElimination\nThe total plasma clearance and the renal clearance are 1.2 mL x min-1 x kg-1 and 0.1 mL x min-1 x kg-1, \nrespectively. \nThe mean terminal half-lives following intravenous and subcutaneous administration are about 12 h \nand 30 h, respectively, demonstrating the effect of absorption processes at the injection site. \n\nLinearity\nThe subcutaneous administration of single doses (0.25 mg to 3 mg cetrorelix) and also daily dosing \nover 14 days show linear kinetics.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.\n\nNo target organ toxicity could be observed from acute, subacute and chronic toxicity studies in rats \nand dogs following subcutaneous administration of cetrorelix. No signs of medicinal product-related \nlocal irritation or incompatibility were noted in dogs after intravenous, intraarterial and paravenous \ninjection when cetrorelix was administered in doses clearly above the intended clinical use in man.\n\nCetrorelix showed no mutagenic or clastogenic potential in gene and chromosome mutation assays.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Cetrotide is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Cetrotide\n3. How to use Cetrotide\n4. Possible side effects\n5 How to store Cetrotide\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\nHow to mix and inject Cetrotide\n\n1. What Cetrotide is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Cetrotide is\nCetrotide contains a medicine called â€˜cetrorelixâ€™. This medicine stops your body from releasing an egg \nfrom your ovary (ovulation) during your menstrual cycle. Cetrotide belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled â€˜anti-gonadotropin-releasing hormonesâ€™.\n\nWhat Cetrotide is used for\nCetrotide is one of the medicines used during â€˜assisted reproductive techniquesâ€™ to help you get \npregnant. It stops eggs being released straight away. This is because if the eggs are released too early \n(premature ovulation) it may not be possible for your doctor to collect them.\n\nHow Cetrotide works\nCetrotide blocks a natural hormone in your body called LHRH (â€˜luteinising hormone releasing \nhormoneâ€™).\nï‚· LHRH controls another hormone, called LH (â€˜luteinising hormoneâ€™).\nï‚· LH stimulates ovulation during your menstrual cycle. \n\nThis means that Cetrotide stops the chain of events that leads to an egg being released from your \novary. When your eggs are ready to be collected, another medicine will be given to you that will \nrelease them (ovulation induction).\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Cetrotide\n\nDo not use Cetrotide\nï‚· if you are allergic to cetrorelix or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\nï‚· if you are allergic to medicines similar to Cetrotide (any other peptide hormones).\nï‚· if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\nï‚· if you have severe kidney disease.\n\n\n\n20\n\nDo not use Cetrotide if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \nusing this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nAllergies\nTell your doctor before using Cetrotide if you have an active allergy or have had allergies in the past.\n\nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)\nCetrotide is used together with other medicines that stimulate your ovaries to develop more eggs ready \nto be released. During or after you receive these medicines, you may develop OHSS. This is when \nyour follicles develop too much and become large cysts. \nFor possible signs to look out for and what to do if this happens see section 4 â€˜Possible side effectsâ€™.\n\nUsing Cetrotide during more than one cycle\nExperience of using Cetrotide during more than one cycle is small. Your doctor will carefully look at \nthe benefits and risks for you, if you need to have Cetrotide during more than one cycle.\n\nLiver disease\nTell your doctor before using Cetrotide if you have a liver disease. Cetrotide has not been investigated \nin patients with hepatic disease.\n\nKidney disease\nTell your doctor before using Cetrotide if you have a kidney disease. Cetrotide has not been \ninvestigated in patients with kidney disease.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nCetrotide is not indicated for the use in children and adolescents.\n\nOther medicines and Cetrotide\nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nDo not use Cetrotide if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding. \n\nDriving and using machines\nCetrotide is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines.\n\n3. How to use Cetrotide\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure.\n\nUsing this medicine\nThis medicine is only for injection just under the skin of your belly (subcutaneous). To reduce skin \nirritation, select a different part of your belly each day. \nï‚· Your doctor must supervise your first injection. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to \n\nprepare and inject the medicine.\nï‚· You can carry out the following injections yourself as long as your doctor has made you aware \n\nof the symptoms that may indicate allergy and of the possibly serious or life-threatening \nconsequences that would need immediate treatment (see section 4 â€˜Possible side effectsâ€™).\n\nï‚· Please carefully read and follow the instructions at the end of this leaflet called â€˜How to mix and \ninject Cetrotideâ€™.\n\nï‚· You start by using another medicine on day 1 of your treatment cycle. You then start using \nCetrotide a few days later. (See next section â€˜How much to useâ€™).\n\n\n\n21\n\nHow much to use\nInject the contents of one vial (0.25 mg Cetrotide) once each day. It is best to use the medicine at the \nsame time each day, leaving 24 hours between each dose.\n\nYou can choose to inject every morning or every evening.\nï‚· If you are injecting every morning: Start your injections on day 5 or 6 of the treatment cycle. \n\nBased on your ovarian response, your doctor may decide to start on another day. Your doctor \nwill tell you the exact date and time. You will keep using this medicine up until and including \nthe morning that your eggs are collected (ovulation induction).\n\nOR\n\nï‚· If you are injecting every evening: Start your injections on day 5 of the treatment cycle. Based \non your ovarian response, your doctor may decide to start on another day. Your doctor will tell \nyou the exact date and time. You will keep using this medicine up until and including the \nevening before your eggs are collected (ovulation induction).\n\nIf you use more Cetrotide than you should\nBad effects are not expected if you accidentally inject more of this medicine than you should. The \neffect of the medicine will last for longer. No specific measures are usually required.\n\nIf you forget to use Cetrotide\nï‚· If you forget a dose, inject it as soon as you remember and talk to your doctor. \nï‚· Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nAllergic reactions\n- Warm, red skin, itching (often in your groin or armpits), red, itchy, raised areas (hives), runny \n\nnose, fast or uneven pulse, swelling of your tongue and throat, sneezing, wheezing or serious \ndifficulty breathing, or dizziness. You may be having a possible serious, life-threatening allergic \nreaction to the medicine. This is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 women).\n\nIf you notice any of the side effects above, stop using Cetrotide and contact your doctor immediately.\n\nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)\nThis may occur due to the other medicines that you are using to stimulate your ovaries.\n- Lower abdominal pain together with feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) may be the \n\nsymptoms of OHSS. This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the treatment and that \nlarge ovarian cysts developed. This event is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 women).\n\n- The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, \nweight gain, difficulty breathing or fluid in your stomach or chest. This event is uncommon \n(may affect up to 1 in 100 women).\n\nIf you notice any of the side effects above, contact your doctor immediately.\n\nOther side effects\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 women):\nï‚· Mild and short-lasting skin irritation may occur at the injection site like redness, itching or \n\nswelling.\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 women):\nï‚· Feeling sick (nausea)\nï‚· Headache.\n\n\n\n22\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine.\n\n5.

This medicine must be at room temperature prior to injection. Remove from the \nrefrigerator approximately 30 minutes before use.\n\n2. Wash your hands \nï‚· It is important that your hands and the things you use are as clean as possible.\n\n3. Lay out everything you need on a clean surface:\nï‚· one vial of powder\nï‚· one pre-filled syringe with sterile water (solvent)\nï‚· one needle with a yellow mark â€“ for injecting the sterile water into the vial and drawing the \n\nmade-up medicine out from the vial\nï‚· one needle with a grey mark â€“ for injecting the medicine into your belly\nï‚· two alcohol swabs.\n\nMixing the powder and water to make up your medicine\n\n1. Remove the cap from the vial \nï‚· There will be a rubber stopper underneath â€“ keep this in the vial.\nï‚· Wipe the rubber stopper and metal ring with your first alcohol swab.\n\n2. Adding the water from the pre-filled syringe to the powder in the vial\nï‚· Unwrap the needle with the yellow mark on it. \nï‚· Remove the cap from the pre-filled syringe and screw the yellow needle onto it. Remove \n\nthe cap from the needle.\nï‚· Push the yellow needle through the centre of the rubber stopper of the vial. \nï‚· Slowly push in the plunger of the syringe to inject the water into the vial. Do not use any \n\nother sort of water.\nï‚· Leave the syringe in the rubber stopper.\n\n3. Mixing the powder and water in the vial\nï‚· While carefully holding the syringe and vial, swirl gently to mix the powder and water \n\ntogether. When it is mixed, it will look clear and have no particles in it. \nï‚· Do not shake or you will create bubbles in your medicine.\n\n4. Re-filling the syringe with the medicine from the vial\nï‚· Turn the vial upside down. Then, gently pull back the plunger, in order to draw the \n\nmedicine from the vial into the syringe. Take care not to pull out completely the plunger \n\n\n\n25\n\nwith the attached plunger stopper. In case you pulled out the plunger with the plunger \nstopper by mistake, make sure to discard the dose as sterility will be lost, and prepare a \nnew dose (and restart from step 1).\n\nï‚· If any medicine is left in the vial, pull out the yellow needle until the end of the needle is \njust inside the rubber stopper. If you look from the side through the gap in the rubber \nstopper, you can control the movement of the needle and the liquid. \n\nï‚· Make sure that you collect all of your medicine from the vial.\n\nï‚· Put the cap back on the yellow needle. Unscrew the yellow needle from the syringe and lay \ndown the syringe. \n\nPreparing the injection site and injecting your medicine\n\n1. Removing air bubbles\nï‚· Unwrap the needle with the grey mark on it. Screw the grey needle onto the syringe and \n\nremove the cap from the grey needle.\nï‚· Hold the syringe with the grey needle pointing upwards and check for any air bubbles. \nï‚· To remove air bubbles, gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top - then \n\nslowly push the plunger in until the air bubbles are gone.\nï‚· Do not touch the grey needle and do not let the needle touch any surface.\n\n2. Clean the injection site\nï‚· Choose an injection site on your belly. It is best around the belly button (navel). To \n\nreduce skin irritation, select a different part of your belly each day. \nï‚· Clean the skin at your chosen injection site with your second alcohol swab - use a circular \n\nmotion. \n\n3. Piercing your skin\nï‚· Hold the syringe in one hand â€“ like you would hold a pencil. \nï‚· Gently pinch up the skin around where you are going to inject and hold this firmly with \n\nyour other hand.\nï‚· Slowly push the grey needle completely into your skin at an angle of about 45 to \n\n90 degrees â€“ then let go of your skin.\n\n\n\n26\n\n4. Injecting your medicine\nï‚· Gently pull back the plunger of the syringe. If blood appears, follow Step 5 below.\nï‚· If no blood appears, slowly push the plunger in to inject your medicine. \nï‚· When the syringe is empty, take out the grey needle slowly at the same angle.\nï‚· Use your second alcohol swab to gently apply pressure where you have just injected. \n\n5. If blood appears:\nï‚· take out the grey needle slowly at the same angle\nï‚· use your second alcohol swab to gently apply pressure where you have just pierced your \n\nskin \nï‚· empty your medicine into a sink and follow Step 6 below\nï‚· wash your hands and start again with a new vial and pre-filled syringe.\n\n6. Disposal\nï‚· Use each needle, vial and syringe only once.\nï‚· Put the cap back on the needles so that they are safe to be thrown away.\nï‚· Ask your pharmacist how to safely dispose of used needles, vial and syringe.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA MANUFACTURER(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE\n\tC.
