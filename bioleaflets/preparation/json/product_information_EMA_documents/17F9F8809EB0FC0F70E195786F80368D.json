NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRefludan 20 mg powder for solution for injection or infusion \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach vial contains 20 mg lepirudin. \n\n \n\n(Lepirudin is a recombinant DNA product derived from yeast cells) \n\n \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder for solution for injection or infusion. \n\n \n\nWhite to almost white lyophilised powder. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nAnticoagulation in adult patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II and \n\nthromboembolic disease mandating parenteral antithrombotic therapy. \n\n \n\nThe diagnosis should be confirmed by the HIPAA (heparin induced platelet activation assay) or an \n\nequivalent test. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment with Refludan should be initiated under the guidance of a physician with experience in \n\ncoagulation disorders. \n\n \n\nInitial dosage \n\n \n\nAnticoagulation in adult patients with HIT type II and thromboembolic disease: \n\n \n\n– 0.4 mg / kg body weight intravenously as a bolus dose \n\n– followed by 0.15 mg / kg body weight / hour as a continuous intravenous infusion for 2 - 10 \n\ndays or longer if clinically needed. \n\n \n\nNormally, the dosage depends on the patient's body weight. This is valid up to a body weight of \n\n110 kg. In patients with a body weight exceeding 110 kg the dosage should not be increased beyond \n\nthe 110 kg body weight dose (see also tables 2 and 3, below). \n\n \n\nMonitoring and modification of the Refludan dosage regimen \n\n \n\nStandard recommendations \n\n \n\nMonitoring: \n\n– In general, the dosage (infusion rate) should be adjusted to the activated partial thromboplastin \n\ntime, aPTT. \n\n– The first aPTT determination should be done 4 hours after start of Refludan therapy. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\n– The aPTT should be monitored at least once daily. More frequent determinations may be \n\nnecessary, for example, in patients with renal impairment or with an increased risk of bleeding. \n\n– Target range (therapeutic window) for the aPTT: \n\n- Using \"Actin FS\" or \"Neothromtin\" on automated coagulometers the target range for the \n\naPTT is 1.5 fold to 3 fold prolongation of the normal control value. \n\n- With other reagents, the upper limit of the therapeutic aPTT window should be reduced to \n\n2.5 fold prolongation of the normal control value. \n\n- To obtain specific and exact aPTT limits, the laboratory equipment / test reagent used may \n\nbe calibrated by spiking standardised human plasma with 0.15 g/ml lepirudin (lower limit) \n\nand 1.5 g/ml lepirudin (upper limit). \n\n \n\nDose modifications: \n\n– Any aPTT value out of the target range is to be confirmed at once before drawing conclusions \n\nwith respect to dose modifications, unless there is a clinical need to react immediately. \n\n– If the confirmed aPTT value is above the target range, the infusion should be stopped for two \n\nhours. At restart, the infusion speed should be decreased by 50 % (no additional intravenous \n\nbolus should be administered). The aPTT should be determined again 4 hours later. \n\n– If the confirmed aPTT value is below the target range, the infusion speed should be increased \n\nby 20 %. The aPTT should be determined again 4 hours later. \n\n– In general, an infusion rate of 0.21 mg/kg/hour should not be exceeded without checking for \n\ncoagulation abnormalities which might be preventing an appropriate aPTT response. \n\n \n\nRecommendations for use in patients scheduled for a switch to oral anticoagulation \n\n \n\nIf a patient is scheduled to receive coumarin derivatives (vitamin K antagonists) for oral \n\nanticoagulation after Refludan therapy, the following should apply: Coumarin derivatives should be \n\ninitiated only when platelet counts are normalising. The intended maintenance dose should be started \n\nwith no loading dose. To avoid prothrombotic effects when initiating coumarin, continue parenteral \n\nanticoagulation for 4 to 5 days (see oral anticoagulant package insert for information). The parenteral \n\nagent can be discontinued when the International Normalised Ratio (INR) stabilises within the desired \n\ntarget range. \n\n \n\nRecommendations for use in patients with renal impairment \n\n \n\nAs lepirudin is almost exclusively excreted and metabolised renally (see also section 5.2), the \n\npatient’s renal function should be considered prior to administration. In case of renal impairment \n\nrelative overdose might occur even under standard dosage regimen. Therefore, the bolus dose and \n\ninfusion rate must be reduced in case of known or suspected renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance \n\nbelow 60 ml/min or creatinine value above 15 mg/l [133 mol/l]). \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, Refludan was not therapeutically administered to HIT type II patients with \n\nsignificant renal impairment. The following dosage recommendations are based on single-dose studies \n\nin a small number of patients with renal impairment. Therefore, these recommendations are only \n\ntentative. \n\n \n\nWhenever available, dose adjustments should be based on creatinine clearance values as obtained \n\nfrom a reliable method (24 h urine sampling). In all other cases the dose adjustment is based on the \n\ncreatinine value. \n\n \n\nIn any case, the bolus dose must be reduced to 0.2 mg / kg body weight. \n\n \n\nThe infusion rate must be reduced according to table 1. Additional aPTT monitoring is mandatory. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 1: Reduction of infusion rate in patients with renal impairment \n\n \n\nCreatinine clearance \n\n[ml/min] \n\nCreatinine value \n\n[mg/l (mol/l)] \n\nAdjusted infusion rate \n\n[% of original dose] \n\n45 – 60 16 – 20 (141 - 177) 50 % \n\n30 – 44 21 – 30 (178 - 265) 30 % \n\n15 – 29 31 - 60 (266 - 530) 15 % \n\nbelow 15* above 60 (530)* avoid or STOP infusion !* \n\n \n\n* In haemodialysis patients or in case of acute renal failure (creatinine clearance below 15 ml/min or \n\ncreatinine value above 60 mg/l [530 mol/l]), infusion of Refludan is to be avoided or stopped. \n\n Only if aPTT values have fallen below the lower therapeutic limit (see Monitoring: target range), \n\nfurther intravenous bolus doses of 0.1 mg / kg body weight may be considered every other day. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nReconstitute the lyophilisate as described in section 6.6. \n\n \n\nInitial intravenous bolus: \n\n \n\nFor intravenous bolus injection, a solution with a concentration of 5 mg/ml is needed. \n\nIntravenous injection is to be carried out slowly. \n\n \n\nTable 2: Examples for standard injection volume according to body weight \n\n \n\nBody weight Injection volume [ml] \n\n[kg] Dosage 0.4 mg / kg body weight Dosage 0.2 mg / kg body weight \n\n50 4.0 2.0 \n\n60 4.8 2.4 \n\n70 5.6 2.8 \n\n80 6.4 3.2 \n\n90 7.2 3.6 \n\n100 8.0 4.0 \n\n 110 8.8 4.4 \n\n \n\nIntravenous infusion: \n\n \n\nFor continuous intravenous infusion, a solution with a concentration of 2 mg/ml is needed. \n\nThe speed of the perfusor automate [ml per hour] is to be set in a body weight dependent fashion. \n\n \n\nTable 3: Examples for standard infusion speed according to body weight \n\n \n\nBody weight Infusion speed [ml/h] \n\n[kg] Dosage 0.15 mg / kg body weight / h Dosage 0.1 mg / kg body weight / h \n\n50 3.8 2.5 \n\n60 4.5 3.0 \n\n70 5.3 3.5 \n\n80 6.0 4.0 \n\n90 6.8 4.5 \n\n100 7.5 5.0 \n\n 110 8.3 5.5 \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n– Known hypersensitivity to lepirudin, to hirudins or to any of the excipients  \n\n– Pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6)  \n\n \n\nWhere there is active bleeding or bleeding tendency it is generally not advisable to administer \n\nRefludan. The physician should carefully weigh the risk of Refludan administration versus its \n\nanticipated benefit, taking into account possible measures to control bleeding. \n\n \n\nThis particularly includes the following situations with increased bleeding risk: \n\n– Recent puncture of large vessels or organ biopsy \n\n– Anomaly of vessels or organs \n\n– Recent cerebrovascular accident, stroke, or intracerebral surgery \n\n– Severe uncontrolled hypertension \n\n– Bacterial endocarditis \n\n– Advanced renal impairment \n\n– Haemorrhagic diathesis \n\n– Recent major surgery \n\n– Recent bleeding (e.g. intracranial, gastrointestinal, intraocular, pulmonary) \n\n– Overt signs of bleeding \n\n– Recent active peptic ulcer \n\n– Age > 65 years. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\n– Anaphylaxis: Refludan may cause allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and shock (see \n\nsection 4.8). Fatal anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients re-exposed to Refludan \n\nin a second or subsequent treatment course. Therefore, alternative treatment options must be \n\nconsidered before the decision to re-expose a patient to Refludan. As these reactions are \n\nimmune-mediated, patients with recent exposure to hirudin or hirudin analog may be at an \n\nincreased risk. Treatment initiation with Refludan should be undertaken only in a setting where \n\nmedical assistance is readily available and where there is access to treatment for anaphylactic \n\nreactions. \n\n– Patients should be informed that they have received Refludan. \n\n– In case of renal impairment relative overdose may occur even under a standard dosage regimen. \n\nTherefore, the treating physician should carefully weigh the risk of administration versus its \n\nanticipated benefit. It may be necessary to exclude patients with renal impairment from \n\ntreatment with lepirudin regimen. The rate of infusion must be reduced in case of known or \n\nsuspected renal insufficiency (see sections 4.2, and 5.2). \n\n– There is no experience with lepirudin in patients with significant liver impairment. Liver \n\ncirrhosis may also affect the renal excretion of lepirudin.  Serious liver injury (e.g. liver \n\ncirrhosis) may enhance the anticoagulant effect of lepirudin due to coagulation defects \n\nsecondary to reduced generation of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. \n\n– Formation of anti-hirudin antibodies was observed in about 40 % of HIT type II patients and \n\nhave been reported especially with a treatment period exceeding five days. This may result in \n\nan enhanced anticoagulant effect of lepirudin, possibly due to delayed renal elimination of \n\nactive lepirudin-antihirudin complexes. Therefore, strict monitoring of aPTT is necessary also \n\nduring prolonged therapy. No evidence of a neutralisation of lepirudin or of an allergic reaction \n\nassociated with the positive antibody test results was found. \n\n– Experience of combined therapy with thrombolytic agents in patients with HIT type II is very \n\nlimited. Since the risk of serious bleeding is considerable in this situation, the dosage of \n\nRefludan should be substantially reduced. The optimal dose regimen of Refludan in these \n\ncircumstances is not known. \n\n– Paediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.  \n\n– Elderly: Patients of advanced age have an increased risk of bleeding complications with \n\nanticoagulation. With respect to lepirudin dosage the potential of renal impairment in elderly \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\npatients is to be taken into account. No specific dosage adjustment is made for elderly patients. \n\nDosing adjustments are based on renal function, weight, and aPTT (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\n  \n\nConcomitant treatment with thrombolytics (e.g. rt-PA or streptokinase) may \n\n– increase the risk of bleeding complications \n\n– considerably enhance the effect of Refludan on aPTT prolongation. \n\n \n\nConcomitant treatment with coumarin derivatives (vitamin K antagonists) and drugs that affect \n\nplatelet function may also increase the risk of bleeding. \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with  \n\n– antiplatelet agents other than acetylsalicylic acid, such as ticlopidine or clopidogrel,  \n\n– GpIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists such as eptifibatide, tirofiban, or abciximab,  \n\n– other thrombin inhibitors such as low molecular weight heparins \n\nhas not been assessed. \n\n \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nThe safety of Refludan for use in human pregnancy or lactation has not been established. \n\nIn a standard embryo-foetal toxicity trial, decreased pup and maternal survival was observed. \n\n \n\nThere is currently no information available on the use of Refludan during lactation. \n\n \n\nRefludan should therefore not be administered to pregnant women or nursing mothers. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNot relevant. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nThe majority of undesirable effects experienced by patients treated with Refludan were generally \n\nrelated to bleeding (>1/10). Life-threatening bleeding events (including intracranial bleeding) were \n\nuncommonly reported (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) in patients with acute coronary syndrome included in \n\nclinical studies. In intensified post-marketing surveillance in HIT type II, fatal bleeding was reported \n\nin 1 % and intracranial bleeding in 0.2 % of patients \n\n \n\nAdverse events reported on Refludan are shown in the table below:  Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nVery common (>1/10); Common (>1/100, <1/10); Uncommon (>1/1,000 <1/100); Rare \n\n(>1/10,000 <1/1,000); Very Rare (<1/10,000) \n\n \n\nSystem Organ Class Very common Rare \n\nImmune System Disorders  Anaphylactic/oid reactions  \n\nVascular Disorders Anemia or drop in the \n\nhaemoglobin value without \n\nobvious source of bleeding  \n\nHaematoma  \n\nBleeding from puncture \n\nsites \n\nEpistaxis \n\nHaematuria  \n\nGastrointestinal bleeding \n\nVaginal bleeding  \n\nRectal bleeding  \n\nPulmonary haemorrhage \n\nPostoperative haemothorax \n\nHaemopericardium \n\nIntracranial bleeding  \n\n \n\nHot flushes \n\nShock including fatal shock \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders  \n\n Cough  \n\nStridor \n\nDyspnea \n\nSkin and Subcutaneous \n\nTissue Disorders  \n\n Allergic Skin Reactions \n\n(including rash) \n\nPruritus \n\nUrticaria \n\nAngio-oedema (including: face \n\noedema, tongue oedema, larynx \n\noedema) \n\nGeneral Disorders and \n\nAdministration Site \n\nConditions  \n\n Fever  \n\nChills \n\nInjection site reactions including \n\npain.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIn case of overdose the risk of bleeding may be increased. \n\n \n\nCurrently, no specific antidote against lepirudin is available. If life-threatening bleeding occurs and \n\nexcessive plasma levels of lepirudin are suspected, the following recommendations should be \n\nfollowed: \n\n– Immediately STOP Refludan administration \n\n– Determine aPTT and other coagulation parameters as appropriate \n\n– Determine haemoglobin and prepare for blood transfusion \n\n– Follow the current guidelines for shock-therapy. \n\n \n\nAdditionally, individual case reports and in-vitro data suggest that either haemofiltration or \n\nhaemodialysis (using high flux dialysis membranes with a cut-off point of 50,000 Dalton) may be \n\nuseful in this situation. \n\n \n\nResults from studies in pigs showed that the application of von Willebrand Factor (vWF, \n\n66 I.U./kg body weight) markedly reduced the bleeding time. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agent - direct thrombin inhibitor, ATC Code: B01AE02 \n\n \n\nLepirudin ([Leu1, Thr2]-63-desulfohirudin) is a recombinant hirudin derived from yeast cells. The \n\npolypeptide composed of 65 amino acids has a molecular weight of 6979.5 Dalton. Natural hirudin is \n\nproduced in trace amounts as a family of highly homologous iso-polypeptides by the leech Hirudo \n\nmedicinalis. \n\n \n\nLepirudin is a highly specific direct inhibitor of thrombin. Its activity is measured in a chromogenic \n\nassay. One anti-thrombin unit (ATU) is the amount of hirudin that neutralises one unit of WHO \n\npreparation 89/588 of thrombin. The specific activity of lepirudin is approximately 16,000 ATU/mg. \n\n \n\nIts mode of action is independent of antithrombin III. Platelet factor 4 does not inhibit lepirudin. One \n\nmolecule of hirudin binds to one molecule of thrombin and thereby blocks the thrombogenic activity \n\nof thrombin. \n\nAs a result all thrombin dependent coagulation assays are affected, e.g. the aPTT values increase in a \n\ndose-dependent fashion. \n\n \n\nThe clinical information on HIT type II in this SPC is based upon the data of two prospective trials \n\ncomprising a total of 198 HIT type II patients treated with Refludan. In the indication HIT type II with \n\nthromboembolic disease (125 patients) the overall mortality during the study period was \n\napproximately 9 % while amputations and new thromboembolic complications were recorded in 6 % \n\nand 10 %, respectively. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of lepirudin following intravenous administration are well described \n\nby a two-compartment model. Distribution is essentially confined to extra-cellular fluids and is \n\ncharacterised by an initial half-life of approximately 10 minutes. Elimination follows a first order \n\nprocess and is characterised by a terminal half-life of about 1.3 hours in young healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nBoth, excretion and metabolism take place in the kidney, and about 45 % of the dose administered is \n\ndetectable in the urine. About 35 % of the dose is excreted as unchanged compound. \n\n \n\nThe systemic clearance of lepirudin decreases in proportion to the existing glomerular filtration rate. \n\nIn female patients the systemic clearance is about 25 % lower as compared to male patients. \n\n \n\nIn elderly patients the systemic clearance of lepirudin is about 25 % lower as compared to younger \n\npatients. Age alone causes a 7 % reduction in clearance from the age of 30 to 70 years. The majority \n\nof the difference in clearance between young and elderly patients is due to the differences in renal \n\nfunction. In patients with terminal renal insufficiency prolonged elimination half-lives of about 2 days \n\nwere observed. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nGeneral toxicity \n\nSingle and repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and monkeys showed the adverse responses that \n\ncould be expected from an exaggerated pharmacodynamic impact of lepirudin. In monkeys retinal \n\nhaemorrhages occurred. Moreover, in rats slight to moderate sinushistiocytosis of the regional lymph \n\nnodes and decreased haemosiderin deposits in the spleen were observed.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nAnticoagulation in adult patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II and \n\nthromboembolic disease mandating parenteral antithrombotic therapy. \n\n \n\nThe diagnosis should be confirmed by the HIPAA (heparin induced platelet activation assay) or an \n\nequivalent test. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment with Refludan should be initiated under the guidance of a physician with experience in \n\ncoagulation disorders. \n\n \n\nInitial dosage \n\n \n\nAnticoagulation in adult patients with HIT type II and thromboembolic disease: \n\n \n\n– 0.4 mg / kg body weight intravenously as a bolus dose \n\n– followed by 0.15 mg / kg body weight / hour as a continuous intravenous infusion for 2 - 10 \n\ndays or longer if clinically needed. \n\n \n\nNormally, the dosage depends on the patient's body weight. This is valid up to a body weight of \n\n110 kg. In patients with a body weight exceeding 110 kg the dosage should not be increased beyond \n\nthe 110 kg body weight dose (see also tables 2 and 3, below). \n\n \n\nMonitoring and modification of the Refludan dosage regimen \n\n \n\nStandard recommendations \n\n \n\nMonitoring: \n\n– In general, the dosage (infusion rate) should be adjusted to the activated partial thromboplastin \n\ntime, aPTT. \n\n– The first aPTT determination should be done 4 hours after start of Refludan therapy. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\n– The aPTT should be monitored at least once daily. More frequent determinations may be \n\nnecessary, for example, in patients with renal impairment or with an increased risk of bleeding. \n\n– Target range (therapeutic window) for the aPTT: \n\n- Using \"Actin FS\" or \"Neothromtin\" on automated coagulometers the target range for the \n\naPTT is 1.5 fold to 3 fold prolongation of the normal control value. \n\n- With other reagents, the upper limit of the therapeutic aPTT window should be reduced to \n\n2.5 fold prolongation of the normal control value. \n\n- To obtain specific and exact aPTT limits, the laboratory equipment / test reagent used may \n\nbe calibrated by spiking standardised human plasma with 0.15 g/ml lepirudin (lower limit) \n\nand 1.5 g/ml lepirudin (upper limit). \n\n \n\nDose modifications: \n\n– Any aPTT value out of the target range is to be confirmed at once before drawing conclusions \n\nwith respect to dose modifications, unless there is a clinical need to react immediately. \n\n– If the confirmed aPTT value is above the target range, the infusion should be stopped for two \n\nhours. At restart, the infusion speed should be decreased by 50 % (no additional intravenous \n\nbolus should be administered). The aPTT should be determined again 4 hours later. \n\n– If the confirmed aPTT value is below the target range, the infusion speed should be increased \n\nby 20 %. The aPTT should be determined again 4 hours later. \n\n– In general, an infusion rate of 0.21 mg/kg/hour should not be exceeded without checking for \n\ncoagulation abnormalities which might be preventing an appropriate aPTT response. \n\n \n\nRecommendations for use in patients scheduled for a switch to oral anticoagulation \n\n \n\nIf a patient is scheduled to receive coumarin derivatives (vitamin K antagonists) for oral \n\nanticoagulation after Refludan therapy, the following should apply: Coumarin derivatives should be \n\ninitiated only when platelet counts are normalising. The intended maintenance dose should be started \n\nwith no loading dose. To avoid prothrombotic effects when initiating coumarin, continue parenteral \n\nanticoagulation for 4 to 5 days (see oral anticoagulant package insert for information). The parenteral \n\nagent can be discontinued when the International Normalised Ratio (INR) stabilises within the desired \n\ntarget range. \n\n \n\nRecommendations for use in patients with renal impairment \n\n \n\nAs lepirudin is almost exclusively excreted and metabolised renally (see also section 5.2), the \n\npatient’s renal function should be considered prior to administration. In case of renal impairment \n\nrelative overdose might occur even under standard dosage regimen. Therefore, the bolus dose and \n\ninfusion rate must be reduced in case of known or suspected renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance \n\nbelow 60 ml/min or creatinine value above 15 mg/l [133 mol/l]). \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, Refludan was not therapeutically administered to HIT type II patients with \n\nsignificant renal impairment. The following dosage recommendations are based on single-dose studies \n\nin a small number of patients with renal impairment. Therefore, these recommendations are only \n\ntentative. \n\n \n\nWhenever available, dose adjustments should be based on creatinine clearance values as obtained \n\nfrom a reliable method (24 h urine sampling). In all other cases the dose adjustment is based on the \n\ncreatinine value. \n\n \n\nIn any case, the bolus dose must be reduced to 0.2 mg / kg body weight. \n\n \n\nThe infusion rate must be reduced according to table 1. Additional aPTT monitoring is mandatory. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\nTable 1: Reduction of infusion rate in patients with renal impairment \n\n \n\nCreatinine clearance \n\n[ml/min] \n\nCreatinine value \n\n[mg/l (mol/l)] \n\nAdjusted infusion rate \n\n[% of original dose] \n\n45 – 60 16 – 20 (141 - 177) 50 % \n\n30 – 44 21 – 30 (178 - 265) 30 % \n\n15 – 29 31 - 60 (266 - 530) 15 % \n\nbelow 15* above 60 (530)* avoid or STOP infusion !* \n\n \n\n* In haemodialysis patients or in case of acute renal failure (creatinine clearance below 15 ml/min or \n\ncreatinine value above 60 mg/l [530 mol/l]), infusion of Refludan is to be avoided or stopped. \n\n Only if aPTT values have fallen below the lower therapeutic limit (see Monitoring: target range), \n\nfurther intravenous bolus doses of 0.1 mg / kg body weight may be considered every other day. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nReconstitute the lyophilisate as described in section 6.6. \n\n \n\nInitial intravenous bolus: \n\n \n\nFor intravenous bolus injection, a solution with a concentration of 5 mg/ml is needed. \n\nIntravenous injection is to be carried out slowly. \n\n \n\nTable 2: Examples for standard injection volume according to body weight \n\n \n\nBody weight Injection volume [ml] \n\n[kg] Dosage 0.4 mg / kg body weight Dosage 0.2 mg / kg body weight \n\n50 4.0 2.0 \n\n60 4.8 2.4 \n\n70 5.6 2.8 \n\n80 6.4 3.2 \n\n90 7.2 3.6 \n\n100 8.0 4.0 \n\n 110 8.8 4.4 \n\n \n\nIntravenous infusion: \n\n \n\nFor continuous intravenous infusion, a solution with a concentration of 2 mg/ml is needed. \n\nThe speed of the perfusor automate [ml per hour] is to be set in a body weight dependent fashion. \n\n \n\nTable 3: Examples for standard infusion speed according to body weight \n\n \n\nBody weight Infusion speed [ml/h] \n\n[kg] Dosage 0.15 mg / kg body weight / h Dosage 0.1 mg / kg body weight / h \n\n50 3.8 2.5 \n\n60 4.5 3.0 \n\n70 5.3 3.5 \n\n80 6.0 4.0 \n\n90 6.8 4.5 \n\n100 7.5 5.0 \n\n 110 8.3 5.5 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n– Known hypersensitivity to lepirudin, to hirudins or to any of the excipients  \n\n– Pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6) \n\n \n\nWhere there is active bleeding or bleeding tendency it is generally not advisable to administer \n\nRefludan. The physician should carefully weigh the risk of Refludan administration versus its \n\nanticipated benefit, taking into account possible measures to control bleeding. \n\n \n\nThis particularly includes the following situations with increased bleeding risk: \n\n– Recent puncture of large vessels or organ biopsy \n\n– Anomaly of vessels or organs \n\n– Recent cerebrovascular accident, stroke, or intracerebral surgery \n\n– Severe uncontrolled hypertension \n\n– Bacterial endocarditis \n\n– Advanced renal impairment \n\n– Haemorrhagic diathesis \n\n– Recent major surgery \n\n– Recent bleeding (e.g. intracranial, gastrointestinal, intraocular, pulmonary) \n\n– Overt signs of bleeding \n\n– Recent active peptic ulcer \n\n– Age > 65 years. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\n– Anaphylaxis: Refludan may cause allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and shock (see \n\nsection 4.8). Fatal anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients re-exposed to Refludan \n\nin a second or subsequent treatment course. Therefore, alternative treatment options must be \n\nconsidered before the decision to re-expose a patient to Refludan. As these reactions are \n\nimmune-mediated, patients with recent exposure to hirudin or hirudin analog may be at an \n\nincreased risk. Treatment initiation with Refludan should be undertaken only in a setting where \n\nmedical assistance is readily available and where there is access to treatment for anaphylactic \n\nreactions. \n\n– Patients should be informed that they have received Refludan. \n\n– In case of renal impairment relative overdose may occur even under a standard dosage regimen. \n\nTherefore, the treating physician should carefully weigh the risk of administration versus its \n\nanticipated benefit. It may be necessary to exclude patients with renal impairment from \n\ntreatment with lepirudin regimen. The rate of infusion must be reduced in case of known or \n\nsuspected renal insufficiency (see sections 4.2, and 5.2). \n\n– There is no experience with lepirudin in patients with significant liver impairment. Liver \n\ncirrhosis may also affect the renal excretion of lepirudin. Serious liver injury (e.g. liver \n\ncirrhosis) may enhance the anticoagulant effect of lepirudin due to coagulation defects \n\nsecondary to reduced generation of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. \n\n– Formation of anti-hirudin antibodies was observed in about 40 % of HIT type II patients and \n\nhave been reported especially with a treatment period exceeding five days. This may result in \n\nan enhanced anticoagulant effect of lepirudin, possibly due to delayed renal elimination of \n\nactive lepirudin-antihirudin complexes. Therefore, strict monitoring of aPTT is necessary also \n\nduring prolonged therapy. No evidence of a neutralisation of lepirudin or of an allergic reaction \n\nassociated with the positive antibody test results was found. \n\n– Experience of combined therapy with thrombolytic agents in patients with HIT type II is very \n\nlimited. Since the risk of serious bleeding is considerable in this situation, the dosage of \n\nRefludan should be substantially reduced. The optimal dose regimen of Refludan in these \n\ncircumstances is not known. \n\n– Paediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.  \n\n– Elderly: Patients of advanced age have an increased risk of bleeding complications with \n\nanticoagulation. With respect to lepirudin dosage the potential of renal impairment in elderly \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n\npatients is to be taken into account. No specific dosage adjustment is made for elderly patients. \n\nDosing adjustments are based on renal function, weight, and aPTT (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\n  \n\nConcomitant treatment with thrombolytics (e.g. rt-PA or streptokinase) may \n\n– increase the risk of bleeding complications \n\n– considerably enhance the effect of Refludan on aPTT prolongation. \n\n \n\nConcomitant treatment with coumarin derivatives (vitamin K antagonists) and drugs that affect \n\nplatelet function may also increase the risk of bleeding. \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with  \n\n– antiplatelet agents other than acetylsalicylic acid, such as ticlopidine or clopidogrel,  \n\n– GpIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists such as eptifibatide, tirofiban, or abciximab,  \n\n– other thrombin inhibitors such as low molecular weight heparins \n\nhas not been assessed. \n\n \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nThe safety of Refludan for use in human pregnancy or lactation has not been established. \n\nIn a standard embryo-foetal toxicity trial, decreased pup and maternal survival was observed. \n\n \n\nThere is currently no information available on the use of Refludan during lactation. \n\n \n\nRefludan should therefore not be administered to pregnant women or nursing mothers. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNot relevant. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nThe majority of undesirable effects experienced by patients treated with Refludan were generally \n\nrelated to bleeding (>1/10). Life-threatening bleeding events (including intracranial bleeding) were \n\nuncommonly reported (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) in patients with acute coronary syndrome included in \n\nclinical studies. In intensified post-marketing surveillance in HIT type II, fatal bleeding was reported \n\nin 1 % and intracranial bleeding in 0.2 % of patients \n\n \n\nAdverse events reported on Refludan are shown in the table below:  Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nVery common (>1/10); Common (>1/100, <1/10); Uncommon (>1/1,000 <1/100); Rare \n\n(>1/10,000 <1/1,000); Very Rare (<1/10,000) \n\n \n\nSystem Organ Class Very common Rare \n\nImmune System Disorders  Anaphylactic/oid reactions  \n\nVascular Disorders Anemia or drop in the \n\nhaemoglobin value without \n\nobvious source of bleeding  \n\nHaematoma  \n\nBleeding from puncture \n\nsites \n\nEpistaxis \n\nHaematuria  \n\nGastrointestinal bleeding \n\nVaginal bleeding  \n\nRectal bleeding  \n\nPulmonary haemorrhage \n\nPostoperative haemothorax \n\nHaemopericardium \n\nIntracranial bleeding  \n\n \n\nHot flushes \n\nShock including fatal shock \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders  \n\n Cough  \n\nStridor \n\nDyspnea \n\nSkin and Subcutaneous \n\nTissue Disorders  \n\n Allergic Skin Reactions \n\n(including rash) \n\nPruritus \n\nUrticaria \n\nAngio-oedema (including: face \n\noedema, tongue oedema, larynx \n\noedema) \n\nGeneral Disorders and \n\nAdministration Site \n\nConditions  \n\n Fever  \n\nChills \n\nInjection site reactions including \n\npain.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIn case of overdose the risk of bleeding may be increased. \n\n \n\nCurrently, no specific antidote against lepirudin is available. If life-threatening bleeding occurs and \n\nexcessive plasma levels of lepirudin are suspected, the following recommendations should be \n\nfollowed: \n\n– Immediately STOP Refludan administration \n\n– Determine aPTT and other coagulation parameters as appropriate \n\n– Determine haemoglobin and prepare for blood transfusion \n\n– Follow the current guidelines for shock-therapy. \n\n \n\nAdditionally, individual case reports and in-vitro data suggest that either haemofiltration or \n\nhaemodialysis (using high flux dialysis membranes with a cut-off point of 50,000 Dalton) may be \n\nuseful in this situation. \n\n \n\nResults from studies in pigs showed that the application of von Willebrand Factor (vWF, \n\n66 I.U./kg body weight) markedly reduced the bleeding time. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agent – direct thrombin inhibitor, ATC Code: B01AE02 \n\n \n\nLepirudin ([Leu1, Thr2]-63-desulfohirudin) is a recombinant hirudin derived from yeast cells. The \n\npolypeptide composed of 65 amino acids has a molecular weight of 6979.5 Dalton. Natural hirudin is \n\nproduced in trace amounts as a family of highly homologous iso-polypeptides by the leech Hirudo \n\nmedicinalis. \n\n \n\nLepirudin is a highly specific direct inhibitor of thrombin. Its activity is measured in a chromogenic \n\nassay. One anti-thrombin unit (ATU) is the amount of hirudin that neutralises one unit of WHO \n\npreparation 89/588 of thrombin. The specific activity of lepirudin is approximately 16,000 ATU/mg. \n\n \n\nIts mode of action is independent of antithrombin III. Platelet factor 4 does not inhibit lepirudin. One \n\nmolecule of hirudin binds to one molecule of thrombin and thereby blocks the thrombogenic activity \n\nof thrombin. \n\nAs a result all thrombin dependent coagulation assays are affected, e.g. the aPTT values increase in a \n\ndose-dependent fashion. \n\n \n\nThe clinical information on HIT type II in this SPC is based upon the data of two prospective trials \n\ncomprising a total of 198 HIT type II patients treated with Refludan. In the indication HIT type II with \n\nthromboembolic disease (125 patients) the overall mortality during the study period was \n\napproximately 9 % while amputations and new thromboembolic complications were recorded in 6 % \n\nand 10 %, respectively. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of lepirudin following intravenous administration are well described \n\nby a two-compartment model. Distribution is essentially confined to extra-cellular fluids and is \n\ncharacterised by an initial half-life of approximately 10 minutes. Elimination follows a first order \n\nprocess and is characterised by a terminal half-life of about 1.3 hours in young healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nBoth, excretion and metabolism take place in the kidney, and about 45 % of the dose administered is \n\ndetectable in the urine. About 35 % of the dose is excreted as unchanged compound. \n\n \n\nThe systemic clearance of lepirudin decreases in proportion to the existing glomerular filtration rate. \n\nIn female patients the systemic clearance is about 25 % lower as compared to male patients. \n\n \n\nIn elderly patients the systemic clearance of lepirudin is about 25 % lower as compared to younger \n\npatients. Age alone causes a 7 % reduction in clearance from the age of 30 to 70 years. The majority \n\nof the difference in clearance between young and elderly patients is due to the differences in renal \n\nfunction. In patients with terminal renal insufficiency prolonged elimination half-lives of about 2 days \n\nwere observed. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nGeneral toxicity \n\nSingle and repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and monkeys showed the adverse responses that \n\ncould be expected from an exaggerated pharmacodynamic impact of lepirudin. In monkeys retinal \n\nhaemorrhages occurred. Moreover, in rats slight to moderate sinushistiocytosis of the regional lymph \n\nnodes and decreased haemosiderin deposits in the spleen were observed.

WHAT REFLUDAN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\n \n\nRefludan is an antithrombotic medicine.  \n\n \n\nAntithrombotics are medicines to prevent formation of blood clots (thrombosis). \n\n \n\nRefludan is used for anticoagulation in adult patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) \n\ntype II and thromboembolic disease requiring injected antithrombotic medicines. HIT type II is an \n\nillness which can occur after you have received heparin containing medicines. It constitutes a certain \n\nkind of allergy towards heparin. It may result in a too low number of blood platelets and/or clots in \n\nyour blood vessels (thrombosis). \n\n \n\nThis may additionally lead to deposition of clots in organs. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. BEFORE YOU USE REFLUDAN \n\n \n\nDo not use Refludan \n\n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to lepirudin, to hirudins or any of the other ingredients of \n\nRefludan. \n\n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nTake special care with Refludan \n\nIf you have a bleeding tendency, your doctor will weigh the risk of Refludan administration against its \n\nbenefit. Thus, please tell your doctor if you have or have had: \n\n– Recent puncture of large vessels or organs \n\n– Anomaly of vessels or organs \n\n– Recent stroke, accident or surgery involving the brain \n\n– High blood pressure \n\n– Inflammation of the inner membrane of the heart \n\n– Advanced kidney disease \n\n– Advanced bleeding tendency \n\n– Recent major surgery \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n36 \n\n– Recent bleeding (e.g. in brain, stomach/intestine, eye, lung) \n\n– Obvious signs of bleeding \n\n– Recent active peptic ulcer \n\n– Age > 65 years \n\n \n\nPlease inform your doctor if you suffer from reduced kidney function or liver cirrhosis (advanced \n\ndisease of the liver) for he will then reduce the dosage.  \n\n \n\nYou should also inform your doctor if you have ever received Refludan, hirudin or a hirudin analogue. \n\n \n\nTaking other medicines \n\nPlease inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \n\neven those not prescribed. \n\n \n\nMedicines given to break up clots or tablets to prevent clot formation (coumarins) may increase the \n\nrisk of bleeding when given at the same time.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nRefludan should not be administered to pregnant women or nursing mothers. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. HOW TO USE REFLUDAN \n\n \n\nYour doctor will determine and control the dosage and duration of your treatment with Refludan \n\naccording to your clinical condition, your body weight, and certain laboratory values. \n\n \n\nIf you have the impression that the effect of Refludan is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or \n\npharmacist. \n\n \n\nRefludan, once reconstituted with an appropriate solvent, will be administered into a vein, by \n\ninjection and then by infusion. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, Refludan can have side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nVery common (at least 1 in 10 people)  \n\n– Bleeding \n\n \n\nReported bleeding events include: anaemia or drop in the haemoglobin value without obvious source \n\nof bleeding, bruising, bleeding from puncture sites, nose bleeding, blood in urine, gastrointestinal \n\nbleeding, vaginal bleeding, rectal bleeding, pulmonary haemorrhage, bleeding into chest space and \n\naround the heart following surgery, bleeding into the brain. \n\n \n\nSevere bleeding and, in particular, intracranial bleeding may be fatal. In intensified post-marketing \n\nsurveillance in HIT type II, fatal bleeding was reported in 1 % and intracranial bleeding in 0.2 % of \n\npatients. Severe bleeding may lead to decreased volume of circulating blood, low blood pressure, \n\nshock, and their clinical sequelae. \n\n \n\nRare (less than 1 in 1,000 people affected) \n\n– Allergic skin reactions (including rash), itching, hot flushes, fever, chills. \n\n– Anaphylactic/oid reactions including urticaria, difficulty in breathing (e.g. consisting of \n\nspasms), cough, sharp sound when breathing, build-up of water in the body and in the inner \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n37 \n\nwall of a vessel (including: face oedema, tongue oedema, throat oedema). In severe cases these \n\nmay lead to shock and death. \n\n– Injection site reactions, including pain. \n\n \n\nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \n\ntell your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. HOW TO STORE REFLUDAN \n\n \n\nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use Refludan after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and the vial after EXP. \n\n \n\nDo not store above 25C. Do not freeze. \n\n \n\nKeep the -vial in the outer carton.  \n\n \n\nDo not use Refludan if the reconstituted solution is cloudy or contains particles. \n\n \n\nOnce reconstituted Refludan is to be used immediately. \n\n \n\nAny unused solution must be discarded appropriately. \n\n \n\n \n\n6. FURTHER INFORMATION \n\n \n\nWhat Refludan contains \n\nThe active substance is lepirudin, a recombinant DNA product derived from yeast cells. \n\n \n\nThe other ingredients are mannitol (E421) and sodium hydroxide for PH adjustment. \n\n \n\nWhat Refludan looks like and contents of the pack \n\nRefludan is a white powder for solution for injection or infusion supplied in a vial containing 20 mg \n\nlepirudin.
