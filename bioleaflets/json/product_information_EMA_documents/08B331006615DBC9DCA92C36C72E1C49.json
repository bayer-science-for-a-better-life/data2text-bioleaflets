NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nBemfola 75 IU/0.125 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL of the solution contains 600 IU (equivalent to 44 micrograms) of follitropin alfa*. Each pre-\nfilled pen delivers 75 IU (equivalent to 5.5 micrograms) in 0.125 mL. \n \n* recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary \n(CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection). \n \nClear colourless solution. \n \nThe pH of the solution is 6.7 - 7.3. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIn adult women \n \n• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS) in women who have been \n\nunresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate. \n• Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted \n\nreproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian \ntransfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). \n\n• Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for \nthe stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In \nclinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. \n\n \nIn adult men \n \n• Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital \n\nor acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic \nGonadotropin (hCG) therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nfertility disorders. \n \nPatients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to \nuse the proper injection techniques. \n \nPosology \n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical \nassessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment \nmonitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing \nmedicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. \n \nComparative clinical trials have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and \nshorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered \nappropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only \nin order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation (see section 5.1). \n \nWomen with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) \nFollitropin alfa may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should \ncommence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. \n \nA commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or \n75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, \nresponse. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring \nfollicle size by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than \n225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be \nabandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence \ntreatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms of recombinant human \nchorionic gonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered \n24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the \nday of, and the day following hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may \nbe performed. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). \nTreatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nWomen undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro \nfertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies \nA commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin \nalfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular \ndevelopment has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum estrogen concentrations and/or \nultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not \nhigher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the \ntenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). \n \nA single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered \n24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. \n \nDown-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now \ncommonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a \ncommonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist \ntreatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, \nfollowing two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the \nfirst 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. \n \nOverall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during \nthe first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. \n \nWomen with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency \nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of follitropin alfa \ntherapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the \n\n\n\n4 \n\noocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin \nalfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these \npatients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at \nany time. \n \nA recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment \nshould be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by \nultrasound and estrogen response. \n \nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of \nstimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa \ninjections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following hCG \nadministration. \n \nAlternatively, IUI may be performed. \n \nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should \nrecommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nMen with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism \nFollitropin alfa should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a \nminimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment \nmay be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be \nnecessary to achieve spermatogenesis. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly population \nThere is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. The safety and efficacy of \nfollitropin alfa in elderly patients have not been established. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nThe safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment have not been established. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \nBemfola is intended for subcutaneous use. The first injection of Bemfola should be performed under \ndirect medical supervision. Self-administration of Bemfola should only be performed by patients who \nare well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. \n \nAs the Bemfola pre-filled pen with the single-dose cartridge is intended for only one injection, clear \ninstructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the single dose presentation. \n \nFor instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n• hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n• tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland; \n• ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome; \n• gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology; \n• ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma. \n \nFollitropin alfa must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as in cases of: \n \n• primary ovarian failure; \n• malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy; \n• fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy; \n• primary testicular insufficiency. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nFollitropin alfa is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse \nreactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems \nand their management. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \neffective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of the ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH \nin some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the \ntreatment objective should be used in both men and women. \n \nPorphyria \nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of \ntreatment. \n \nTreatment in women \nBefore starting treatment, the reason for the couple's infertility must be thoroughly investigated and \nputative contraindications for pregnancy must be evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated \nfor hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and should be treated accordingly. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or \nART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the \nrecommended follitropin alfa dose and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy \nwill minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle \ndevelopment and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant \ntests. \n \nIn clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered \nwith lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably \nbe at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. \n \nNo direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been \nperformed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin \nalfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. \n \nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \n\n\n\n6 \n\nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. \n \nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms \nincluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, \nhaemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, \nhydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian \ntorsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial \ninfarction. \n \nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome, high absolute or \nrapidly rising serum estradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation; \n> 3,000 pg/mL or > 11,000 pmol/L in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. \n> 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). \n \nAdherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dose and to the regimen of administration can \nminimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation \ncycles by ultrasound scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk \nfactors. \n \nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian \nhyperstimulation occur such as a serum estradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \n≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain \nfrom coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly \n(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after \nhormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days \nfollowing treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG \nadministration. \n \nIn ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. \n \nMild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended \nthat gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and \nappropriate therapy be started. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \nIn patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of a multiple pregnancy is increased \ncompared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple \npregnancy, especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal \noutcomes. \n \nTo minimise the risk of a multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. \n \nIn patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of a multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the \nnumber of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. \n \nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. \n \nPregnancy loss \n\n\n\n7 \n\nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, regardless of whether the \npregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of \nectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. \n \nReproductive system neoplasms \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \nCongenital malformation \nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. \n \nThromboembolic events \nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted \nhowever that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n \nTreatment in men \nElevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective \nresponse cannot be obtained. \n \nSemen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the \nassessment of the response. \n \nSodium content \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation \n(e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a \nGnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa \nneeded to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product \ninteraction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere is no indication for use of follitropin alfa during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of \nexposed pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or \nfeto/neonatal toxicity of follitropin alfa. \n \nNo teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). In case of exposure during \npregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of follitropin alfa. \n \nBreast-feeding \n\n\n\n8 \n\nFollitropin alfa is not indicated during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nFollitropin alfa is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFollitropin alfa is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \n \nMild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and \nshould be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4). \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions are ranked under heading of frequency using the following convention: very \ncommon (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTreatment in women \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nVery common: Headache \n \nVascular disorders \n \nVery rare: Thromboembolism (both in association with and separate from OHSS) \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n \nVery common: Ovarian cysts \n \nCommon: Mild or moderate OHSS (including associated symptomatology) \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4) \n \nRare: Complication of severe OHSS \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nTreatment in men \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nCommon: Acne \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n \nCommon: Gynaecomastia, Varicocele \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nInvestigations \n \nCommon: Weight gain \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of an overdose of follitropin alfa are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that \nOHSS may occur (see section 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA05. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc�\n\n\n10 \n\nBemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the \ndevelopment of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with \nfollitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated \nafter the administration of hCG. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in women \nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. \n \nIn clinical trials comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and \nin ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose \nand a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. \n \nIn ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in \na higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. \n \nTable 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of \nfollitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) \n\n follitropin alfa (n = 130) \nurinary FSH \n(n = 116) \n\nNumber of oocytes retrieved 11.0 ± 5.9 8.8 ± 4.8 \nDays of FSH stimulation required 11.7 ± 1.9 14.5 ± 3.3 \nTotal dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) 27.6 ± 10.2 40.7 ± 13.6 \nNeed to increase the dose (%) 56.2 85.3 \n\n \nDifferences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in men \nIn men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months \ninduces spermatogenesis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with \nan initial half-life of around 2 hours and is eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about \none day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 L and 0.6 L/h, respectively. \nOne-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady state within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown \nto effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity in addition to those already stated in the other sections of this \nSmPC. \n \nImpaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa \n(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/�\n\n\n11 \n\nGiven in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses \nwithout being teratogenic, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin \n(hMG). However, since follitropin alfa is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical \nrelevance. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIn adult women \n \n• Anovulation (including polycystic ovariansyndrome, PCOS) in women who have been \n\nunresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate. \n• Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted \n\nreproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian \ntransfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). \n\n• Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for \nthe stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In \nclinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. \n\n \nIn adult men \n \n• Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital \n\nor acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic \nGonadotropin (hCG) therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nfertility disorders. \n \nPatients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to \nuse the proper injection techniques. \n \nPosology \n\n\n\n14 \n\nThe dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical \nassessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment \nmonitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing \nmedicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. \n \nComparative clinical trials have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and \nshorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered \nappropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only \nin order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation (see section 5.1). \n \nWomen with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) \nFollitropin alfa may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should \ncommence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. \n \nA commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or \n75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, \nresponse. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring \nfollicle size by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than \n225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be \nabandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence \ntreatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms of recombinant human \nchorionic gonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered \n24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the \nday of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may \nbe performed. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). \nTreatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nWomen undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro \nfertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies \nA commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin \nalfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular \ndevelopment has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum estrogen concentrations and/or \nultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not \nhigher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the \ntenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). \n \nA single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered \n24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. \n \nDown-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now \ncommonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a \ncommonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist \ntreatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, \nfollowing two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the \nfirst 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. \n \nOverall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during \nthe first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. \n \nWomen with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency \nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of follitropin alfa \ntherapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the \n\n\n\n15 \n\noocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin \nalfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these \npatients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at \nany time. \n \nA recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment \nshould be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by \nultrasound and estrogen response. \n \nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of \nstimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa \ninjections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG \nadministration. \n \nAlternatively, IUI may be performed. \n \nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should \nrecommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nMen with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism \nFollitropin alfa should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a \nminimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment \nmay be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be \nnecessary to achieve spermatogenesis. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly population \nThere is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. The safety and efficacy of \nfollitropin alfa in elderly patients have not been established. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nThe safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment have not been established. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \nBemfola is intended for subcutaneous use. The first injection of Bemfola should be performed under \ndirect medical supervision. Self-administration of Bemfola should only be performed by patients who \nare well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. \n \nAs the Bemfola pre-filled pen with the single-dose cartridge is intended for only one injection, clear \ninstructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the single dose presentation. \n \nFor instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n• hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n• tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland; \n• ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome; \n• gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology; \n• ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma. \n \nFollitropin alfa must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as in case of: \n \n• primary ovarian failure; \n• malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy; \n• fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy; \n• primary testicular insufficiency. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nFollitropin alfa is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse \nreactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems \nand their management. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \neffective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of the ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH \nin some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the \ntreatment objective should be used in both men and women. \n \nPorphyria \nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of \ntreatment. \n \nTreatment in women \nBefore starting treatment, the reason for the couple's infertility must be thoroughly investigated and \nputative contraindications for pregnancy must be evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated \nfor hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and should be treated accordingly. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or \nART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the \nrecommended follitropin alfa dose and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy \nwill minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle \ndevelopment and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant \ntests. \n \nIn clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered \nwith lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably \nbe at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. \n \nNo direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been \nperformed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin \nalfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. \n \nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \n\n\n\n17 \n\nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. \n \nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms \nincluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, \nhaemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, \nhydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian \ntorsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial \ninfarction. \n \nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome, high absolute or \nrapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation; \n> 3,000 pg/mL or > 11,000 pmol/L in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. \n> 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). \n \nAdherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dose and to the regimen of administration can \nminimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation \ncycles by ultrasound scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk \nfactors. \n \nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian \nhyperstimulation occur such as a serum estradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \n≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain \nfrom coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly \n(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after \nhormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days \nfollowing treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG \nadministration. \n \nIn ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. \n \nMild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended \nthat gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and \nappropriate therapy be started. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \nIn patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of a multiple pregnancy is increased \ncompared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple \npregnancy, especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal \noutcomes. \n \nTo minimise the risk of a multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. \n \nIn patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number \nof embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. \n \nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. \n \nPregnancy loss \n\n\n\n18 \n\nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, regardless of whether the \npregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of \nectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. \n \nReproductive system neoplasms \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \nCongenital malformation \nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. \n \nThromboembolic events \nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted \nhowever that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n \nTreatment in men \nElevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective \nresponse cannot be obtained. \n \nSemen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the \nassessment of the response. \n \nSodium content \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation \n(e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a \nGnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa \nneeded to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product \ninteraction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere is no indication for use of follitropin alfa during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of \nexposed pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or \nfeto/neonatal toxicity of follitropin alfa. \n \nNo teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). In case of exposure during \npregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of follitropin alfa. \n \nBreast-feeding \n\n\n\n19 \n\nFollitropin alfa is not indicated during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \nFollitropin alfa is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFollitropin alfa is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \n \nMild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and \nshould be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4). \n \nList of adverse reactions  \nThe adverse reactions are ranked under heading of frequency using the following convention: very \ncommon (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTreatment in women \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nVery common: Headache \n \nVascular disorders \n \nVery rare: Thromboembolism (both in association with and separate from OHSS) \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n \nVery common: Ovarian cysts \n \nCommon: Mild or moderate OHSS (including associated symptomatology) \n \nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4) \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \nRare: Complication of severe OHSS \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nTreatment in men \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nCommon: Acne \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n \nCommon: Gynaecomastia, Varicocele \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nInvestigations \n \nCommon: Weight gain \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of an overdose of follitropin alfa are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that \nOHSS may occur (see section 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA05. \n \nBemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc�\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/�\n\n\n21 \n\n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the \ndevelopment of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with \nfollitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated \nafter the administration of hCG. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in women \nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. \n \nIn clinical trials comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and \nin ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose \nand a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. \n \nIn ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in \na higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. \n \nTable 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of \nfollitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) \n\n follitropin alfa (n = 130) \nurinary FSH \n(n = 116) \n\nNumber of oocytes retrieved 11.0 ± 5.9 8.8 ± 4.8 \nDays of FSH stimulation required 11.7 ± 1.9 14.5 ± 3.3 \nTotal dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) 27.6 ± 10.2 40.7 ± 13.6 \nNeed to increase the dose (%) 56.2 85.3 \n\n \nDifferences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in men \nIn men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months \ninduces spermatogenesis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with \nan initial half-life of around 2 hours and is eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about \none day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 L and 0.6 L/h, respectively. \nOne-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steadystate within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown \nto effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity in addition to those already stated in the other sections of this \nSmPC. \n \nImpaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa \n(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. \n \nGiven in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses \nwithout being teratogenic, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin \n\n\n\n22 \n\n(hMG). However, since follitropin alfa is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical \nrelevance. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIn adult women \n \n• Anovulation (including polycystic ovariansyndrome, PCOS) in women who have been \n\nunresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate. \n• Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted \n\nreproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian \ntransfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). \n\n• Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for \nthe stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In \nclinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. \n\n \nIn adult men \n \n• Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital \n\nor acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic \nGonadotropin (hCG) therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nfertility disorders. \n \nPatients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to \nuse the proper injection techniques. \n \nPosology \n\n\n\n25 \n\nThe dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical \nassessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment \nmonitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing \nmedicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. \n \nComparative clinical trials have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and \nshorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered \nappropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only \nin order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation (see section 5.1). \n \nWomen with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) \nFollitropin alfa may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should \ncommence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. \n \nA commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or \n75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, \nresponse. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring \nfollicle size by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than \n225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be \nabandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence \ntreatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms of recombinant human \nchorionic gonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered \n24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the \nday of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may \nbe performed. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). \nTreatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nWomen undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro \nfertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies \nA commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin \nalfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular \ndevelopment has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum estrogen concentrations and/or \nultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not \nhigher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the \ntenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). \n \nA single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered \n24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. \n \nDown-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now \ncommonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a \ncommonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist \ntreatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, \nfollowing two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the \nfirst 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. \n \nOverall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during \nthe first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. \n \nWomen with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency \nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of follitropin alfa \ntherapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the \n\n\n\n26 \n\noocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin \nalfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these \npatients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at \nany time. \n \nA recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment \nshould be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by \nultrasound and estrogen response. \n \nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of \nstimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa \ninjections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following hCG \nadministration. \n \nAlternatively, IUI may be performed. \n \nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should \nrecommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nMen with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism \nFollitropin alfa should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a \nminimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment \nmay be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be \nnecessary to achieve spermatogenesis. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly population \nThere is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. The safety and efficacy of \nfollitropin alfa in elderly patients have not been established. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nThe safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment have not been established. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \nBemfola is intended for subcutaneous use. The first injection of Bemfola should be performed under \ndirect medical supervision. Self-administration of Bemfola should only be performed by patients who \nare well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. \n \nAs the Bemfola pre-filled pen with the single-dose cartridge is intended for only one injection, clear \ninstructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the single dose presentation. \n \nFor instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n• hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n• tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland; \n• ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome; \n• gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology; \n• ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma. \n \nFollitropin alfa must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as in case of: \n \n• primary ovarian failure; \n• malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy; \n• fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy; \n• primary testicular insufficiency. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nFollitropin alfa is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse \nreactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems \nand their management. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \neffective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of the ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH \nin some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the \ntreatment objective should be used in both men and women. \n \nPorphyria \nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of \ntreatment. \n \nTreatment in women \nBefore starting treatment, the reason for the couple's infertility must be thoroughly investigated and \nputative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and should be treated accordingly. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or \nART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the \nrecommended follitropin alfa dose and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy \nwill minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle \ndevelopment and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant \ntests. \n \nIn clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered \nwith lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably \nbe at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. \n \nNo direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been \nperformed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin \nalfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. \n \nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \n\n\n\n28 \n\nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. \n \nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms \nincluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, \nhaemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, \nhydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian \ntorsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial \ninfarction. \n \nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or \nrapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation; \n> 3,000 pg/mL or > 11,000 pmol/L in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. \n> 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). \n \nAdherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dose and to the regimen of administration can \nminimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation \ncycles by ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk \nfactors. \n \nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian \nhyperstimulation occur such as a serum estradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \n≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain \nfrom coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly \n(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after \nhormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days \nfollowing treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG \nadministration. \n \nIn ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. \n \nMild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended \nthat gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and \nappropriate therapy be started. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \nIn patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of a multiple pregnancy is increased \ncompared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple \npregnancy, especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal \noutcomes. \n \nTo minimise the risk of a multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. \n \nIn patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number \nof embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. \n \nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. \n \nPregnancy loss \n\n\n\n29 \n\nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, regardless of whether the \npregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of \nectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. \n \nReproductive system neoplasms \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \nCongenital malformation \nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. \n \nThromboembolic events \nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted \nhowever that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n \nTreatment in men \nElevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective \nresponse cannot be obtained. \n \nSemen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the \nassessment of the response. \n \nSodium content \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation \n(e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a \nGnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa \nneeded to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product \ninteraction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere is no indication for use of follitropin alfa during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of \nexposed pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or \nfeto/neonatal toxicity of follitropin alfa. \n \nNo teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). In case of exposure during \npregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of follitropin alfa. \n \nBreastfeeding \n\n\n\n30 \n\nFollitropin alfa is not indicated during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \nFollitropin alfa is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFollitropin alfa is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \n \nMild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and \nshould be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of an overdose of follitropin alfa are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that \nOHSS may occur (see section 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA05. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc�\n\n\n32 \n\nBemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the \ndevelopment of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with \nfollitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated \nafter the administration of hCG. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in women \nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. \n \nIn clinical trials comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and \nin ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose \nand a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. \n \nIn ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in \na higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. \n \nTable 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of \nfollitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) \n\n follitropin alfa (n = 130) \nurinary FSH \n(n = 116) \n\nNumber of oocytes retrieved 11.0 ± 5.9 8.8 ± 4.8 \nDays of FSH stimulation required 11.7 ± 1.9 14.5 ± 3.3 \nTotal dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) 27.6 ± 10.2 40.7 ± 13.6 \nNeed to increase the dose (%) 56.2 85.3 \n\n \nDifferences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in men \nIn men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months \ninduces spermatogenesis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with \nan initial half-life of around 2 hours and is eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about \none day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 L and 0.6 L/h, respectively. \nOne-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady state within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown \nto effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity in addition to those already stated in the other sections of this \nSmPC. \n \nImpaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa \n(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/�\n\n\n33 \n\nGiven in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses \nwithout being teratogenic, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin \n(hMG). However, since follitropin alfa is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical \nrelevance. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIn adult women \n \n• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOs) in women who have been \n\nunresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate. \n• Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted \n\nreproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian \ntransfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). \n\n• Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for \nthe stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In \nclinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. \n\n \nIn adult men \n \n• Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital \n\nor acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic \nGonadotropin (hCG) therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nfertility disorders. \n \nPatients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to \nuse the proper injection techniques. \n \nPosology \n\n\n\n36 \n\nThe dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical \nassessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment \nmonitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing \nmedicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. \n \nComparative clinical trials have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and \nshorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered \nappropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only \nin order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation (see section 5.1). \n \nWomen with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) \nFollitropin alfa may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should \ncommence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. \n \nA commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or \n75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, \nresponse. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring \nfollicle size by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than \n225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be \nabandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence \ntreatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms of recombinant human \nchorionic gonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered \n24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the \nday of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may \nbe performed. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). \nTreatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nWomen undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro \nfertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies \nA commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin \nalfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular \ndevelopment has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum estrogen concentrations and/or \nultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not \nhigher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the \ntenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). \n \nA single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered \n24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. \n \nDown-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now \ncommonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a \ncommonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist \ntreatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, \nfollowing two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the \nfirst 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. \n \nOverall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during \nthe first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. \n \nWomen with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency \nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of follitropin alfa \ntherapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the \n\n\n\n37 \n\noocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin \nalfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these \npatients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at \nany time. \n \nA recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment \nshould be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by \nultrasound and estrogen response. \n \nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of \nstimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa \ninjections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following hCG \nadministration. \n \nAlternatively, IUI may be performed. \n \nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should \nrecommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nMen with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism \nFollitropin alfa should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a \nminimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment \nmay be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be \nnecessary to achieve spermatogenesis. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly population \nThere is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. The safety and efficacy of \nfollitropin alfa in elderly patients have not been established. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nThe safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment have not been established. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \nBemfola is intended for subcutaneous use. The first injection of Bemfola should be performed under \ndirect medical supervision. Self-administration of Bemfola should only be performed by patients who \nare well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. \n \nAs the Bemfola pre-filled pen with the single-dose cartridge is intended for only one injection, clear \ninstructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the single dose presentation. \n \nFor instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n• hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n• tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland; \n• ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome; \n• gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology; \n• ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma. \n \nFollitropin alfa must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as in case of: \n \n• primary ovarian failure; \n• malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy; \n• fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy; \n• primary testicular insufficiency. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nFollitropin alfa is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse \nreactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems \nand their management. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \neffective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of the ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH \nin some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the \ntreatment objective should be used in both men and women. \n \nPorphyria \nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of \ntreatment. \n \nTreatment in women \nBefore starting treatment, the reason for the couple's infertility must be assessed thoroughly \ninvestigated and putative contraindications for pregnancy must be evaluated. In particular, patients \nshould be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and should be \ntreated accordingly. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or \nART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the \nrecommended follitropin alfa dose and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy \nwill minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle \ndevelopment and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant \ntests. \n \nIn clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered \nwith lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably \nbe at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. \n \nNo direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been \nperformed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin \nalfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. \n \nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms \nincluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, \nhaemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, \nhydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian \ntorsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial \ninfarction. \n \nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or \nrapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation; \n> 3,000 pg/mL or > 11,000 pmol/L in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. \n> 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). \n \nAdherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dose and to the regimen of administration can \nminimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation \ncycles by ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk \nfactors. \n \nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian \nhyperstimulation occur such as a serum estradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \n≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain \nfrom coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly \n(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after \nhormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days \nfollowing treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG \nadministration. \n \nIn ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. \n \nMild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended \nthat gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and \nappropriate therapy be started. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \nIn patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of a multiple pregnancy is increased \ncompared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple \npregnancy, especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal \noutcomes. \n \nTo minimise the risk of a multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. \n \nIn patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number \nof embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. \n \nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nPregnancy loss \nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, regardless of whether the \npregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of \nectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. \n \nReproductive system neoplasms \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \nCongenital malformation \nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. \n \nThromboembolic events \nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted \nhowever that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n \nTreatment in men \nElevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective \nresponse cannot be obtained. \n \nSemen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the \nassessment of the response. \n \nSodium content \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation \n(e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a \nGnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa \nneeded to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product \ninteraction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere is no indication for use of follitropin alfa during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of \nexposed pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or \nfeto/neonatal toxicity of follitropin alfa. \n \nNo teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). In case of exposure during \npregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of follitropin alfa. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nBreast-feeding \nFollitropin alfa is not indicated during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nFollitropin alfa is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFollitropin alfa is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \n \nMild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and \nshould be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4). \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions are ranked under heading of frequency using the following convention: very \ncommon (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTreatment in women \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nVery common: Headache \n \nVascular disorders \n \nVery rare: Thromboembolism (both in association with and separate from OHSS. \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n \nVery common: Ovarian cysts \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nCommon: Mild or moderate OHSS (including associated symptomatology) \n \nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4) \n \nRare: Complication of severe OHSS \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nTreatment in men \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nCommon: Acne \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n \nCommon: Gynaecomastia, Varicocele \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nInvestigations \n \nCommon: Weight gain \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of an overdose of follitropin alfa are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that \nOHSS may occur (see section 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA05. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc�\n\n\n43 \n\n \nBemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the \ndevelopment of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with \nfollitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated \nafter the administration of hCG. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in women \nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. \n \nIn clinical trials comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and \nin ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose \nand a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. \n \nIn ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in \na higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. \n \nTable 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of \nfollitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) \n\n follitropin alfa (n = 130) \nurinary FSH \n(n = 116) \n\nNumber of oocytes retrieved 11.0 ± 5.9 8.8 ± 4.8 \nDays of FSH stimulation required 11.7 ± 1.9 14.5 ± 3.3 \nTotal dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) 27.6 ± 10.2 40.7 ± 13.6 \nNeed to increase the dose (%) 56.2 85.3 \n\n \nDifferences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in men \nIn men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months \ninduces spermatogenesis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with \nan initial half-life of around 2 hours and is eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about \none day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 L and 0.6 L/h, respectively. \nOne-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steadystate within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown \nto effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity in addition to those already stated in other sections of this \nSmPC. \n \nImpaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa \n(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/�\n\n\n44 \n\n \nGiven in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses \nwithout being teratogenic, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin \n(hMG). However, since follitropin alfa is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical \nrelevance. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIn adult women \n \n• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian snydrome, PCOS) in women who have been \n\nunresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate. \n• Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted \n\nreproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian \ntransfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). \n\n• Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for \nthe stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In \nclinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. \n\n \nIn adult men \n \n• Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital \n\nor acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic \nGonadotropin (hCG) therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nfertility disorders. \n \nPatients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to \nuse the proper injection techniques. \n \nPosology \n\n\n\n47 \n\nThe dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical \nassessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment \nmonitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing \nmedicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. \n \nComparative clinical trials have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and \nshorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered \nappropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only \nin order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation (see section 5.1). \n \nWomen with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) \nFollitropin alfa may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should \ncommence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. \n \nA commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or \n75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, \nresponse. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring \nfollicle size by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than \n225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be \nabandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence \ntreatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms of recombinant human \nchorionic gonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered \n24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the \nday of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may \nbe performed. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). \nTreatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nWomen undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro \nfertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies \nA commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin \nalfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular \ndevelopment has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum estrogen concentrations and/or \nultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not \nhigher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the \ntenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). \n \nA single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered \n24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. \n \nDown-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now \ncommonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a \ncommonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist \ntreatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, \nfollowing two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the \nfirst 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. \n \nOverall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during \nthe first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. \n \nWomen with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency \nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of follitropin alfa \ntherapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the \n\n\n\n48 \n\noocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin \nalfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these \npatients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at \nany time. \n \nA recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment \nshould be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by \nultrasound and estrogen response. \n \nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of \nstimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa \ninjections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following hCG \nadministration. \n \nAlternatively, IUI may be performed. \n \nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should \nrecommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \nMen with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism \nFollitropin alfa should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a \nminimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment \nmay be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be \nnecessary to achieve spermatogenesis. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly population \nThere is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. The safety and efficacy of \nfollitropin alfa in elderly patients have not been established. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nThe safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment have not been established. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \nBemfola is intended for subcutaneous use. The first injection of Bemfola should be performed under \ndirect medical supervision. Self-administration of Bemfola should only be performed by patients who \nare well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. \n \nAs the Bemfola pre-filled pen with the single-dose cartridge is intended for only one injection, clear \ninstructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the single dose presentation. \n \nFor instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n• hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n• tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland; \n• ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome; \n• gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology; \n• ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma. \n \nFollitropin alfa must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as in case of: \n \n• primary ovarian failure; \n• malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy; \n• fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy; \n• primary testicular insufficiency. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nFollitropin alfa is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse \nreactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems \nand their management. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \neffective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of the ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH \nin some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the \ntreatment objective should be used in both men and women. \n \nPorphyria \nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of \ntreatment. \n \nTreatment in women \nBefore starting treatment, the reason for the couple's infertility must be thoroughly investigated and \nputative contraindications for pregnancy must be evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated \nfor hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and should be treated accordingly. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or \nART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the \nrecommended follitropin alfa dose and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy \nwill minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle \ndevelopment and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant \ntests. \n \nIn clinicaltrials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered \nwith lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably \nbe at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. \n \nNo direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been \nperformed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin \nalfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. \n \nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \n\n\n\n50 \n\nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. \n \nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms \nincluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, \nhaemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, \nhydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian \ntorsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial \ninfarction. \n \nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome, high absolute or \nrapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation; \n> 3,000 pg/mL or > 11,000 pmol/L in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. \n> 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). \n \nAdherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dose and to the regimen of administration can \nminimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation \ncycles by ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk \nfactors. \n \nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian \nhyperstimulation occur such as serum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \n≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain \nfrom coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly \n(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after \nhormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days \nfollowing treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG \nadministration. \n \nIn ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. \n \nMild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended \nthat gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and \nappropriate therapy be started. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \nIn patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of a multiple pregnancy is increased \ncompared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple \npregnancy, especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal \noutcomes. \n \nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. \n \nIn patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of a multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the \nnumber of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. \n \nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. \n \nPregnancy loss \n\n\n\n51 \n\nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, regardless of whether the \npregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of \nectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. \n \nReproductive system neoplasms \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \nCongenital malformation \nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. \n \nThromboembolic events \nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted \nhowever that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n \nTreatment in men \nElevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective \nresponse cannot be obtained. \n \nSemen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the \nassessment of the response. \n \nSodium content \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation \n(e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a \nGnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa \nneeded to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product \ninteraction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere is no indication for use of follitropin alfa during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of \nexposed pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or \nfeto/neonatal toxicity of follitropin alfa. \n \nNo teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). In case of exposure during \npregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of follitropin alfa. \n \nBreastfeeding \n\n\n\n52 \n\nFollitropin alfa is not indicated during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \nFollitropin alfa is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFollitropin alfa is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \n \nMild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and \nshould be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThromboembolism may occur very rarely, usually associated with severe OHSS (see section 4.4). \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions are ranked under heading of frequency using the following convention: very \ncommon (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTreatment in women \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nVery common: Headache \n \nVascular disorders \n \nVery rare: Thromboembolism, (both in association with and separate from OHSS. \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n \nVery common: Ovarian cysts \n \nCommon: Mild or moderate OHSS (including associated symptomatology) \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4) \n \nRare: Complication of severe OHSS \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nTreatment in men \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n \nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nCommon: Acne \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n \nCommon: Gynaecomastia, Varicocele \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation \n\nat the site of injection) \n \nInvestigations \n \nCommon: Weight gain \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of an overdose of follitropin alfa are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that \nOHSS may occur (see section 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA05. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc�\n\n\n54 \n\nBemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the \ndevelopment of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with \nfollitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated \nafter the administration of hCG. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in women \nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. \n \nIn clinical trials comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and \nin ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose \nand a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. \n \nIn ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in \na higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. \n \nTable 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of \nfollitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) \n\n follitropin alfa (n = 130) \nurinary FSH \n(n = 116) \n\nNumber of oocytes retrieved 11.0 ± 5.9 8.8 ± 4.8 \nDays of FSH stimulation required 11.7 ± 1.9 14.5 ± 3.3 \nTotal dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) 27.6 ± 10.2 40.7 ± 13.6 \nNeed to increase the dose (%) 56.2 85.3 \n\n \nDifferences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in men \nIn men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months \ninduces spermatogenesis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with \nan initial half-life of around 2 hours and is eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about \none day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 L and 0.6 L/h, respectively. \nOne-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steadystate within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown \nto effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity in addition to those already stated in the other sections of this \nSmPC. \n \nImpaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa \n(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/�\n\n\n55 \n\nGiven in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses \nwithout being teratogenic, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin \n(hMG). However, since follitropin alfa is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical \nrelevance. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you use Bemfola \n3. How to use Bemfola \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Bemfola \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \n \n1. What Bemfola is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Bemfola is \nThis medicine contains the active substance follitropin alfa, which is almost identical to a natural \nhormone produced by your body called “follicle-stimulating hormone” (FSH). FSH is a gonadotropin, \na type of hormone that plays an important role in human fertility and reproduction. In women, FSH is \nneeded for the growth and development of the sacs (follicles) in the ovaries that contain the egg cells. \nIn men, FSH is needed for the production of sperm. \n \nWhat Bemfola is used for \n \nIn adult women, Bemfola is used: \n• to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not \n\nrespond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. \n• together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“luteinising hormone” or LH) to help \n\nrelease an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that are not ovulating because their body is \nproducing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH). \n\n• to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted \nreproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as \n“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. \n\n \nIn adult men, Bemfola is used: \n• together with another medicine called “human chorionic gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce \n\nsperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Bemfola \n \n\n\n\n83 \n\nYou and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor \nexperienced in treating fertility disorders. \n \nDo not use Bemfola \n• if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n• if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). \n• If you are a woman: \n\n- with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. \n- with unexplained vaginal bleeding. \n- with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. \n- with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure \n(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. \n\n• If you are a man: \n- with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. \n\n \nDo not use Bemfola if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before using this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nPorphyria \nTell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an \ninability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). \nTell your doctor straight away if: \n• your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the \n\nsun, and/or \n• you have stomach, arm or leg pain. \n \nIn case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. \n \nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \nIf you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles \ndevelop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, \nfeel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who \nmight ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). \nIn case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are \nadhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. Bemfola treatment seldom causes severe OHSS \nunless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic \ngonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any \nhCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive \nmethod for at least four days. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \nWhen using Bemfola, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceive naturally. A multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy \nby using the right dose of Bemfola at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive \ntechnology the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number \nof fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. \n \nMiscarriage \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, \nyou are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \n\n\n\n84 \n\nIf you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if \nthose happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become \nworse with Bemfola treatment. \n \nMen with too much FSH in their blood \nIf you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. Bemfola \nusually does not work if you have this problem. If your doctor decides to try Bemfola treatment, to \nmonitor the treatment, they may ask you to provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting \ntreatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nBemfola is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Bemfola \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n• If you use Bemfola with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene \n\ncitrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. \n• If you use Bemfola at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist or \n\nantagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may \nneed a higher dose of Bemfola to produce follicles. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not use Bemfola if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nBemfola contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-\nfree”. \n \n \n3. How to use Bemfola \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \nUsing this medicine \n \n\n• Bemfola is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). Use the pre-\nfilled pen only once then it should be disposed of in a safe manner. Do not administered the \nsolution if it contains particles or is not clear. \n\n• The first injection of Bemfola should be given under supervision of your doctor. \n• Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the Bemfola pre-filled pen to inject the \n\nmedicine. \n• If you administer Bemfola to yourself, please carefully read and follow the “Instructions for \n\nUse”. These instructions can be found at the end of the package leaflet. \n \nHow much to use \n \nYour doctor will decide how much medicine you will use and how often. The doses described below \nare stated in International Units (IU) and millilitres (mL). \n \nWomen \n \nIf you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n• Bemfola is usually given every day. \n• If you have irregular periods, start using Bemfola within the first 7 days of your menstrual \n\ncycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. \n• The usual starting dose of Bemfola is 75 to 150 IU (0.12 to 0.25 mL) each day. \n• Your dose of Bemfola may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you get \n\nthe desired response or your doctor tells you to stop, see below. \n• The maximum daily dose of Bemfola is usually not higher than 225 IU (0.375 mL). \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last Bemfola injection. The best time to \nhave sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with Bemfola should \nbe stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of \nBemfola than before. \n \nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG \n(see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of Bemfola \nthan before. \n \nIf you are not ovulating, have no periods and have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH \nand LH hormones \n \n• The usual starting dose of Bemfola is 75 to 150 IU (0.12 to 0.25 mL) together with 75 IU \n\n(0.12 mL) of lutropin alfa. \n• You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. \n• Your dose of Bemfola may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you get \n\nthe desired response. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of \n\n“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or \n5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of Bemfola and lutropin \nalfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \nAlternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed by placing the sperm into the womb \ncavity. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with Bemfola should be \nstopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of Bemfola than \nbefore. \n \nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment with Bemfola will be stopped and you will not be \ngiven any hCG (see section 2, OHSS). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose \nof Bemfola than before. \n \nIf you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology \n \n• The usual starting dose of Bemfola is 150 to 225 IU (0.25 to 0.37 mL) each day, from day 2 or 3 \n\nof your treatment cycle. \n• Bemfola dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is \n\n450 IU (0.75 mL). \n• Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes \n\nabout 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests \nand/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. \n\n• When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant \nhCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or \n\n\n\n86 \n\n5,000 IU to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last Bemfola injection. This gets your \neggs ready for collection. \n\n \nIn other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing \nhormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then Bemfola is started approximately two weeks after start \nof agonist treatment. The Bemfola and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop \nas desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU Bemfola is \nadministered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response. When GnRH \nantagonist is used, it is administered from the 5th or 6th day of Bemfola treatment and continued until \novulation induction. \n \nMen \n \n• The usual dose of Bemfola is 150 IU (0.25 mL) together with hCG. \n• You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. \n• If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you \n\ncontinue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. \n \nIf you use more Bemfola than you should \n \nThe effects of taking too much Bemfola are unknown. Nevertheless one could expect Ovarian Hyper-\nStimulation Syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However the OHSS will only \noccur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, under ‘OHSS’). \n \nIf you forget to use Bemfola \n \nIf you forget to use Bemfola, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk to \nyour doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects in women \n• Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of Ovarian \n\nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the \ntreatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also section 2 “Take special care with \nBemfola”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). \n\n• OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, weight \ngain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. This \nside effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n\n• Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may \naffect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n• Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS \nmay be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). This could cause chest pain, \nbreathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also section 2 under ‘Blood clotting problems’). \n\n \nSerious side effects in men and women \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing \n\ncan sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare  \n \nIf you notice any of the above-listed side effects you should immediately contact your doctor, who \nmight ask you to stop using Bemfola. \n \n\n\n\n87 \n\nOther side effects in women \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n• Sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) \n• Headache \n• Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/or irritation \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n• Abdominal pain \n• Feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and bloating \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing \n\nmay occur. These reactions can sometimes be serious. \n• Your asthma may get worse \n \nOther side effects in men \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n• Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/or irritation \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n• Swelling of the veins above and behind the testicles (varicocele). \n• Breast development, acne or weight gain. \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n• Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty in breathing \n\nmay occur. These reactions can sometimes be serious. \n• Your asthma may get worse. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
