PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nGardasil, suspension for injection.\nGardasil, suspension for injection in a pre-filled syringe.\n\nPrior to agitation, Gardasil may appear as a clear liquid with a white precipitate. After thorough \nagitation, it is a white, cloudy liquid.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nGardasil is a vaccine for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of:\n– premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), premalignant anal lesions, cervical \n\ncancers and anal cancers causally related to certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) \ntypes\n\n– genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to specific HPV types. \n\nSee sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information on the data that support this indication.\n\nThe use of Gardasil should be in accordance with official recommendations.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nIndividuals 9 to and including 13 years of age \nGardasil can be administered according to a 2-dose schedule (0.5 ml at 0, 6 months) (see section 5.1).\n\nIf the second vaccine dose is administered earlier than 6 months after the first dose, a third dose should \nalways be administered.\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nAlternatively, Gardasil can be administered according to a 3-dose (0.5 ml at 0, 2, 6 months) schedule. \nThe second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose \nshould be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within \na 1-year period. \n\nIndividuals 14 years of age and older\nGardasil should be administered according to a 3-dose (0.5 ml at 0, 2, 6 months) schedule.\n\nThe second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose \nshould be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within \na 1-year period.\n\nThe use of Gardasil should be in accordance with official recommendations.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Gardasil in children below 9 years of age have not been established. No \ndata are available (see section 5.1).\n\nIt is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Gardasil complete the vaccination \ncourse with Gardasil (see section 4.4).\n\nThe need for a booster dose has not been established.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe vaccine should be administered by intramuscular injection. The preferred site is the deltoid area of \nthe upper arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh.\n\nGardasil must not be injected intravascularly. Neither subcutaneous nor intradermal administration has \nbeen studied. These methods of administration are not recommended (see section 6.6).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. \n\nIndividuals who develop symptoms indicative of hypersensitivity after receiving a dose of Gardasil \nshould not receive further doses of Gardasil.\n\nAdministration of Gardasil should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile \nillness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a mild upper respiratory tract infection or \nlow-grade fever, is not a contraindication for immunisation.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nThe decision to vaccinate an individual should take into account the risk for previous HPV exposure \nand potential benefit from vaccination.\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in \ncase of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine.\n\nSyncope (fainting), sometimes associated with falling, can occur following, or even before, any \nvaccination, especially in adolescents as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be \naccompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia, and \ntonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. Therefore, vaccinees should be observed for \napproximately 15 minutes after vaccine administration. It is important that procedures are in place to \navoid injury from faints.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nAs with any vaccine, vaccination with Gardasil may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients. \n\nGardasil will only protect against diseases that are caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 and to a \nlimited extent against diseases caused by certain related HPV types (See section 5.1). Therefore, \nappropriate precautions against sexually transmitted diseases should continue to be used.\n\nGardasil is for prophylactic use only and has no effect on active HPV infections or established clinical \ndisease. Gardasil has not been shown to have a therapeutic effect. The vaccine is therefore, not \nindicated for treatment of cervical cancer, high-grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal dysplastic lesions \nor genital warts. It is also not intended to prevent progression of other established HPV-related lesions.\n\nGardasil does not prevent lesions due to a vaccine HPV type in individuals infected with that HPV \ntype at the time of vaccination (see section 5.1).\n\nThe use of Gardasil in adult women should take into consideration the variability of HPV type \nprevalence in different geographical areas. \n\nVaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. Since no vaccine is 100% effective and \nGardasil will not provide protection against every HPV type, or against existing HPV infections, \nroutine cervical screening remains critically important and should follow local recommendations.\n\nSafety and immunogenicity of the vaccine have been assessed in individuals aged from 7 to 12 years \nwho are known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (see section 5.1). \nIndividuals with impaired immune responsiveness, due to either the use of potent immunosuppressive \ntherapy, a genetic defect, or other causes, may not respond to the vaccine.\n\nThis vaccine should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopaenia or any coagulation \ndisorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.\n\nLong-term follow-up studies were conducted to determine the duration of protection. (see section 5.1).\n\nThere are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support change during vaccination with \nGardasil to other HPV vaccines which do not cover the same HPV types. Therefore, it is important \nthat the same vaccine should be prescribed for the whole dose regimen.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn all clinical trials, individuals who had received immunoglobulin or blood-derived products during \nthe 6 months prior to the first vaccine dose were excluded. \n\nUse with other vaccines \n\nAdministration of Gardasil at the same time (but, for injected vaccines, at a different injection site) as \nhepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine did not interfere with the immune response to the HPV types. The \nseroprotection rates (proportion of individuals reaching seroprotective level anti-HBs >10 mIU/ml) \nwere unaffected (96.5% for concomitant vaccination and 97.5% for hepatitis B vaccine only). Anti-\nHBs geometric mean antibody titres were lower on co-administration, but the clinical significance of \nthis observation is not known.\n\nGardasil may be administered concomitantly with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria \n(d) and tetanus (T) with either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis [inactivated] \n(IPV) (dTap, dT-IPV, dTap-IPV vaccines) with no significant interference with antibody response to \nany of the components of either vaccine. However, a trend of lower anti-HPV GMTs was observed in \nthe concomitant group. The clinical significance of this observation is not known.  This is based on the \nresults from a clinical trial in which a combined dTap-IPV vaccine was administered concomitantly \nwith the first dose of Gardasil. (see section 4.8).\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nThe concomitant administration of Gardasil with vaccines other than the ones above has not been \nstudied.\n\nUse with hormonal contraceptives\n\nIn clinical studies, 57.5% of women aged 16 to 26 years and 31.2% of women aged 24 to 45 years \nwho received Gardasil used hormonal contraceptives during the vaccination period. Use of hormonal \ncontraceptives did not appear to affect the immune response to Gardasil.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nSpecific studies of the vaccine in pregnant women were not conducted. During the clinical \ndevelopment program, 3,819 women (vaccine = 1,894 vs. placebo = 1,925) reported at least one \npregnancy. There were no significant differences in types of anomalies or proportion of pregnancies \nwith an adverse outcome in Gardasil and placebo treated individuals. These data on pregnant women \n(more than 1000 exposed outcomes) indicate no malformative nor feto/ neonatal toxicity.\n\nThe data on Gardasil administered during pregnancy did not indicate any safety signal. However, these \ndata are insufficient to recommend use of Gardasil during pregnancy. Vaccination should be \npostponed until completion of pregnancy. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIn breast-feeding mothers given Gardasil or placebo during the vaccination period of the clinical trials \nthe rates of adverse reactions in the mother and the breast-fed infant were comparable between the \nvaccination and the placebo groups. In addition, vaccine immunogenicity was comparable among \nbreast-feeding mothers and women who did not breast-feed during the vaccine administration.\n\nTherefore, Gardasil can be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). No effects on male fertility were observed in rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nA. Summary of the safety profile\n\nIn 7 clinical trials (6 placebo-controlled), individuals were administered Gardasil or placebo on the \nday of enrolment and approximately 2 and 6 months thereafter. Few individuals (0.2%) discontinued \ndue to adverse reactions. Safety was evaluated in either the entire study population (6 studies) or in a \npredefined subset (one study) of the study population using vaccination report card (VRC)-aided \nsurveillance for 14 days after each injection of Gardasil or placebo. The individuals who were \nmonitored using VRC-aided surveillance included 10,088 individuals (6,995 females 9 to 45 years of \nage and 3,093 males 9 to 26 years of age at enrolment) who received Gardasil and 7,995 individuals \n(5,692 females and 2,303 males) who received placebo. \n\nThe most common adverse reactions observed were injection-site adverse reactions (77.1% of \nvaccinees within 5 days following any vaccination visit) and headache (16.6% of the vaccinees). \n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nThese adverse reactions usually were mild or moderate in intensity.\n\nB. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nClinical Trials\nTable 1 presents vaccine-related adverse reactions which were observed among recipients of Gardasil \nat a frequency of at least 1.0% and also at a greater frequency than observed among placebo recipients. \nThey are ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention:\n\n[Very Common (≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 to 1/10); Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to 1/100); Rare \n(≥1/10,000 to 1/1,000); Very Rare (1/10,000)]\n\nPost-Marketing Experience\nTable 1 also includes additional adverse events which have been spontaneously reported during the \npost-marketing use of Gardasil worldwide. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a \npopulation of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a \ncausal relationship to vaccine exposure. Consequently, the frequency of these adverse events is \nqualified as \"not known\".\n\nTable 1: Adverse Events Following Administration of Gardasil from Clinical Trials and Post-\nMarketing Surveillance\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Events\n\nInfections and infestations Not known Injection-site cellulitis *\nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders\nNot known Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura*, \n\nlymphadenopathy*\n\nImmune system disorders Not known Hypersensitivity reactions including \nanaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions*\n\nNervous system disorders Very common Headache\nNot known Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis*, \n\nDizziness1 *, Guillain-Barré syndrome*, syncope \nsometimes accompanied by tonic-clonic \nmovements*\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Nausea\nNot known Vomiting*\n\nMusculoskeletal and Connective \nTissue Disorders\n\nCommon Pain in extremity\nNot known Arthralgia*, Myalgia*\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nVery common At the injection site: erythema, pain, swelling\n\nCommon Pyrexia\nAt the injection site: hematoma, pruritus\n\nNot known Asthenia*, chills*, fatigue*, malaise*\n\n* Post Marketing adverse events (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).\n1 During clinical trials, dizziness was observed as a common adverse reaction in females. In males, dizziness was \nnot observed at a greater frequency in vaccine recipients than in placebo recipients.\n\nIn addition, in clinical trials adverse reactions that were judged to be vaccine- or placebo-related by \nthe study investigator were observed at frequencies lower than 1%: \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:\nVery rare: bronchospasm.\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nRare: urticaria.\nNine cases (0.06%) of urticaria were reported in the Gardasil group and 20 cases (0.15%) were seen in \nthe adjuvant-containing placebo group.\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nIn the clinical studies, individuals in the Safety Population reported any new medical conditions \nduring the follow-up. Among 15,706 individuals who received Gardasil and 13,617 individuals who \nreceived placebo, there were 39 cases of non-specific arthritis/arthropathy reported, 24 in the Gardasil \ngroup and 15 in the placebo group. \n\nIn a clinical trial of 843 healthy adolescent males and females 11-17 years of age, administration of the \nfirst dose of Gardasil concomitantly with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis [acellular, \ncomponent] and poliomyelitis [inactivated] booster vaccine showed that there was more injection-site \nswelling and headache reported following concomitant administration. The differences observed were \n< 10% and in the majority of subjects, the adverse events were reported as mild to moderate in \nintensity.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere have been reports of administration of higher than recommended doses of Gardasil. \n\nIn general, the adverse event profile reported with overdose was comparable to recommended single \ndoses of Gardasil.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Viral Vaccine, ATC code: J07BM01\n\nMechanism of Action\n\nGardasil is an adjuvanted non-infectious recombinant quadrivalent vaccine prepared from the highly \npurified virus-like particles (VLPs) of the major capsid L1 protein of HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18. The \nVLPs contain no viral DNA, they cannot infect cells, reproduce or cause disease. HPV only infects \nhumans, but animal studies with analogous papillomaviruses suggest that the efficacy of LI VLP \nvaccines is mediated by the development of a humoral immune response. \n\nHPV 16 and HPV 18 are estimated to be responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers and \n75-80% of anal cancers; 80% of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS); 45-70% of high-grade cervical\nintraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3); 25% of low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1); \napproximately 70% of HPV related high-grade vulvar (VIN 2/3) and vaginal (VaIN 2/3) intraepithelial \nneoplasia and 80% of HPV related high-grade anal (AIN 2/3) intraepithelial neoplasia. HPV 6 and 11 \nare responsible for approximately 90% of genital warts and 10% of low grade cervical intraepithelial \nneoplasia (CIN 1). CIN 3 and AIS have been accepted as immediate precursors of invasive cervical \ncancer.\n\nThe term \"premalignant genital lesions\" in section 4.1 corresponds to high-grade cervical\nintraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3), high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN 2/3) and high-\ngrade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN 2/3).\n\nThe term \"premalignant anal lesions\" in section 4.1 corresponds to high-grade anal intraepithelial \nneoplasia (AIN 2/3).\n\nThe indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of Gardasil in females 16 to 45 years of age \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8\n\nand in males 16 to 26 years of age and on the demonstration of immunogenicity of Gardasil in 9- to \n15-year old children and adolescents.\n\nClinical Studies\n\nEfficacy in women 16 through 26 years\n\nThe efficacy of Gardasil in 16- through 26 year-old women was assessed in 4 placebo-controlled, \ndouble-blind, randomised Phase II and III clinical studies including a total of 20,541 women, who \nwere enrolled and vaccinated without pre-screening for the presence of HPV infection.  \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoints included HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related vulvar and vaginal lesions \n(genital warts, VIN, VaIN) and CIN of any grade and cervical cancers (Protocol 013, FUTURE I), \nHPV 16- or 18-related CIN 2/3 and AIS and cervical cancers (Protocol 015, FUTURE II), HPV 6-, \n11-, 16-, or 18-related persistent infection and disease (Protocol 007), and HPV 16-related persistent \ninfection (Protocol 005). The primary analyses of efficacy, with respect to vaccine HPV types (HPV 6, \n11, 16, and 18), were conducted in the per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population (i.e. all 3 vaccinations \nwithin 1 year of enrollment, no major protocol deviations and naïve to the relevant HPV type(s) prior \nto dose 1 and through 1 month Postdose 3 (Month 7)).\n\nEfficacy results are presented for the combined analysis of study protocols. The efficacy for \nHPV 16/18 related CIN 2/3 or AIS is based on data from protocols 005 (16-related endpoints only), \n007, 013, and 015. The efficacy for all other endpoints is based on protocols 007, 013, and 015. The \nmedian duration of follow-up for these studies was 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, and 3.0 years for Protocol 005, \nProtocol 007, Protocol 013, and Protocol 015, respectively. The median duration of follow-up for the \ncombined protocols (005, 007, 013, and 015) was 3.6 years. Results of individual studies support the \nresults from the combined analysis. Gardasil was efficacious against HPV disease caused by each of \nthe four vaccine HPV types. At end of study, individuals enrolled in the two Phase-III studies \n(Protocol-013 and Protocol-015), were followed for up to 4 years (median 3.7 years).\n\nCervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) Grade 2/3 (moderate to high-grade dysplasia) and \nadenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) were used in the clinical trials as a surrogate marker for cervical cancer.\n\nIn the long-term extension study of Protocol 015, 2,536 women 16-23 years old during vaccination \nwith Gardasil in the base study were followed. In the PPE population no cases of HPV diseases (HPV \ntypes 6/11/16/18 related high grade CIN) were observed up to approximately 14 years (median follow-\nup of 11.9 years). In this study, a durable protection was statistically demonstrated to approximately \n12 years.\n\nEfficacy in women naïve to the relevant vaccine HPV type(s)\n\nEfficacy was measured starting after the Month 7 visit. Overall, 73% of women were naïve (PCR \nnegative and seronegative) to all 4 HPV types at enrolment.\n\nThe efficacy results for relevant endpoints analysed at 2 years post-enrolment and at end of study \n(median duration of follow-up = 3.6 years) in the per-protocol population are presented in the Table 2.\n\nIn a supplemental analysis, the efficacy of Gardasil was evaluated against HPV 16/18-related CIN 3 \nand AIS.\n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nTable 2: Analysis of efficacy of Gardasil against high grade cervical lesions in the PPE population\nGardasil Placebo % \n\nEfficacy\nat 2 \n\nyears\n(95% \nCI)\n\nGardasil Placebo\n% \n\nEfficacy***\nat end of \n\nstudy\n(95% CI)\n\nNumber of \ncases\n\nNumber of\nindividuals*\n\nNumber of \ncases\n\nNumber of\nindividuals*\n\nNumber of \ncases\n\nNumber of\nindividuals*\n\nNumber of \ncases\n\nNumber of\nindividuals*\n\nHPV 16/18-\nrelated CIN \n2/3 or AIS\n\n0\n\n8487\n\n53\n\n8460\n\n100.0\n(92.9, \n100.0)\n\n2**\n\n8493\n\n112\n\n8464\n\n98.2\n(93.5, 99.8)\n\nHPV 16/18-\nrelated CIN 3\n\n0\n\n8487\n\n29\n\n8460\n\n100\n(86.5, \n100.0)\n\n2**\n\n8493\n\n64\n\n8464\n\n96.9\n(88.4, 99.6)\n\nHPV 16/18-\nrelated AIS\n\n0\n\n8487\n\n6\n\n8460\n\n100\n(14.8, \n100.0)\n\n0\n\n8493\n\n7\n\n8464\n\n100\n(30.6, \n100.0)\n\n*Number of individuals with at least one follow-up visit after Month 7\n**Based on virologic evidence, the first CIN 3 case in a patient chronically infected with HPV 52 is likely to be \ncausally related to HPV 52.

The efficacy for HPV 16/18 related CIN 2/3 or \nAIS is based on data from protocols 005 (16-related endpoints only), 007, 013, and 015. Patients were followed \nfor up to 4 years (median 3.6 years).\nNote: point estimates and confidence intervals are adjusted for person-time of follow-up.\n\nEfficacy against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related VIN 2/3 was 73.3% (95% CI: 40.3, 89.4), against \nHPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related VaIN 2/3 was 85.7% (95% CI: 37.6, 98.4), and against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, \n18-related genital warts was 80.3% (95% CI: 73.9, 85.3) in the combined protocols at end of study.\n\nOverall 12% of the combined study population had an abnormal Pap test suggestive of CIN at Day 1.\nAmong women with an abnormal Pap test at Day 1 who were naïve to the relevant vaccine HPV types \nat Day 1, efficacy of the vaccine remained high. Among women with an abnormal Pap test at Day 1 \nwho were already infected with the relevant vaccine HPV types at Day 1, no vaccine efficacy was \nobserved.\n\nProtection Against the Overall Burden of Cervical HPV disease in 16- Through 26-Year-Old Women\n\nThe impact of Gardasil against the overall risk for cervical, HPV disease (i.e., disease caused by any \nHPV type) was evaluated starting 30 days after the first dose in 17,599 individuals enrolled in the two \nPhase III efficacy trials (Protocols 013 and 015). Among women who were naïve to 14 common HPV \ntypes and had a negative Pap test at Day 1, administration of Gardasil reduced the incidence of \nCIN 2/3 or AIS caused by vaccine- or non-vaccine HPV types by 42.7% (95% CI: 23.7, 57.3) and of \ngenital warts by 82.8% (95% CI: 74.3, 88.8) at end of study.\n\nIn the modified ITT population, the benefit of the vaccine with respect to the overall incidence of \nCIN 2/3 or AIS (caused by any HPV type) and of genital warts was much lower, with a reduction of \n18.4% (95% CI: 7.0, 28.4) and 62.5% (95% CI: 54.0, 69.5), respectively, as Gardasil does not impact \nthe course of infections or disease that are present at vaccination onset.\n\nImpact on Definitive Cervical Therapy Procedures \n\nThe impact of Gardasil on rates of Definitive Cervical Therapy Procedures regardless of causal HPV \ntypes was evaluated in 18,150 individuals enrolled in Protocol 007, Protocols 013 and 015. In the HPV \nnaïve population (naïve to 14 common HPV types and had a negative Pap test at Day 1), Gardasil \nreduced the proportion of women who experienced a definitive cervical therapy procedure (Loop \nElectro-Excision Procedure or Cold-Knife Conization) by 41.9% (95% CI: 27.7, 53.5) at end of study. \nIn the ITT population the corresponding reduction was 23.9% (95% CI: 15.2, 31.7).\n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\nCross-protective efficacy\n\nThe efficacy of Gardasil against CIN (any grade) and CIN 2/3 or AIS caused by 10 non-vaccine HPV \ntypes (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59) structurally related to HPV 16 or HPV 18 was \nevaluated in the combined Phase III efficacy database (N = 17,599) after a median follow-up of \n3.7 years (at end of study). Efficacy against disease endpoints caused by pre-specified combinations of \nnon-vaccine HPV types was measured. The studies were not powered to assess efficacy against \ndisease caused by individual HPV types.\n\nThe primary analysis was done in type-specific populations that required women to be negative for the \ntype being analyzed, but who could be positive for other HPV types (96% of the overall population).\nThe primary time point analysis after 3 years did not reach statistical significance for all pre-specified \nendpoints. The final end-of-study results for the combined incidence of CIN 2/3 or AIS in this \npopulation after a median follow-up of 3.7 years are shown in Table 4. For composite endpoints, \nstatistically significant efficacy against disease was demonstrated against HPV types phylogenetically \nrelated to HPV 16 (primarily HPV 31) whereas no statistically significant efficacy was observed for \nHPV types phylogenetically related to HPV 18 (including HPV 45). For the 10 individual HPV types, \nstatistical significance was only reached for HPV 31.\n\nTable 4: Results for CIN 2/3 or AIS in Type-Specific HPV-Naïve Individuals† (end of study results)\nNaïve to ≥ 1 HPV Type\n\nComposite Endpoint\nGardasil Placebo\n\n% Efficacy 95% CIcases cases\n(HPV 31/45) ‡ 34 60 43.2% 12.1, 63.9\n\n(HPV 31/33/45/52/58) § 111 150 25.8% 4.6, 42.5\n10 non-vaccine HPV \n\nTypes║\n162 211 23.0% 5.1, 37.7\n\nHPV-16 related types (A9 \nspecies)\n\n111 157 29.1% 9.1, 44.9\n\nHPV 31 23 52 55.6% 26.2, 74.1†\n\nHPV 33 29 36 19.1% <0, 52.1†\n\nHPV 35 13 15 13.0% <0, 61.9†\n\nHPV 52 44 52 14.7% <0, 44.2†\n\nHPV 58 24 35 31.5% <0, 61.0†\n\nHPV-18 related types     \n(A7 species)\n\n34 46 25.9% <0, 53.9\n\nHPV 39 15 24 37.5% <0, 69.5†\n\nHPV 45 11 11 0.0% <0, 60.7†\n\nHPV 59 9 15 39.9% <0, 76.8†\n\nA5 species (HPV 51) 34 41 16.3% <0, 48.5†\n\nA6  species (HPV 56) 34 30 -13.7% <0, 32.5†\n† The studies were not powered to assess efficacy against disease caused by individual HPV types.\n‡ Efficacy was based on reductions in HPV 31-related CIN 2/3 or AIS\n§ Efficacy was based on reductions in HPV 31-, 33-, 52-, and 58-related CIN 2/3 or AIS\n║ Includes assay-identified non-vaccine HPV types 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59.  \n\nEfficacy in women 24 through 45 years\n\nThe efficacy of Gardasil in 24- through 45 year-old women was assessed in 1 placebo-controlled, \ndouble-blind, randomised Phase III clinical study (Protocol 019, FUTURE III) including a total of \n3,817 women, who were enrolled and vaccinated without pre-screening for the presence of HPV \ninfection.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoints included the combined incidence of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related and \nthe combined incidence of HPV 16- or HPV 18-related persistent infection (6 month definition), \ngenital warts, vulvar and vaginal lesions, CIN of any grade, AIS, and cervical cancers.

This population \napproximates to the general population of men with respect to prevalence of HPV infection or disease \nat enrolment.\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nThe efficacy of GARDASIL against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related external genital warts was 68.1% \n(95% CI: 48.8, 79.3). \n\nThe efficacy of GARDASIL against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related AIN 2/3 and HPV 16- or 18-related \nAIN 2/3, in the MSM substudy, was 54.2% (95% CI: 18.0, 75.3; 18/275 versus 39/276) and 57.5% \n(95% CI: -1.8, 83.9; 8/275 versus 19/276 cases), respectively.\n\nProtection Against the Overall Burden of HPV disease in 16- Through 26-Year-Old Men\n\nThe impact of Gardasil against the overall risk for external genital lesions was evaluated after the first \ndose in 2,545 individuals enrolled in the Phase III efficacy trial (Protocol 020). Among men who were \nnaïve to 14 common HPV types, administration of Gardasil reduced the incidence of external genital \nlesions caused by vaccine- or non-vaccine HPV types by 81.5% (95% CI: 58.0, 93.0). In the Full \nAnalysis Set (FAS) population, the benefit of the vaccine with respect to the overall incidence of EGL \nwas lower, with a reduction of 59.3% (95% CI: 40.0, 72.9), as Gardasil does not impact the course of \ninfections or disease that are present at vaccination onset. \n\nImpact on Biopsy and Definitive Therapy Procedures \n\nThe impact of Gardasil on rates of biopsy and treatment of EGL regardless of causal HPV types was \nevaluated in 2,545 individuals enrolled in Protocol 020. In the HPV naïve population (naïve to 14 \ncommon HPV types), Gardasil reduced the proportion of men who had a biopsy by 54.2% (95% CI: \n28.3, 71.4) and who were treated by 47.7% (95% CI: 18.4, 67.1) at end of study. In the FAS \npopulation, the corresponding reduction was 45.7% (95% CI: 29.0, 58.7) and 38.1% (95% CI: 19.4, \n52.6).\n\nImmunogenicity\n\nAssays to Measure Immune Response\n\nNo minimum antibody level associated with protection has been identified for HPV vaccines.\n\nThe immunogenicity of Gardasil was assessed in 20,132 (Gardasil n = 10,723; placebo n = 9,409) girls \nand women 9 to 26 years of age, 5,417 (Gardasil n = 3,109; placebo n = 2,308) boys and men 9 to \n26 years of age and 3,819 women 24 to 45 years of age (Gardasil n = 1,911, placebo n = 1,908).\n\nType-specific immunoassays, competitive Luminex-based immunoassay (cLIA), with type-specific \nstandards were used to assess immunogenicity to each vaccine type. This assay measures antibodies \nagainst a single neutralizing epitope for each individual HPV type.\n\nImmune Responses to Gardasil at 1 month post dose 3 \n\nIn the clinical studies in women 16 to 26 years of age, 99.8%, 99.8%, 99.8%, and 99.5% of individuals \nwho received Gardasil became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18-seropositive,\nrespectively, by 1 month Postdose 3. In the clinical study in women 24 to 45 years, 98.4%, 98.1%, \n98.8%, and 97.4% of individuals who received Gardasil became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-\nHPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 seropositive, respectively, by 1 month Postdose 3. In the clinical study in \nmen 16 to 26 years, 98.9%, 99.2%, 98.8%, and 97.4% of individuals who received Gardasil became \nanti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 seropositive, respectively, by 1 month \nPostdose 3. Gardasil induced high anti-HPV Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) 1 month Postdose 3 in all \nage groups tested.\n\nAs expected for women 24 to 45 years of age (Protocol 019), the observed antibody titres were lower \nthan that seen in women 16 to 26 years.\n\nAnti-HPV levels in placebo individuals who had cleared an HPV infection (seropositive and PCR \n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\nnegative) were substantially lower than those induced by the vaccine. Furthermore, anti-HPV levels \n(GMTs) in vaccinated individuals remained at or above serostatus cut-off during the long-term follow-\nup of the Phase III studies (see below under Persistence of Immune Response of Gardasil).\n\nBridging the Efficacy of Gardasil from Women to Girls\n\nA clinical study (Protocol 016) compared the immunogenicity of Gardasil in 10- to 15-year-old girls to \nthose in 16- to 23 year old women. In the vaccine group, 99.1 to 100% became seropositive to all \nvaccine serotypes by 1 month Postdose 3.\n\nTable 6 compares the 1 month Postdose 3 anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 GMTs in 9- to 15 year-old girls \nwith those in 16- to 26-year old women. \n\nTable 6: Immunogenicity bridging between 9- to 15-year-old girls and 16- to 26-year-old women (per-\nprotocol population) based on titres as measured by cLIA\n\n9- to 15-Year-Old Girls\n(Protocols 016 and 018)\n\n16- to 26-Year-Old Women\n(Protocols 013 and 015)\n\nn GMT (95% CI) n GMT (95% CI)\nHPV 6 915 929 (874, 987) 2631 543 (526, 560)\n\nHPV 11 915 1303 (1223, 1388) 2655 762 (735, 789)\nHPV 16 913 4909 (4548, 5300) 2570 2294 (2185, 2408)\nHPV 18 920 1040 (965, 1120) 2796 462 (444, 480)\nGMT- Geometric mean titre in mMU/ml (mMU = milli-Merck units)\n\nAnti-HPV responses at Month 7 among 9- to 15-year-old girls were non-inferior to anti-HPV \nresponses in 16- to 26-year-old women for whom efficacy was established in the Phase III studies. \nImmunogenicity was related to age and Month 7 anti-HPV levels were significantly higher in younger \nindividuals below 12 years of age than in those above that age.\n\nOn the basis of this immunogenicity bridging, the efficacy of Gardasil in 9- to 15-year-old girls is \ninferred.\n\nIn the long-term extension study of Protocol 018, 369 girls 9-15 years old during vaccination with \nGardasil in the base study were followed. In the PPE population, no cases of HPV diseases (HPV \ntypes 6/11/16/18 related CIN any grade and Genital Warts) were observed through 10.7 years (median \nfollow-up of 10.0 years).\n\nBridging the Efficacy of Gardasil from Men to Boys \n\nThree clinical studies (Protocols 016, 018 and 020) were used to compare the immunogenicity of \nGardasil in 9- to 15-year-old boys to 16- to 26-year-old men. In the vaccine group, 97.4 to 99.9% \nbecame seropositive to all vaccine serotypes by 1 month Postdose 3.\n\nTable 7 compares the 1 month Postdose 3 anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 GMTs in 9- to 15-year-old boys \nwith those in 16- to 26-year-old men. \n\nTable 7: Immunogenicity bridging between 9- to 15-year-old boys and 16- to 26-year-old men (per-\nprotocol population) based on titres as measured by cLIA\n\n9- to 15-Year-Old Boys 16- to 26-Year-Old Men\n\nn GMT (95% CI) n GMT (95% CI)\nHPV 6 884 1038 (964, 1117) 1093 448 (419, 479)\nHPV 11 885 1387 (1299, 1481) 1093 624 (588, 662)\nHPV 16 882 6057 (5601, 6549) 1136 2403 (2243, 2575)\nHPV 18 887 1357 (1249, 1475) 1175 403 (375, 433)\n\nGMT- Geometric mean titre in mMU/ml (mMU = milli-Merck units)\n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\nAnti-HPV responses at Month 7 among 9- to 15-year-old boys were non-inferior to anti-HPV \nresponses in 16- to 26-year-old men for whom efficacy was established in the Phase III studies. \nImmunogenicity was related to age and Month 7 anti-HPV levels were significantly higher in younger \nindividuals.\n\nOn the basis of this immunogenicity bridging, the efficacy of Gardasil in 9- to 15-year-old boys is \ninferred.\n\nIn the long-term extension study of Protocol 018, 326 boys 9-15 years old during vaccination with \nGardasil in the base study were followed. In the PPE population, no cases of HPV diseases (HPV \ntypes 6/11/16/18 related External Genital Lesions) were observed through 10.6 years (median follow-\nup of 9.9 years).\n\nPersistence of Immune Response of Gardasil\n\nA subset of individuals enrolled in the Phase III studies was followed up for a long-term period for \nsafety, immunogenicity and effectiveness. Total IgG Luminex Immunoassay (IgG LIA) was used to \nassess the persistence of immune response in addition to cLIA.\n\nIn all populations (women 9 – 45 years, men 9 – 26 years), peak anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-\nHPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 GMTs cLIA were observed at Month 7. Afterwards, the GMTs declined \nthrough Month 24 - 48 and then generally stabilized. The duration of immunity following a 3-dose \nseries has been observed for up to 14 years post-vaccination.\n\nGirls and boys vaccinated with Gardasil at 9-15 years of age in Protocol 018 base study were followed \nup in an extension study. Depending on HPV type, 60-96% and 78-98% of subjects were seropositive \nby cLIA and IgG LIA respectively 10 years after vaccination (see Table 8).\n\nTable 8: Long-term immunogenicity data (per-protocol population) based on percentage of \nseropositive subjects as measured by cLIA and IgG LIA (Protocol 018) at 10 years, in girls and boys \n9-15 years of age  \n\ncLIA IgG LIA\n\nn\n% of seropositive \n\nsubjects\nn % of seropositive subjects\n\nHPV 6 409 89% 430 93%\nHPV 11 409 89% 430 90%\nHPV 16 403 96% 426 98%\nHPV 18 408 60% 429 78%\n\nWomen vaccinated with Gardasil at 16-23 years of age in Protocol 015 base were followed up in an \nextension study. Fourteen years after vaccination, 91%, 91%, 98% and 52% were anti-HPV 6, anti-\nHPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 seropositive in the cLIA, respectively, and 98%, 98%, 100% \nand 94% were anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 seropositive in the IgG LIA, \nrespectively.\n\nWomen vaccinated with Gardasil at 24-45 years of age in Protocol 019 base study were followed up in \nan extension study. Ten years after vaccination, 79%, 85%, 94%, and 36% were anti-HPV 6, anti-\nHPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 seropositive in the cLIA, respectively, and 86%, 79%, 100% \nand 83% were anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 seropositive in the IgG LIA, \nrespectively.\n\nMen vaccinated with Gardasil at 16-26 years of age in Protocol 020 base study were followed up in an \nextension study. Ten years after vaccination, 79%, 80%, 95% and 40% were anti-HPV 6, anti-\nHPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 seropositive in the cLIA, respectively, and 92%, 92%, 100% \n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\nand 92% were anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 seropositive in the IgG LIA, \nrespectively.\n\nIn these studies, individuals who were seronegative for anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and \nanti-HPV 18 in the cLIA were still protected against clinical disease after a follow-up of 14 years for \n16-23 year-old women, 10 years for 24-45 year-old women, and 10 years for 16-26 year-old men.\n\nEvidence of Anamnestic (Immune Memory) Response\n\nEvidence of an anamnestic response was seen in vaccinated women who were seropositive to relevant \nHPV type(s) prior to vaccination. In addition, a subset of vaccinated women who received a challenge \ndose of Gardasil 5 years after the onset of vaccination, exhibited a rapid and strong anamnestic \nresponse that exceeded the anti-HPV GMTs observed 1 month Postdose 3. \n\nHIV infected subjects\n\nAn academic study documenting safety and immunogenicity of Gardasil has been performed in 126 \nHIV infected subjects aged from 7-12 years (of which 96 received Gardasil). Seroconversion to all \nfour antigens occurred in more than ninety-six percent of the subjects. The GMTs were somewhat \nlower than reported in non-HIV infected subjects of the same age in other studies. The clinical \nrelevance of the lower response is unknown. The safety profile was similar to non-HIV infected \nsubjects in other studies. The CD4% or plasma HIV RNA was not affected by vaccination. \n\nImmune Responses to Gardasil using a 2-dose schedule in individuals 9-13 years of age\n\nA clinical trial showed that among girls who received 2 doses of HPV vaccine 6 months apart, \nantibody responses to the 4 HPV types, one month after the last dose were non-inferior to those among \nyoung women who received 3 doses of the vaccine within 6 months.\n\nAt Month 7, in the Per Protocol population, the immune response in girls aged 9-13 years (n = 241) \nwho received 2 doses of Gardasil (at 0, 6 months) was non–inferior and numerically higher to the \nimmune response in women aged 16-26 years (n = 246) who received 3 doses of Gardasil (at 0, 2, \n6 months). \n\nAt 36 month follow-up, the GMT in girls (2 doses, n = 86) remained non-inferior to the GMT in \nwomen (3doses, n = 86) for all 4 HPV types.\n\nIn the same study, in girls aged 9-13 years, the immune response after a 2-dose schedule was \nnumerically lower than after a 3-dose schedule (n = 248 at Month 7; n = 82 at Month 36). The clinical \nrelevance of these findings is unknown. A subset of the study participants from the 2-dose group \n(n=50) were followed 5-years post-vaccination (Month 60 Postdose 1). Among the girls receiving 2 \ndoses of the vaccine, 96%, 100%, 100%, and 84% remained seropositive to anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, \nanti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18, respectively, in the cLIA.\n\nDuration of protection of a 2-dose schedule of Gardasil has not been established.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSingle-dose and repeated-dose toxicity and local tolerance studies revealed no special hazards to \nhumans.\n\nGardasil induced specific antibody responses against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in pregnant rats, \nfollowing one or multiple intramuscular injections. Antibodies against all four HPV types were \n\n \n\n\n\n18\n\ntransferred to the offspring during gestation and possibly during lactation. There were no treatment-\nrelated effects on developmental signs, behaviour, reproductive performance, or fertility of the \noffspring.\n\nGARDASIL administered to male rats at the full human dose (120 mcg total protein) had no effects on \nreproductive performance including fertility, sperm count, and sperm motility, and there were no \nvaccine-related gross or histomorphologic changes on the testes and no effects on testes weights.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Gardasil is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive Gardasil\n3. How Gardasil is given\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Gardasil \n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Gardasil is and what it is used for\n\nGardasil is a vaccine. Vaccination with Gardasil is intended to protect against diseases caused by \nHuman Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18. \n\nThese diseases include pre-cancerous lesions of the female genitals (cervix, vulva, and vagina); pre-\ncancerous lesions of the anus and genital warts in males and females; cervical and anal cancers. HPV\ntypes 16 and 18 are responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases, 75-80% of anal \ncancer cases; 70% of HPV-related pre-cancerous lesions of the vulva and vagina; 75% of HPV related \npre-cancerous lesions of the anus. HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for approximately 90% of\ngenital wart cases.\n\nGardasil is intended to prevent these diseases. The vaccine is not used to treat HPV related diseases. \nGardasil does not have any effect in individuals who already have a persistent infection or disease \nassociated with any of the HPV types in the vaccine. However, in individuals who are already infected \nwith one or more of the vaccine HPV types, Gardasil can still protect against diseases associated with \nthe other HPV types in the vaccine.\n\nGardasil cannot cause the diseases it protects against.\n\nGardasil produces type-specific antibodies and has been shown in clinical trials to prevent HPV 6-, \n11-, 16-, and 18-related diseases in women 16-45 years of age and in men 16-26 years of age. The \nvaccine also produces type-specific antibodies in 9- to 15-year-old children and adolescents. \n\nGardasil should be used in accordance with official guidelines.\n\n2. What you need to know before you receive Gardasil\n\nDo not receive Gardasil if:\n you or your child is allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the active substances or any of the other \n\ningredients of Gardasil (listed under “other ingredients”– see section 6).\n you or your child developed an allergic reaction after receiving a dose of Gardasil. \n you or your child suffer from an illness with high fever. However, a mild fever or upper \n\nrespiratory infection (for example cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.\n\n \n\n\n\n38\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if you or your child\n has a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal), for example \n\nhaemophilia \n has a weakened immune system, for example due to a genetic defect, HIV infection or \n\nmedicines that affect the immune system.\n\nFainting, sometimes accompanied by falling, can occur (mostly in adolescents) following any needle \ninjection. Therefore, tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection.\n\nAs with any vaccine, Gardasil may not fully protect 100% of those who get the vaccine.\n\nGardasil will not protect against every type of Human Papillomavirus. Therefore, appropriate \nprecautions against sexually transmitted disease should continue to be used.\n\nGardasil will not protect against other diseases that are not caused by Human Papillomavirus.\n\nVaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. You should continue to follow your \ndoctor’s advice on cervical smear/Pap tests and preventative and protective measures.\n\nWhat other important information should you or your child know about Gardasil\n\nLonger term follow-up studies were conducted to determine the duration of protection. The need for a \nbooster dose has not been established. \n\nOther medicines or vaccines and Gardasil\nGardasil can be given with a Hepatitis B vaccine or with a combined booster vaccine containing \ndiphtheria (d) and tetanus (T) with either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis \n[inactivated] (IPV) (dTap, dT-IPV, dTap-IPV vaccines) at a separate injection site (another part of \nyour body, e.g. the other arm or leg) during the same visit.\n\nGardasil may not have an optimal effect if:\n used with medicines that suppress the immune system.\n\nIn clinical trials, oral or other contraceptives (e.g. the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by \nGardasil.\n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking or have taken recently any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.\nGardasil may be given to women who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed.\n\nDriving and using machines\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.\n\n3. How Gardasil is given\n\nGardasil is given as an injection by your doctor. Gardasil is intended for adolescents and adults from 9 \nyears of age onwards.\n\n \n\n\n\n39\n\nIf you are from 9 to and including 13 years of age\nGardasil can be administered according to a 2-dose schedule:\n- First injection: at chosen date\n- Second injection: 6 months after first injection\nIf the second vaccine dose is administered earlier than 6 months after the first dose, a third dose should \nalways be administered.\n\nAlternatively, Gardasil can be administered according to a 3-dose schedule:\n- First injection: at chosen date\n- Second injection: 2 months after first injection\n- Third injection: 6 months after first injection\nThe second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose \nshould be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within \na 1-year period. Please speak to your doctor for more information.\n\nIf you are from 14 years of age\nGardasil should be administered according to a 3-dose schedule:\n- First injection: at chosen date\n- Second injection: 2 months after first injection\n- Third injection: 6 months after first injection\nThe second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose \nshould be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within \na 1-year period. Please speak to your doctor for more information.\n\nIt is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Gardasil complete the vaccination \ncourse with Gardasil.\n\nGardasil will be given as an injection through the skin into the muscle (preferably the muscle of the \nupper arm or thigh).\n\nThe vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines and solutions.\n\nIf you forget one dose of Gardasil:\n\nIf you miss a scheduled injection, your doctor will decide when to give the missed dose.\nIt is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits for the \nfollow-up doses. If you forget or are not able to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your \ndoctor for advice. When Gardasil is given as your first dose, the completion of the vaccination course \nshould be done with Gardasil, and not with another HPV vaccine.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all vaccines and medicines, Gardasil can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nThe following side effects can be seen after the use of Gardasil:\n\nVery commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients), side effects found at the injection site include: pain, \nswelling and redness. Headache was also seen.\n\nCommonly (more than 1 in 100 patients), side effects found at the injection site include: bruising, \nitching, pain in extremity. Fever and nausea have also been reported.\n\nRarely (less than 1 in 1000 patients): hives (urticaria).\n\n \n\n\n\n40\n\nVery rarely (less than 1 in 10,000 patients), difficulty breathing (bronchospasm) has been reported.\n\nWhen Gardasil was given with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis [acellular, component] and \npoliomyelitis [inactivated] booster vaccine during the same visit, there was more headache and \ninjection-site swelling. \n\nSide effects that have been reported during marketed use include:\n\nFainting, sometimes accompanied by shaking or stiffening, has been reported. Although fainting \nepisodes are uncommon, patients should be observed for 15 minutes after they receive HPV vaccine.  \n\nAllergic reactions that may include difficulty breathing, wheezing (bronchospasm), hives and rash \nhave been reported. Some of these reactions have been severe.\n\nAs with other vaccines, side effects that have been reported during general use include: swollen glands \n(neck, armpit, or groin); muscle weakness, abnormal sensations, tingling in the arms, legs and upper \nbody, or confusion (Guillain-Barré Syndrome, Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis); dizziness, \nvomiting, joint pain, aching muscles, unusual tiredness or weakness, chills, generally feeling unwell, \nbleeding or bruising more easily than normal, and skin infection at the injection site.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine.\n\n5. How to store Gardasil\n\nKeep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children.\nDo not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the vial label and the outer carton (after \nEXP). The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.\nStore in a refrigerator (2ºC - 8ºC).\nDo not freeze.\nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.\n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

Vaccination with Gardasil is intended to protect against diseases caused by \nHuman Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18. \n\nThese diseases include pre-cancerous lesions of the female genitals (cervix, vulva, and vagina); pre-\ncancerous lesions of the anus and genital warts in males and females; cervical and anal cancers. HPV\ntypes 16 and 18 are responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases, 75-80% of anal \ncancer cases; 70% of HPV-related pre-cancerous lesions of the vulva and vagina, 75% of HPV related \npre-cancerous lesions of the anus. HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for approximately 90% of\ngenital wart cases.\n\nGardasil is intended to prevent these diseases. The vaccine is not used to treat HPV related diseases. \nGardasil does not have any effect in individuals who already have a persistent infection or disease \nassociated with any of the HPV types in the vaccine. However, in individuals who are already infected \nwith one or more of the vaccine HPV types, Gardasil can still protect against diseases associated with \nthe other HPV types in the vaccine.\n\nGardasil cannot cause the diseases it protects against.\n\nGardasil produces type-specific antibodies and has been shown in clinical trials to prevent HPV 6-, \n11-, 16-, and 18-related diseases in women 16-45 years of age and in men 16-26 years of age. The \nvaccine also produces type-specific antibodies in 9- to 15-year-old children and adolescents. \n\nGardasil should be used in accordance with official guidelines.\n\n2. What you need to know before you receive Gardasil\n\nDo not receive Gardasil if:\n you or your child is allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the active substances or any of the other \n\ningredients of Gardasil (listed under “other ingredients”– see section 6).\n you or your child developed an allergic reaction after receiving a dose of Gardasil. \n you or your child suffer from an illness with high fever. However, a mild fever or upper \n\nrespiratory infection (for example cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.\n\n \n\n\n\n46\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if you or your child\n has a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal), for example \n\nhaemophilia \n has a weakened immune system, for example due to a genetic defect, HIV infection or \n\nmedicines that affect the immune system. \n\nFainting, sometimes accompanied by falling, can occur (mostly in adolescents) following any needle \ninjection. Therefore, tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection.\n\nAs with any vaccine, Gardasil may not fully protect 100% of those who get the vaccine.\n\nGardasil will not protect against every type of Human Papillomavirus. Therefore, appropriate \nprecautions against sexually transmitted disease should continue to be used.\n\nGardasil will not protect against other diseases that are not caused by Human Papillomavirus.\n\nVaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. You should continue to follow your \ndoctor’s advice on cervical smear/Pap tests and preventative and protective measures.\n\nWhat other important information should you or your child know about Gardasil\n\nLonger term follow-up studies were conducted to determine the duration of protection. The need for a \nbooster dose has not been established. \n\nOther medicines or vaccines and Gardasil\nGardasil can be given with a Hepatitis B vaccine or with a combined booster vaccine containing \ndiphtheria (d) and tetanus (T) with either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis \n[inactivated] (IPV) (dTap, dT-IPV, dTap-IPV vaccines) at a separate injection site (another part of \nyour body, e.g. the other arm or leg) during the same visit.\n\nGardasil may not have an optimal effect if:\n used with medicines that suppress the immune system.\n\nIn clinical trials, oral or other contraceptives (e.g. the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by \nGardasil.\n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking or have taken recently any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.\nGardasil may be given to women who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed.\n\nDriving and using machines\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.\n\n3. How Gardasil is given\n\nGardasil is given as an injection by your doctor. Gardasil is intended for adolescents and adults from \n9 years of age onwards.\n\n \n\n\n\n47\n\nIf you are from 9 to and including 13 years of age\nGardasil can be administered according to a 2-dose schedule:\n- First injection: at chosen date\n- Second injection: 6 months after first injection\nIf the second vaccine dose is administered earlier than 6 months after the first dose, a third dose should \nalways be administered.\n\nAlternatively, Gardasil can be administered according to a 3-dose schedule:\n- First injection: at chosen date\n- Second injection: 2 months after first injection\n- Third injection: 6 months after first injection\nThe second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose \nshould be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within \na 1-year period. Please speak to your doctor for more information.\n\nIf you are from 14 years of age\nGardasil should be administered according to a 3-dose schedule:\n- First injection: at chosen date\n- Second injection: 2 months after first injection\n- Third injection: 6 months after first injection\nThe second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose \nshould be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within \na 1-year period. Please speak to your doctor for more information.\n\nIt is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Gardasil complete the vaccination \ncourse with Gardasil.\n\nGardasil will be given as an injection through the skin into the muscle (preferably the muscle of the \nupper arm or thigh).\n\nThe vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines and solutions.\n\nIf you forget one dose of Gardasil:\n\nIf you miss a scheduled injection, your doctor will decide when to give the missed dose.\nIt is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits for the \nfollow-up doses. If you forget or are not able to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your \ndoctor for advice. When Gardasil is given as your first dose, the completion of the vaccination course \nshould be done with Gardasil, and not with another HPV vaccine.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all vaccines and medicines, Gardasil can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nThe following side effects can be seen after the use of Gardasil:\n\nVery commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients), side effects found at the injection site include: pain,\nswelling and redness. Headache was also seen.\n\nCommonly (more than 1 in 100 patients), side effects found at the injection site include: bruising, \nitching, pain in extremity. Fever and nausea have also been reported. \n\nRarely (less than 1 in 1000 patients): hives (urticaria).\n\n \n\n\n\n48\n\nVery rarely (less than 1 in 10,000 patients), difficulty breathing (bronchospasm) has been reported.\n\nWhen Gardasil was given with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis [acellular, component] and \npoliomyelitis [inactivated] booster vaccine during the same visit, there was more headache and \ninjection-site swelling. \n\nSide effects that have been reported during marketed use include:\n\nFainting, sometimes accompanied by shaking or stiffening, has been reported. Although fainting \nepisodes are uncommon, patients should be observed for 15 minutes after they receive HPV vaccine.\n\nAllergic reactions that may include difficulty breathing, wheezing (bronchospasm), hives and rash \nhave been reported. Some of these reactions have been severe.\n\nAs with other vaccines, side effects that have been reported during general use include: swollen glands \n(neck, armpit, or groin); muscle weakness, abnormal sensations, tingling in the arms, legs and upper \nbody, or confusion (Guillain-Barré Syndrome, Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis); dizziness, \nvomiting, joint pain, aching muscles, unusual tiredness or weakness, chills, generally feeling unwell, \nbleeding or bruising more easily than normal, and skin infection at the injection site.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine.\n\n5. How to store Gardasil\n\nKeep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children.\nDo not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the syringe label and the outer carton \n(after EXP). The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.\nStore in a refrigerator (2ºC - 8ºC).\nDo not freeze.\nKeep the syringe in the outer carton in order to protect from light.\n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.
