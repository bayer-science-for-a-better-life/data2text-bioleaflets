CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMalignant pleural mesothelioma \nALIMTA in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of chemotherapy na\u00efve patients \nwith unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nALIMTA in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology \n(see section 5.1). \n \nALIMTA is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or metastatic \nnon-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology in patients whose disease \nhas not progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy (see section 5.1). \n \nALIMTA is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with locally advanced \nor metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology (see section \n5.1). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nALIMTA must only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the use of \nanti-cancer chemotherapy. \n \nALIMTA in combination with cisplatin \nThe recommended dose of ALIMTA is 500 mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA) administered as an \nintravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. The recommended dose of \ncisplatin is 75 mg/m2 BSA infused over two hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the \npemetrexed infusion on the first day of each 21-day cycle. Patients must receive adequate anti-emetic \ntreatment and appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving cisplatin (see also cisplatin \nSummary of Product Characteristics for specific dosing advice). \n \nALIMTA as single agent \nIn patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of \nALIMTA is 500 mg/m2 BSA administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day \nof each 21-day cycle. \n \nPre-medication regimen \nTo reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day prior \nto, on the day of, and the day after pemetrexed administration. The corticosteroid should be equivalent \nto 4 mg of dexamethasone administered orally twice a day (see section 4.4). \n \nTo reduce toxicity, patients treated with pemetrexed must also receive vitamin supplementation (see \nsection 4.4). Patients must take oral folic acid or a multivitamin containing folic acid (350 to \n1000 micrograms) on a daily basis. At least five doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven \ndays preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing must continue during the full course of \ntherapy and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. Patients must also receive an intramuscular \ninjection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed and \nonce every three cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be given on the same day as \npemetrexed. \n \nMonitoring \nPatients receiving pemetrexed should be monitored before each dose with a complete blood count, \nincluding a differential white cell count (WCC) and platelet count. Prior to each chemotherapy \nadministration blood chemistry tests should be collected to evaluate renal and hepatic function. Before \nthe start of any cycle of chemotherapy, patients are required to have the following: absolute neutrophil \ncount (ANC) should be \u2265 1500 cells/mm3 and platelets should be \u2265 100,000 cells/mm3. \n \nCreatinine clearance should be \u2265 45 ml/min. \n \nThe total bilirubin should be \u2264 1.5 times upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate \naminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) should be \u2264 3 times \nupper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase, AST and ALT \u2264 5 times upper limit of normal is \nacceptable if liver has tumour involvement. \n \nDose adjustments \nDose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir haematologic counts or \nmaximum non-haematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. Treatment may be delayed \nto allow sufficient time for recovery. Upon recovery patients should be retreated using the guidelines \nin Tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for ALIMTA used as a single agent or in combination with \ncisplatin. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 1 - Dose modification table for ALIMTA (as single agent or in combination) and \ncisplatin \u2013 Haematologic toxicities \n\nNadir ANC < 500 /mm3 and nadir platelets \n\u2265 50,000 /mm3 \n\n75 % of previous dose (both ALIMTA and \ncisplatin) \n\nNadir platelets  <50,000 /mm3 regardless of \nnadir ANC \n\n75 % of previous dose (both ALIMTA and \ncisplatin) \n\nNadir platelets <50,000/mm3 with bleedinga,  \nregardless of nadir ANC \n\n50% of previous dose (both ALIMTA and \ncisplatin) \n\n a These criteria meet the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI \n1998) definition of \u2265CTC Grade 2 bleeding \n\n \nIf patients develop non-haematologic toxicities \u2265 Grade 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), ALIMTA should \nbe withheld until resolution to less than or equal to the patient\u2019s pre-therapy value. Treatment should \nbe resumed according to the guidelines in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2 - Dose modification table for ALIMTA (as single agent or in combination) and \ncisplatin\u2013 Non-haematologic toxicities a, b \n\n Dose of ALIMTA \n(mg/m2) \n\nDose for cisplatin (mg/m2) \n\nAny Grade 3 or 4 toxicities except \nmucositis \n\n75 % of previous dose 75 % of previous dose \n\nAny diarrhoea requiring \nhospitalisation (irrespective of \ngrade) or grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea. \n\n75 % of previous dose 75 % of previous dose \n\nGrade 3 or 4 mucositis 50 % of previous dose 100 % of previous dose \n\n a National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) b Excluding \nneurotoxicity \n\n \nIn the event of neurotoxicity, the recommended dose adjustment for ALIMTA and cisplatin is \ndocumented in Table 3. Patients should discontinue therapy if Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity is observed. \n \n\nTable 3 - Dose modification table for ALIMTA (as single agent or in combination) and \ncisplatin \u2013 Neurotoxicity \n\nCTC a Grade Dose of ALIMTA (mg/m2) Dose for cisplatin (mg/m2) \n\n0 \u2013 1 100 % of previous dose 100 % of previous dose \n\n2  100 % of previous dose 50 % of previous dose \n\n a National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) \n \nTreatment with ALIMTA should be discontinued if a patient experiences any haematologic or \nnon-haematologic Grade 3 or 4 toxicity after 2 dose reductions or immediately if Grade 3 or 4 \nneurotoxicity is observed.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nIn clinical studies, there has been no indication that patients 65 years of age or older are at increased \nrisk of adverse reaction compared to patients younger than 65 years old. No dose reductions other than \nthose recommended for all patients are necessary.  \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPaediatric population  \nThere is no relevant use of ALIMTA in the paediatric population in malignant pleural mesothelioma \nand non-small cell lung cancer. \n \nPatients with renal impairment (standard cockcroft and gault formula or glomerular filtration rate \nmeasured Tc99m-DPTA serum clearance method)  \nPemetrexed is primarily eliminated unchanged by renal excretion. In clinical studies, patients with \ncreatinine clearance of \u2265 45 ml/min required no dose adjustments other than those recommended for \nall patients. There are insufficient data on the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance \nbelow 45 ml/min; therefore the use of pemetrexed is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo relationships between AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), or total bilirubin and pemetrexed \npharmacokinetics were identified. However patients with hepatic impairment such as bilirubin > 1.5 \ntimes the upper limit of normal and/or aminotransferase > 3.0 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic \nmetastases absent) or > 5.0 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic metastases present) have not been \nspecifically studied. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nALIMTA is for intravenous use. ALIMTA should be administered as an intravenous infusion over \n10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. \n \nFor precautions to be taken before handling or administering ALIMTA and for instructions on \nreconstitution and dilution of ALIMTA before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \nConcomitant yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPemetrexed can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia (or pancytopenia) (see section 4.8). Myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. \nPatients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy and pemetrexed should not be \ngiven to patients until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) returns to \u2265 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count \nreturns to \u2265 100,000 cells/mm3. Dose reductions for subsequent cycles are based on nadir ANC, \nplatelet count and maximum non-haematologic toxicity seen from the previous cycle (see section 4.2). \n \nLess toxicity and reduction in Grade 3/4 haematologic and non-haematologic toxicities such as \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3/4 neutropenia were reported when \npre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 was administered. Therefore, all patients treated with \npemetrexed must be instructed to take folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce \ntreatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2). \n \nSkin reactions have been reported in patients not pre-treated with a corticosteroid. Pre-treatment with \ndexamethasone (or equivalent) can reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nAn insufficient number of patients has been studied with creatinine clearance of below 45 ml/min. \nTherefore, the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance of < 45 ml/min is not \nrecommended (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPatients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min) should \navoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic \nacid (> 1.3 g daily) for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed administration \n(see section 4.5). \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency eligible for pemetrexed therapy NSAIDs with \nlong elimination half-lives should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, and at least \n2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.5). \n \nSerious renal events, including acute renal failure, have been reported with pemetrexed alone or in \nassociation with other chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the patients in whom these occurred had \nunderlying risk factors for the development of renal events including dehydration or pre-existing \nhypertension or diabetes. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular necrosis were also reported \nin post marketing setting with pemetrexed alone or with other chemotherapeutic agents. Most of these \nevents resolved after pemetrexed withdrawal. Patients should be regularly monitored for acute tubular \nnecrosis, decreased renal function and signs and symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (e.g. \nhypernatraemia). \n \nThe effect of third space fluid, such as pleural effusion or ascites, on pemetrexed is not fully defined. \nA phase 2 study of pemetrexed in 31 solid tumour patients with stable third space fluid demonstrated \nno difference in pemetrexed dose normalized plasma concentrations or clearance compared to patients \nwithout third space fluid collections. Thus, drainage of third space fluid collection prior to pemetrexed \ntreatment should be considered, but may not be necessary.  \n \nDue to the gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed given in combination with cisplatin, severe \ndehydration has been observed. Therefore, patients should receive adequate antiemetic treatment and \nappropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving treatment. \n \nSerious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events have been \nuncommonly reported during clinical studies with pemetrexed, usually when given in combination \nwith another cytotoxic agent. Most of the patients in whom these events have been observed had pre-\nexisting cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.8). \n \nImmunodepressed status is common in cancer patients. As a result, concomitant use of live attenuated \nvaccines is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nPemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are advised not to father a \nchild during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive measures or abstinence are \nrecommended. Owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men \nare advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed \n(see section 4.6). \n \nCases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with radiation either prior, \nduring or subsequent to their pemetrexed therapy.  Particular attention should be paid to these patients \nand caution exercised with use of other radiosensitising agents.  \n \nCases of radiation recall have been reported in patients who received radiotherapy weeks or years \npreviously.  \n \nExcipients \n \nALIMTA 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium- free\u2019. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nALIMTA 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nThis medicinal product contains 54 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 2,7 % of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPemetrexed is mainly eliminated unchanged renally by tubular secretion and to a lesser extent by \nglomerular filtration. Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. aminoglycoside, loop \ndiuretics, platinum compounds, cyclosporin) could potentially result in delayed clearance of \npemetrexed. This combination should be used with caution. If necessary, creatinine clearance should \nbe closely monitored.  \n \nConcomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g. probenecid, penicillin) \ncould potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed. Caution should be made when these drugs \nare combined with pemetrexed. If necessary, creatinine clearance should be closely monitored. \n \nIn patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min), high doses of non-steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen > 1600 mg/day) and acetylsalicylic acid at \nhigher dose (> 1.3 g daily) may decrease pemetrexed elimination and, consequently, increase the \noccurrence of pemetrexed adverse reactions. Therefore, caution should be made when administering \nhigher doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid, concurrently with pemetrexed to patients with normal \nfunction (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min). \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min), the \nconcomitant administration of pemetrexed with NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid at \nhigher dose should be avoided for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed \nadministration (see section 4.4).  \n \nIn the absence of data regarding potential interaction with NSAIDs having longer half-lives such as \npiroxicam or rofecoxib, the concomitant administration with pemetrexed in patients with mild to \nmoderate renal insufficiency should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, and at \nleast 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4). If concomitant administration of \nNSAIDs is necessary, patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, especially myelosuppression \nand gastrointestinal toxicity. \n \nPemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. Results from in vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes indicated that pemetrexed would not be predicted to cause clinically significant inhibition \nof the metabolic clearance of drugs metabolised by CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2. \n \nInteractions common to all cytotoxics \nDue to the increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer, the use of anticoagulation treatment is \nfrequent. The high intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during diseases and the \npossibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and anticancer chemotherapy require increased \nfrequency of INR (International Normalised Ratio) monitoring, if it is decided to treat the patient with \noral anticoagulants. \n \nConcomitant use contraindicated: Yellow fever vaccine: risk of fatal generalised vaccinale disease (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended: Live attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever, for which \nconcomitant use is contraindicated): risk of systemic, possibly fatal, disease. The risk is increased in \nsubjects who are already immunosuppressed by their underlying disease. Use an inactivated vaccine \nwhere it exists (poliomyelitis) (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed. \nPemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are advised not to father a \nchild during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive measures or abstinence are \nrecommended. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women but pemetrexed, like other \nanti-metabolites, is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. \nAnimal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Pemetrexed should not be used \nduring pregnancy unless clearly necessary, after a careful consideration of the needs of the mother and \nthe risk for the foetus (see section 4.4).  \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether pemetrexed is excreted in human milk and adverse reactions on the \nbreast-feeding child cannot be excluded.  Breast-feeding must be discontinued during pemetrexed \ntherapy (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \nOwing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men are advised to \nseek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, it \nhas been reported that pemetrexed may cause fatigue. Therefore patients should be cautioned against \ndriving or operating machines if this event occurs. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported undesirable effects related to pemetrexed, whether used as monotherapy \nor in combination, are bone marrow suppression manifested as anaemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, \nthrombocytopenia; and gastrointestinal toxicities, manifested as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, \nconstipation, pharyngitis, mucositis, and stomatitis. Other undesirable effects include renal toxicities, \nincreased aminotransferases, alopecia, fatigue, dehydration, rash, infection/sepsis and neuropathy. \nRarely seen events include Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe table 4 lists the adverse drug events regardless of causality associated with pemetrexed used either \nas a monotherapy treatment or in combination with cisplatin from the pivotal registration studies \n(JMCH, JMEI, JMBD, JMEN and PARAMOUNT) and from the post marketing period. \n \nADRs are listed by MedDRA body system organ class. The following convention has been used for \nclassification of frequency: very common: \u2265 1/10; common: \u2265 1/100 to < 1/10; uncommon: \u2265 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100; rare: \u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000; very rare: < 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data). \n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 4.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nReported symptoms of overdose include neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, sensory \npolyneuropathy and rash. Anticipated complications of overdose include bone marrow suppression as \nmanifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. In addition, infection with or without \nfever, diarrhoea, and/or mucositis may be seen. In the event of suspected overdose, patients should be \nmonitored with blood counts and should receive supportive therapy as necessary. The use of calcium \nfolinate / folinic acid in the management of pemetrexed overdose should be considered. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Folic acid analogues, ATC code: L01BA04  \n \nALIMTA (pemetrexed) is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by \ndisrupting crucial folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting \nthymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide \nformyltransferase (GARFT), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of \nthymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate \ncarrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is rapidly \nand efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The \npolyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more potent inhibitors of TS and GARFT. \nPolyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumour cells and, to a \nlesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life \nresulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nALIMTA in all subsets of the paediatric population in the granted indications (see Section 4.2). \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nMesothelioma \n \nEMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus \ncisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, has shown that patients treated \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n\nwith ALIMTA and cisplatin had a clinically meaningful 2.8-month median survival advantage over \npatients receiving cisplatin alone. \n \nDuring the study, low-dose folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation was introduced to patients\u2019 \ntherapy to reduce toxicity. The primary analysis of this study was performed on the population of all \npatients randomly assigned to a treatment arm who received study drug (randomised and treated). A \nsubgroup analysis was performed on patients who received folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation \nduring the entire course of study therapy (fully supplemented).

The separation \nbetween the treatment arms was achieved by improvement in lung function in the ALIMTA/cisplatin \narm and deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm. \n \nThere are limited data in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with ALIMTA alone. \nALIMTA at a dose of 500 mg/m2 was studied as a single-agent in 64 chemonaive patients with \nmalignant pleural mesothelioma. The overall response rate was 14.1 %. \n \nNSCLC, second-line treatment \n \nA multicentre, randomised, open label phase 3 study of ALIMTA versus docetaxel in patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy has shown median survival times of \n8.3 months for patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent To Treat population n = 283) and 7.9 months for \npatients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288). Prior chemotherapy did not include ALIMTA. An \nanalysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on the treatment effect on overall survival was in favour of \nALIMTA versus docetaxel for other than predominantly squamous histologies (n = 399, 9.3 versus \n8.0 months, adjusted HR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0 .61-1.00, p = 0.047) and was in favour of docetaxel for \nsquamous cell carcinoma histology (n = 172, 6.2 versus 7.4 months, adjusted HR = 1.56; \n\n\n\n13 \n\n95% CI = 1.08-2.26, p = 0.018). There were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety \nprofile of ALIMTA within the histology subgroups. \n \nLimited clinical data from a separate randomized, Phase 3, controlled trial, suggest that efficacy data \n(overall survival, progression free survival) for pemetrexed are similar between patients previously pre \ntreated with docetaxel (n = 41) and patients who did not receive previous docetaxel treatment \n(n = 540). \n\n \nTable 6.

All patients \nincluded in this study had an ECOG performance status 0 or 1.   \n \nThe primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population. Sensitivity analyses of main efficacy \nendpoints were also assessed on the Protocol Qualified (PQ) population. The efficacy analyses using \nPQ population are consistent with the analyses for the ITT population and support the non-inferiority \nof AC versus GC.  \n \nProgression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate were similar between treatment arms: \nmedian PFS was 4.8 months for ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus 5.1 months for gemcitabine plus \ncisplatin (adjusted hazard ratio 1.04; 95% CI = 0.94-1.15), and overall response rate was 30.6% \n(95% CI = 27.3-33.9) for ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus 28.2% (95% CI = 25.0-31.4) for gemcitabine \nplus cisplatin. PFS data were partially confirmed by an independent review (400/1725 patients were \nrandomly selected for review).  \n \nThe analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on overall survival demonstrated clinically relevant \ndifferences in survival according to histology, see table below. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nTable 7.

First line doublet therapy containing ALIMTA was not included. All patients included in \nthis study had an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Patients received maintenance treatment until \ndisease progression. Efficacy and safety were measured from the time of randomisation after \ncompletion of first line (induction) therapy. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of maintenance \ntreatment with ALIMTA and 3.5 cycles of placebo. A total of 213 patients (48.3%) completed \n\u2265 6 cycles and a total of 103 patients (23.4%) completed \u2265 10 cycles of treatment with ALIMTA. \n \nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the \nALIMTA arm over the placebo arm (n = 581, independently reviewed population; median of \n4.0 months and 2.0 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.49-0.73, p < 0.00001). The \nindependent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of PFS.  The \nmedian OS for the overall population (n = 663) was 13.4 months for the ALIMTA arm and 10.6 \nmonths for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.79 (95% CI = 0.65-0.95, p = 0.01192). \n \nConsistent with other ALIMTA studies, a difference in efficacy according to NSCLC histology was \nobserved in JMEN. For patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology \n(n = 430, independently reviewed population) median PFS was 4.4 months for the ALIMTA arm and \n1.8 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.47 (95% CI = 0.37-0.60, p = 0.00001). The median \nOS for patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n = 481) was \n15.5 months for the ALIMTA arm and 10.3 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.70 \n(95% CI = 0.56-0.88, p = 0.002). Including the induction phase the median OS for patients with \nNSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology was 18.6 months for the ALIMTA arm and \n13.6 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.71 (95% CI = 0.56-0.88, p = 0.002). \n \nThe PFS and OS results in patients with squamous cell histology suggested no advantage for ALIMTA \nover placebo.  \n \nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of ALIMTA within the \nhistology subgroups. \n \nJMEN: Kaplan Meier plots of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival ALIMTA \nversus placebo in patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology: \n \n                   Progression-Free Survival   Overall Survival  \n\nPFS Time (months)\n0 6 12 18\n\nPF\nS \n\nPr\nob\n\nab\nilit\n\ny\n\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n\nPemetrexed   \nPlacebo    \n\nSurvival Time (months)\n0 6 12 18 24 30 36 42\n\nSu\nrv\n\niv\nal\n\n P\nro\n\nba\nbi\n\nlit\ny\n\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n\nPemetrexed   \nPlacebo    \n\n \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nPARAMOUNT \nA multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (PARAMOUNT), \ncompared the efficacy and safety of continuation maintenance treatment with ALIMTA plus BSC \n(n = 359) with that of placebo plus BSC (n = 180) in patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or \nmetastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology who did not progress \nafter 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy of ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin. Of the 939 \npatients treated with ALIMTA plus cisplatin induction, 539 patients were randomised to maintenance \ntreatment with pemetrexed or placebo. Of the randomised patients, 44.9% had a complete/partial \nresponse and 51.9% had a response of stable disease to ALIMTA plus cisplatin induction. Patients \nrandomised to maintenance treatment were required to have an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. The \nmedian time from the start of ALIMTA plus cisplatin induction therapy to the start of maintenance \ntreatment was 2.96 months on both the pemetrexed arm and the placebo arm. Randomised patients \nreceived maintenance treatment until disease progression. Efficacy and safety were measured from the \ntime of randomisation after completion of first line (induction) therapy. Patients received a median of \n4 cycles of maintenance treatment with ALIMTA and 4 cycles of placebo. A total of 169 patients \n(47.1%) completed \u2265 6 cycles maintenance treatment with ALIMTA, representing at least 10 total \ncycles of ALIMTA. \n \nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the \nALIMTA arm over the placebo arm (n = 472, independently reviewed population; median of \n3.9 months and 2.6 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.51-0.81, p = 0.0002). The \nindependent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of PFS. For \nrandomised patients, as measured from the start of ALIMTA plus cisplatin first line induction \ntreatment, the median investigator-assessed PFS was 6.9 months for the ALIMTA arm and 5.6 months \nfor the placebo arm (hazard ratio = 0.59 95% CI = 0.47-0.74).  \n \nFollowing ALIMTA plus cisplatin induction (4 cycles), treatment with ALIMTA was statistically \nsuperior to placebo for OS (median 13.9 months versus 11.0 months, hazard ratio = 0.78, \n95%CI=0.64-0.96, p=0.0195).  At the time of this final survival analysis, 28.7% of patients were alive \nor lost to follow up on the ALIMTA arm versus 21.7% on the placebo arm.  The relative treatment \neffect of ALIMTA was internally consistent across subgroups (including disease stage, induction \nresponse, ECOG PS, smoking status, gender, histology and age) and similar to that observed in the \nunadjusted OS and PFS analyses.  The 1 year and 2 year survival rates for patients on ALIMTA were \n58% and 32% respectively, compared to 45% and 21% for patients on placebo.  From the start of \nALIMTA plus cisplatin first line induction treatment, the median OS of patients was 16.9 months for \nthe ALIMTA arm and 14.0 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio= 0.78, 95% CI= 0.64-0.96).  The \npercentage of patients that received post study treatment was 64.3% for ALIMTA and 71.7% for \nplacebo. \n\nPARAMOUNT:Kaplan Meier plot of progression-free survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) \nfor continuation ALIMTA maintenance versus placebo in patients with NSCLC other than \npredominantly squamous cell histology (measured from randomisation)  \n\n           Progression-Free Survival    Overall Survival \n\n \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nThe ALIMTA maintenance safety profiles from the two studies JMEN and PARAMOUNT were \nsimilar. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed following single-agent administration have been \nevaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumours at doses ranging from 0.2 to \n838 mg/m2 infused over a 10-minute period. Pemetrexed has a steady-state volume of distribution of \n9 l/m2. In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is approximately 81 % bound to plasma proteins. \nBinding was not notably affected by varying degrees of renal impairment. Pemetrexed undergoes \nlimited hepatic metabolism. Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70 % to 90 % of the \nadministered dose being recovered unchanged in urine within the first 24 hours following \nadministration. In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is actively secreted by OAT3 (organic anion \ntransporter. Pemetrexed total systemic clearance is 91.8 ml/min and the elimination half-life from \nplasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of 90 ml/min). \nBetween patient variability in clearance is moderate at 19.3 %. Pemetrexed total systemic exposure \n(AUC) and maximum plasma concentration increase proportionally with dose. The pharmacokinetics \nof pemetrexed are consistent over multiple treatment cycles. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed are not influenced by concurrently administered \ncisplatin. Oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B12 supplementation do not affect the \npharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdministration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice resulted in decreased foetal viability, decreased foetal \nweight, incomplete ossification of some skeletal structures and cleft palate.  \n \nAdministration of pemetrexed to male mice resulted in reproductive toxicity characterised by reduced \nfertility rates and testicular atrophy. In a study conducted in beagle dog by intravenous bolus injection \nfor 9 months, testicular findings (degeneration/necrosis of the seminiferous epithelium) have been \nobserved.  This suggests that pemetrexed may impair male fertility. Female fertility was not \ninvestigated.  \n \nPemetrexed was not mutagenic in either the in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster \novary cells, or the Ames test. Pemetrexed has been shown to be clastogenic in the in vivo \nmicronucleus test in the mouse. \n \nStudies to assess the carcinogenic potential of pemetrexed have not been conducted. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nMannitol \nHydrochloric acid \nSodium hydroxide \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nPemetrexed is physically incompatible with diluents containing calcium, including lactated Ringer\u2019s \ninjection and Ringer\u2019s injection. In the absence of other compatibility studies this medicinal product \nmust not be mixed with other medicinal products. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vial \n3 years. \n \nReconstituted and infusion solutions   \nWhen prepared as directed, reconstituted and infusion solutions of ALIMTA contain no antimicrobial \npreservatives. Chemical and physical in-use stability of reconstituted and infusion solutions of \npemetrexed were demonstrated for 24 hours at refrigerated temperature. From a microbiological point \nof view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and \nconditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C \nto 8\u00b0C. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nALIMTA 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nType I glass vial with rubber stopper containing 100 mg of pemetrexed. \nPack of 1 vial.  \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \nALIMTA 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nType I glass vial with rubber stopper containing 500 mg of pemetrexed. \nPack of 1 vial. \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling  \n \n1. Use aseptic technique during the reconstitution and further dilution of pemetrexed for \n\nintravenous infusion administration. \n \n\n2. Calculate the dose and the number of ALIMTA vials needed. Each vial contains an excess of \npemetrexed to facilitate delivery of label amount. \n\n \n3. ALIMTA 100 mg \n\nReconstitute 100-mg vials with 4.2 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for \ninjection, without preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed.  \n\n \nALIMTA 500 mg \nReconstitute 500-mg vials with 20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection, \nwithout preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed.  \n\n \nGently swirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting solution is clear \nand ranges in colour from colourless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting \nproduct quality. The pH of the reconstituted solution is between 6.6 and 7.8. Further dilution is \nrequired. \n\n \n4. The appropriate volume of reconstituted pemetrexed solution must be further diluted to 100 ml \n\nwith sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection, without preservative, and \nadministered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes. \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\n5. Pemetrexed infusion solutions prepared as directed above are compatible with polyvinyl \nchloride and polyolefin lined administration sets and infusion bags. \n\n \n6. Parenteral medicinal products must be inspected visually for particulate matter and \n\ndiscolouration prior to administration. If particulate matter is observed, do not administer. \n \n\n7. Pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material \nmust be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \nPreparation and administration precautions \nAs with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and \npreparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. If a pemetrexed \nsolution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If \npemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. Pemetrexed is not \na vesicant. There is not a specific antidote for extravasation of pemetrexed. There have been few \nreported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, which were not assessed as serious by the investigator. \nExtravasation should be managed by local standard practice as with other non-vesicants. \n \n \n7.

What ALIMTA is and what it is used for \n \nALIMTA is a medicine used in the treatment of cancer. \n \nALIMTA is given in combination with cisplatin, another anti-cancer medicine, as treatment for \nmalignant pleural mesothelioma, a form of cancer that affects the lining of the lung, to patients who \nhave not received prior chemotherapy.  \n \nALIMTA is also given in combination with cisplatin for the initial treatment of patients with \nadvanced stage of lung cancer. \n \nAlimta can be prescribed to you if you have lung cancer at an advanced stage if your disease has \nresponded to treatment or it remains largely unchanged after initial chemotherapy.  \n \nALIMTA is also a treatment for patients with advanced stage of lung cancer whose disease has \nprogressed after other initial chemotherapy has been used. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use ALIMTA \n \nDo not use ALIMTA \n-  if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to pemetrexed or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n-  if you are breast-feeding; you must discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with ALIMTA. \n-  if you have recently received or are about to receive a vaccine against yellow fever.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or hospital pharmacist before receiving ALIMTA. \n \nIf you currently have or have previously had problems with your kidneys, talk to your doctor or \nhospital pharmacist as you may not be able to receive ALIMTA. \n\n\n\n32 \n\nBefore each infusion you will have samples of your blood taken to evaluate if you have sufficient \nkidney and liver function and to check that you have enough blood cells to receive ALIMTA. Your \ndoctor may decide to change the dose or delay treating you depending on your general condition and if \nyour blood cell counts are too low. If you are also receiving cisplatin, your doctor will make sure that \nyou are properly hydrated and receive appropriate treatment before and after receiving cisplatin to \nprevent vomiting. \n \nIf you have had or are going to have radiation therapy, please tell your doctor, as there may be an early \nor late radiation reaction with ALIMTA. \n \nIf you have been recently vaccinated, please tell your doctor, as this can possibly cause bad effects \nwith ALIMTA. \n \nIf you have heart disease or a history of heart disease, please tell your doctor. \n  \nIf you have an accumulation of fluid around your lungs, your doctor may decide to remove the fluid \nbefore giving you ALIMTA. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine should not be used in children or adolescents, since there is no experience with this \nmedicine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and ALIMTA \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking any medicine for pain or inflammation (swelling), such as \nmedicines called \u201cnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\u201d (NSAIDs), including medicines purchased \nwithout a doctor\u2019s prescription (such as ibuprofen). There are many sorts of NSAIDs with different \ndurations of activity. Based on the planned date of your infusion of ALIMTA and/or on the status of \nyour kidney function, your doctor needs to advise you on which medicines you can take and when you \ncan take them. If you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your medicines are NSAIDs. \n \nPlease tell your doctor or hospital pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor.

Women must use effective contraception during treatment \nwith ALIMTA. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIf you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor.  \nBreast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with ALIMTA. \n \nFertility \nMen are advised not to father a child during and up to 6 months following treatment with ALIMTA \nand should therefore use effective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for up to 6 \nmonths afterwards. If you would like to father a child during the treatment or in the 6 months \nfollowing receipt of treatment, seek advice from your doctor or pharmacist. You may want to seek \ncounselling on sperm storage before starting your therapy. \n \nDriving and using machines \nALIMTA may make you feel tired.

This is \nequivalent to 2,7 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \n3. How to use ALIMTA \n \nThe dose of ALIMTA is 500 milligrams for every square metre of your body\u2019s surface area. Your \nheight and weight are measured to work out the surface area of your body. Your doctor will use this \nbody surface area to work out the right dose for you.  This dose may be adjusted, or treatment may be \ndelayed depending on your blood cell counts and on your general condition. A hospital pharmacist, \nnurse or doctor will have mixed the ALIMTA powder with 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution \nfor injection before it is given to you. \n \nYou will always receive ALIMTA by infusion into one of your veins. The infusion will last \napproximately 10 minutes. \n \nWhen using ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin: \nThe doctor or hospital pharmacist will work out the dose you need based on your height and weight. \nCisplatin is also given by infusion into one of your veins, and is given approximately 30 minutes after \nthe infusion of ALIMTA has finished. The infusion of cisplatin will last approximately 2 hours. \n \nYou should usually receive your infusion once every 3 weeks. \n \nAdditional medicines: \nCorticosteriods: your doctor will prescribe you steroid tablets (equivalent to 4 milligram of \ndexamethasone twice a day) that you will need to take on the day before, on the day of, and the day \nafter ALIMTA treatment. This medicine is given to you to reduce the frequency and severity of skin \nreactions that you may experience during your anticancer treatment. \n \nVitamin supplementation: your doctor will prescribe you oral folic acid (vitamin) or a multivitamin \ncontaining folic acid (350 to 1000 micrograms) that you must take once a day while you are taking \nALIMTA. You must take at least 5 doses during the seven days before the first dose of ALIMTA. You \nmust continue taking the folic acid for 21 days after the last dose of ALIMTA. You will also receive \nan injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before administration of ALIMTA and then \napproximately every 9 weeks (corresponding to 3 courses of ALIMTA treatment). Vitamin B12 and \nfolic acid are given to you to reduce the possible toxic effects of the anticancer treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

Use aseptic techniques during the reconstitution and further dilution of pemetrexed for \n\nintravenous infusion administration. \n \n2. Calculate the dose and the number of ALIMTA vials needed. Each vial contains an excess of \n\npemetrexed to facilitate delivery of the label amount. \n \n3. ALIMTA 100 mg: \n\nReconstitute each 100 mg vial with 4.2 ml of 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for \ninjection, without preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. \n \nALIMTA 500 mg: \nReconstitute each 500 mg vial with 20 ml of 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for \ninjection, without preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. \n \nGently swirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting solution is clear \nand ranges in colour from colourless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting \nproduct quality. The pH of the reconstituted solution is between 6.6 and 7.8. Further dilution is \nrequired. \n\n \n4. The appropriate volume of reconstituted pemetrexed solution must be further diluted to 100 ml \n\nwith 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution for injection, without preservative, and \nadministered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes. \n\n \n5. Pemetrexed infusion solutions prepared as directed above are compatible with polyvinyl \n\nchloride and polyolefin lined administration sets and infusion bags. Pemetrexed is incompatible \nwith diluents containing calcium, including lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection and Ringer\u2019s Injection. \n\n \n6. Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and \n\ndiscolouration prior to administration. If particulate matter is observed, do not administer. \n \n7. Pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. Any unused product or waste material should be \n\ndisposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nPreparation and administration precautions:  As with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, \ncare should be exercised in the handling and preparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. The use of \ngloves is recommended. If a pemetrexed solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and \nthoroughly with soap and water. If pemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush \nthoroughly with water. Pemetrexed is not a vesicant. There is not a specific antidote for extravasation \nof pemetrexed. There have been a few reported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, which were not \nassessed as serious by the investigator. Extravasation should be managed by local standard practice \nas with other non-vesicants. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.

your height and weight are measured to work out the surface area of your body. your doctor will use this body surface area to work out the right dose for you. this dose may be adjusted, or treatment may be delayed depending on your blood cell counts and on your general condition. a hospital pharmacist, nurse or doctor will have mixed the alimta powder with 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution for injection before it is given to you. you will always receive alimta by infusion into one of your veins. the infusion will last approximately 10 minutes. when using alimta in combination with cisplatin: the doctor or hospital pharmacist will work out the dose you need based on your height and weight. cisplatin is also given by infusion into one of your veins, and is given approximately 30 minutes after the infusion of alimta has finished. the infusion of cisplatin will last approximately 2 hours. you should usually receive your infusion once every 3 weeks. additional medicines: corticosteriods: your doctor will prescribe you steroid tablets (equivalent to 4 milligram of dexamethasone twice a day) that you will need to take on the day before, on the day of, and the day after alimta treatment. this medicine is given to you to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions that you may experience during your anticancer treatment. vitamin supplementation: your doctor will prescribe you oral folic acid (vitamin) or a multivitamin containing folic acid (350 to 1000 micrograms) that you must take once a day while you are taking alimta. you must take at least 5 doses during the seven days before the first dose of alimta. you must continue taking the folic acid for 21 days after the last dose of alimta. you will also receive an injection of vitamin b12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before administration of alimta and then approximately every 9 weeks (corresponding to 3 courses of alimta treatment). vitamin b12 and folic acid are given to you to reduce the possible toxic effects of the anticancer treatment. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "alimta", "Type":
