PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate).\n\nA white to yellow powder.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nZavicefta is indicated for the treatment of the following infections in adults (see sections 4.4 and 5.1):\n\n Complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI)\n Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including pyelonephritis \n Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP)\n\nZavicefta is also indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in \nadult patients with limited treatment options (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nIt is recommended that Zavicefta should be used to treat infections due to aerobic Gram-negative \norganisms in adult patients with limited treatment options only after consultation with a physician with \nappropriate experience in the management of infectious diseases (see section 4.4).\n\nPosology\n\nTable 1 shows the recommended intravenous dose for patients with estimated creatinine clearance\n(CrCL) ≥ 51 mL/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n\n\n3\n\nTable 1 Recommended intravenous dose for patients with estimated CrCL ≥ 51 mL/min1\n\nType of infection Dose of\nceftazidime/avibactam\n\nFrequency Infusion \ntime\n\nDuration of treatment\n\nComplicated IAI2, 3 2 g/0.5 g Every 8 \nhours\n\n2 hours 5-14 days\n\nComplicated UTI, \nincluding \npyelonephritis3\n\n2 g/0.5 g Every 8 \nhours\n\n2 hours 5-10 days4\n\nHospital-acquired \npneumonia, including \nVAP3\n\n2 g/0.5 g Every 8 \nhours\n\n2 hours 7-14 days\n\nInfections due to \naerobic Gram-negative \norganisms in patients \nwith limited treatment \noptions2,3\n\n2 g/0.5 g Every 8 \nhours\n\n2 hours Guided by the severity \nof the infection, the \npathogen(s) and the \npatient’s clinical and \nbacteriological \nprogress5\n\n1 CrCL estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula\n2 To be used in combination with metronidazole when anaerobic pathogens are known or suspected to be \n\ncontributing to the infectious process\n3 To be used in combination with an antibacterial agent active against Gram-positive pathogens when these are \nknown or suspected to be contributing to the infectious process\n4 The total duration shown may include intravenous Zavicefta followed by appropriate oral therapy\n5 There is very limited experience with the use of Zavicefta for more than 14 days\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nNo dosage adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment (estimated CrCL ≥ 51 -\n≤ 80 mL/min) (see section 5.2).\n\nTable 2 shows the recommended dose adjustments for patients with estimated CrCL ≤ 50 mL/min (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nTable 2 Recommended intravenous doses for patients with estimated CrCL ≤ 50 mL/min1\n\nEstimated CrCL\n(mL/min)\n\nDose regimen2 Frequency Infusion time\n\n31-50 1 g/0.25 g Every 8 hours 2 hours\n16-30 0.75 g/0.1875 g Every 12 hours 2 hours\n6-15 0.75 g/0.1875 g Every 24 hours 2 hours\n\nESRD including on \nhaemodialysis3\n\n0.75 g/0.1875 g Every 48 hours 2 hours\n\n1 CrCL estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula\n2 Dose recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic modelling\n3 Ceftazidime and avibactam are removed by haemodialysis (see sections 4.9 and 5.2). Dosing of Zavicefta on \n\nhaemodialysis days should occur after completion of haemodialysis.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n4\n\nPaediatric population\nSafety and efficacy in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet been established. \n\nCurrently available data are described in section 4.8 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nZavicefta is administered by intravenous infusion over 120 minutes in an infusion volume of 100 mL.\n\nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration see \nsection 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nHypersensitivity to any cephalosporin antibacterial agent.\n\nSevere hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylactic reaction, severe skin reaction) to any other type of β-lactam \nantibacterial agent (e.g. penicillins, monobactams or carbapenems).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\n\nSerious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions are possible (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). In case \nof hypersensitivity reactions, treatment with Zavicefta must be discontinued immediately and adequate \nemergency measures must be initiated. \n\nBefore beginning treatment, it should be established whether the patient has a history of \nhypersensitivity reactions to ceftazidime, to other cephalosporins or to any other type of β-lactam \nantibacterial agent. Caution should be used if ceftazidime/avibactam is given to patients with a history \nof non-severe hypersensitivity to penicillins, monobactams or carbapenems.\n\nClostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea\n\nClostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea has been reported with ceftazidime/avibactam, and can range \nin severity from mild to life-threatening. This diagnosis should be considered in patients who present \nwith diarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of Zavicefta (see section 4.8). \nDiscontinuation of therapy with Zavicefta and the administration of specific treatment for Clostridium \ndifficile should be considered. Medicinal products that inhibit peristalsis should not be given.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nCeftazidime and avibactam are eliminated via the kidneys, therefore, the dose should be reduced \naccording to the degree of renal impairment (see section 4.2). Neurological sequelae, including tremor, \nmyoclonus, non-convulsive status epilepticus, convulsion, encephalopathy and coma, have \noccasionally been reported with ceftazidime when the dose has not been reduced in patients with renal \nimpairment.\n\nIn patients with renal impairment, close monitoring of estimated creatinine clearance is advised. In \nsome patients, the creatinine clearance estimated from serum creatinine can change quickly, especially\nearly in the course of treatment for the infection.\n\n\n\n5\n\nNephrotoxicity\n\nConcurrent treatment with high doses of cephalosporins and nephrotoxic medicinal products such as \naminoglycosides or potent diuretics (e.g. furosemide) may adversely affect renal function. \n\nDirect antiglobulin test (DAGT or Coombs test) seroconversion and potential risk of haemolytic \nanaemia\n\nCeftazidime/avibactam use may cause development of a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAGT, or \nCoombs test), which may interfere with the cross-matching of blood and/or may cause drug induced \nimmune haemolytic anaemia (see section 4.8). While DAGT seroconversion in patients receiving \nZavicefta was very common in clinical studies (the estimated range of seroconversion across Phase 3 \nstudies was 3.2% to 20.8% in patients with a negative Coombs test at baseline and at least one follow-\nup test), there was no evidence of haemolysis in patients who developed a positive DAGT on \ntreatment. However, the possibility that haemolytic anaemia could occur in association with Zavicefta\ntreatment cannot be ruled out. Patients experiencing anaemia during or after treatment with Zavicefta\nshould be investigated for this possibility.\n\nLimitations of the clinical data\n\nClinical efficacy and safety studies of Zavicefta have been conducted in cIAI, cUTI and HAP\n(including VAP).\n\nComplicated intra-abdominal infections\nIn two studies in patients with cIAI, the most common diagnosis (approximately 42%) was \nappendiceal perforation or peri-appendiceal abscess. Approximately 87% of patients had APACHE II \nscores of ≤ 10 and 4.0% had bacteraemia at baseline. Death occurred in 2.1% (18/857) of patients who \nreceived Zavicefta and metronidazole and in 1.4% (12/863) of patients who received meropenem.\n\nAmong a subgroup with baseline CrCL 30 to 50 mL/min death occurred in 16.7% (9/54) of patients \nwho received Zavicefta and metronidazole and 6.8% (4/59) of patients who received meropenem. \nPatients with CrCL 30 to 50 mL/min received a lower dose of Zavicefta than is currently \nrecommended for patients in this sub-group.\n\nComplicated urinary tract infections\nIn two studies in patients with cUTI, 381/1091 (34.9%) patients were enrolled with cUTI without \npyelonephritis while 710 (65.1%) were enrolled with acute pyelonephritis (mMITT population). A \ntotal of 81 cUTI patients (7.4%) had bacteraemia at baseline.\n\nHospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia\nIn a single study in patients with nosocomial pneumonia 280/808 (34.7%) had VAP and 40/808 (5.0%) \nwere bacteraemic at baseline.\n\nPatients with limited treatment options\nThe use of ceftazidime/avibactam to treat patients with infections due to Gram-negative aerobic \npathogens who have limited treatment options is based on experience with ceftazidime alone and on \nanalyses of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship for ceftazidime/avibactam (see section \n5.1).\n\nSpectrum of activity of ceftazidime/avibactam\n\nCeftazidime has little or no activity against the majority of Gram-positive organisms and anaerobes \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.1). Additional antibacterial agents should be used when these pathogens are \nknown or suspected to be contributing to the infectious process. \n\n\n\n6\n\nThe inhibitory spectrum of avibactam includes many of the enzymes that inactivate ceftazidime, \nincluding Ambler class A β-lactamases and class C β-lactamases. Avibactam does not inhibit class B \nenzymes (metallo-β-lactamases) and is not able to inhibit many of the class D enzymes (see section \n5.1).\n\nNon-susceptible organisms\n\nProlonged use may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms (e.g. enterococci, fungi), \nwhich may require interruption of treatment or other appropriate measures.\n\nInterference with laboratory tests\n\nCeftazidime may interfere with copper reduction methods (Benedict's, Fehling's, Clinitest) for \ndetection of glycosuria leading to false positive results. Ceftazidime does not interfere with enzyme-\nbased tests for glycosuria.\n\nControlled sodium diet\n\nEach vial contains a total of 6.44 mmol of sodium (approximately 148 mg), equivalent to 7.4% of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake for sodium. The maximum daily dose of this product is \nequivalent to 22.2% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake for sodium.\n\nThis should be considered when administering Zavicefta to patients who are on a controlled sodium \ndiet.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn vitro, avibactam is a substrate of OAT1 and OAT3 transporters which might contribute to the active \nuptake of avibactam from the blood compartment and therefore affect its excretion. Probenecid (a \npotent OAT inhibitor) inhibits this uptake by 56% to 70% in vitro and, therefore, has the potential to \nalter the elimination of avibactam. Since a clinical interaction study of avibactam and probenecid has \nnot been conducted, co-administration of avibactam with probenecid is not recommended.\n\nAvibactam showed no significant inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro. Avibactam and \nceftazidime showed no in vitro cytochrome P450 induction at clinically relevant concentrations. \nAvibactam and ceftazidime do not inhibit the major renal or hepatic transporters in the clinically\nrelevant exposure range, therefore the interaction potential via these mechanisms is considered to be \nlow.\n\nClinical data have demonstrated that there is no interaction between ceftazidime and avibactam, and \nbetween ceftazidime/avibactam and metronidazole. \n\nOther types of interaction\nConcurrent treatment with high doses of cephalosporins and nephrotoxic medicinal products such as \naminoglycosides or potent diuretics (e.g. furosemide) may adversely affect renal function (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nChloramphenicol is antagonistic in vitro with ceftazidime and other cephalosporins. The clinical \nrelevance of this finding is unknown, but due to the possibility of antagonism in vivo this drug \ncombination should be avoided.\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nAnimal studies with ceftazidime do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \npregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Animal studies with \navibactam have shown reproductive toxicity without evidence of teratogenic effects (see section 5.3).\n\nCeftazidime/avibactam should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the \npossible risk. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nCeftazidime is excreted in human milk in small quantities. It is unknown whether avibactam is \nexcreted in human milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made \nwhether to discontinue breast feeding or to discontinue/abstain from ceftazidime/avibactam therapy \ntaking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\n\nThe effects of ceftazidime/avibactam on fertility in humans have not been studied. No data are \navailable on animal studies with ceftazidime. Animal studies with avibactam do not indicate harmful \neffects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nUndesirable effects may occur (e.g. dizziness), which may influence the ability to drive and use \nmachines following administration of Zavicefta (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nIn seven Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, 2024 adult patients were treated with Zavicefta. The most \ncommon adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 5% of patients treated with Zavicefta were Coombs direct \ntest positive, nausea, and diarrhoea. Nausea and diarrhoea were usually mild or moderate in intensity. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with ceftazidime alone and/or identified during the \nPhase 2 and Phase 3 trials with Zavicefta. Adverse reactions are classified according to frequency and \nSystem Organ Class. Frequency categories are derived from adverse reactions and/or potentially \nclinically significant laboratory abnormalities, and are defined according to the following conventions:\n\nVery common (≥1/10)\nCommon (≥1/100 and <1/10)\nUncommon (≥1/1,000 and <1/100)\nRare (≥1/10,000 and <1/1000)\nVery rare (<1/10,000)\nUnknown (cannot be estimated from the available data)\n\nTable 3 Frequency of adverse reactions by system organ class\nSystem Organ\n\nClass\n\nVery \n\ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Very rare Unknown\n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations\n\nCandidiasis \n\n(including \n\nClostridium \n\ndifficile colitis\n\n\n\n8\n\nSystem Organ\n\nClass\n\nVery \n\ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Very rare Unknown\n\nVulvovaginal \n\ncandidiasis and \n\nOral candidiasis)\n\nPseudomembran\n\nous colitis\n\nBlood and \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders\n\nCoombs \n\ndirect test \n\npositive\n\nEosinophilia\n\nThrombocytosis\n\nThrombocytopenia\n\nNeutropenia\n\nLeukopenia\n\nLymphocytosis\n\nAgranulocytosis\n\nHaemolytic \n\nanaemia\n\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nAnaphylactic \nreaction\n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders\n\nHeadache\n\nDizziness\n\nParaesthesia\n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders\n\nDiarrhoea \n\nAbdominal pain\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nDysgeusia\n\nHepatobiliary \n\ndisorders\n\nAlanine \n\naminotransferase \n\nincreased\n\nAspartate \n\naminotransferase \n\nincreased\n\nBlood alkaline \n\nphosphatase \n\nincreased\n\nGamma-\n\nglutamyltransferase \n\nincreased\n\nBlood lactate \n\ndehydrogenase\n\nIncreased\n\nJaundice\n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders\n\nRash maculo-\n\npapular\n\nUrticaria\n\nPruritus\n\nToxic epidermal \n\nnecrolysis\n\nStevens-Johnson \n\nsyndrome\n\nErythema \n\nmultiforme\n\nAngioedema\n\nDrug Reaction \nwith Eosinophilia \n\n\n\n9\n\nSystem Organ\n\nClass\n\nVery \n\ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Very rare Unknown\n\nand Systemic \nSymptoms \n(DRESS)\n\nRenal and \n\nurinary \n\ndisorders\n\nBlood creatinine \n\nincreased \n\nBlood urea \n\nincreased\n\nAcute kidney \n\ninjury\n\nTubulointerstitial \n\nnephritis\n\nGeneral \n\ndisorders and \n\nadministration \n\nsite conditions\n\nInfusion site \n\nthrombosis\n\nInfusion site \n\nphlebitis\n\nPyrexia\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety assessment in children is based on the safety data from 1 trial in which 61 paediatric \npatients aged from 3 years to less than 18 years with cIAI received Zavicefta. Overall, the safety \nprofile in these 61 children was similar to that observed in the adult population with cIAI.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nOverdose with ceftazidime/avibactam can lead to neurological sequelae including encephalopathy, \n\nconvulsions and coma, due to the ceftazidime component. \n\nSerum levels of ceftazidime can be reduced by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. During a 4-hour \nhaemodialysis period, 55% of the avibactam dose was removed.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, ceftazidime, combinations, ATC code: \nJ01DD52\n\n\n\n10\n\nMechanism of action\n\nCeftazidime inhibits bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis following binding to penicillin binding \nproteins (PBPs), which leads to bacterial cell lysis and death. Avibactam is a non β-lactam, β-\nlactamase inhibitor that acts by forming a covalent adduct with the enzyme that is stable to hydrolysis. \nIt inhibits both Ambler class A and class C β-lactamases and some class D enzymes, including \nextended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), KPC and OXA-48 carbapenemases, and AmpC enzymes. \nAvibactam does not inhibit class B enzymes (metallo-β-lactamases) and is not able to inhibit many\nclass D enzymes. \n\nResistance\n\nBacterial resistance mechanisms that could potentially affect ceftazidime/avibactam include mutant or \nacquired PBPs, decreased outer membrane permeability to either compound, active efflux of either \ncompound, and β-lactamase enzymes refractory to inhibition by avibactam and able to hydrolyse \nceftazidime.\n\nAntibacterial activity in combination with other antibacterial agents\n\nNo synergy or antagonism was demonstrated in in vitro drug combination studies with \nceftazidime/avibactam and metronidazole, tobramycin, levofloxacin, vancomycin, linezolid, colistin \nand tigecycline.\n\nSusceptibility testing breakpoints\n\nMinimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on \nAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for ceftazidime/avibactam are as follows:\nOrganisms Susceptible Resistant\nEnterobacteriaceae ≤8 mg/L >8 mg/L\nPseudomonas aeruginosa ≤8 mg/L >8 mg/L\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship\n\nThe antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime against specific pathogens has been shown to best correlate \nwith the percent time of free-drug concentration above the ceftazidime/avibactam minimum inhibitory \nconcentration over the dose interval (%fT >MIC of ceftazidime/avibactam). For avibactam the PK-PD \nindex is the percent time of the free drug concentration above a threshold concentration over the dose \ninterval (% fT >CT).\n\nClinical efficacy against specific pathogens\n\nEfficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against the following pathogens that were \nsusceptible to ceftazidime/avibactam in vitro.\n\nComplicated intra-abdominal infections\nGram-negative micro-organisms\n\n Citrobacter freundii\n Enterobacter cloacae\n Escherichia coli\n Klebsiella oxytoca\n Klebsiella pneumoniae\n Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\n\n\n11\n\nComplicated urinary-tract infections\nGram-negative micro-organisms\n\n Escherichia coli \n Klebsiella pneumoniae \n Proteus mirabilis\n Enterobacter cloacae\n Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nHospital-acquired pneumonia including ventilator-associated pneumonia\nGram-negative micro-organisms\n\n Enterobacter cloacae\n Escherichia coli\n Klebsiella pneumoniae \n Proteus mirabilis\n Serratia marcescens\n Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nClinical efficacy has not been established against the following pathogens that are relevant to the \napproved indications although in vitro studies suggest that they would be susceptible to \nceftazidime/avibactam in the absence of acquired mechanisms of resistance.\n\nGram-negative micro-organisms\n Citrobacter koseri\n Enterobacter aerogenes\n Morganella morganii\n Proteus vulgaris\n Providencia rettgeri\n\nIn-vitro data indicate that the following species are not susceptible to ceftazidime/avibactam.\n\n Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-reistant)\n\n Anaerobes\n\n Enterococcus spp.\n\n Stenotrophomonas maltophilia\n\n Acinetobacter spp.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nZavicefta in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of intra-abdominal \ninfections, urinary tract infections, pneumonia and Gram-negative bacterial infections (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nDistribution\n\nThe human protein binding of both ceftazidime and avibactam is approximately 10% and 8%, \nrespectively. The steady-state volumes of distribution of ceftazidime and avibactam were about 22 L \nand 18 L, respectively in healthy adults following multiple doses of 2000 mg/500 mg \nceftazidime/avibactam infused over 2 hours every 8 hours. Both ceftazidime and avibactam penetrate \ninto human bronchial epithelial lining fluid (ELF) to the same extent with concentrations around 30% \nof those in plasma. The concentration time profiles are similar for ELF and plasma.\n\n\n\n12\n\nPenetration of ceftazidime into the intact blood-brain barrier is poor. Ceftazidime concentrations of 4 \nto 20 mg/L or more are achieved in the CSF when the meninges are inflamed. Avibactam penetration \nof the blood brain barrier has not been studied clinically; however, in rabbits with inflamed meninges, \nCSF exposures of ceftazidime and avibactam were 43% and 38% of plasma AUC, respectively. \nCeftazidime crosses the placenta readily, and is excreted in the breast milk. \n\nBiotransformation\n\nCeftazidime is not metabolised. No metabolism of avibactam was observed in human liver \npreparations (microsomes and hepatocytes). Unchanged avibactam was the major drug-related \ncomponent in human plasma and urine following dosing with [14C]-avibactam.\n\nElimination\n\nThe terminal half-life (t½) of both ceftazidime and avibactam is about 2 h after intravenous\nadministration. Ceftazidime is excreted unchanged into the urine by glomerular filtration; \napproximately 80-90% of the dose is recovered in the urine within 24 h. Avibactam is excreted \nunchanged into the urine with a renal clearance of approximately 158 mL/min, suggesting active \ntubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration. Approximately 97% of the avibactam dose is \nrecovered in the urine, 95% within 12 h. Less than 1% of ceftazidime is excreted via the bile and less \nthan 0.25% of avibactam is excreted into faeces.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of both ceftazidime and avibactam are approximately linear across the dose \nrange studied (50 mg to 2000 mg) for a single intravenous administration. No appreciable \naccumulation of ceftazidime or avibactam was observed following multiple intravenous infusions of \n2000 mg/500 mg of ceftazidime/avibactam administered every 8 hours for up to 11 days in healthy \nadults with normal renal function.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nElimination of ceftazidime and avibactam is decreased in patients with moderate or severe renal \nimpairment. The average increases in avibactam AUC are 3.8-fold and 7-fold in subjects with \nmoderate and severe renal impairment, see section 4.2.\n\nHepatic impairment\nMild to moderate hepatic impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime in \nindividuals administered 2 g intravenously every 8 hours for 5 days, provided renal function was not \nimpaired. The pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not \nbeen established. The pharmacokinetics of avibactam in patients with any degree of hepatic \nimpairment has not been studied. \n\nAs ceftazidime and avibactam do not appear to undergo significant hepatic metabolism, the systemic \nclearance of either active substance is not expected to be significantly altered by hepatic impairment. \n\nElderly patients (≥65 years)\nReduced clearance of ceftazidime was observed in elderly patients, which was primarily due to age-\nrelated decrease in renal clearance of ceftazidime. The mean elimination half-life of ceftazidime \nranged from 3.5 to 4 hours following intravenous bolus dosing with 2 g every 12 hours in elderly \npatients aged 80 years or older.\n\nFollowing a single intravenous administration of 500 mg avibactam as a 30-minute IV infusion, the \nelderly had a slower terminal half-life of avibactam, which may be attributed to age related decrease in \nrenal clearance. \n\n\n\n13\n\nGender and race\nThe pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime/avibactam is not significantly affected by gender or race.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nCeftazidime\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, reproduction toxicity or genotoxicity. Carcinogenicity studies \nhave not been conducted with ceftazidime.\n\nAvibactam\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity or genotoxicity. Carcinogenicity studies have not been \nconducted with avibactam.\n\nReproduction toxicity\n\nIn pregnant rabbits administered avibactam at 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day, there was a dose-related lower \nmean foetal weight and delayed ossification, potentially related to maternal toxicity. Plasma exposure \nlevels at maternal and foetal NOAEL (100 mg/kg/day) indicate moderate to low margins of safety. \nIn the rat, no adverse effects were observed on embryofetal development or fertility. Following \nadministration of avibactam throughout pregnancy and lactation in the rat, there was no effect on pup \nsurvival, growth or development, however there was an increase in incidence of dilation of the renal \npelvis and ureters in less than 10% of the rat pups at maternal exposures greater than or equal to \napproximately 1.5 times human therapeutic exposures. \n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n\n1. What Zavicefta is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Zavicefta\n3. How to use Zavicefta\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Zavicefta\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Zavicefta is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Zavicefta is\nZavicefta is an antibiotic medicine that contains two active substances ceftazidime and avibactam.\n Ceftazidime belongs to the group of antibiotics called “cephalosporins”. It can kill many types \n\nof bacteria.\n Avibactam is a “beta-lactamase inhibitor” that helps ceftazidime kill some bacteria that it cannot \n\nkill on its own.\n\nWhat Zavicefta is used for\nZavicefta is used in adults to treat:\n infections of the stomach and gut (abdomen)\n infections of the bladder or kidneys called “urinary tract infections”\n an infection of the lungs called “pneumonia”\n infections caused by bacteria that other antibiotics may not be able to kill\n\nHow Zavicefta works\nZavicefta works by killing certain types of bacteria, which can cause serious infections.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Zavicefta\n\nDo not use Zavicefta if:\n you are allergic to ceftazidime, avibactam or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6)\n you are allergic to other cephalosporin antibiotics\n you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to other antibiotics belonging to the penicillin or \n\ncarbapenem groups\n\n\n\n25\n\nDo not use Zavicefta if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse \nbefore using Zavicefta.\n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before using Zavicefta if:\n you have ever had any allergic reaction (even if only a skin rash) to other antibiotics belonging \n\nto the penicillin or carbapenem groups\n you have kidney problems - your doctor may give you a lower dose to make sure you don’t get \n\ntoo much medicine. This could cause symptoms such as fits (see section If you use more \nZavicefta than you should)\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before using \nZavicefta.\n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse if you suffer from diarrhoea during your treatment.\n\nOther infections\nThere is a small possibility that you may get a different infection caused by another bacteria during or \nafter treatment with Zavicefta. These include thrush (fungal infections of the mouth or genital area).\n\nLab tests\nTell your doctor that you are taking Zavicefta if you are going to have any tests. This is because you \nmay get an abnormal result with a test called “DAGT” or “Coombs”. This test looks for antibodies that \nfight against your red blood cells.\n\nZavicefta can also affect the results of some urine tests for sugar. Tell the person taking the sample that \nyou have been given Zavicefta.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nZavicefta should not be used in children and adolescents . This is because it is not known if the \nmedicine is safe to use in these age groups.\n\nOther medicines and Zavicefta\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\nTalk to your doctor before using Zavicefta if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n an antibiotic called chloramphenicol\n a type of antibiotic called an aminoglycoside – such as gentamicin, tobramycin\n a water tablet called furosemide\n a medicine for gout called probenecid\n\nTell your doctor before using Zavicefta if any of the above apply to you.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nZavicefta may make you feel dizzy. This may affect you being able to drive, use tools or machines.\n\nZavicefta contains sodium\nThe maximum recommended daily dose of this medicinal product contains 444 mg sodium (found in \ntable salt). This is equivalent to 22.2% of the adult recommended maximum daily dietary intake for \nsodium. \n\nTalk to your pharmacist or doctor if you have been advised to have a low salt diet.\n\n\n\n26\n\n3. How to use Zavicefta \n\nZavicefta will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse. \n\nHow much to use\nThe recommended dose is one vial (2 g of ceftazidime and 0.5 g of avibactam), every 8 hours.\n\nIt is given as a drip into a vein – this will take about 2 hours. \n\nA course of treatment usually lasts from 5 to up to 14 days, depending on the type of infection you \nhave and how you respond to treatment.\n\nPeople with kidney problems\nIf you have kidney problems your doctor may lower your dose. This is because Zavicefta is removed \nfrom your body by the kidneys.\n\nIf you use more Zavicefta than you should\nZavicefta will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse, so it is unlikely you will be given the wrong \ndose. However, if you have side effects or think you have been given too much Zavicefta, tell your \ndoctor or nurse straight away. If you have too much Zavicefta it could have an effect on the brain and \ncause fits or coma.\n\nIf you miss a dose of Zavicefta\nIf you think you have missed a dose, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The \nfollowing side effects may happen with this medicine:\n\nSerious side effects\nTell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects - you may need \nurgent medical treatment:\n severe allergic reactions – signs include sudden swelling of your lips, face, throat or tongue, a \n\nsevere rash or other severe skin reactions, difficulty swallowing or breathing. This reaction may \nbe life-threatening.\n\n diarrhoea that keeps getting worse or does not go away, or stools that contains blood or mucus –\nthis may happen during or after treatment is stopped with Zavicefta.

The contents of Zavicefta vial \nshould be reconstituted with 10 mL of sterile water for injections. Instructions for the reconstitution of \nZavicefta vial are summarized below:\n\nDosage strength\nceftazidime/avibactam\n\n(mg)\n\nVolume of diluent\nto be added\n\n(mL)\n\nApproximate\nceftazidime/avibactam \n\nconcentration\n(mg/mL)\n\nAmount to be\nwithdrawn\n\n\n\n30\n\n2000/500 10 167.3/41.8 Total volume\n\n1. Introduce the syringe needle through the vial closure and inject 10 mL of sterile water for \ninjections. \n\n2. Withdraw the needle and shake the vial to give a clear solution. \n3. Do not insert a gas relief needle until the product has dissolved. Insert a gas relief needle \n\nthrough the vial closure to relieve the internal pressure.\n4. Transfer the entire contents (approximately 12.0 mL) of the resultant solution to an infusion \n\nbag immediately. Reduced doses may be achieved by transfer of an appropriate volume of the \nresultant solution to an infusion bag, based upon ceftazidime and avibactam content of \n167.3 mg/mL and 41.8 mg/mL, respectively. A dose of 1000 mg/250 mg or 750 mg/187.5 mg \nis achieved with 6.0 mL or 4.5 mL aliquots, respectively.\n\nNote: to preserve product sterility, it is important that the gas relief needle is not inserted through the \nvial closure before the product is dissolved.\n\nThe reconstituted solution must be further diluted to produce Zavicefta solution for infusion. A 100 mL\ninfusion bag can be used to prepare the infusion, based on the patient’s volume requirements. \nAppropriate infusion diluents include: sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, dextrose \n50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection, sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL and dextrose 25 mg/mL solution for \ninjection (0.45% sodium chloride and 2.5% dextrose) or Lactated Ringer’s solution. The resulting \nsolution should be administered over 120 minutes.\n\nReconstitution time is less than 2 minutes. Mix gently to reconstitute and check to see that the contents \nhave dissolved completely. The total time interval between starting reconstitution and completing \npreparation of the intravenous infusion should not exceed 30 minutes. Parenteral medicinal products \nshould be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration.\n\nThe colour of Zavicefta infusion solution is pale yellow and free of particles.\n\nStudies have shown that Zavicefta solutions for infusion are stable for up to 12 hours at room \ntemperature. Alternatively they are stable for up to 24 hours under refrigerated storage. Once removed \nfrom refrigeration to room temperature, the diluted product must be used within 12 hours. The total in-\nuse stability from reconstitution to administration should not exceed 36 hours (24 hours at 2-8°C plus \n12 hours room temperature).\n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately unless \nreconstitution and dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user.\n\nThe compatibility of Zavicefta with other medicines has not been established. Zavicefta should not be \nmixed with or physically added to solutions containing other medicinal products.\n\nEach vial is for single use only.\n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
