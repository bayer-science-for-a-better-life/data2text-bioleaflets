PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in pre-filled syringe. \nClear to slightly opalescent. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza for adults, especially in those who run an increased risk of associated \ncomplications. \n \nOptaflu should be used in accordance to Official guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults from the age of 18 years: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 3\n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Optaflu in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not yet \nbeen established. No data are available. Therefore, Optaflu is not recommended for use in children and \nadolescents less than 18 years of age (see section 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nImmunisation shall be postponed in patients with febrile illness or acute infection. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nOptaflu should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \nthe needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOptaflu may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Immunisation should be carried out on \nseparate limbs. It should be noted that adverse reactions may be intensified. \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThe safety of Optaflu in pregnancy and breast-feeding has not been assessed in clinical trials. \n \nPregnancy \nIn general data from influenza vaccinations in pregnant women do not indicate adverse foetal and \nmaternal outcomes attributable to the vaccine. Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity \n(see Section 5.3 \u2013 Preclinical safety data). The use of Optaflu may be considered from the second \ntrimester of pregnancy. For pregnant women with medical conditions that increase their risk of \ncomplications from influenza, administration of the vaccine is recommended, irrespective of their \nstage of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThere is no human data on use of Optaflu during lactation. No effects on the breastfed newborn /infant \nare anticipated. Optaflu may be used during lactation \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 4\n\nFertility \nNo human fertility data are available. Animal data have not shown effects on female fertility \n(see section 5.3). Male fertility has not been assessed in animals (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOptaflu has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \na) Summary of safety profile \n \nThe safety of Optaflu has been assessed in seven randomized, active controlled clinical trials \nperformed as part of the development program. Overall 7253 single doses of Optaflu were \nadministered to 6180 adults aged 18 \u2013 60 years of age and to 1073 elderly (aged 61 years or older). \nSafety and reactogenicity evaluations were performed for all subjects during the first 3 weeks \nfollowing vaccination and SAEs have been collected for approximately 6700 vaccinees during six \nmonths of follow-up. \n \nb) Summary of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency: \nVery Common (\u22651/10) \nCommon (\u22651/100 -<1/10) \nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 - <1/100) \nRare (\u22651/10,000 - <1/1,000) \nVery Rare (<1/10,000) \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \nThe following adverse reactions have been observed: \n \nTable 1: Frequency in adults (18-60 years of age) \n \n\nOrgan class \nVery \n\ncommon \n\u2265 1/10 \n\nCommon \n\u2265 1/100 to  \n\n< 1/10 \n\nUncommon\n\u2265 1/1000 to \n\n< 1/100 \n\nRare \n\u2265 1/10,000 \nto <1/1000 \n\nVery rare \n<1/ 10,000 \n\nNot known \n(cannot be \nestimated \n\nfrom available \ndata) \n\nNervous system \ndisorders - Headache*    \n\n- Neurological \ndisorders, \nsuch as Guillain \nBarr\u00e9 syndrome, \nencephalomyelitis \nand neuritis \n\n- Paraesthesia\n\nVascular \ndisorders     \n\n- Vasculitis, \npossibly \nassociated with \ntransient renal \ninvolvement \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders     \n\n- Allergic \nreactions, \nin very rare \ncases leading to \nshock \n\n- Angioedema\n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n   \n- Local \n\nlymphadeno-\npathy \n\n- Thrombo-\ncytopenia**  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 5\n\nOrgan class \nVery \n\ncommon \n\u2265 1/10 \n\nCommon \n\u2265 1/100 to  \n\n< 1/10 \n\nUncommon\n\u2265 1/1000 to \n\n< 1/100 \n\nRare \n\u2265 1/10,000 \nto <1/1000 \n\nVery rare \n<1/ 10,000 \n\nNot known \n(cannot be \nestimated \n\nfrom available \ndata) \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n- Myalgia* - Arthralgia*     \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite disorders \n\n- Erythema* \n- Injection \n\nsite pain* \n- Malaise* \n- Fatigue* \n\n- Swelling* \n- Ecchymosis* \n- Induration* \n- Fever greater \n\nthan 38.0\uf0b0C* \n- Shivering/ \n\nchills* \n- Gastrointestinal \n\ndisorders such \nas abdominal \npain, diarrhoea \nor dyspepsia* \n\n - Fever greater than 39.0\u00b0C  \n\n- Extensive \nswelling of \ninjected \nlimb \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n - Sweating* \n\n- Generalised \nskin reaction\ns including \npruritus, \nurticaria or \nnon-specific \nrash \n\n   \n\n* These reactions usually disappeared within 1-2 days without treatment. \n** Thrombocytopenia (some very rare cases were severe with platelet counts less than 5000 per mm3) \n \nIn the elderly frequencies were similar, except for myalgia, headache and injection site pain which \nwere classified as \u2018common\u2019. The incidence rates for moderate and severe pain after Optaflu \nvaccination are similar to those of egg-derived influenza vaccines; however a slightly increased risk \nfor mild short-lasting injection site pain was observed with Optaflu in the subgroup of elderly \nvaccinees (8% compared to 6% with egg-derived influenza vaccine). \n \nPost-marketing surveillance: \n \nSo far there is limited post-marketing experience with Optaflu. \n \nThe following additional adverse reactions were reported from post-marketing surveillance with \negg-based seasonal trivalent vaccines: \n \nNervous system disorders: \n \nNeuralgia, convulsion, febrile convulsion. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions: \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal products is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionols are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting sytem \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported for Optaflu. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 6\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC Code: J07BB02 \n \nEfficacy against Culture-Confirmed Influenza \n \nA multinational (US, Finland, and Poland), randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was \nperformed to assess clinical efficacy and safety of Optaflu during the 2007-2008 influenza season in \nadults aged 18 to 49 years. A total of 11,404 subjects were enrolled to receive Optaflu (N=3828), \nAgrippal (N=3676) or placebo (N=3900) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Among the overall study population enrolled, \nthe mean age was 33 years, 55% were female, 84% were Caucasian, 7% were Black, 7% were \nHispanic, and 2% were of other ethnic origin. \n \nOptaflu efficacy was defined as the prevention of culture-confirmed symptomatic influenza illness \ncaused by viruses antigenically matched to those in the vaccine compared to placebo. Influenza cases \nwere identified by active and passive surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI). ILI was defined \naccording to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition, i.e., a fever (oral \ntemperature \u2265 100.0\u00b0F / 38\u00b0C) and cough or sore throat. After an episode of ILI, nose and throat swab \nsamples were collected for analysis. Vaccine efficacies against vaccine-matched influenza viral \nstrains, against all influenza viral strains, and against individual influenza viral subtypes were \ncalculated (Tables 2 and 3). \n \nTable 2: Vaccine Efficacy against Culture-Confirmed Influenza \n \n\n Number of \nsubjects per \n\nprotocol \n\nNumber of \nsubjects with \n\ninfluenza \n\nAttack \nRate (%) \n\nVaccine Efficacy* \n\n% Lower Limit of One- Sided 97.5% CI \nAntigenically Matched Strains \n\nOptaflu 3776 7 0.19 83.8 61.0 \nPlacebo 3843 44 1.14 -- -- \n\nAll Culture-Confirmed Influenza \nOptaflu 3776 42 1.11 69.5 55.0 \nPlacebo 3843 140 3.64 -- -- \n\n* Simultaneous one-sided 97.5% confidence intervals for the vaccine efficacy of each influenza vaccine \nrelative to placebo based on the Sidak-corrected score confidence intervals for the two relative risks. \nVaccine Efficacy = (1 - Relative Risk) x 100 % \n\n \nTable 3: Comparative Efficacy of Optaflu versus Placebo against Culture-Confirmed \n\nInfluenza by Influenza Viral Subtype \n \n\n Optaflu \n(N=3776) \n\nPlacebo \n(N=3843) \n\nVaccine Efficacy* \n\nAttack \nRate (%) \n\nNumber of Subjects \nwith Influenza \n\nAttack \nRate (%) \n\nNumber of Subjects \nwith Influenza \n\n% Lower Limit of \nOne-Sided 97.5% CI \n\nAntigenically Matched Strains \nA/H3N2** 0. 05  2 0 0 -- -- \nA/H1N1 0.13 5 1.12 43 88.2 67.4 \nB** 0 0 0.03 1 -- -- \n\nAll Culture-Confirmed Influenza \nA/H3N2 0.16 6 0.65 25 75.6 35.1 \nA/H1N1 0.16 6 1.48 57 89.3 73.0 \nB 0.79 30 1.59 61 49.9 18.2 \n\n* Simultaneous one-sided 97.5% confidence intervals for the vaccine efficacy of each influenza vaccine \nrelative to placebo based on the Sidak-corrected score confidence intervals for the two relative risks. \nVaccine Efficacy = (1 - Relative Risk) x 100 %;

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Optaflu is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive Optaflu \n3. How Optaflu is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Optaflu \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What OPTAFLU is and what it is used for \n \nOptaflu is a vaccine against flu (influenza). Due to the kind of manufacturing Optaflu is free of \nchicken/egg protein. \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence system) will \nproduce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can \ncause the flu. \n \nOptaflu is used to prevent flu in adults, especially in those who run an increased risk of experiencing \nassociated complications in case they fall ill with flu. \n \nThe vaccine targets three strains of influenza virus following the recommendations by the World \nHealth Organisation for the 2015/2016 season. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive OPTAFLU \n \nYou should not receive Optaflu \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to influenza vaccine or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n\uf0b7 if you have an acute infection. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Optaflu. \n \nBEFORE receiving the vaccine \n\uf0b7 you should tell your doctor if your immune system is impaired, or if you are undergoing \n\ntreatment which affects the immune system, e.g. with medicine against cancer (chemotherapy) \nor corticosteroid medicines (see Section 2, \u201cTaking other medicines\u201d). \n\n\uf0b7 your doctor or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment and supervision is readily \navailable in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction with symptoms \nsuch as difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash) following the \nadministration. This reaction may occur with Optaflu as with all vaccines that are injected. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 26\n\n\uf0b7 Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or \nnurse if you fainted with a previous injection. \n\n\uf0b7 if you have an acute illness associated with fever. \n \nIf you need a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses in the first few weeks \nafter vaccination with Optaflu, the result of the test may not be correct. Tell the doctor requesting the \ntest that you have recently received Optaflu. \n \nOther medicines and Optaflu \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription or if you have recently received any other \nvaccine. \n \nIf you take any medicines against cancer (chemotherapy), corticosteroid medicines (such as cortisone) \nor other medicines affecting the immune system, the immune response of your body may be \nweakened. Therefore, the vaccine may work less effectively. \n \nOptaflu may be given at the same time as other vaccines. In this case the vaccines should be injected \ninto separate limbs. Note that the side effects of the vaccines may be intensified. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nPregnancy: \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Your \ndoctor will decide if you should receive Optaflu.  \nThe limited data from influenza vaccinations in pregnant women do not indicate that there are negative \neffects for the unborn child. The use of this vaccine may be considered from the second trimester of \npregnancy. For pregnant women with medical conditions that increase their risk of complications from \nthe flu, administration of the vaccine is recommended, irrespective of their stage of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding: \nOptaflu may be used during breast feeding. \n \nFertility: \nNo human fertility data are available. Animal data have not shown effects on female fertility. \n \nDriving and using machines \nOptaflu may have a minor effect on your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nOptaflu contains sodium chloride and potassium chloride \nThis vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \nThis vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018potassium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How OPTAFLU is given \n \nOptaflu is given to you by your doctor or nurse. Optaflu should under no circumstances be injected \ninto a blood vessel. \n \nAdults from the age of 18 years: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml \nOptaflu is injected into the muscle on the top of the upper arm (deltoid muscle). \n \nChildren and adolescents: \nOptaflu is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age since there is no information \navailable. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 27\n\n \n4.

vaccine (listed in section 6) if you have an acute infection. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving optaflu. before receiving the vaccine you should tell your doctor if your immune system is impaired, or if you are undergoing treatment which affects the immune system, e.g. with medicine against cancer (chemotherapy) or corticosteroid medicines (see section 2, \"taking other medicines\"). your doctor or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment and supervision is readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction with symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash) following the administration. this reaction may occur with optaflu as with all vaccines that are injected. fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection. if you have an acute illness associated with fever. if you need a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses in the first few weeks after vaccination with optaflu, the result of the test may not be correct. tell the doctor requesting the test that you have recently received optaflu. other medicines and optaflu tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or if you have recently received any other vaccine. if you take any medicines against cancer (chemotherapy), corticosteroid medicines (such as cortisone) or other medicines affecting the immune system, the immune response of your body may be weakened. therefore, the vaccine may work less effectively. optaflu may be given at the same time as other vaccines. in this case the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. note that the side effects of the vaccines may be intensified. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility pregnancy: tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or plan to become pregnant. your doctor will decide if you should receive optaflu. the limited data from influenza vaccinations in pregnant women do not indicate that there are negative effects for the unborn child. the use of this vaccine may be considered from the second trimester of pregnancy. for pregnant women with medical conditions that increase their risk of complications from the flu, administration of the vaccine is recommended, irrespective of their stage of pregnancy. breast-feeding: optaflu may be used during breast feeding. fertility: no human fertility data are available. animal data have not shown effects on female fertility. driving and using machines optaflu may have a minor effect on your ability to drive and use machines. optaflu contains sodium chloride and potassium chloride this vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'sodium-free'. this vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'potassium-free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "optaflu", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset":
