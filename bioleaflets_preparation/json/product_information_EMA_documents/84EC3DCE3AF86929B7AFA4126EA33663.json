NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVIBATIV 250 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion  \nVIBATIV 750 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion  \n \n \n2.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nVIBATIV 250 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nEach vial contains 250 mg telavancin (as hydrochloride).  \n \nVIBATIV 750 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion  \nEach vial contains 750 mg telavancin (as hydrochloride).  \n \nAfter reconstitution, each ml contains 15 mg of telavancin.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3.  PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion  \nA white to pale pink, whole or fragmented cake  \n \n \n4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1  Therapeutic indications \n \nVIBATIV is indicated for the treatment of adults with nosocomial pneumonia (NP) including \nventilator associated pneumonia, known or suspected to be caused by methicillin-resistant \nStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA). \n \nVIBATIV should be used only in situations where it is known or suspected that other alternatives are \nnot suitable (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology  \n \nAdults  \nThe recommended dosage regimen is 10 mg/kg, once every 24 hours, for 7 to 21 days. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients \nElderly patients should receive a telavancin dose in accordance with their bodyweight and renal \nfunction (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRenal impairment  \nPatients with renal impairment should receive an initial dose according to calculated or measured \ncreatinine clearance as presented in the table below. During treatment dose adjustments according to \nthe table should be made based on calculated or measured creatinine clearance in patients with \nclinically relevant changes in renal function.  \n \nCreatinine clearance* (ml/min) Dosage regimen  \n> 50 10 mg/kg every 24 hours  \n30-50 7.5 mg/kg every 24 hours  \n*As calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula  \n \nThe use in patients with acute renal failure or creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 ml/min including \npatients undergoing haemodialysis is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  \n \nHepatic impairment  \nMild to moderate degrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) (see section 5.2) did not result \nin a relevant change in pharmacokinetics of telavancin. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary \nwhen administering telavancin to subjects with mild or moderate degrees of hepatic impairment. No \ndata are available in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Therefore, caution \nshould be exercised if telavancin is given to subjects with severe hepatic impairment.  \n \nObese patients  \nObese patients (defined as those with BMI > 30 kg/m2) should receive telavancin at the reduced dose \nof 7.5 mg/kg once every 24 hours (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric patients  \nThe safety and efficacy of VIBATIV in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not yet \nbeen established. No data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor intravenous use. \n \nVIBATIV must be reconstituted and then further diluted prior to administration by intravenous \ninfusion through a dedicated line or through a Y-site over a 60 minute period. Bolus injections must \nnot be administered. For instructions on reconstitution and dilution, see section 6.6.  \n \n4.3  Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nPatients with severe renal impairment, i.e. creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 ml/min, including patients \nundergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4).  \n \nAcute renal failure (see section 4.4).  \n \nPregnancy (see section 4.6).  \n Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRenal impairment  \n \nIn the clinical studies, patients with pre existing acute renal failure receiving telavancin had an \nincreased risk of mortality. All-cause mortality was 32/73 (44%) in the telavancin group and 16/64 \n(25%) in the vancomycin group, whereas in patients without acute renal failure at baseline it was \n118/678 (17%) and 124/688 (18%), respectively. Therefore, the use of telavancin in patients with \npre-existing acute renal failure and in patients with severe renal impairment is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).  \n \nRenal adverse reactions \n \nIn the pooled clinical studies (NP and complicated skin and soft tissue infection (cSSTI)), renal \nadverse reactions were reported more frequently in patients receiving telavancin compared with \nvancomycin (3.8% vs. 2.2%, respectively). Renal function (serum creatinine and urinary output for \noliguria/anuria) should be monitored daily for at least the first 3 to 5 days of therapy and every 48 to \n72 hours thereafter in all patients receiving telavancin. Initial dose and dosage adjustments during \ntreatment should be made based on calculated or measured creatinine clearance according to the \ndosing regimen in section 4.2. If renal function markedly decreases during treatment, the benefit of \ncontinuing telavancin should be assessed.  \n \nOther factors that may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity \n \nCaution should be used when prescribing VIBATIV to patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic \nmedicines, those with pre existing renal disease or with co-morbidity known to predispose to kidney \ndysfunction (e.g. diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, hypertension). \n \nInfusion related reactions  \n \nRapid intravenous infusions of antimicrobial agents of the class of glycopeptides have been associated \nwith red man syndrome-like reactions, including flushing of the upper body, urticaria, pruritus or rash \n(see section 4.8). Stopping or slowing the infusion may result in cessation of these reactions. Infusion \nrelated reactions can be limited if the daily dose is infused over a 1 hour period.  \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with telavancin, and may be \nlife-threatening. If an allergic reaction to telavancin occurs, discontinue treatment and institute \nappropriate therapy. \n \nCross hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients with a history \nof vancomycin allergy. Caution should be exercised when prescribing telavancin to patients with a \nprior history of hypersensitivity reaction to vancomycin. If an allergic reaction to telavancin occurs, \ndiscontinue treatment and institute appropriate therapy. \n \nQTc prolongation  \n \nA clinical QTc study with telavancin doses of 7.5 and 15 mg/kg versus vehicle and an active \ncomparator (400 mg moxifloxacin) showed that once daily dosing for 3 days resulted in a mean \nvehicle corrected increase in QTcF by 4.1 and 4.5 millisecond, respectively, compared to a \n9.2 millisecond increase observed with the comparator.  \n \nCaution is warranted when using telavancin to treat patients taking medicinal products known to \nprolong the QT interval. In addition, caution is warranted when using telavancin to treat patients with \ncongenital long QT syndrome, known prolongation of the QTc interval, uncompensated heart failure, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n5 \n\nor severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients with these conditions were not included in clinical trials \nof telavancin.  \n \nOtotoxicity  \n \nAs with other glycopeptides, ototoxicity (deafness and tinnitus) has been reported in patients treated \nwith telavancin (see section 4.8). Patients who develop signs and symptoms of impaired hearing or \ndisorders of the inner ear during treatment with telavancin should be carefully evaluated and \nmonitored (see section 4.8). Patients receiving telavancin in conjunction with or sequentially with \nother medicinal products with known ototoxic potential should be carefully monitored and the benefit \nof telavancin evaluated if hearing deteriorates.  \n \nSuperinfection  \n \nThe use of antibiotics may promote the overgrowth of non-susceptible micro-organisms. If \nsuperinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.  \n \nAntibiotic-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis  \n \nAntibiotic-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported with nearly all \nantibacterial agents, including telavancin (see section 4.8), and may range in severity from mild to \nlife-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with \ndiarrhoea during or shortly following treatment.  \n \nConcomitant antibiotic coverage \n \nTelavancin is active against Gram-positive bacteria only (see section 5.1 for information on the \nantimicrobial spectrum). In mixed infections where Gram-negative and/or certain types of anaerobic \nbacteria are suspected, VIBATIV should be co-administered with appropriate antibacterial agent(s).  \n \nSpecific patient groups  \n \nThe nosocomial pneumonia (NP) studies excluded known or suspected pulmonary disease like \ngranulomatous diseases, lung cancer, or other malignancy metastatic to the lungs; cystic fibrosis or \nactive tuberculosis; Legionella pneumophila pneumonia; meningitis, endocarditis, or osteomyelitis; \nrefractory shock defined as supine systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg for >2 hours with evidence of \nhypoperfusion or requirement for high-dose sympathomimetic agents. Also patients with baseline \nQTc >500 msec, congenital long QT syndrome, uncompensated heart failure, or abnormal K+ or Mg2+ \nblood levels that could not be corrected, severely neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count <500/mm3) or \nanticipated to develop severe neutropenia due to prior or planned chemotherapy, or who had HIV with \nCD4 count <100/mm3 during the last 6 months were excluded. \n \n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn studies in healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of telavancin were not significantly altered by \nsimultaneous administration of aztreonam or piperacillin-tazobactam. Also, the pharmacokinetics of \naztreonam or piperacillin tazobactam were not altered by telavancin. Based on their pharmacokinetic \nproperties, no interaction is expected with other beta-lactams, clindamycin, metronidazole, or \nfluoroquinolones. \n \nIt was demonstrated in a clinical study with intravenous midazolam that multiple doses of telavancin \nhad no effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, which is a sensitive substrate for CYP3A4. \nIn vitro experiments indicate that telavancin will not affect the clearance of medicinal products \nmetabolised by CYP isoforms 1A2, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6. Since telavancin is primarily excreted \nunchanged by renal clearance and multiple CYP enzymes are able to metabolise telavancin, no \nrelevant interactions are expected with inhibitors or inducers of the CYP450 system. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n6 \n\nAlthough telavancin does not interfere with coagulation, it interfered with certain tests used to monitor \ncoagulation (see below), when tests are conducted using samples drawn between 0 to 18 hours after \ntelavancin administration to patients being treated once every 24 hours. Blood samples for coagulation \ntests should be collected as closely as possible prior to a patient’s next dose of telavancin or \nconsideration given to using a test unaffected by telavancin.  \n \nCoagulation tests affected by telavancin Coagulation tests unaffected by telavancin  \nInternational normalised ratio Whole blood (Lee-White) clotting time \nActivated partial thromboplastin time Ex vivo platelet aggregation \nActivated clotting time Chromogenic factor Xa assay \nCoagulation based factor Xa tests Functional (chromogenic) factor X assay  \n Bleeding time  \n D-dimer  \n Fibrin degradation products \n \nNo evidence of increased bleeding risk has been observed in clinical trials with telavancin. Telavancin \nhas no effect on platelet aggregation. Furthermore, no evidence of hypercoagulability has been seen, as \nhealthy subjects receiving telavancin have normal levels of D-dimer and fibrin degradation products. \n \nTelavancin interferes with urine qualitative dipstick protein assays, as well as quantitative dye \nmethods (e.g. pyrogallol red molybdate). Microalbumin assays based on immunoassay utilizing \nnephelometric (turbidity) detection are not affected and can be used to monitor urinary protein \nexcretion during telavancin treatment. For routine monitoring of renal function it is recommended to \nuse serum creatinine concentration or estimated creatinine clearance.  \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy  \n \nThe use of VIBATIV is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).  \nThere is no human experience with telavancin. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3).  \n \nThe pregnancy status of women of childbearing potential has to be established prior to dosing with \ntelavancin. Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment.  \n \nBreastfeeding  \n \nIt is unknown whether telavancin is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of telavancin in milk \nhas not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to \ncontinue/discontinue therapy with telavancin should be made taking into account the benefit of \nbreastfeeding to the child and the benefit of telavancin therapy to the woman.  \n \nFertility  \n \nTelavancin has been shown to affect sperm quantity and quality of male rats (see section 5.3) although \nno effect on fertility, mating, or early embryogenesis has been reported. The potential risk for humans \nis unknown.  \n \n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDizziness, somnolence, confusion and blurred vision may occur and VIBATIV may have an influence \non the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.8  Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn phase 3 clinical trials involving 1680 patients (751 and 929, NP and cSSTI, respectively) who \nreceived telavancin at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg, adverse reactions were reported in 47.3% of patients. \nTreatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5.0% of patients who received telavancin.  \n \nThe most commonly reported related adverse reactions (occurring in >1% of patients) were: fungal \ninfection, insomnia, dysgeusia, headache, dizziness, nausea, constipation, diarrhoea, vomiting, alanine \naminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, pruritus, rash, renal failure acute, \nblood creatinine increased, urine abnormality (foamy urine), fatigue and chills.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to \n<1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Since these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of \nuncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency which is therefore categorised as \nnot known. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9  Overdose \n \nIn healthy volunteers who received a dose of 15 mg/kg, a higher incidence of adverse reactions to \ntelavancin was seen: dysgeusia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema, headache, macular rash, and \nred man syndrome.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n9 \n\nIn the event of overdose, telavancin should be discontinued and supportive care is advised with \nmaintenance of glomerular filtration and careful monitoring of renal function. Following \nadministration of a single dose of telavancin 7.5 mg/kg to subjects with end-stage renal disease, \napproximately 5.9% of the administered dose of telavancin was recovered in the dialysate following \n4 hours of haemodialysis. However, no information is available on the use of haemodialysis to treat an \noverdose. \n \nThe clearance of telavancin by continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) was evaluated in an in \nvitro study. Telavancin was cleared by CVVH and the clearance of telavancin increased with \nincreasing ultrafiltration rate. However, the clearance of telavancin by CVVH has not been evaluated \nin a clinical study; thus, the clinical significance of this finding and use of CVVH to treat an overdose \nare unknown. \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, glycopeptide antibacterials, ATC code: \nJ01XA03 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTelavancin exerts concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against susceptible Gram-positive \nbacteria. Telavancin inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding to late-stage peptidoglycan precursors, \nincluding lipid II, which prevents polymerisation of the precursor into peptidoglycan and subsequent \ncross-linking events. Telavancin also binds to bacterial membranes and causes depolarisation of \nmembrane potential and an increase in membrane permeability that results in inhibition of protein, \nRNA, and lipid synthesis. \n \nMechanism of resistance \n \nS. aureus that exhibit high level resistance to glycopeptide antibacterial agents (GRSA) are not \nsusceptible to telavancin. There is no known cross-resistance between telavancin and other \nnon-glycopeptide classes of antibiotics. \n \nBreakpoints \n \nThe minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints are as follows: \n \n\nPathogen MIC (µg/ml) \n\nS. aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) ≤0.12 \n \nMicrobiological susceptibility \nThe prevalence of acquired resistance may vary geographically and with time for selected species and \nlocal information on resistance is desirable, particularly when treating severe infections. As necessary, \nexpert advice should be sought when the local prevalence of resistance is such that the utility of the \nagent in at least some types of infections is questionable.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nTelavancin demonstrated efficacy against MSSA and MRSA in two randomised controlled studies in \npatients with nosocomial pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, involving \n751 patients who received telavancin. Despite in vitro susceptibility, there are insufficient clinical data \nto assess the potential for efficacy of telavancin in infections due to hGISA/GISA. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n10 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ntelavancin in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in nosocomial pneumonia. See 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use. \n \n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTelavancin exhibited linear pharmacokinetics at doses up to 15 mg/kg administered as a daily \n60 minute intravenous infusion for 7 days in healthy volunteers. The mean (SD) maximum telavancin \nconcentration (Cmax) amounts to 108 (26) µg/ml at steady state at a once daily dose of 10 mg/kg \ninfused over a period of 1 h (tmax) and then falls to a trough value of 8.55 (2.84) µg/ml (C24h ). Mean \n(SD) AUC0-24 amounts to 780 (125) µg.h/ml. Telavancin has a small volume of distribution. At a dose \nof 10 mg/kg, mean Vss averaged between 133 (SD 24) ml/kg after multiple dosing, corresponding to a \nvalue of approximately 10 l for a 75 kg person. This data indicate that telavancin is not extensively \ndistributed. Telavancin is a low clearance active substance with a mean (SD) CL of 13.1 (2.0) ml/hr/kg \nin subjects with normal renal function, corresponding to a total CL of approximately 1 l/hr in a 75 kg \nsubject. In combination with the small Vss, this results in a t1/2 of about 8 h. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe apparent distribution volume of telavancin at steady-state in healthy adult subjects was \napproximately 133 ml/kg.  \n \nHuman plasma protein binding is approximately 90%, primarily to serum albumin.  \n \nAt a dose of 10 mg/kg for 3 consecutive days to healthy volunteers subjected to bronchoalveolar \nlavage, the concentration ratio in pulmonary epithelial lining fluid/plasma ranged from 0.050 and \n0.121 over a period of 4 to 24 hours after start of infusion. Higher concentrations were observed in \nalveolar macrophages with ratios varying between 0.360 (at 4 h) and 6.67 (at 24 h). In vitro studies \nshowed that telavancin retained full activity in the presence of pulmonary surfactant. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that CYP1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 2C18, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 2J2, 3A4, 3A5 and 4F12 \nare able to metabolise telavancin, resulting in hydroxylation at the 7, 8 and 9 position of the \n2-(decylamino) ethyl side chain of telavancin. \n \nIn a mass balance study in male subjects using radiolabeled telavancin, 3 hydroxylated metabolites \nwere identified with the predominant metabolite (THRX-651540) accounting for <10% of the \nradioactivity in urine and <2% of the radioactivity in plasma. \n \nIn healthy young adults, three hydroxylated metabolites were identified after infusion of telavancin. \nThe AUC of the predominant metabolite accounted for approximately 2-3% of AUC of telavancin. \n \nElimination \n \nRenal excretion is the major route of elimination for telavancin in humans. In healthy young adults, \nafter infusion of radiolabeled telavancin, approximately 76% of the administered dose was recovered \nfrom urine and less than 1% of the dose was recovered from faeces (collected for up to 9 days), based \non total radioactivity. Telavancin is mainly excreted unchanged accounting for approximately 82% of \nthe total amount recovered over 48 hours in urine. The elimination half-life in subjects with normal \nrenal function is approximately 8 hours. \n \nBecause renal excretion is the primary route of elimination, dosage adjustment is necessary in patients \nwith a creatinine clearance of 30-50 ml/min (see section 4.2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo clinically significant differences in pharmacokinetics of telavancin were observed between healthy \nelderly and healthy young subjects. Analysis of patient population pharmacokinetic data did not show \na relevant effect of age on pharmacokinetics. Therefore, no dose adjustment is needed in elderly \npatients except in those with creatinine clearance of 30-50 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).  \n \nPaediatric patients \nThe pharmacokinetics of telavancin in patients below 18 years of age have not been established (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nGender \nNo clinically significant gender-related differences in telavancin pharmacokinetics have been \nobserved. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender.  \n \nRenal insufficiency \nPharmacokinetic parameters (mean (SD)) following a single dose administration of 7.5 mg/kg \ntelavancin in volunteers with varying degrees of renal function are provided below.  \n \n Degree of Renal Impairment \n Normal Mild Moderate Severe ESRDa \nCrCL (ml/min)b 93.8 \n\n(10.8) \n64.1 \n(9.7) \n\n40.3 \n(7.0) \n\n21.0 \n(6.3) NA \n\nCmax (μg/ml) 70.6 \n(11.2) \n\n65.9 \n(2.7) \n\n65.8 \n(12.1) \n\n71.8 \n(7.1) \n\n52.1 \n(10.1) \n\nAUCinf (µg⋅h/ml)  560 \n(93) \n\n633 \n(101) \n\n721 \n(200) \n\n1220 \n(120) \n\n1010 \n(341) \n\nt1/2 (h) 6.90 \n(0.60) \n\n9.6 \n(2.9) \n\n10.6 \n(2.4) \n\n14.5 \n(1.3) \n\n11.8 \n(2.8) \n\nCL (ml/h/kg) 13.7 \n(2.1) \n\n12.1 \n(1.9) \n\n11.1 \n(3.3) \n\n6.18 \n(0.63) \n\n8.18 \n(2.65) \n\na ESRD= End-stage renal disease maintained on haemodialysis \nb Baseline mean creatinine clearance as calculated by Cockcroft-Gault equation \n \nThe effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of telavancin has been evaluated in 2 clinical \npharmacology studies in healthy subjects with normal renal function and subjects with mild to severe \nrenal impairment. Both studies consistently showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of telavancin, \nbut not the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) increases with decreasing renal function. Changes \nin AUC only become clinically relevant in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. \nTherefore, the same dose of 10 mg/kg/24 hr can be used in patients with normal renal function or mild \nrenal impairment. To ensure a comparable exposure in patients with moderate renal impairment, the \ndose should be lowered to 7.5 mg/kg/24 hr. \n \nRecommendations for dose adjustment can be found in section 4.2. \n \nHepatic impairment \nFollowing administration of a single 10 mg/kg dose of telavancin, the pharmacokinetics of telavancin \nin subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) were similar to that observed in \nsubjects with normal hepatic function. No adjustment of dosage is required for patients with mild to \nmoderate degrees of hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). The pharmacokinetics of telavancin have \nnot been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). \n \nObese patients \nBody mass index (BMI) at baseline was found to influence telavancin pharmacokinetics in the \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in healthy (without infection) adult subjects. Exposure to \ntelavancin increases with increase in BMI; for each 10-unit increase in BMI, it is estimated that plasma \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n12 \n\nexposure will increase by up to 25%. A dose adjustment should be made in obese patients with BMI > \n30 kg/m2 (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data  \n \nThe telavancin medicinal product, which contains the excipient hydroxypropylbetadex (HP-β-CD), \ninduced adverse effects in animal studies at plasma concentrations that were in the same range as \nclinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use.  \n \nThe liver, kidney, macrophages and testis were identified as target organs of toxicity in animals. \nIn the liver, treatment for 13 weeks or longer resulted in reversible degeneration/necrosis of \nhepatocytes accompanied by elevations in serum AST and ALT in rats and dogs. \n \nEffects on the kidney occurred after a minimum of 4 weeks of dosing and were a combination of renal \ntubular injury and tubular epithelial vacuolisation. The tubular injury was characterised by \ndegeneration and necrosis of proximal tubular cells, and was associated with increases in BUN and \ncreatinine that reach a maximum of 2 times the control values at the highest doses. The tubular injury \nwas reversible, but not all animals had yet reached full recovery 4 weeks after the end of treatment.  \n \nVacuolisation of tubular epithelium was a common observation in animals treated with the telavancin \nmedicinal product and with the vehicle (HP-β-CD). At higher doses or longer treatment durations, \nvacuolisation of the urothelium in the bladder also occurred. Vacuolisation was not associated with \nrenal function impairment, but was not reversible after 4 weeks of recovery. Vacuolisation is \nconsidered to represent a cytoprotective event and is expected to reverse with the same half-life as the \nturnover time of the proximal tubular cells. The presence of hydroxypropylbetadex in the formulation \nat a ratio of 1:10 reduces the incidence and severity of the changes due to telavancin and attenuates the \nglycopeptides-like toxicity of telavancin. \n \nSystemic macrophage hypertrophy and hyperplasia occurred in rats and dogs, in many organ systems \nthat normally contain macrophages. The macrophages were shown to contain telavancin and \nHP-β-CD. \n \nGenotoxicity was addressed with a standard in vitro and in vivo test battery. The studies did not \nprovide any evidence for a genotoxic potential of telavancin. \n \nAfter 13 weeks of treatment, reversible seminiferous tubular degeneration was observed in the testis of \nrats. In studies on fertility in male rats, decreases in sperm motility and epididymal sperm counts as \nwell as an increase in the frequency of abnormal sperm were demonstrated after 10 weeks of \nintravenous administration of telavancin. Male fertility was unaffected. In a second study, 6 weeks of \ndosing was associated with sloughed testicular germ cells in the epididymis, indicative of testicular \ninjury, and effects upon sperm quality and quantity were observed. Both effects were reversible \nfollowing an 8 week recovery period. The potential risk for humans is unknown (see section 4.6). \n \nIn rats and dogs vacuolisation of the epididymal tubular epithelium cells was also noted, and this \nfinding did not show reversibility after a recovery period of 4 weeks. Vacuolisation is considered to be \na cytoprotective event, which is not associated with functional impairment. \n \nIn embryo-fetal development studies malformations of digits and limbs were observed in rats, rabbits \nand minipigs. In the rat embryo-fetal development study dilatation of lateral ventricles of the brain was \nobserved in the high dose group. An increase in the number of stillborn pups was observed in these \npre- and post-natal studies (see section 4.3). \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n13 \n\n6.

What VIBATIV is and what it is used for \n \nVIBATIV contains telavancin as active substance, which is an antibiotic of the glycopeptide group. \nVIBATIV is used to treat adult patients with infections of the lungs that have developed in the \nhospital, including patients on artificial ventilation, when these infections are known or suspected to \nbe caused by bacteria called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).  \nIt is only used when the bacteria that cause these infections can be killed with telavancin. VIBATIV \ncan only be used when other antibiotics are not suitable. \n \nIf you also have other bacteria that cause your infection, your doctor may prescribe other antibiotics in \naddition to VIBATIV. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use VIBATIV \n \nDo not use VIBATIV \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to telavancin or any of the other ingredients of VIBATIV \n\n(listed in section 6) \n- If you suffer from severe kidney problems, or receive haemodialysis  \n- if you are pregnant \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given VIBATIV \n\n \n\n- if you have kidney problems. Your doctor may decide to reduce the dose of VIBATIV and \nmonitor you more closely during treatment. Alternatively, your doctor may decide that this \nmedicine is not suitable for you.  \n\n- if you are at greater risk of developing kidney disorders or if you are receiving other \nmedicines that can affect your kidney. Your doctor will tell you if this is the case and may \ndecide to monitor you more closely during treatment. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n27 \n\n- if you experience skin reactions to the product. Your doctor may decide to adjust the rate of the \ninfusion. \n\n- if you are allergic to antibiotics such as vancomycin. Tell your doctor immediately if this is the \ncase. \n\n- if you are suffering from heart disorders. Tell your doctor immediately if this is the case. \n- if you notice a change in your hearing. Tell your doctor immediately if this is the case. Your \n\ndoctor may monitor your hearing during treatment. Ringing in the ears and deafness are possible \nside effects. \n\n- While antibiotics including VIBATIV fight certain bacteria, other bacteria and fungi may \ncontinue to grow. This is called overgrowth. Your doctor will monitor you for any potential \ninfections and treat you if necessary.  \n\n- if you develop diarrhoea during or shortly after your treatment, tell your doctor immediately. Do \nnot take any diarrhoea medicine without first checking with your doctor.  \n\n- if you are suffering from more than one infection. Your doctor will treat you as necessary.  \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nTelavancin is not to be used in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and VIBATIV \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nTelavancin may interfere with some laboratory tests that measure how well your blood is clotting. The \ntest results can suggest poor blood clotting when, in fact, there is no problem. Tell your doctor that \nyou are receiving VIBATIV. \n \nTelavancin may interfere with some laboratory tests that measure proteins in the urine. Tell your \ndoctor that you are receiving VIBATIV. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nTelavancin must not be given to pregnant women. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may \nbe pregnant, or are trying to become pregnant. You have to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with VIBATIV.  \n \nIt is not known if telavancin passes into breast milk in humans. Ask your doctor for advice before \nbreastfeeding your baby.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nVIBATIV may cause side effects, such as dizziness, sleepiness, confusion or blurred vision that can \nhave an influence on the ability to drive or operate machinery. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of VIBATIV \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use VIBATIV \n \nVIBATIV will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse.  \nThe dose given will depend on how much you weigh. The dose for adults (18 years and older) is \n10 milligrams (mg) for every kilogram (kg) of body weight, given once a day. This dose is given as an \ninfusion (drip into a vein) over a period of about 60 minutes. \nIf your kidneys do not work well or if you are overweight, the dose may be reduced. \n \nA course of treatment usually lasts for 7 to 21 days. Your doctor will decide how long you should be \ntreated.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n28 \n\nIf you use more VIBATIV than you should  \nIf you are given more VIBATIV than you should receive, the chance of experiencing the following \nside effects increases: disturbed taste, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, reactions at the site of the \ninfusion, headache, rash, skin flushing of the upper body. If this happens, the infusion of telavancin \nwill be stopped and the doctor will check the functioning of your kidneys.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

Bolus injections must \nnot be administered.  \n \nThe following formula can be used to calculate to volume of reconstituted VIBATIV concentrate \nrequired to prepare a dose:  \n \nTelavancin dose (mg) = 10 mg/kg (or 7.5 mg/kg) x patient body weight (in kg)  \n \nVolume of reconstituted concentrate (ml) = Telavancin dose (mg)/15 (mg/ml)  \n \nIncompatibilities  \n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicine must not be mixed with other medicines. \n \nShelf life  \n \nShelf life of reconstituted concentrate: The reconstituted concentrate should be diluted immediately \nafter preparation.  \n \nShelf life of diluted product: Chemical and physical in use stability of the reconstituted solution and \nthe diluted solution in the infusion bag has been demonstrated for 24 hours under refrigeration \n(2-8°C). From a microbiological point of view the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in use storage times are the responsibility of the user and should not be longer than \n24 hours at 2-8°C.  \n \nSpecial precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nThe powder must be reconstituted and the resulting concentrate must then be immediately diluted \nfurther prior to use.  \n \nPreparation of the reconstituted concentrate (VIBATIV 250 mg vial)  \nThe contents of the vial containing 250 mg telavancin must be reconstituted with 15 ml of either \ndextrose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection, or water for injections or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n31 \n\n(0.9%) solution for injection to obtain a concentration of approximately 15 mg/ml (total volume of \napproximately 17 ml).  \n \nPreparation of the reconstituted concentrate (VIBATIV 750 mg vial)  \nThe contents of the vial containing 750 mg telavancin must be reconstituted with 45 ml of either \ndextrose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection, or water for injections or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for injection to obtain a concentration of approximately 15 mg/ml (total volume of \napproximately 50 ml).  \n \nDiscard the vial if the vacuum does not pull the diluent into the vial.  \n \nAseptic technique must be used to reconstitute VIBATIV. After addition of either dextrose 50 mg/ml \n(5%) solution for injection, or water for injections or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \ninjection, the contents of the vial are mixed by swirling gently to facilitate reconstitution.  \n \nReconstitution time is not more than 5 minutes for the vial containing 250 mg.  \nReconstitution time is not more than 10 minutes for the vial containing 750 mg.  \nMixing is continued until the content of the vial is completely dissolved and is free of particulate \nmatter by visual inspection.  \n \nAppearance of reconstituted concentrate  \nA reconstituted concentrate of VIBATIV is a clear, colourless to pale pink solution. Foaming may \noccur during reconstitution but will dissipate upon standing.  \n \nPreparation of final diluted solution for infusion  \nReconstituted concentrate must be further diluted prior to administration.  \nFor doses of 150 to 800 mg, the appropriate volume of reconstituted concentrate must be further \ndiluted in 100 to 250 ml prior to infusion. Doses less than 150 mg or greater than 800 mg should be \nfurther diluted in a volume resulting in a final solution of 0.6 to 8 mg/ml. Appropriate infusion \nsolutions include: dextrose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection, sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \nsolution for injection or lactated Ringer’s solution for injection. The dilution is to be made under \naseptic conditions.  \n \nThe solution is to be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. \nThe solution should only be used if the solution is clear and free from particles.  \n \nDisposal  \nFor single use only. Discard any unused solution.  \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
