NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nAbraxane 5 mg/ml powder for suspension for infusion.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach vial contains 100 mg of paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound nanoparticles. \n\nEach vial contains 250 mg of paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound nanoparticles. \n\n \n\nAfter reconstitution, each ml of suspension contains 5 mg of paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound \n\nnanoparticles. \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect \n\nEach ml of concentrate contains 0.183 mmol sodium, which is 4.2 mg of sodium. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder for suspension for infusion. \n\nThe reconstituted suspension has a pH of 6-7.5 and an osmolality of 300-360 mOsm/kg. \n\nThe powder is white to yellow. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nAbraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in adult patients who \n\nhave failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard, anthracycline containing \n\ntherapy is not indicated (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAbraxane in combination with gemcitabine is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with \n\nmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. \n\n \n\nAbraxane in combination with carboplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung \n\ncancer in adult patients who are not candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nAbraxane should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units specialised \n\nin the administration of cytotoxic agents. It should not be substituted for or with other paclitaxel \n\nformulations. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nBreast cancer \n\nThe recommended dose of Abraxane is 260 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 \n\nweeks.  \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDose adjustments during treatment of breast cancer \n\nPatients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3 for a week or longer) or \n\nsevere sensory neuropathy during Abraxane therapy should have the dose reduced to 220 mg/m2 for \n\nsubsequent courses. Following recurrence of severe neutropenia or severe sensory neuropathy, additional \n\ndose reduction should be made to 180 mg/m2. Abraxane should not be administered until neutrophil \n\ncounts recover to >1500 cells/mm3. For Grade 3 sensory neuropathy, withhold treatment until resolution \n\nto Grade 1 or 2, followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses. \n\n \n\nPancreatic adenocarcinoma \n\nThe recommended dose of Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine is 125 mg/m2 administered \n\nintravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The concurrent recommended \n\ndose of gemcitabine is 1000 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes immediately after the \n\ncompletion of Abraxane administration on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments during treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma \n\n \n\nTable 1: Dose level reductions for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma \n\nDose Level  Abraxane Dose (mg/m2) Gemcitabine Dose (mg/m2) \n\nFull dose 125 1000 \n\n1st dose level reduction 100 800 \n\n2nd dose level reduction 75 600 \n\nIf additional dose reduction \n\nrequired \nDiscontinue treatment Discontinue treatment \n\n \n\nTable 2: Dose modifications for neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia at the start of a cycle or \n\nwithin a cycle for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma \n\nCycle \n\nDay \n\nANC count \n\n(cells/mm3) \n \n\nPlatelet count \n\n(cells/mm3) \n\nAbraxane \n\n Dose   \n\nGemcitabine \n\nDose  \n\nDay 1 < 1500  OR < 100,000 Delay doses until recovery \n\nDay 8 ≥ 500 but < 1000 OR ≥ 50,000 but < 75,000 Reduce doses 1 dose level \n\n < 500 OR < 50,000 Withhold doses  \n\nDay 15:    If Day 8 doses were given without modification:  \n\nDay 15 ≥ 500 but < 1000 OR ≥ 50,000 but < 75,000 \n\nTreat with Day 8 dose level and \n\nfollow with WBC Growth Factors  \n\nOR \n\n Reduce doses 1 dose level from \n\nDay 8 doses  \n\n < 500 OR < 50,000 Withhold doses \n\nDay 15:    If Day 8 doses were reduced:  \n\nDay 15 ≥ 1000  AND ≥ 75,000   \n\nReturn to the Day 1 dose levels and \n\nfollow with WBC Growth Factors  \n\nOR \n\nTreat with same doses as Day 8   \n\n ≥ 500 but < 1000 OR ≥ 50,000 but < 75,000 Treat with Day 8 dose levels and \n\n\n\n4 \n\nfollow with WBC Growth Factors  \n\nOR  \n\nReduce doses 1 dose level from \n\nDay 8 doses  \n\n < 500 OR < 50,000 Withhold doses \n\nDay 15:    IF Day 8 doses were withheld:  \n\nDay 15 ≥ 1000  AND ≥ 75,000   \n\nReturn to Day 1 dose levels and \n\nfollow with WBC Growth Factors  \n\nOR \n\nReduce doses 1 dose level from \n\nDay 1 doses  \n\n ≥ 500 but < 1000 OR ≥ 50,000 but < 75,000 \n\nReduce 1 dose level and follow \n\nwith WBC Growth Factors  \n\nOR \n\nReduce doses 2 dose levels from \n\nDay 1 doses  \n\n < 500 OR < 50,000 Withhold doses \n\nAbbreviations: ANC=Absolute Neutrophil Count; WBC=white blood cell \n\n \n\nTable 3: Dose modifications for other adverse drug reactions in patients with pancreatic \n\nadenocarcinoma \n\nAdverse Drug Reaction \n\n(ADR) \nAbraxane Dose Gemcitabine Dose \n\nFebrile Neutropenia: \n\nGrade 3 or 4 \n\nWithhold doses until fever resolves and ANC ≥ 1500; resume at next \n\nlower dose levela \n\nPeripheral Neuropathy: \n\nGrade 3 or 4 \n\nWithhold dose until improves to \n\n≤ Grade 1;  \n\nresume at next lower dose levela \n\nTreat with same dose \n\nCutaneous Toxicity: \n\nGrade 2 or 3 \n\nReduce to next lower dose levela;  \n\ndiscontinue treatment if ADR persists  \n\nGastrointestinal \n\nToxicity: \n\nGrade 3 mucositis or \n\ndiarrhoea \n\nWithhold doses until improves to ≤ Grade 1;  \n\nresume at next lower dose levela \n\na. See Table 1 for dose level reductions \n \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer: \n\nThe recommended dose of Abraxane is 100 mg/m2 administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 \n\nminutes on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle.  The recommended dose of carboplatin is AUC = 6 \n\nmg•min/mL on Day 1 only of each 21-day cycle, beginning immediately after the end of Abraxane \n\nadministration.   \n\n \n\nDose adjustments during treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: \n\nAbraxane should not be administered on Day 1 of a cycle until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is ≥1500 \n\ncells/mm3 and platelet count is ≥100,000 cells/mm3. For each subsequent weekly dose of Abraxane, \n\npatients must have an ANC ≥500 cells/mm3 and platelets >50,000 cells/mm3 or the dose is to be withheld \n\n\n\n5 \n\nuntil counts recover.  When counts recover, resume dosing the following week according to the criteria in \n\nTable 4. Reduce subsequent dose only if criteria in Table 4 are met.  \n\n \n\nTable 4: Dose reductions for haematologic toxicities in patients with non-small cell lung cancer \nHaematologic Toxicity Occurrence Dose of Abraxane \n\n(mg/m2)1 \n\nDose of carboplatin \n\n(AUC mg•min/mL)1 \n\nNadir ANC <500/mm3 with neutropenic \n\nfever > 38°C \n\nOR \n\nDelay of next cycle due to persistent \n\nneutropenia2 (Nadir ANC <1500/mm3) \n\nOR \n\nNadir ANC <500/mm3 for > 1 week \n\nFirst 75 4.5 \n\nSecond 50 3.0 \n\nThird Discontinue Treatment \n\nNadir platelets <50,000/mm3 \nFirst 75 4.5 \n\nSecond Discontinue Treatment \n1On Day 1 of the 21-day cycle reduce the dose of Abraxane and carboplatin simultaneously.

For ≥ Grade \n\n3 peripheral neuropathy, withhold treatment until resolution to ≤ Grade 1.  Treatment may be resumed at \n\nthe next lower dose level in subsequent cycles according to the guidelines in Table 5.  For any other Grade \n\n3 or 4 non-haematologic toxicity, interrupt treatment until the toxicity improves to ≤ Grade 2, then restart \n\ntreatment according to the guidelines in Table 5.  \n\n \n\nTable 5: Dose reductions for non-haematologic toxicities in patients with non-small cell lung cancer \nNon-haematologic Toxicity Occurrence Dose of Abraxane \n\n(mg/m2)1 \n\nDose of carboplatin \n\n(AUC mg•min/mL)1 \n\nGrade 2 or 3 cutaneous toxicity \n\nGrade 3 diarrhoea \n\nGrade 3 mucositis \n\n≥ Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy \n\nAny other Grade 3 or 4 non-\n\nhaematologic toxicity  \n\nFirst 75 4.5 \n\nSecond 50 3.0 \n\nThird Discontinue Treatment \n\nGrade 4 cutaneous toxicity, diarrhoea, or \n\nmucositis \n\nFirst Discontinue Treatment \n\n1On Day 1 of the 21-day cycle reduce the dose of Abraxane and carboplatin simultaneously. On Days 8 or 15 of the 21-day cycle reduce the dose \n\nof Abraxane; reduce the dose of carboplatin in the subsequent cycle. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nFor patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1 to ≤ 1.5 x ULN and aspartate \n\naminotransferase [AST] ≤ 10 x ULN), no dose adjustments are required, regardless of indication. Treat \n\nwith same doses as patients with normal hepatic function. \n\n \n\nFor metastatic breast cancer patients and non-small cell lung cancer patients with moderate to severe \n\nhepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to ≤ 5 x ULN and AST ≤ 10 x ULN), a 20% reduction in dose is \n\nrecommended. The reduced dose may be escalated to the dose for patients with normal hepatic function if \n\nthe patient is tolerating the treatment for at least two cycles (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nFor patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that have moderate to severe hepatic \n\nimpairment, there are insufficient data to permit dosage recommendations (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nFor patients with total bilirubin > 5 x ULN or AST > 10 x ULN, there are insufficient data to permit \n\ndosage recommendations regardless of indication (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nAdjustment of the starting Abraxane dose is not required for patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (estimated creatinine clearance ≥30 to <90 ml/min). There are insufficient data available to \n\nrecommend dose modifications of Abraxane in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal \n\ndisease (estimated creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo additional dosage reductions, other than those for all patients, are recommended for patients 65 years \n\nand older. \n\n \n\nOf the 229 patients in the randomized study who received Abraxane monotherapy for breast cancer, 13% \n\nwere at least 65 years of age and < 2% were 75 years and older. No toxicities occurred notably more \n\nfrequently among patients at least 65 years of age who received Abraxane. However, a subsequent \n\nanalysis in 981 patients receiving Abraxane monotherapy for metastatic breast cancer, of which 15% were \n\n≥ 65 years old and 2% were ≥ 75 years old, showed a higher incidence of epistaxis, diarrhoea, \n\ndehydration, fatigue and peripheral oedema in patients ≥ 65 years. \n\n \n\nOf the 421 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the randomized study who received Abraxane in \n\ncombination with gemcitabine, 41% were 65 years and older and 10% were 75 years and older. In patients \n\naged 75 years and older who received Abraxane and gemcitabine, there was a higher incidence of serious \n\nadverse reactions and adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). Patients \n\nwith pancreatic adenocarcinoma aged 75 years and older should be carefully assessed before treatment is \n\nconsidered (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nOf the 514 patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the randomized study who received Abraxane in \n\ncombination with carboplatin, 31% were 65 years or older and 3.5% were 75 years or older.  \n\nMyelosuppression events, peripheral neuropathy events, and arthralgia were more frequent in patients 65 \n\nyears or older compared to patients younger than 65 years of age. There is limited experience of \n\nAbraxane/carboplatin use in patients 75 years or older. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling using data from 125 patients with advanced solid tumours \n\nindicates that patients ≥ 65 years of age may be more susceptible to development of neutropenia within the \n\nfirst treatment cycle. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Abraxane in children and adolescents aged 0 to less than 18 years has not been \n\nestablished. Currently available data are described in section s 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on \n\na posology can be made. There is no relevant use of Abraxane in the paediatric population for the \n\nindication of metastatic breast cancer or pancreatic adenocarcinoma or non-small cell lung cancer. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nAdminister reconstituted Abraxane suspension intravenously using an infusion set incorporating a 15 µm \n\nfilter. Following administration, it is recommended that the intravenous line be flushed with sodium \n\nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure administration of the complete dose. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.  \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nLactation (see section 4.6). \n\nPatients who have baseline neutrophil counts <1500 cells/mm3. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nAbraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which may have substantially \n\ndifferent pharmacological properties compared to other formulations of paclitaxel (see sections 5.1 and \n\n5.2). It should not be substituted for or with other paclitaxel formulations. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\nRare occurrences of severe hypersensitivity reactions, including very rare events of anaphylactic reactions \n\nwith fatal outcome, have been reported. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the medicinal product should \n\nbe discontinued immediately, symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the patient should not be \n\nrechallenged with paclitaxel. \n\n \n\nHaematology \n\nBone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) occurs frequently with Abraxane. Neutropenia is \n\ndose-dependent and a dose-limiting toxicity. Frequent monitoring of blood cell counts should be \n\nperformed during Abraxane therapy. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Abraxane \n\nuntil neutrophils recover to >1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to >100,000 cells/mm3 (see section \n\n4.2). \n\n \n\nNeuropathy \n\nSensory neuropathy occurs frequently with Abraxane, although development of severe symptoms is less \n\ncommon. The occurrence of Grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy does not generally require dose reduction. \n\nWhen Abraxane is used as monotherapy, if Grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops, treatment should be \n\nwithheld until resolution to Grade 1 or 2 followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of \n\nAbraxane is recommended (see section 4.2). For combination use of Abraxane and gemcitabine, if Grade \n\n3 or higher peripheral neuropathy develops, withhold Abraxane; continue treatment with gemcitabine at \n\nthe same dose. Resume Abraxane at reduced dose when peripheral neuropathy improves to Grade 0 or 1 \n\n(see section 4.2). For combination use of Abraxane and carboplatin, if Grade 3 or higher peripheral \n\nneuropathy develops, treatment should be withheld until improvement to Grade 0 or 1 followed by a dose \n\nreduction for all subsequent courses of Abraxane and carboplatin (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nSepsis \n\nSepsis was reported at a rate of 5% in patients with or without neutropenia who received Abraxane in \n\ncombination with gemcitabine. Complications due to the underlying pancreatic cancer, especially biliary \n\nobstruction or presence of biliary stent, were identified as significant contributing factors. If a patient \n\nbecomes febrile (regardless of neutrophil count), initiate treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. For \n\nfebrile neutropenia, withhold Abraxane and gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC ≥ 1500 cells/mm3, \n\nthen resume treatment at reduced dose levels (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPneumonitis \n\nPneumonitis occurred in 1% of patients when Abraxane was used as monotherapy and in 4% of patients \n\nwhen Abraxane was used in combination with gemcitabine. Closely monitor all patients for signs and \n\nsymptoms of pneumonitis. After ruling out infectious etiology and upon making a diagnosis of \n\npneumonitis, permanently discontinue treatment with Abraxane and gemcitabine and promptly initiate \n\nappropriate treatment and supportive measures (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBecause the toxicity of paclitaxel can be increased with hepatic impairment, administration of Abraxane in \n\npatients with hepatic impairment should be performed with caution. Patients with hepatic impairment may \n\nbe at increased risk of toxicity, particularly from myelosuppression; such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored for development of profound myelosuppression. \n\n \n\nAbraxane is not recommended in patients that have total bilirubin > 5 x ULN or AST > 10 x ULN. In \n\naddition, Abraxane is not recommended in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that \n\nhave moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN and AST ≤ 10 x ULN) (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nCardiotoxicity \n\nRare reports of congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction have been observed among \n\nindividuals receiving Abraxane. Most of the individuals were previously exposed to cardiotoxic medicinal \n\nproducts such as anthracyclines or had underlying cardiac history. Thus, patients receiving Abraxane \n\nshould be vigilantly monitored by physicians for the occurrence of cardiac events. \n\n \n\nCNS metastases \n\nThe effectiveness and safety of Abraxane in patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases has \n\nnot been established. CNS metastases are generally not well controlled by systemic chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal symptoms \n\nIf patients experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea following the administration of Abraxane, they may \n\nbe treated with commonly used anti-emetics and constipating agents. \n\n \n\nPatients 75 years and older \n\nFor patients of 75 years and older, no benefit for the combination treatment of Abraxane and gemcitabine \n\nin comparison to gemcitabine monotherapy has been demonstrated. In the very elderly (≥75 years) who \n\nreceived Abraxane and gemcitabine, there was a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions and adverse \n\nreactions that led to treatment discontinuation including haematologic toxicities, peripheral neuropathy, \n\ndecreased appetite and dehydration. Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma aged 75 years and older \n\nshould be carefully assessed for their ability to tolerate Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine with \n\nspecial consideration to performance status, co-morbidities and increased risk of infections (see section \n\n4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nOther \n\nAlthough limited data is available, no clear benefit in terms of prolonged overall survival has been \n\ndemonstrated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients with normal CA 19-9 levels prior to start of treatment \n\nwith Abraxane and gemcitabine (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nErlotinib should not be co-administered with Abraxane plus gemcitabine (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\nWhen reconstituted, each ml of Abraxane concentrate contains 0.183 mmol sodium, which is 4.2 mg of \n\nsodium. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nThe metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed, in part, by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and \n\nCYP3A4 (see section 5.2). Therefore, in the absence of a PK drug-drug interaction study, caution should \n\nbe exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit either \n\nCYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole and other imidazole antifungals, erythromycin, fluoxetine, \n\ngemfibrozil, clopidogrel, cimetidine, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir) because toxicity of \n\n\n\n9 \n\npaclitaxel may be increased due to higher paclitaxel exposure. Administering paclitaxel concomitantly \n\nwith medicines known to induce either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, \n\nefavirenz, nevirapine) is not recommended because efficacy may be compromised because of lower \n\npaclitaxel exposures. \n\n \n\nPaclitaxel and gemcitabine do not share a common metabolic pathway. Paclitaxel clearance is primarily \n\ndetermined by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 mediated metabolism followed by biliary excretion, while \n\ngemcitabine is inactivated by cytidine deaminase followed by urinary excretion. Pharmacokinetic \n\ninteractions between Abraxane and gemcitabine have not been evaluated in humans. \n\n \n\nA pharmacokinetic study was conducted with Abraxane and carboplatin in non-small cell lung cancer \n\npatients. There were no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions between Abraxane and \n\ncarboplatin. \n\n \n\nAbraxane is indicated as monotherapy for breast cancer, in combination with gemcitabine for pancreatic \n\nadenocarcinoma, or in combination with carboplatin for non-small cell lung cancer (see section 4.1). \n\nAbraxane should not be used in combination with other anticancer agents.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n\n \n\nContraception in males and females \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and up to 1 month \n\nafter receiving treatment with Abraxane. Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to use effective \n\ncontraception and to avoid fathering a child during and up to six months after treatment. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are very limited data on the use of paclitaxel in human pregnancy. Paclitaxel is suspected to cause \n\nserious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Studies in animals have shown reproductive \n\ntoxicity (see section 5.3). Women of childbearing potential should have a pregnancy test prior to starting \n\ntreatment with Abraxane. Abraxane should not be used in pregnancy, and in women of childbearing \n\npotential not using effective contraception, unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment \n\nwith paclitaxel. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nPaclitaxel and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). It is not \n\nknown if paclitaxel is excreted in human milk. Because of potential serious adverse reactions in \n\nbreast-feeding infants, Abraxane is contraindicated during lactation. Breast-feeding must be discontinued \n\nfor the duration of therapy.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nAbraxane induced infertility in male rats (see section 5.3). Based on findings in animals, male and female \n\nfertility may be compromised. Male patients should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to \n\ntreatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Abraxane. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n\n \n\nAbraxane has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Abraxane may cause \n\nadverse reactions such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (common) that may affect the ability to \n\ndrive and use machinery. Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines if they feel tired or \n\ndizzy. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n\nThe most common clinically significant adverse reactions associated with the use of Abraxane have been \n\nneutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, arthralgia/myalgia and gastrointestinal disorders.  \n\n \n\nThe frequencies of adverse reactions associated with the administration of Abraxane are listed in Table 6 \n\n(Abraxane as monotherapy) and Table 7 (Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine), and Table 9 \n\n(Abraxane in combination with carboplatin). \n\n \n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1000 \n\nto <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000), very rare (<1/10,000).

MedDRA preferred terms to capture a medical concept. \n1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on one definitely related case in a population of 789 patients. \n2 As reported in the post-marketing surveillance of Abraxane. \n3 The frequency of pneumonitis is calculated based on pooled data in 1310 patients in clinical trials receiving Abraxane monotherapy for breast \n\ncancer and for other indications using MedDRA SMQ Interstitial lung disease. See section 4.4.  \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nThe following are the most common and clinically relevant adverse reactions related to 229 patients with \n\nmetastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg/m2 Abraxane once every three weeks in the pivotal \n\nphase III clinical study. \n\n  \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nNeutropenia was the most notable important haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients), and \n\nwas rapidly reversible and dose dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients. Grade 4 \n\nneutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) occurred in 9% of patients treated with Abraxane. Febrile neutropenia \n\noccurred in four patients on Abraxane. Anaemia (Hb < 10 g/dl) was observed in 46% of patients on \n\nAbraxane and was severe (Hb < 8 g/dl) in three cases. Lymphopenia was observed in 45% of the patients. \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nIn general, the frequency and severity of neurotoxicity was dose-dependent in patients receiving \n\nAbraxane. Peripheral neuropathy (mostly Grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy) was observed in 68% of \n\npatients on Abraxane with 10% being Grade 3, and no cases of Grade 4. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nNausea occurred in 29% of the patients and diarrhoea in 25% of the patients.  \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nAlopecia was observed in >80% of the patients treated with Abraxane. The majority of alopecia events \n\noccurred less than one month after initiation of Abraxane. Pronounced hair loss ≥50% is expected for the \n\nmajority of patients who experience alopecia. \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nArthralgia occurred in 32% of patients on Abraxane and was severe in 6% of cases. Myalgia occurred in \n\n24% of patients on Abraxane and was severe in 7% of cases. The symptoms were usually transient, \n\ntypically occurred three days after Abraxane administration and resolved within a week.  \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nAsthenia/Fatigue was reported in 40% of the patients. \n\n \n\nPancreatic adenocarcinoma (Abraxane administered in combination with gemcitabine) \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions were assessed in 421 patients treated with Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine \n\nand 402 gemcitabine monotherapy-treated patients receiving first-line systemic treatment for metastatic \n\nadenocarcinoma of the pancreas in a phase III randomized, controlled, open-label trial.

The median time to improvement by at least 1 grade was \n\n21 days, and the median time to improvement from Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy to Grade 0 or 1 was 29 \n\ndays. Of the patients with treatment interrupted due to peripheral neuropathy, 44% (31/70 patients) were \n\nable to resume Abraxane at a reduced dose. No patients treated with Abraxane in combination with \n\ngemcitabine had Grade 4 peripheral neuropathy. \n\n \n\nSepsis \n\nSepsis was reported at a rate of 5% in patients with or without neutropenia who received Abraxane in \n\ncombination with gemcitabine during the conduct of a trial in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Complications \n\ndue to the underlying pancreatic cancer, especially biliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent, were \n\nidentified as significant contributing factors. If a patient becomes febrile (regardless of neutrophil count), \n\ninitiate treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. For febrile neutropenia, withhold Abraxane and \n\ngemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC ≥ 1500 cells/mm3, then resume treatment at reduced dose levels \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPneumonitis \n\nPneumonitis has been reported at a rate of 4% with the use of Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine. \n\nOf the 17 cases of pneumonitis reported in patients treated with Abraxane in combination with \n\ngemcitabine, 2 had a fatal outcome. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. \n\nAfter ruling out infectious etiology and upon making a diagnosis of pneumonitis, permanently discontinue \n\ntreatment with Abraxane and gemcitabine and promptly initiate appropriate treatment and supportive \n\nmeasures (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer (Abraxane administered in combination with carboplatin) \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nTable 9 lists adverse reactions associated with the administration of Abraxane in combination with \n\ncarboplatin.  \n\n \n\nTable 9: Adverse reactions reported with Abraxane in combination with carboplatin (N = 514) \n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations \n\nCommon: Pneumonia, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary \n\ntract infection \n\n \n\nUncommon: Sepsis, oral candidiasis \n\nBlood and lymphatic \n\nsystem disorders1 \n\nVery common: Neutropenia1, thrombocytopenia1, anaemia1, leukopenia1 \n\n \n\nCommon: Febrile neutropenia, lymphopenia \n\n \n\nUncommon: Pancytopenia \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\nUncommon: Drug hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition disorders \n\nVery common: Decreased appetite \n\n \n\nCommon: Dehydration \n\nPsychiatric disorders Common: Insomnia \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: Peripheral neuropathy2 \n\n \n\nCommon: Dysgeusia, headache, dizziness \n\nEye disorders Common: Vision blurred \n\nVascular disorders Common: Hypotension, hypertension \n\n \n\nUncommon: Flushing \n\nRespiratory thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\nVery common: Dyspnoea \n\n \n\nCommon: Haemoptysis, epistaxis, cough  \n\n \n\nUncommon: Pneumonitis3 \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, constipation  \n\n \n\nCommon: Stomatitis, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, dysphagia \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common: Hyperbilirubinaemia \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\nVery common: Rash, alopecia \n\n \n\nCommon: Pruritus, nail disorder \n\n \n\nUncommon: Skin exfoliation, dermatitis allergic, urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and \n\nconnective tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: Arthralgia, myalgia \n\n \n\nCommon: Back pain, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain \n\n\n\n17 \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nVery common: Fatigue, asthenia, oedema peripheral \n\n \n\nCommon: Pyrexia, chest pain \n\n \n\nUncommon: Mucosal inflammation, infusion site extravasation, infusion \n\nsite inflammation, infusion site rash \n\nInvestigations Common: Alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase \n\nincreased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, weight decreased \n\nMedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities: SMQ = Standardized MedDRA Query \n1 Based on laboratory assessments: maximal degree of myelosuppression (treated population) \n2 Peripheral neuropathy is evaluated using the SMQ neuropathy (broad scope) \n3 Pneumonitis is evaluated using the SMQ interstitial lung disease (broad scope) \n\n \n\nFor non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with Abraxane and carboplatin, the median time to first \n\noccurrence of Grade 3 treatment related peripheral neuropathy was 121 days, and the median time to \n\nimprovement from Grade 3 treatment related peripheral neuropathy to Grade 1 was 38 days.  No patients \n\ntreated with Abraxane and carboplatin experienced Grade 4 peripheral neuropathy. \n\n \n\nAnemia and thrombocytopenia were more commonly reported in the Abraxane arm than in the Taxol arm \n\n(54% versus 28% and 45% versus 27% respectively).  \n\nPatient-reported taxane toxicity was assessed using the 4 subscales of the Functional Assessment of \n\nCancer Therapy (FACT)-Taxane questionnaire. Using repeated measure analysis, 3 of the 4 subscales \n\n(peripheral neuropathy, pain hands/feet, and hearing) favored Abraxane and carboplatin (p ≤ 0.002).  For \n\nthe other subscale (oedema), there was no difference in the treatment arms. \n\n \n\nPost-marketing experience \n\n \n\nCranial nerve palsies, vocal cord paresis, and rare reports of severe hypersensitivity reactions have been \n\nreported during post-marketing surveillance of Abraxane. \n\n \n\nThere have been rare reports of reduced visual acuity due to cystoid macular oedema during treatment \n\nwith Abraxane. Upon diagnosis of cystoid macular oedema, treatment with Abraxane should be \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\nThere have been reports of tumour lysis syndrome during treatment with Abraxane. \n\n \n\nScleroderma of the skin has been reported. In some patients previously exposed to capecitabine, reports of \n\npalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesiae have been reported as part of the continuing surveillance of \n\nAbraxane. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, true estimates of \n\nfrequency cannot be made and a causal relationship to the events has not been established. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe study consisted of 106 patients, 104 of whom were paediatric patients aged from 6 months to less than \n\n18 years (see section 5.1). Every patient experienced at least 1 adverse reaction. The most frequently \n\nreported adverse reactions were neutropenia, anaemia, leukopenia and pyrexia. Serious adverse reactions \n\nreported in more than 2 patients were pyrexia, back pain, peripheral oedema and vomiting. No new safety \n\nsignals were identified in the limited number of paediatric patients treated with Abraxane and the safety \n\nprofile was similar to that of the adult population. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \n\nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere is no known antidote for paclitaxel overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be \n\nclosely monitored. Treatment should be directed at the major anticipated toxicities, which are bone \n\nmarrow suppression, mucositis and peripheral neuropathy. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, plant alkaloids and other natural products, taxanes, \n\nATC Code: L01CD01 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action  \n\nPaclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and \n\nstabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation. This stability results in the inhibition of the \n\nnormal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic \n\ncellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or “bundles” of microtubules \n\nthroughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.  \n\n \n\nAbraxane contains human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles of approximately 130 nm in size, where \n\nthe paclitaxel is present in a non-crystalline, amorphous state. Upon intravenous administration, the \n\nnanoparticles dissociate rapidly into soluble, albumin bound paclitaxel complexes of approximately 10 nm \n\nin size. Albumin is known to mediate endothelial caveolar transcytosis of plasma constituents, and in vitro \n\nstudies demonstrated that the presence of albumin in Abraxane enhances transport of paclitaxel across \n\nendothelial cells. It is hypothesised that this enhanced transendothelial caveolar transport is mediated by \n\nthe gp-60 albumin receptor, and that there is enhanced accumulation of paclitaxel in the area of tumour \n\ndue to the albumin-binding protein Secreted Protein Acidic Rich in Cysteine (SPARC). \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n  \n\nBreast cancer \n\nData from 106 patients accrued in two single-arm open-label studies and from 454 patients treated in a \n\nrandomised Phase III comparative study are available to support the use of Abraxane in metastatic breast \n\ncancer. This information is presented below. \n\n \n\nSingle-arm open-label studies \n\nIn one study, Abraxane was administered as a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg/m2 to 43 patients \n\nwith metastatic breast cancer. The second trial utilised a dose of 300 mg/m2 as a 30-minute infusion in 63 \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients were treated without steroid pre-treatment or planned \n\nG-CSF support. Cycles were administered at 3-week intervals. The response rates in all patients were \n\n39.5% (95% CI: 24.9%-54.2%) and 47.6% (95% CI: 35.3%-60.0%), respectively. The median time to \n\ndisease progression was 5.3 months (175 mg/m2; 95% CI: 4.6-6.2 months) and 6.1 months (300 mg/m2; \n\n95% CI: 4.2-9.8 months). \n\n \n\nRandomised comparative study \n\nThis multi-centre trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who were treated every 3 \n\nweeks with single-agent paclitaxel, either as solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 given as a 3-hour \n\ninfusion with premedication to prevent hypersensitivity (N = 225), or as Abraxane 260 mg/m2 given as a \n\n30 minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).  \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nSixty-four percent of patients had impaired performance status (ECOG 1 or 2) at study entry; 79% had \n\nvisceral metastases; and 76% had > 3 sites of metastases. Fourteen percent of the patients had not received \n\nprior chemotherapy; 27% had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting only, 40% in the metastatic \n\nsetting only, and 19% in both metastatic and adjuvant settings. Fifty-nine percent received study medicinal \n\nproduct as second or greater than second-line therapy. Seventy-seven percent of the patients had been \n\npreviously exposed to anthracyclines. \n\n \n\nResults for overall response rate and time to disease progression, and progression-free survival and \n\nsurvival for patients receiving > 1st-line therapy, are shown below. \n\n \n\nTable 10: Results for overall response rate, median time to disease progression, and \n\nprogression-free survival as assessed by the investigator  \n\nEfficacy variable \nAbraxane \n\n(260 mg/m2) \n\nSolvent-based paclitaxel \n\n(175 mg/m2) \np-value \n\nResponse rate [95% CI] (%) \n\n> 1st-line therapy 26.5 [18.98, 34.05] (n = 132) 13.2 [7.54, 18.93] (n = 136) 0.006a \n\n*Median time to disease progression [95% CI] (weeks) \n\n> 1st-line therapy 20.9 [15.7, 25.9] (n = 131) 16.1 [15.0, 19.3] (n = 135) 0.011b \n\n*Median progression free survival [95% CI] (weeks) \n\n> 1st-line therapy 20.6 [15.6, 25.9] (n = 131) 16.1 [15.0, 18.3] (n = 135) 0.010b \n\n*Survival [95% CI] (weeks) \n\n> 1st-line therapy 56.4 [45.1, 76.9] (n = 131) 46.7 [39.0, 55.3] (n = 136) 0.020b \n\n*This data is based on Clinical Study Report: CA012-0 Addendum dated Final (23 March-2005) \n\na Chi-squared test  \nb Log-rank test \n\n \n\nTwo hundred and twenty nine patients treated with Abraxane in the randomized, controlled clinical trial \n\nwere evaluated for safety. Neurotoxicity to paclitaxel was evaluated through improvement by one grade \n\nfor patients experiencing Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy at any time during therapy. The natural course of \n\nperipheral neuropathy to resolution to baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after > 6 courses of \n\ntreatment was not evaluated and remains unknown. \n\n \n\nPancreatic adenocarcinoma \n\nA multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label study was conducted in 861 patients to compare \n\nAbraxane/gemcitabine versus gemcitabine monotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic \n\nadenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Abraxane was administered to patients (N = 431) as an intravenous \n\n\n\n20 \n\ninfusion over 30-40 minutes at a dose of 125 mg/m2 followed by gemcitabine as an intravenous infusion \n\nover 30-40 minutes at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. In the \n\ncomparator treatment arm, gemcitabine monotherapy was administered to patients (N = 430) in \n\naccordance with the recommended dose and regimen. Treatment was administered until disease \n\nprogression or development of an unacceptable toxicity. Of the 431 patients with pancreatic \n\nadenocarcinoma who were randomized to receive Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine, the \n\nmajority (93%) were white, 4% were black and 2% were Asian. 16% had a Karnofsky Performance Status \n\nof 100; 42% had a KPS of 90; 35% had a KPS of 80; 7% had a KPS of 70; and <1% of patients had a KPS \n\nof below 70. Patients with high cardiovascular risk, history of peripheral artery disease and/or of \n\nconnective tissue disorders and/or interstitial lung disease were excluded from the study. \n\n \n\nPatients received a median treatment duration of 3.9 months in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 2.8 \n\nmonths in the gemcitabine arm. 32% of patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm compared with 15% of \n\npatients in the gemcitabine arm received 6 or more months of treatment.  For the treated population, the \n\nmedian relative dose intensity for gemcitabine was 75% in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 85% in the \n\ngemcitabine arm. The median relative dose intensity of Abraxane was 81%. A higher median cumulative \n\ndose of gemcitabine was delivered in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (11400 mg/m2) when compared with \n\nthe gemcitabine arm (9000 mg/m2). \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS). The key secondary endpoints were progression-\n\nfree survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR), both assessed by independent, central, blinded \n\nradiological review using RECIST guidelines (Version 1.0).  \n\n \n\nTable 11: Efficacy results from randomized study in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma \n\n(Intent-to-treat population) \n\n \n\nAbraxane(125 mg/m2)/gemcitabine \n\n(N=431) \n\nGemcitabine \n\n(N=430) \n\nOverall Survival \n\nNumber of deaths (%) 333 (77) 359 (83) \n\nMedian Overall Survival, \n\nmonths (95% CI) \n8.5 (7.89, 9.53) 6.7 (6.01, 7.23) \n\nHRA+G/G (95% CI)a  0.72 (0.617, 0.835) \n\nP-valueb  <0.0001 \n\nSurvival Rate % (95% CI) at   \n\n1 Year 35% (29.7, 39.5) 22% (18.1, 26.7) \n\n2 Year 9% (6.2, 13.1) 4% (2.3, 7.2) \n\n75th Percentile Overall \n\nSurvival (months) \n14.8 11.4 \n\nProgression-free Survival \n\nDeath or progression, n (%) 277 (64) 265 (62) \n\nMedian Progression-free \n\nSurvival, months (95% CI) \n5.5 (4.47, 5.95) 3.7 (3.61, 4.04) \n\nHRA+G/G (95% CI)a 0.69 (0.581, 0.821) \n\nP-valueb  <0.0001 \n\nOverall Response Rate \n\nConfirmed complete or partial \n\noverall response, n (%) \n99 (23) 31 (7) \n\n95% CI 19.1, 27.2 5.0, 10.1 \n\npA+G/pG (95% CI) 3.19 (2.178, 4.662) \n\nP-value (chi-square test) <0.0001 \nCI = confidence interval, HRA+G/G = hazard ratio of Abraxane+gemcitabine/gemcitabine, pA+G/pG=response rate  ratio of \nAbraxane+gemcitabine/gemcitabine \na stratified Cox proportional hazard model \n\n\n\n21 \n\nb stratified log-rank test, stratified by geographic region (North America versus others), KPS (70 to 80 versus 90 to 100), and presence of liver \n\nmetastasis (yes versus no). \n\n \nThere was a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients treated with Abraxane/gemcitabine \n\nversus gemcitabine alone, with 1.8 months increase in median OS, 28% overall reduction in risk of death, \n\n59% improvement in 1-year survival, and 125% improvement in 2-year survival rates. \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier curve of overall survival (intent-to-treat population) \n\n \n \n\nTreatment effects on OS favoured the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm across the majority of pre-specified \n\nsubgroups (including gender, KPS, geographic region, primary location of pancreatic cancer, stage at \n\ndiagnosis, presence of liver metastases, presence of peritoneal carcinomatosis, prior Whipple procedure, \n\npresence of biliary stent at baseline, presence of pulmonary metastases, and number of metastatic sites). \n\nFor patients ≥ 75 years of age in the Abraxane/gemcitabine and gemcitabine arms the survival Hazard \n\nRatio (HR) was 1.08 (95% CI 0.653, 1. 797).

The study compared Abraxane in combination with carboplatin \n\nversus solvent-based paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin as first-line treatment in patients with \n\nadvanced non-small cell lung cancer. Over 99% of patients had an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology \n\nGroup) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients with pre-existing neuropathy of Grade ≥ 2 or serious \n\nmedical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems were excluded.

Of the 42 patients, 1 \n\npatient was < 2, 27 were aged ≥ 2 to < 12, 12 were aged ≥12 to < 18 and 2 adult patients were aged ≥ 18 to \n\n24 years old. \n\n \n\nPatients were treated for a median of 2 cycles at the MTD. From the 41 patients eligible for efficacy \n\nevaluation in stage 1, 1 patient in the rhabdomyosarcoma group (N=14) had a confirmed partial response \n\n(PR) resulting in an ORR of 7.1% (95% CI:  0.2, 33.9). No confirmed complete response (CR) or PR was \n\nobserved in either the Ewing’s sarcoma group (N=13) or the neuroblastoma group (N=14). None of the \n\nstudy arms continued into stage 2 because the protocol-defined requirement of ≥ 2 patients to have a \n\nconfirmed response was not met.  \n\n \n\nThe median overall survival results, including the 1-year follow-up period were 32.1 weeks (95% CI: \n\n21.4, 72.9), 32.0 weeks (95% CI: 12, not established) and 19.6 weeks (95% CI: 4, 25.7) for the Ewing’s \n\nsarcoma, neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma groups, respectively. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nThe overall safety profile of Abraxane in paediatric patients was consistent with the known safety profile \n\nof Abraxane in adults (see section 4.8). Based on these results, it was concluded that Abraxane as \n\nmonotherapy does not have meaningful clinical activity or survival benefit that warrants further \n\ndevelopment in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane at dose \n\nlevels of 80 to 375 mg/m2 were determined in clinical studies. The paclitaxel exposure (AUC) increased \n\nlinearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.hr/ml following dosing from 80 to 300 mg/m2. \n\n \n\nIn a study in patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of paclitaxel \n\nfollowing Abraxane administered intravenously at 260 mg/m2 over 30 minutes were compared with those \n\nfollowing 175 mg/m2 of the solvent-based paclitaxel injection administered over 3 hours. Based on \n\nnon-compartmental PK analysis, the plasma clearance of paclitaxel with Abraxane was larger (43%) than \n\nthat following a solvent-based paclitaxel injection and its volume of distribution was also higher (53%). \n\nThere were no differences in terminal half-lives. \n\nIn a repeat dose study with 12 patients receiving Abraxane administered intravenously at 260 mg/m2, \n\nintra-patient variability in AUC was 19% (range = 3.21%-37.70%). There was no evidence for \n\naccumulation of paclitaxel with multiple treatment courses. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing Abraxane administration to patients with solid tumours, paclitaxel is evenly distributed into \n\nblood cells and plasma and is highly bound to plasma proteins (94%). \n\n \n\nThe protein binding of paclitaxel following Abraxane was evaluated by ultrafiltration in a within-patient \n\ncomparison study. The fraction of free paclitaxel was significantly higher with Abraxane (6.2%) than with \n\nsolvent-based paclitaxel (2.3%). This resulted in significantly higher exposure to unbound paclitaxel with \n\nAbraxane compared with solvent-based paclitaxel, even though the total exposure is comparable. This is \n\npossibly due to paclitaxel not being trapped in Cremophor EL micelles as with solvent-based paclitaxel. \n\nBased on the published literature, in vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins, (using paclitaxel at \n\nconcentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 µg/ml), indicate that the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, \n\ndexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel. \n\n \n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the total volume of distribution is approximately 1741 L; \n\nthe large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding of \n\npaclitaxel. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nBased on the published literature, in vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices show that \n\npaclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6-hydroxypaclitaxel; and to two minor metabolites, \n\n3’-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6-3’-p-dihydroxypaclitaxel. The formation of these hydroxylated metabolites \n\nis catalysed by CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and both CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes, respectively. \n\n \n\nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, after a 30-minute infusion of Abraxane at 260 mg/m2, the mean \n\nvalue for cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged active substance accounted for 4% of the total \n\nadministered dose with less than 1% as the metabolites 6-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3’-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, \n\nindicating extensive non-renal clearance. Paclitaxel is principally eliminated by hepatic metabolism and \n\nbiliary excretion. \n\n \n\nAt the clinical dose range of 80 to 300 mg/m2, the mean plasma clearance of paclitaxel ranges from 13 to \n\n30 L/h/m2, and the mean terminal half-life ranges from 13 to 27 hours. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe effect of hepatic impairment on population pharmacokinetics of Abraxane was studied in patients \n\nwith advanced solid tumours. This analysis included patients with normal hepatic function (n=130), and \n\npre-existing mild (n=8), moderate (n=7), or severe (n=5) hepatic impairment (according to NCI Organ \n\nDysfunction Working Group criteria). The results show that mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1 to \n\n≤1.5 x ULN) has no clinically important effect on pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel. Patients with moderate \n\n(total bilirubin >1.5 to ≤3 x ULN) or severe (total bilirubin >3 to ≤5 x ULN) hepatic impairment have a \n\n22% to 26% decrease in the maximum elimination rate of paclitaxel and approximately 20% increase in \n\nmean paclitaxel AUC compared with patients with normal hepatic function. Hepatic impairment has no \n\neffect on mean paclitaxel Cmax. In addition, elimination of paclitaxel shows an inverse correlation with \n\ntotal bilirubin and a positive correlation with serum albumin. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling indicates that there is no correlation between hepatic \n\nfunction (as indicated by the baseline albumin or total bilirubin level) and neutropenia after adjusting for \n\nAbraxane exposure. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic data are not available for patients with total bilirubin >5 x ULN or for patients with \n\nmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis included patients with normal renal function (n=65), and pre-existing \n\nmild (n=61), moderate (n=23), or severe (n=l) renal impairment (according to draft FDA guidance criteria \n\n2010). Mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥30 to <90 ml/min) has no clinically \n\nimportant effect on the maximum elimination rate and systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of paclitaxel. \n\nPharmacokinetic data are insufficient for patients with severe renal impairment and not available for \n\npatients with end stage kidney disease. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis for Abraxane included patients with ages ranging from 24 to 85 \n\nyears old and shows that age does not significantly influence the maximum elimination rate and systemic \n\nexposure (AUC and Cmax) of paclitaxel. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling using data from 125 patients with advanced solid tumours \n\nindicates that patients ≥ 65 years of age may be more susceptible to development of neutropenia within the \n\nfirst treatment cycle, although the plasma paclitaxel exposure is not affected by age. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel following 30 minutes of intravenous administration at dose levels of \n\n120 mg/m2 to 270 mg/m2 were determined in 64 patients (2 to ≤ 18 years) in Phase 1 of a Phase 1/2 study \n\nin recurrent or refractory paediatric solid tumours. Following dosing increase from 120 to 270 mg/m2, the \n\npaclitaxel mean AUC(0-inf) and Cmax ranged from 8867 to 14361 ng*hr/ml and from 3488 to 8078 ng/ml, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nDose normalized peak drug exposure values were comparable across the dose range studied; however, \n\ndose-normalized total drug exposure values were only comparable across 120 mg/m2 to 240 mg/m2; with \n\nlower dose-normalized AUC∞ at the 270 mg/m2 dose level. At the MTD of 240 mg/m2, the mean CL was \n\n19.1 L/h and the mean terminal half-life was 13.5 hours. \n\n \n\nIn children and adolescent patients, exposure to paclitaxel increased with higher dosing and weekly drug \n\nexposures were higher than in adult patients. \n\n \n\nOther intrinsic factors \n\n\n\n26 \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses for Abraxane indicate that gender, race (Asian vs. White), and type \n\nof solid tumours do not have a clinically important effect on systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of \n\npaclitaxel. Patients weighing 50 kg had paclitaxel AUC approximately 25% lower than those weighing 75 \n\nkg. The clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nThe carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel has not been studied. However, based on the published literature, \n\npaclitaxel is a potentially carcinogenic and genotoxic agent at clinical doses, based upon its \n\npharmacodynamic mechanism of action. Paclitaxel has been shown to be clastogenic in vitro \n\n(chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (micronucleus test in mice). Paclitaxel has \n\nbeen shown to be genotoxic in vivo (micronucleus test in mice), but it did not induce mutagenicity in the \n\nAmes test or the Chinese hamster ovary/hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (CHO/HGPRT) \n\ngene mutation assay. \n\n \n\nPaclitaxel at doses below the human therapeutic dose was associated with low fertility when administered \n\nprior and during mating in male and female rats and foetal toxicity in rats. Animal studies with Abraxane \n\nshowed non-reversible, toxic effects on the male reproductive organs at clinically relevant exposure levels. \n\n \n\nPaclitaxel and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk of lactating rats. Following intravenous \n\nadministration of radiolabelled paclitaxel to rats on days 9 to 10 postpartum, concentrations of \n\nradioactivity in milk were higher than in plasma and declined in parallel with the plasma concentrations. \n \n\n \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n \n\nHuman albumin solution (containing sodium, sodium caprylate and N-acetyl DL tryptophanate). \n\n \n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \n\nsection 6.6. \n\n \n\n6.3 Shelf life \n \n\nUnopened vials \n\n3 years \n\n \n\nStability of reconstituted suspension in the vial \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C-8°C in the original \n\ncarton, protected from light.  \n\n \n\nStability of the reconstituted suspension in the infusion bag \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C-8°C followed by 4 hours \n\nat 25°C, protected from light. \n\n \n\nHowever, from a microbiological point of view, unless the method of reconstituting and filling of the \n\ninfusion bags precludes the risks of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately after \n\nreconstitution and filling of the infusion bags. \n\n \n\nIf not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nThe total combined storage time of reconstituted medicinal product in the vial and in the infusion bag \n\nwhen refrigerated and protected from light is 24 hours. This may be followed by storage in the infusion \n\nbag for 4 hours below 25°C. \n\n \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \n\nUnopened vials \n\nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. Neither freezing nor refrigeration adversely \n\naffects the stability of the product. This medicinal product does not require any special temperature \n\nstorage conditions. \n\n \n\nReconstituted suspension \n\nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n\n \n\n50 ml vial (type 1 glass) with a stopper (butyl rubber), with an overseal (aluminium), containing 100 mg \n\nof paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound nanoparticles. \n\n \n\n100 ml vial (type 1 glass) with a stopper (butyl rubber), with an overseal (aluminium), containing 250 mg \n\nof paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound nanoparticles. \n\n \n\nPack size of one vial. \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n\n \n\nPreparation and administration precautions \n\nPaclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticancer medicinal product and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, \n\ncaution should be exercised in handling Abraxane. The use of gloves, goggles and protective clothing is \n\nrecommended. If the suspension contacts the skin, the skin should be washed immediately and thoroughly \n\nwith soap and water. If it contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed thoroughly with \n\nwater. Abraxane should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately trained in the \n\nhandling of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant staff should not handle Abraxane. \n\n \n\nGiven the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible \n\ninfiltration during administration of the medicinal product. Limiting the infusion of Abraxane to 30 \n\nminutes, as directed, reduces the likelihood of infusion-related reactions. \n\n \n\nReconstitution and administration of the product \n\nAbraxane is supplied as a sterile lyophilised powder for reconstitution before use. After reconstitution, \n\neach ml of suspension contains 5 mg of paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound nanoparticles. \n\n \n\n100 mg vial: Using a sterile syringe, 20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion \n\nshould slowly be injected into a vial of Abraxane over a minimum of 1 minute. \n\n \n\n250 mg vial: Using a sterile syringe, 50 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion \n\nshould slowly be injected into a vial of Abraxane over a minimum of 1 minute. \n\n \n\nThe solution should be directed onto the inside wall of the vial. The solution should not be injected \n\ndirectly onto the powder as this will result in foaming. \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nOnce the addition is complete, the vial should be allowed to stand for a minimum of 5 minutes to ensure \n\nproper wetting of the solid. Then, the vial should gently and slowly be swirled and/or inverted for at least \n\n2 minutes until complete resuspension of any powder occurs. The generation of foam must be avoided. If \n\nfoaming or clumping occurs, the solution must stand for at least 15 minutes until foam subsides. \n\n \n\nThe reconstituted suspension should be milky and homogenous without visible precipitates. Some settling \n\nof the reconstituted suspension may occur. If precipitates or settling are visible, the vial should be gently \n\ninverted again to ensure complete resuspension prior to use.  \n\n \n\nInspect the suspension in the vial for particulate matter. Do not administer the reconstituted suspension if \n\nparticulate matter is observed in the vial. \n\n \n\nThe exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/ml suspension required for the patient should be calculated and the \n\nappropriate amount of reconstituted Abraxane should be injected into an empty, sterile, PVC or non-PVC \n\ntype intravenous bag. \n\n \n\nThe use of medical devices containing silicone oil as a lubricant (i.e. syringes and IV bags) to reconstitute \n\nand administer Abraxane may result in the formation of proteinaceous strands. Administer Abraxane using \n\nan infusion set incorporating a 15 µm filter to avoid administration of these strands. Use of a 15 µm filter \n\nremoves strands and does not change the physical or chemical properties of the reconstituted product.  \n\n \n\nUse of filters with a pore size less than 15 µm may result in blockage of the filter. \n\n \n\nThe use of specialized di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)-free solution containers or administration sets is \n\nnot necessary to prepare or administer Abraxane infusions.  \n\n \n\nFollowing administration, it is recommended that the intravenous line be flushed with sodium chloride 9 \n\nmg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure administration of the complete dose. \n\n \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n47 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nAbraxane 5 mg/ml powder for suspension for infusion \n\n \n\npaclitaxel \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n\n \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n\n1. What Abraxane is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Abraxane \n3. How to use Abraxane \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Abraxane \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n\n \n\n1. What Abraxane is and what it is used for  \n\n \n\nWhat Abraxane is \n\nAbraxane contains, as its active substance, paclitaxel attached to the human protein albumin, in the form \n\nof tiny particles known as nanoparticles. Paclitaxel belongs to a group of medicines called “taxanes” used \n\nin cancer. \n\n• Paclitaxel is the part of the medicine that affects the cancer, it works by stopping cancer cells from \ndividing – this means that they die. \n\n• Albumin is the part of the medicine that helps paclitaxel dissolve in the blood and get across the \nwalls of the blood vessels into the tumour. This means that other chemicals that can cause side \n\neffects that can be life threatening are not needed. Such side effects occur far less with Abraxane. \n\n \n\nWhat Abraxane is used for \n\nAbraxane is used to treat the following types of cancer: \n\n \n\nBreast Cancer \n\n• Breast cancer which has spread to other parts of the body (this is called “metastatic” breast cancer). \n\n• Abraxane is used in metastatic breast cancer when at least one other therapy has been tried but has \nnot worked and you are unsuitable for treatments containing a group of medicines called \n\n“anthracyclines”. \n\n• People with metastatic breast cancer who received Abraxane where another therapy had failed, were \nmore likely to experience a reduction in tumour size, and lived longer than people who took an \n\nalternative therapy. \n\n \n\nPancreatic cancer \n\n• Abraxane is used together with a medicine called gemcitabine if you have metastatic cancer of the \npancreas. People with metastatic pancreatic cancer (pancreatic cancer that has spread to other parts \n\n\n\n48 \n\nof the body) who received Abraxane with gemcitabine in a clinical trial lived longer than people \n\nwho had only received gemcitabine. \n\n \n\nLung Cancer \n\n• Abraxane is also used together with a medicine called carboplatin if you have the most common \ntype of lung cancer, called “non-small cell lung cancer”. \n\n• Abraxane is used in non-small cell lung cancer where surgery or radiotherapy would not be suitable \nto treat the disease. \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Abraxane \n\n \n\nDo not use Abraxane \n\n• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to paclitaxel or any of the other ingredients of Abraxane (listed in \nsection 6); \n\n• if you are breast-feeding; \n\n• if you have a low white blood cell count (baseline neutrophil counts <1500 cells/mm3 - your doctor \nwill advise you on this). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before using Abraxane \n\n• if you have poor kidney function; \n\n• if you have severe liver problems; \n\n• if you have heart problems. \n \n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse if you experience any of these conditions whilst being treated with Abraxane, \n\nyour doctor may wish to stop treatment or reduce the dose: \n\n• if you experience any abnormal bruising, bleeding, or signs of infections such as a sore throat or a \nfever; \n\n• if you experience numbness, tingling, pricking sensations, sensitivity to touch, or muscle weakness; \n\n• if you experience breathing problems, like shortness of breath or dry cough. \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nAbraxane is only for adults and should not be taken by children and adolescents aged below 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Abraxane \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This includes medicines \n\nobtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. This is because Abraxane can affect the way \n\nsome other medicines work. Also, some other medicines can affect the way Abraxane works. \n\n \n\nTake care and speak to your doctor when taking Abraxane at the same time as any of the following: \n\n• medicines for treating infections (i.e. antibiotics such erythromycin, rifampicin, etc.; ask your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are unsure whether the medicine you are taking is an antibiotic), \n\nand including medicines for treating fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole) \n\n• medicines used to help you stabilize your mood also sometimes referred to as anti-depressants (e.g. \nfluoxetine)  \n\n• medicines used to treat seizures (epilepsy) (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin) \n\n• medicines used to help you lower blood lipid levels (e.g. gemfibrozil) \n\n• medicine used for heartburn or stomach ulcers (e.g. cimetidine) \n\n• medicines used to treat HIV and AIDS (e.g. ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, efavirenz, \nnevirapine) \n\n• a medicine called clopidogrel used to prevent blood clots. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nPregnancy breast-feeding and fertility \n\nPaclitaxel may cause serious birth defects and should therefore not be used if you are pregnant. Your \n\ndoctor will arrange a pregnancy test before starting treatment with Abraxane. \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and up to 1 month after receiving \n\ntreatment with Abraxane. \n\n \n\nDo not breast feed when taking Abraxane as it is not known if the active ingredient paclitaxel passes into \n\nthe mother’s milk. \n\n \n\nMale patients are advised to use effective contraception and to avoid fathering a child during and up to six \n\nmonths after treatment and should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the \n\npossibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Abraxane. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nSome people may feel tired or dizzy after being given Abraxane. If this happens to you, do not drive or use \n\nany tools or machines. \n\n \n\nIf you are given other medicines as part of your treatment, you should ask your doctor for advice on \n\ndriving and using machines. \n\n \n\nAbraxane contains sodium \n\nEach ml of Abraxane contains approximately 4.2 mg of sodium. This should be taken into consideration if \n\nyou are on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Abraxane \n\n \n\nAbraxane will be given to you by a doctor or nurse into a vein from an intravenous drip. The dose you \n\nreceive is based on your body surface area and blood test results. The usual dose is for breast cancer is \n\n260 mg/m2 of body surface area given over a 30 minute period. The usual dose for advanced pancreatic \n\ncancer is 125 mg/m2 of body surface area given over a 30 minute period. The usual dose for non-small cell \n\nlung cancer is 100 mg/m2 of body surface area given over a 30 minute period. \n\n \n\nHow often will you receive Abraxane? \n\nFor treatment of metastatic breast cancer, Abraxane is usually given once every three weeks (on day 1 of a \n\n21-day cycle). \n\n \n\nFor treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer, Abraxane is given on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day \n\ntreatment cycle with gemcitabine being given immediately after the Abraxane.  \n\n \n\nFor treatment of non-small cell lung cancer Abraxane is given once every week (i.e. on days 1, 8 and 15 of \n\na 21-day cycle), with carboplatin being given once every three weeks (i.e. only on day 1 of each 21-day \n\ncycle), immediately after the Abraxane dose has been given. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

Gloves, goggles and protective clothing should be \n\nused. If Abraxane suspension contacts the skin, the skin should be washed immediately and thoroughly \n\nwith soap and water. If Abraxane contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed \n\nthoroughly with water. Abraxane should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately \n\ntrained in the handling of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant staff should not handle Abraxane. \n\n \n\nGiven the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible \n\ninfiltration during administration of the medicinal product. Limiting the infusion of Abraxane to 30 \n\nminutes, as directed, reduces the likelihood of infusion-related reactions. \n\n \n\nReconstitution of the product and administration \n\nAbraxane should be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units specialised in the \n\nadministration of cytotoxic agents. \n\n \n\nAbraxane is supplied as a sterile lyophilised powder for reconstitution before use. After reconstitution, \n\neach ml of suspension contains 5 mg of paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound nanoparticles. \n\nReconstituted Abraxane suspension is administered intravenously using an infusion set incorporating a \n\n15 µm filter. \n\n \n\nReconstitution of 100 mg: \n\nUsing a sterile syringe, 20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion should slowly be \n\ninjected into the 100 mg vial of Abraxane over a minimum of 1 minute.  \n\n \n\nReconstitution of 250 mg: \n\nUsing a sterile syringe, 50 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion should slowly be \n\ninjected into the 250 mg vial of Abraxane over a minimum of 1 minute.  \n\n \n\nThe solution should be directed onto the inside wall of the vial. The solution should not be injected \n\ndirectly onto the powder as this will result in foaming. \n\n \n\nOnce the addition is complete, the vial should be allowed to stand for a minimum of 5 minutes to ensure \n\nproper wetting of the solid. Then, the vial should gently and slowly be swirled and/or inverted for at least \n\n2 minutes until complete resuspension of any powder occurs. The generation of foam should be avoided. \n\nIf foaming or clumping occurs, the suspension should stand for at least 15 minutes until foam subsides. \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n\nThe reconstituted suspension should be milky and homogenous without visible precipitates. Some settling \n\nof the reconstituted suspension may occur. If precipitates or settling are visible, the vial should be gently \n\ninverted again to ensure complete resuspension prior to use. \n\n \n\nInspect the suspension in the vial for particulate matter. Do not administer the reconstituted suspension if \n\nparticulate matter is observed in the vial. \n\n \n\nThe exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/ml suspension required for the patient should be calculated and the \n\nappropriate amount of reconstituted Abraxane should be injected into an empty, sterile, PVC or non-PVC \n\ntype intravenous bag \n\n \n\nThe use of medical devices containing silicone oil as a lubricant (i.e. syringes and IV bags) to reconstitute \n\nand administer Abraxane may result in the formation of proteinaceous strands. Administer Abraxane using \n\nan infusion set incorporating a 15 µm filter to avoid administration of these strands. Use of a 15 µm filter \n\nremoves strands and does not change the physical or chemical properties of the reconstituted product.  \n\n \n\nUse of filters with a pore size less than 15 µm may result in blockage of the filter. \n\n \n\nThe use of specialized DEHP-free solution containers or administration sets is not necessary to prepare or \n\nadminister Abraxane infusions.  \n\n \n\nFollowing administration, it is recommended that the intravenous line be flushed with sodium chloride 9 \n\nmg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure administration of the complete dose. \n\n \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\nStability \n\nUnopened vials of Abraxane are stable until the date indicated on the package when the vial is kept in the \n\nouter carton in order to protect from light. Neither freezing nor refrigeration adversely affects the stability \n\nof the product. This medicinal product does not require any special temperature storage conditions.  \n\n \n\nStability of the reconstituted suspension in the vial \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C-8°C in the original \n\ncarton, protected from light. \n\n \n\nStability of the reconstituted suspension in the infusion bag \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C-8°C followed by 4 hours \n\nat 25°C, protected from light.  \n\n \n\nHowever, from a microbiological point of view, unless the method of reconstituting and filling of the \n\ninfusion bags precludes the risks of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately \n\nafter reconstitution and filling of the infusion bags. \n\n \n\nIf not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. \n\n \n\nThe total combined storage time of reconstituted medicinal product in the vial and in the infusion bag \n\nwhen refrigerated and protected from light is 24 hours. This may be followed by storage in the infusion \n\nbag for 4 hours below 25°C. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.
