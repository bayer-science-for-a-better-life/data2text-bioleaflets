There are \ninsufficient data in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment for dosing recommendations. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nMethod of administration \nBavencio is for intravenous infusion only. It must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus \ninjection. \n \nBavencio has to be diluted with either sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or with \nsodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection. It is administered over 60 minutes as an \nintravenous infusion using a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding 0.2 micrometre in-line or \nadd-on filter. \n \nFor instructions on the preparation and administration of the medicinal product, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nInfusion-related reactions, which might be severe, have been reported in patients receiving avelumab \n(see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including pyrexia, \nchills, flushing, hypotension, dyspnoea, wheezing, back pain, abdominal pain, and urticaria. \n \nFor Grade 3 or Grade 4 infusion-related reactions, the infusion should be stopped and avelumab \nshould be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2). \n \nFor Grade 1 infusion-related reactions, the infusion rate should be slowed by 50% for the current \ninfusion. For patients with Grade 2 infusion-related reactions, the infusion should be temporary \ndiscontinued until Grade 1 or resolved, then the infusion will restart with a 50% slower infusion rate \n(see section 4.2). \n \nIn case of recurrence of Grade 1 or Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, the patient may continue to \nreceive avelumab under close monitoring, after appropriate infusion rate modification and \npremedication with paracetamol and antihistamine (see section 4.2). \n \nIn clinical trials, 98.6% (433/439) of patients with infusion-related reactions had a first \ninfusion-related reaction during the first 4 infusions of which 2.7% (12/439) were Grade \u2265 3. In the \nremaining 1.4% (6/439) of patients, infusion-related reactions occurred after the first 4 infusions and \nall were of Grade 1 or Grade 2. \n \nImmune-related adverse reactions \nMost immune-related adverse reactions with avelumab were reversible and managed with temporary \nor permanent discontinuation of avelumab, administration of corticosteroids and/or supportive care. \n \nFor suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm \naetiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, avelumab should be \nwithheld and corticosteroids administered. If corticosteroids are used to treat an adverse reaction, a \ntaper of at least 1 month duration should be initiated upon improvement. \n \nIn patients, whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, \nadministration of other systemic immunosuppressants may be considered. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nImmune-related pneumonitis \nImmune-related pneumonitis occurred in patients treated with avelumab. One fatal case has been \nreported in patients receiving avelumab (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-related pneumonitis and causes other \nthan immune-related pneumonitis should be ruled out. Suspected pneumonitis should be confirmed \nwith radiographic imaging. \n \nCorticosteroids should be administered for Grade \u2265 2 events (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nprednisone or equivalent, followed by a corticosteroid taper). \n \nAvelumab should be withheld for Grade 2 immune-related pneumonitis until resolution, and \npermanently discontinued for Grade 3, Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 2 immune-related pneumonitis (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nImmune-related hepatitis \nImmune-related hepatitis occurred in patients treated with avelumab. Two fatal cases have been \nreported in patients receiving avelumab (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be monitored for changes in liver function and symptoms of immune-related hepatitis \nand causes other than immune-related hepatitis should be ruled out. \n \nCorticosteroids should be administered for Grade \u2265 2 events (initial dose 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone \nor equivalent, followed by a corticosteroid taper). \n \nAvelumab should be withheld for Grade 2 immune-related hepatitis until resolution and permanently \ndiscontinued for Grade 3 or Grade 4 immune-related hepatitis (see section 4.2). \n \nImmune-related colitis \nImmune-related colitis has been reported in patients receiving avelumab (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-related colitis and causes other than \nimmune-related colitis should be ruled out. Corticosteroids should be administered for Grade \u2265 2 \nevents (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a corticosteroid taper). \n \nAvelumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or Grade 3 immune-related colitis until resolution, and \npermanently discontinued for Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 immune-related colitis (see section 4.2). \n \nImmune-related pancreatitis \nImmune-related pancreatitis has been reported in patients receiving avelumab. Two fatal cases have \nbeen reported in patients receiving avelumab in combination with axitinib (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-related pancreatitis. In symptomatic \npatients, obtain gastroenterology consultation and laboratory investigations (including imaging) to \nensure the initiation of appropriate measures at an early stage. Corticosteroids should be administered \nfor immune-related pancreatitis (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by \na corticosteroid taper). \n \nAvelumab should be withheld in the event of suspected immune-related pancreatitis. Avelumab should \nbe permanently discontinued if immune-related pancreatitis is confirmed (see section 4.2). \n \nImmune-related myocarditis \nImmune-related myocarditis has been reported in patients receiving avelumab. Two fatal cases have \nbeen reported in patients receiving avelumab in combination with axitinib (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-related myocarditis. In symptomatic \npatients, obtain cardiologic consultation and laboratory investigations to ensure the initiation of \nappropriate measures at an early stage. Corticosteroids should be administered for immune-related \nmyocarditis (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a corticosteroid \ntaper). If no improvement within 24 hours on corticosteroids, additional immunosuppression (e.g., \nmycophenolate, infliximab, anti-thymocyte globulin) should be considered. \n \nAvelumab should be withheld in the event of suspected immune-related myocarditis. Avelumab \nshould be permanently discontinued if immune-related myocarditis is confirmed (see section 4.2). \n \nImmune-related endocrinopathies \nImmune-related thyroid disorders, immune-related adrenal insufficiency, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus \nhave been reported in patients receiving avelumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for \nclinical signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies. Avelumab should be withheld for Grade 3 or \nGrade 4 endocrinopathies until resolution (see section 4.2). \n \nThyroid disorders (hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism) \nThyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically \nduring treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of \nthyroid disorders. Hypothyroidism should be managed with replacement therapy and hyperthyroidism \nwith anti-thyroid medicinal product, as needed. \n \nAvelumab should be withheld for Grade 3 or Grade 4 thyroid disorders (see section 4.2). \n \nAdrenal insufficiency \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency during and after \ntreatment. Corticosteroids should be administered (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone intravenously or oral \nequivalent) for Grade \u2265 3 adrenal insufficiency followed by a taper until a dose of less than or equal to \n10 mg/day has been reached. \n \nAvelumab should be withheld for Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptomatic adrenal insufficiency (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nType 1 diabetes mellitus \nAvelumab can cause Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be monitored for hyperglycaemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate \ntreatment with insulin for Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Avelumab should be withheld and anti-\nhyperglycaemics in patients with Grade \u2265 3 hyperglycaemia should be administered. Treatment with \navelumab should be resumed when metabolic control is achieved on insulin replacement therapy. \n \nImmune-related nephritis and renal dysfunction \nAvelumab can cause immune-related nephritis (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be monitored for elevated serum creatinine prior to and periodically during treatment. \nCorticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a corticosteroid \ntaper) should be administered for Grade \u2265 2 nephritis. Avelumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or \nGrade 3 nephritis until resolution to \u2264 Grade 1 and permanently discontinued for Grade 4 nephritis. \n \nOther immune-related adverse reactions \nOther clinically important immune-related adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients: \nmyositis, hypopituitarism, uveitis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nFor suspected immune-related adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm aetiology or to \nrule out other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, avelumab should be withheld and \ncorticosteroids to be administered. Avelumab should be resumed when the immune-related adverse \nreaction returns to Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Avelumab should be permanently \ndiscontinued for any Grade 3 immune-related adverse reaction that recurs and for Grade 4 \nimmune-related adverse reaction (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatotoxicity (in combination with axitinib) \nHepatotoxicity occurred in patients treated with avelumab in combination with axitinib with higher \nthan expected frequencies of Grade 3 and Grade 4 ALT and AST elevation compared to avelumab \nalone (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be more frequently monitored for changes in liver function and symptoms as compared \nto when avelumab is used as monotherapy. \n \nAvelumab should be withheld for Grade 2 hepatotoxicity until resolution and permanently \ndiscontinued for Grade 3 or Grade 4 hepatotoxicity. Corticosteroids should be considered for \nGrade \u2265 2 events (see section 4.2). \n \nPatients excluded from clinical studies \nPatients with the following conditions were excluded from clinical trials: active central nervous system \n(CNS) metastasis; active or a history of autoimmune disease; a history of other malignancies within the \nlast 5 years; organ transplant; conditions requiring therapeutic immune suppression or active infection \nwith HIV, or hepatitis B or C. \n \nSodium content \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been conducted with avelumab. \n \nAvelumab is primarily metabolised through catabolic pathways, therefore, it is not expected that \navelumab will have pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with other medicinal products. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving \navelumab and should use effective contraception during treatment with avelumab and for at least \n1 month after the last dose of avelumab. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited data from the use of avelumab in pregnant women. \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with avelumab. However, in murine models of \npregnancy, blockade of PD-L1 signalling has been shown to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and to \nresult in an increased foetal loss (see section 5.3). These results indicate a potential risk, based on its \nmechanism of action, that administration of avelumab during pregnancy could cause foetal harm, \nincluding increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. \n \nHuman IgG1 immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. Therefore, avelumab has the \npotential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. It is not recommended to use \navelumab during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with \navelumab. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether avelumab is excreted in human milk. Since it is known that antibodies can be \nsecreted in human milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \n \nBreast-feeding women should be advised not to breast-feed during treatment and for at least 1 month \nafter the last dose due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed infants. \n \nFertility \nThe effect of avelumab on male and female fertility is unknown. \n \nAlthough studies to evaluate the effect of avelumab on fertility have not been conducted, there were \nno notable effects in the female reproductive organs in monkeys based on 1-month and 3-month \nrepeat-dose toxicity studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAvelumab has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has been reported \nfollowing administration of avelumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised to use caution when \ndriving or operating machinery until they are certain that avelumab does not adversely affect them. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAvelumab is most frequently associated with immune-related adverse reactions. Most of these, \nincluding severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal \nof avelumab (see \u201cDescription of selected adverse reactions\u201d below). \n \nMerkel cell carcinoma \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of avelumab as monotherapy has been evaluated in 1,738 patients with solid tumours \nincluding metastatic MCC receiving 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks of avelumab in clinical studies. In this \npatient population, the most common adverse reactions with avelumab were fatigue (32.4%), nausea \n(25.1%), diarrhoea (18.9%), decreased appetite (18.4%), constipation (18.4%), infusion-related \nreactions (17.1%), weight decreased (16.6%), and vomiting (16.2%). \n \nThe most common Grade \u2265 3 adverse reactions were anaemia (6.0%), dyspnoea (3.9%), and \nabdominal pain (3.0%). Serious adverse reactions were immune-related adverse reactions and \ninfusion-related reaction (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions reported for 88 patients with metastatic MCC and for 1,650 patients in a phase I \nstudy in solid tumours are presented in Table 2. In both studies, avelumab was administered at \n10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. \n \nThese reactions are presented by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000).

The median duration was 1.3 weeks (range: more than 4 days to 1.3 weeks). \n \nImmune-related nephritis did not lead to discontinuation of avelumab in any patient. All 2 patients \nwith immune-related nephritis were treated with high-dose corticosteroids for a median of 1.1 weeks \n(range: 3 days to 1.9 weeks). Immune-related nephritis resolved in 1 (50%) of the 2 patients at the time \nof data cut-off. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nHepatotoxicity (in combination with axitinib) \nIn patients treated with avelumab in combination with axitinib, Grades 3 and Grade 4 increased ALT \nand increased AST were reported in 9% and 7% of patients, respectively. \n \nIn patients with ALT \u2265 3 times ULN (Grades 2-4, n=82), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 92%. \n \nAmong the 73 patients who were rechallenged with either avelumab (59%) or axitinib (85%) \nmonotherapy or with both (55%), 66% had no recurrence of ALT \u2265 3 times ULN. \n \nImmunogenicity \nOf 1,738 patients treated with avelumab 10 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion every 2 weeks, \n1,627 were evaluable for treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and 96 (5.9%) tested \npositive. In ADA positive patients, there may be an increased risk for infusion-related reactions (about \n40% and 25% in ADA ever-positive and ADA never-positive patients, respectively). Based on data \navailable, including the low incidence of immunogenicity, the impact of ADA on pharmacokinetics, \nefficacy and safety is uncertain, while the impact of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) is unknown. \n \nOf the 480 patients with at least one valid ADA result at any time point treated with avelumab \n10 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion every 2 weeks in combination with axitinib 5 mg twice daily, 453 \nwere evaluable for treatment-emergent ADA and 66 (14.6%) tested positive. A new ADA method with \nimproved sensitivity and drug tolerance was used in the RCC population. Overall, there was no \nevidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile, increased incidence of infusion reactions or effects on \nefficacy with anti-avelumab antibody development. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThree patients were reported to be overdosed with 5% to 10% above the recommended dose of \navelumab. The patients had no symptoms, did not require any treatment for the overdose, and \ncontinued on avelumab therapy. \n \nIn case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions. \nThe treatment is directed to the management of symptoms. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: \nL01XC31. \n \nMechanism of action \nAvelumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against programmed \ndeath ligand 1 (PD-L1). Avelumab binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and the \nprogrammed death 1 (PD-1) and B7.1 receptors. This removes the suppressive effects of PD-L1 on \ncytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, resulting in the restoration of anti-tumour T-cell responses. Avelumab has also \nshown to induce natural killer (NK) cell-mediated direct tumour cell lysis via antibody-dependent \ncell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n17 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nMerkel cell carcinoma (study EMR100070-003) \nThe efficacy and safety of avelumab was investigated in the single arm, multi-centre study \nEMR100070-003 with two parts. Part A was conducted in patients with histologically confirmed \nmetastatic MCC, whose disease had progressed on or after chemotherapy administered for distant \nmetastatic disease, with a life expectancy of more than 3 months. Part B included patients with \nhistologically confirmed metastatic MCC who were treatment-na\u00efve to systemic therapy in the \nmetastatic setting. \n \nPatients with active or a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis; active or a history of \nautoimmune disease; a history of other malignancies within the last 5 years; organ transplant; \nconditions requiring therapeutic immune suppression or active infection with HIV, or hepatitis B or C \nwere excluded. \n \nPatients received avelumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or \nunacceptable toxicity. Patients with radiological disease progression not associated with significant \nclinical deterioration, defined as no new or worsening symptoms, no change in performance status for \ngreater than two weeks, and no need for salvage therapy could continue treatment. \n \nTumour response assessments were performed every 6 weeks, as assessed by an Independent Endpoint \nReview Committee (IERC) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1. \n \nStudy 003 Part A \u2013 previously-treated patients \nThe major efficacy outcome measure was confirmed best overall response (BOR); secondary efficacy \noutcome measures included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall \nsurvival (OS). \n \nAn efficacy analysis was conducted in all 88 patients after a minimum follow-up of 36 months. Patients \nreceived a median of 7 doses of avelumab (range: 1 dose to 95 doses), and the median duration of \ntreatment was 17 weeks (range: 2 weeks to 208 weeks). \n \nOf the 88 patients, 65 (74%) were male, the median age was 73 years (range 33 years to 88 years), \n81 (92%) patients were Caucasian, and 49 (56%) patients and 39 (44%) patients with an Eastern \nCooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 and 1, respectively. \n \nOverall, 52 (59%) patients were reported to have had 1 prior anti-cancer therapy for MCC, 26 (30%) \nwith 2 prior therapies, and 10 (11%) with 3 or more prior therapies. Forty-seven (53%) of the patients \nhad visceral metastases. \n \nTable 4 summarises efficacy endpoints in patients receiving avelumab at the recommended dose for \nstudy EMR100070-003, Part A with a minimum follow-up of 36 months. Overall survival was \nevaluated in an analysis with a minimum follow-up of 44 months.

Patients were randomised (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: \n\u2022 Avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 2 weeks in combination with axitinib 5 mg \n\ntwice daily orally (N=442). Patients who tolerated axitinib 5 mg twice daily without Grade 2 or \ngreater axitinib-related adverse events for 2 consecutive weeks could increase to 7 mg and then \nsubsequently to 10 mg twice daily. Axitinib could be interrupted or reduced to 3 mg twice daily \nand subsequently to 2 mg twice daily to manage toxicity. \n\n\u2022 Sunitinib 50 mg once daily orally for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off (N=444) until \nradiographic or clinical progression or unacceptable toxicity. \n\n \nTreatment with avelumab and axitinib continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease by \nBlinded Independent Central Review (BICR) assessment or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of \navelumab and axitinib was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression based on \ninvestigator\u2019s assessment of the patient\u2019s benefit-risk and clinical condition, including performance \nstatus, clinical symptoms, adverse events and laboratory data. The majority (n=160, 71.4%) of the \npatients with progressive disease continued treatment with both medicinal products after progression. \nAssessment of tumour status was performed at baseline, after randomisation at 6 weeks, then every \n6 weeks thereafter up to 18 months after randomisation, and every 12 weeks thereafter until \ndocumented confirmed disease progression by BICR. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by BICR using \nRECIST v1.1 and overall survival (OS) in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC who \nhave PD-L1-positive tumours (PD-L1 expression level \u2265 1%). The key secondary endpoints were PFS \nbased on BICR assessment per RECIST v1.1 and OS irrespective of PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 status \nwas determined by immunohistochemistry. Additional secondary endpoints included objective \nresponse (OR), time to response (TTR) and duration of response (DOR). \n \nThe study population characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range: 27.0 to 88.0), 38% of patients \nwere 65 years or older, 75% were male, 75% were White, and the ECOG performance score was 0 \n(63%) or 1 (37%). \n \nPatient distribution by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) \nrisk groups was 21% favourable, 62% intermediate, and 16% poor. Patient distribution by Memorial \nSloan\u2013Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk groups was 22% favourable, 65% intermediate, and \n11% poor. \n \nEfficacy results are presented in Table 8 and Figure 3 based on a data cut-off date of 28 January 2019. \nWith a median OS follow-up of 19 months, OS data were immature with 27% deaths.

The volume of distribution at steady state was 4.72 L. \n \nConsistent with a limited extravascular distribution, the volume of distribution of avelumab at steady \nstate is small. As expected for an antibody, avelumab does not bind to plasma proteins in a specific \nmanner. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nElimination \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis from 1,629 patients, the value of total systemic \nclearance (CL) is 0.59 L/day. In the supplemental analysis, avelumab CL was found to decrease over \ntime: the largest mean maximal reduction (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) from baseline value with \ndifferent tumour types was approximately 32.1% (CV 36.2%). \n \nSteady-state concentrations of avelumab were reached after approximately 4 to 6 weeks (2 to 3 cycles) \nof repeated dosing at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and systemic accumulation was approximately \n1.25-fold. \n \nThe elimination half-life (t\u00bd) at the recommended dose is 6.1 days based on the population PK \nanalysis. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe exposure of avelumab increased dose-proportionally in the dose range of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg \nevery 2 weeks. \n \nWhen avelumab 10 mg/kg was administered in combination with axitinib 5 mg, the respective \nexposures of avelumab and axitinib were unchanged compared to the single agents. There was no \nevidence to suggest a clinically relevant change of avelumab clearance over time in patients with \nadvanced RCC. \n \nSpecial populations \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis suggested no difference in the total systemic clearance of \navelumab based on age, gender, race, PD-L1 status, tumour burden, renal impairment and mild or \nmoderate hepatic impairment. \n \nTotal systemic clearance increases with body weight. Steady-state exposure was approximately \nuniform over a wide range of body weights (30 to 204 kg) for body weight normalised dosing. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo clinically important differences in the clearance of avelumab were found between patients with \nmild (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 60 to 89 mL/min, Cockcroft-Gault Creatinine Clearance \n(CrCL); n=623), moderate (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min, n=320) and patients with normal (GFR \n\u2265 90 mL/min, n=671) renal function. \n \nAvelumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 15 to 29 mL/min). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo clinically important differences in the clearance of avelumab were found between patients with \nmild hepatic impairment (bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin between 1 and 1.5 times ULN, \nn=217) and normal hepatic function (bilirubin and AST \u2264 ULN, n=1,388) in a population PK analysis. \nHepatic impairment was defined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria of hepatic dysfunction. \n \nAvelumab has not been studied in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin between 1.5 \nand 3 times ULN) or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3 times ULN). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose \ntoxicity in Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenously doses of 20, 60 or 140 mg/kg once a \nweek for1 month and 3 months, followed by a 2-month recovery period after the 3-month dosing \nperiod. Perivascular mononuclear cell cuffing was observed in the brain and spinal cord of monkeys \ntreated with avelumab at \u2265 20 mg/kg for 3 months. Although there was no clear dose-response \nrelationship, it cannot be excluded that this finding was related to avelumab treatment. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with avelumab. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is \nthought to be involved in maintaining tolerance to the foetus throughout pregnancy. Blockade of \nPD-L1 signalling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and \nto result in an increase in foetal loss. These results indicate a potential risk that administration of \navelumab during pregnancy could cause foetal harm, including increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. \n \nNo studies have been conducted to assess the potential of avelumab for carcinogenicity or \ngenotoxicity. \n \nFertility studies have not been conducted with avelumab. In 1-month and 3-month repeat-dose \ntoxicology studies in monkeys, there were no notable effects in the female reproductive organs. Many \nof the male monkeys used in these studies were sexually immature and thus no explicit conclusions \nregarding effects on male reproductive organs can be made. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n39 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nBavencio 20 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion \navelumab \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Bavencio is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Bavencio \n3. How to use Bavencio \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Bavencio \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Bavencio is and what it is used for \n \nBavencio contains the active substance avelumab, a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) that \nattaches to a specific target in the body called PD-L1. \n \nPD-L1 is found on the surface of certain tumour cells, and helps protect them from the immune system \n(the body\u2019s natural defences). Bavencio binds to PD-L1, and blocks this protective effect, allowing the \nimmune system to attack the tumour cells. \n \nBavencio is used in adults to treat: \n\u2022 Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare type of skin cancer, when it is metastatic (has spread to \n\nother parts of the body). \n\u2022 Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a type of kidney cancer, when it is advanced (has spread beyond \n\nthe kidney or to other parts of the body). \n \nFor renal cell cancer, Bavencio is to be used in combination with axitinib. \n \nIt is important that you also read the package leaflet for the medicine containing axitinib. If you have \nany questions about axitinib, ask your doctor. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Bavencio \n \nDo not use Bavencio \nif you are allergic to avelumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nBlood tests and weight checks: \nYour doctor will check your general health before and during treatment with Bavencio. \nYou will have blood tests during your treatment and your doctor will monitor your weight before and \nduring treatment. \n \nTalk to your doctor before receiving Bavencio: \nIt may cause side effects (see section 4). Please note that in some cases symptoms may be delayed, and \nmay develop after your last dose. If you suffer from any of these you should seek urgent medical \nattention: \n\u2022 infusion-related reactions; \n\u2022 problems due to inflammation of your lungs (pneumonitis); \n\u2022 inflammation of your liver (hepatitis) or other liver problems; \n\u2022 inflammation of your intestines (colitis), diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft stools) or more bowel \n\nmovements than usual; \n\u2022 inflammation of your pancreas (pancreatitis); \n\u2022 inflammation of your heart (myocarditis); \n\u2022 problems with your hormone producing glands (the thyroid, adrenal and pituitary glands) that \n\nmay affect how these glands work; \n\u2022 Type 1 diabetes, including acid in the blood produced from diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis); \n\u2022 problems with your kidneys; \n\u2022 inflammation of your muscles (myositis). \n \nIf you experience any of these symptoms when taking Bavencio do not try to treat them on your own \nwith other medicines. Your doctor may \n\u2022 give you other medicines in order to prevent complications and reduce your symptoms, \n\u2022 withhold the next dose of Bavencio, \n\u2022 or stop your treatment with Bavencio altogether. \n \nCheck with your doctor or nurse before you receive Bavencio if: \n\u2022 you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells); \n\u2022 you have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immune deficiency \n\nsyndrome (AIDS); \n\u2022 you have ever had chronic viral infection of the liver, including hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C \n\n(HCV); \n\u2022 you receive medicines to suppress your immune system; \n\u2022 you have had an organ transplant. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nBavencio has not been studied in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Bavencio \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy \nBavencio can cause harm to your unborn baby. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are \nplanning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nYou must not use Bavencio if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. \n \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use effective contraceptives while you are \nbeing treated with Bavencio and for at least 1 month after your last dose. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nBreast-feeding \nIf you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor. \n \nDo not breast-feed while receiving Bavencio and for at least 1 month after your last dose. \n \nIt is unknown if Bavencio passes into your breast milk. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use machines after you have received Bavencio if you are not feeling well enough. \nTiredness is a very common side effect of Bavencio and can affect your ability to drive or to use \nmachines. \n \nBavencio has a low sodium content \nBavencio contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) in each dose and therefore is essentially \nsodium-free. \n \n \n3. How to use Bavencio \n \nYou will receive Bavencio in a hospital or clinic, under the supervision of an experienced doctor. \n \nHow much Bavencio you will receive \nThe recommended dose of avelumab is 800 mg every 2 weeks. Your doctor will decide how many \ntreatments you need. \n \nHow you will receive Bavencio \nYou will receive Bavencio as an infusion (a drip) into a vein (intravenously) over a period of 1 hour. \nBavencio will be added to an infusion bag containing a sodium chloride solution before use. \n \nBefore you receive Bavencio \nFor at least the first 4 treatments, you will receive paracetamol and an antihistamine before being \ngiven Bavencio, to help to prevent possible side effects related to the infusion. Depending on how \nyour body responds to treatment, your doctor may decide to continue giving you these medicines \nbefore all of your Bavencio treatments. \n \nIf you miss a dose of Bavencio \nIt is very important for you to keep all your appointments to receive Bavencio. If you miss an \nappointment, ask your doctor when to schedule your next dose. \n \nIf you stop receiving Bavencio \nDo not stop treatment with Bavencio unless you have discussed this with your doctor. Stopping your \ntreatment may stop the effect of the medicine. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some side \neffects may happen weeks or months after your last dose. \n \nBavencio acts on your immune system and may cause inflammation in parts of your body (see \nsection 2). Inflammation may cause serious damage to your body and some inflammatory conditions \nmay lead to death and need treatment or withdrawal of Bavencio. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nSeek urgent medical attention if you experience inflammation in any part of your body or if you \nhave any of the following signs or symptoms, or if they get worse. \n \n\u2022 Signs of infusion-related reactions such as shortness of breath or wheezing, chills or shaking, \n\nbumpy rash or skin wheals, flushing, low blood pressure (dizziness, fatigue, nausea) fever, \nback pain, and abdominal pain.

"do not use bavencio if you are allergic to avelumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions blood tests and weight checks: your doctor will check your general health before and during treatment with bavencio. you will have blood tests during your treatment and your doctor will monitor your weight before and during treatment. talk to your

these you should seek urgent medical attention: infusion-related reactions; problems due to inflammation of your lungs (pneumonitis); inflammation of your liver (hepatitis) or other liver problems; inflammation of your intestines (colitis), diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft stools) or more bowel movements than usual; inflammation of your pancreas (pancreatitis); inflammation of your heart (myocarditis); problems with your hormone producing glands (the thyroid, adrenal and pituitary glands) that may affect how these glands work; type 1 diabetes, including acid in the blood produced from diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis); problems with your kidneys; inflammation of your muscles (myositis). if you experience any of these symptoms when taking bavencio do not try to treat them on your own with other medicines. your doctor may give you other medicines in order to prevent complications and reduce your symptoms, withhold the next dose of bavencio, or stop your treatment with bavencio altogether. check with your doctor or nurse before you receive bavencio if: you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells); you have human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids); you have ever had chronic viral infection of the liver, including hepatitis b (hbv) or hepatitis c (hcv); you receive medicines to suppress your immune system; you have had an organ transplant. children and adolescents bavencio has not been studied in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. other medicines and bavencio

planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. you must not use bavencio if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. if you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use effective contraceptives while you are being treated with bavencio and for at least 1 month after your last dose. breast-feeding if you are breast-feeding, tell
