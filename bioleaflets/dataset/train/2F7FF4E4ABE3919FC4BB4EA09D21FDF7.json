NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nXydalba 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach vial contains dalbavancin hydrochloride equivalent to 500 mg dalbavancin.\n\nAfter reconstitution each ml contains 20 mg dalbavancin.\n\nThe diluted solution for infusion must have a final concentration of 1 to 5 mg/ml dalbavancin (see\nsection 6.6).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate).\n\nWhite to off-white to pale yellow powder.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nXydalba is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in \nadults (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nRecommended dose and duration of treatment for adults\nThe recommended dose of dalbavancin in adult patients with ABSSSI is 1,500 mg administered as \neither a single infusion of 1,500 mg or as 1,000 mg followed one week later by 500 mg (see \nsections 5.1 and 5.2).\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nDose adjustments are not required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance \uf0b3 30 to 79 ml/min). Dose adjustments are not required for patients receiving regularly \nscheduled haemodialysis (3 times/week), and dalbavancin may be administered without regard to the \ntiming of haemodialysis.\n\nIn patients with chronic renal impairment whose creatinine clearance is < 30 ml/min and who are not \nreceiving regularly scheduled haemodialysis, the recommended dose is reduced to either 1,000 mg \nadministered as a single infusion or 750 mg followed one week later by 375 mg (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\n\n\n3\n\nNo dose adjustment of dalbavancin is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh A). Caution should be exercised when prescribing dalbavancin to patients with moderate \nor severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B & C) as no data are available to determine appropriate \ndosing (see sections 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of dalbavancin in children aged from birth to < 18 years has not yet been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in section 5.2, but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made.\n\nMethod of administration \n\nIntravenous use\n\nXydalba must be reconstituted and then further diluted prior to administration by intravenous infusion\nover a 30 - minute period. For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product \nbefore administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\n\nDalbavancin should be administered with caution in patients known to be hypersensitive to other \nglycopeptides since cross-hypersensitivity may occur. If an allergic reaction to dalbavancin occurs, \nadministration should be discontinued and appropriate therapy for the allergic reaction should be \ninstituted.\n\nClostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile-associated diarrhoea\n\nAntibacterial-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported with the use of \nnearly all antibiotics and may range in severity from mild to life threatening. Therefore, it is important \nto consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea during or subsequent to the treatment \nwith dalbavancin (see section 4.8). In such circumstance, the discontinuation of dalbavancin and the \nuse of supportive measures together with the administration of specific treatment for Clostridioides \n(formerly Clostridium) difficile should be considered. These patients must never be treated with \nmedicinal products that suppress the peristalsis.\n\nInfusion-related reactions\n\nXydalba is to be administered via intravenous infusion, using a total infusion time of 30 minutes to \nminimise the risk of infusion-related reactions. Rapid intravenous infusions of glycopeptide \nantibacterial agents can cause reactions that resemble \u201cRed-Man Syndrome\u201d, including flushing of the \nupper body, urticaria, pruritus, and/or rash. Stopping or slowing the infusion may result in cessation of \nthese reactions.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nInformation on the efficacy and safety of dalbavancin in patients with creatinine clearance \n< 30 ml/min is limited. Based on simulations, dose adjustment is needed for patients with chronic \nrenal impairment whose creatinine clearance is < 30 ml/min and who are not receiving regular \nhaemodialysis (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\nMixed infections\n\n\n\n4\n\nIn mixed infections in which Gram-negative bacteria are suspected patients should also be treated with \nan appropriate antibacterial agent(s) against Gram-negative bacteria (see section 5.1).\n\nNon-susceptible organisms\n\nThe use of antibiotics may promote the overgrowth of non-susceptible micro-organisms. If \nsuperinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.\n\nLimitations of the clinical data\n\nThere is limited data on safety and efficacy of dalbavancin when administered for more than two doses \n(one week apart). In the major trials in ABSSSI the types of infections treated were confined to \ncellulitis/erysipelas, abscesses and wound infections only. There is no experience with dalbavancin in \nthe treatment of severely immunocompromised patients.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nResults from an in vitro receptor screening study do not indicate a likely interaction with other \ntherapeutic targets or a potential for clinically relevant pharmacodynamic interactions (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nClinical drug-drug interaction studies with dalbavancin have not been conducted.\n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect the pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin.\n\nDalbavancin is not metabolised by CYP enzymes in vitro, therefore co-administered CYP inducers or \ninhibitors are unlikely to influence the pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin.\n\nIt is not known if dalbavancin is a substrate for hepatic uptake and efflux transporters. \nCo-administration with inhibitors of these transporters may increase the exposure to dalbavancin. \nExamples of such transporter inhibitors are boosted protease inhibitors, verapamil, quinidine, \nitraconazole, clarithromycin and cyclosporine.\n\nPotential for dalbavancin to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products.\n\nThe interaction potential of dalbavancin on medicinal products metabolised by CYP enzymes is \nexpected to be low since it is neither an inhibitor nor an inducer of CYP enzymes in vitro. There are \nno data on dalbavancin as an inhibitor of CYP2C8.\n\nIt is not known if dalbavancin is an inhibitor of transporters. Increased exposure to transporter \nsubstrates sensitive for inhibited transporter activity, such as statins and digoxin, cannot be excluded if \ncombined with dalbavancin.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data from the use of dalbavancin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nXydalba is not recommended during pregnancy, unless the potential expected benefit clearly justifies \nthe potential risk to the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether dalbavancin is excreted in human milk. However, dalbavancin is excreted in \n\n\n\n5\n\nthe milk of lactating rats and may be excreted in human breast milk. Dalbavancin is not well absorbed \norally; however, an impact on the gastrointestinal flora or mouth flora of a breast-feeding infant cannot \nbe excluded. A decision must be made whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to \ncontinue/discontinue therapy with Xydalba taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the \nchild and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\n\nStudies in animals have shown reduced fertility (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nXydalba may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines, as dizziness has been \nreported in a small number of patients (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nIn Phase 2 / 3 clinical studies, 2,473 patients received dalbavancin administered as either a single \ninfusion of 1,500 mg or as 1,000 mg followed one week later by 500 mg. The most common adverse \nreactions occurring in \u2265 1 % of patients treated with dalbavancin were nausea (2.4 %), diarrhoea \n(1.9 %), and headache (1.3 %) and were generally of mild or moderate severity.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions (Table 1)\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified in Phase 2/3 clinical trials with dalbavancin. \nAdverse reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency \ncategories are derived according to the following conventions: very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). \n\nTable 1\n\nSystem Organ Class Common Uncommon Rare\nInfections and infestations vulvovaginal mycotic infection, urinary \n\ntract infection, fungal infection,\nClostridioides (formerly Clostridium)\ndifficile colitis, oral candidiasis\n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\n\nanaemia, thrombocytosis, eosinophilia, \nleucopenia, neutropenia\n\nImmune system disorders anaphylactoid \nreaction \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\ndecreased appetite\n\nPsychiatric disorders insomnia\nNervous system disorders headache dysgeusia, dizziness\nVascular disorders flushing, phlebitis\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\ncough bronchospasm\n\nGastrointestinal disorders nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, \nabdominal discomfort, vomiting\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\npruritus, urticaria, rash\n\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders\n\nvulvovaginal pruritus\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\ninfusion-related reactions\n\nInvestigations blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, \nalanine aminotransferase increased, \n\n\n\n6\n\nSystem Organ Class Common Uncommon Rare\naspartate aminotransferase increased, blood \nuric acid increased, liver function test \nabnormal, transaminases increased, blood \nalkaline phosphatase increased, platelet \ncount increased, body temperature \nincreased, hepatic enzyme increased,\ngamma-glutamyl transferase increased,\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nClass adverse reactions\nOtotoxicity has been associated with glycopeptide use (vancomycin and teicoplanin); patients who are \nreceiving concomitant therapy with an ototoxic medicinal product, such as an aminoglycoside, may be \nat increased risk.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with dalbavancin, as dose-limiting \ntoxicity has not been observed in clinical studies. In Phase 1 studies, healthy volunteers have been \nadministered single doses of up to 1,500 mg, and cumulative doses up to 4,500 mg over a period of up \nto 8 weeks, with no signs of toxicity or laboratory results of clinical concern. In Phase 3 studies, \npatients have been administered single doses of up to 1,500 mg.\n\nTreatment of overdose with dalbavancin should consist of observation and general supportive \nmeasures. Although no information is available specifically regarding the use of haemodialysis to treat \noverdose, it should be noted that in a Phase 1 study in patients with renal impairment, less than 6 % of \nthe recommended dalbavancin dose was removed after 3 hours of haemodialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antibacterials for systemic use, glycopeptide antibacterials,\nATC code: J01XA04.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nDalbavancin is a bactericidal lipoglycopeptide.\n\nIts mechanism of action in susceptible Gram-positive bacteria involves interruption of cell wall \nsynthesis by binding to the terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine of the stem peptide in nascent cell wall \npeptidoglycan, preventing cross-linking (transpeptidation and transglycosylation) of disaccharide \nsubunits resulting in bacterial cell death.\n\nMechanism of resistance\n\nAll Gram-negative bacteria are inherently resistant to dalbavancin.\n\nResistance to dalbavancin in Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. is mediated by VanA, a \ngenotype that results in modification of the target peptide in nascent cell wall. Based on in vitro\n\n\n\n7\n\nstudies the activity of dalbavancin is not affected by other classes of vancomycin resistance genes.\n\nDalbavancin MICs are higher for vancomycin-intermediate staphylococci (VISA) than for fully \nvancomycin susceptible strains. If the isolates with higher dalbavancin MICs represent stable \nphenotypes and are correlated with resistance to the other glycopeptides, then the likely mechanism \nwould be an increase in the number of glycopeptide targets in nascent peptidoglycan.\n\nCross-resistance between dalbavancin and other classes of antibiotics was not seen in in vitro studies.\nMethicillin resistance has no impact on dalbavancin activity.\n\nInteractions with other antibacterial agents\n\nIn in vitro studies, no antagonism has been observed between dalbavancin and other commonly used \nantibiotics (i.e. cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, meropenem, amikacin, aztreonam, \nciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), when tested against \n12 species of Gram-negative pathogens (see section 4.5).\n\nSusceptibility testing breakpoints\n\nMinimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints determined by the European Committee on \nAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) are:\n\n\uf0b7\uf020 Staphylococcus spp.: Susceptible \u2264 0.125 mg/l; Resistant > 0.125 mg/l,\n\uf0b7\uf020 Beta-haemolytic streptococci of Groups A, B, C, G: Susceptible \u2264 0.125 mg/l; Resistant\n\n> 0.125 mg/l,\n\uf0b7\uf020 Viridans group streptococci (Streptococcus anginosus group only): Susceptible\n\n\u2264 0.125 mg/l; Resistant > 0.125 mg/l.\n\nPK/PD relationship\n\nBactericidal activity against staphylococci in vitro is time-dependent at serum concentrations of \ndalbavancin similar to those obtained at the recommended dose in humans. In vivo PK/PD relationship \nof dalbavancin for S. aureus was investigated using a neutropenic model of animal infection that \nshowed that net reduction in the log10 of colony-forming units (CFU) was greatest when larger doses \nwere given less frequently. \n\nClinical efficacy against specific pathogens\n\nEfficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against the pathogens listed for ABSSSI that were \nsusceptible to dalbavancin in vitro:\n\n\uf0b7\uf020 Staphylococcus aureus,\n\uf0b7\uf020 Streptococcus pyogenes,\n\uf0b7\uf020 Streptococcus agalactiae,\n\uf0b7\uf020 Streptococcus dysgalactiae,\n\uf0b7 Streptococcus anginosus group (includes S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. \n\nconstellatus).\n\nAntibacterial activity against other relevant pathogens\n\nClinical efficacy has not been established against the following pathogens although in vitro studies \nsuggest that they would be susceptible to dalbavancin in the absence of acquired mechanisms of \nresistance:\n\n\uf0b7\uf020 Group G streptococci\n\uf0b7\uf020 Clostridium perfringens\n\uf0b7\uf020 Peptostreptococcus spp.\n\nPaediatric population\n\n\n\n8\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXydalba in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in ABSSSI (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin have been characterised in healthy subjects, patients, and special \npopulations. Systemic exposures to dalbavancin are dose proportional following single doses over a \nrange of 140 to 1120 mg, indicating linear pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin. No accumulation of \ndalbavancin was observed following multiple intravenous infusions administered once-weekly for up \nto 8 weeks (1,000 mg on Day 1, followed by up to 7 weekly 500 mg doses) in healthy adults.\n\nThe mean terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) was 372 (range 333 to 405) hours. The pharmacokinetics \nof dalbavancin are best described using a three-compartment model (\u03b1 and \u03b2 distributional phases \nfollowed by a terminal elimination phase). Thus, the distributional half-life (t1/2\u03b2), which constitutes \nmost of the clinically-relevant concentration-time profile, ranged from 5 to 7 days and is consistent \nwith once-weekly dosing.\n\nEstimated pharmacokinetic parameters of dalbavancin following the two-dose regimen and the \nsingle-dose regimen, respectively, are shown in Table 2 below.\n\nTable 2\n\nMean (SD) dalbavancin pharmacokinetic parameters using population PK analysis1\n\nParameter Two-dose regimen2 Single-dose regimen3\n\nCmax (mg/L) Day 1: 281 (52) Day 1: 411 (86)\n\nDay 8: 141 (26)\n\nAUC0-Day14\n(mg\u2022h/L)\n\n18100 (4600) 20300 (5300)\n\nCL (L/h) 0.048 (0.0086) 0.049 (0.0096)\n1   Source: DAL-MS-01.\n2    1,000 mg on Day 1 + 500 mg on Day 8; Study DUR001-303 subjects with evaluable PK sample.\n3    1,500 mg; Study DUR001-303 subjects with evaluable PK sample.\n\nThe dalbavancin plasma concentration-time following the two-dose and the single-dose regimens, \nrespectively, are shown in Figure 1. \n\n\n\n9\n\nFigure 1. Dalbavancin Plasma Concentrations versus time in a typical ABSSSI patient \n(simulation using population pharmacokinetic model) for both the single and the two-dose \nregimens.\n\nDistribution\n\nClearance and volume of distribution at steady state are comparable between healthy subjects and \npatients with infections. The volume of distribution at steady state was similar to the volume of \nextracellular fluid. Dalbavancin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. \nThe plasma protein binding of dalbavancin is 93 % and is not altered as a function of drug \nconcentration, renal insufficiency, or hepatic insufficiency. Following a single intravenous dose of \n1,000 mg in healthy volunteers AUC in skin blister fluid amounted (bound and unbound dalbavancin) \nto approximately 60 % of the plasma AUC at day 7 post-dose.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nMetabolites have not been observed in significant amounts in human plasma. The metabolites \nhydroxy-dalbavancin and mannosyl aglycone have been detected in urine (< 25 % of administered \ndose). The metabolic pathways responsible for producing these metabolites have not been identified; \nhowever, due to the relatively minor contribution of metabolism to the overall elimination of \ndalbavancin, drug-drug interactions via inhibition or induction of metabolism of dalbavancin are not \nanticipated. Hydroxy-dalbavancin and mannosyl aglycone show significantly less antibacterial activity\ncompared to dalbavancin.\n\nElimination\n\nFollowing administration of a single 1,000 mg dose in healthy subjects, an average of 19 % to 33 % of \nthe administered dalbavancin dose was excreted in urine as dalbavancin and 8 % to 12 % as the \nmetabolite hydroxy-dalbavancin. Approximately 20 % of the administered dose was excreted in \nfaeces.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\n\n\n\n10\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin were evaluated in 28 subjects with varying degrees of renal \nimpairment and in 15 matched control subjects with normal renal function. Following a single dose of \n500 mg or 1,000 mg dalbavancin, the mean plasma clearance (CLT) was reduced 11 %, 35 %, and \n47 % in subjects with mild (CLCR 50 - 79 ml/min), moderate (CLCR 30 \u2013 49 ml/min), and severe \n(CLCR < 30 ml/min) renal impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. \nThe mean AUC for subjects with creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min was approximately 2 - fold higher. \nThe clinical significance of the decrease in mean plasma CLT, and the associated increase in AUC0-\u221e \nnoted in these pharmacokinetic studies of dalbavancin in subjects with severe renal impairment has not \nbeen established. Dalbavancin pharmacokinetics in subjects with end-stage renal disease receiving \nregularly scheduled renal dialysis (3 times/week) were similar to those observed in subjects with mild \nto moderate renal impairment, and less than 6 % of an administered dose is removed after 3 hours of \nhaemodialysis. For dosing instructions in subjects with renal impairment refer to section 4.2.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin were evaluated in 17 subjects with mild, moderate, or severe \nhepatic impairment and compared to 9 matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. The \nmean AUC was unchanged in subjects with mild hepatic impairment compared to subjects with \nnormal hepatic function; however, the mean AUC decreased by 28 % and 31 %, respectively, in \nsubjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The cause and the clinical significance of the \ndecreased exposure in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic function are unknown.  For dosing \ninstructions in subjects with hepatic impairment refer to section 4.2.\n\nGender\n\nClinically significant gender-related differences in dalbavancin pharmacokinetics have not been \nobserved in healthy subjects or in patients with infections. No dose adjustment is recommended based \non gender.\n\nElderly\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin were not significantly altered with age; therefore, dose \nadjustment is not necessary based on age (see section 4.2). The experience with dalbavancin in elderly \nis limited: 276 patients \u2265 75 years of age were included in the Phase 2/3 clinical studies, of which 173 \nreceived dalbavancin. Patients up to 93 years of age have been included in clinical studies.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Xydalba in children aged from birth to < 18 years have not yet been\nestablished.\n\nA total of 10 paediatric patients with ages 12 to 16 years who had resolving infections were given \nsingle doses of either dalbavancin 1,000 mg (body weight \u2265 60 kg) or dalbavancin 15 mg/kg\n(body weight < 60 kg). \n\nMean plasma exposures for dalbavancin, based on AUCinf (17,495 \u00b5g\u2022h/ml and 16,248 \u00b5g \u2022h/ml) and \nCmax (212 \u00b5g/ml and 191 \u00b5g/ml) were similar when administered as 1,000 mg to paediatric subjects\n(12-16 years) weighing > 60 kg (61.9 - 105.2 kg) or as 15 mg/kg to paediatric subjects weighing \n< 60 kg (47.9-58.9 kg). Apparent terminal t\u00bd was similar for dalbavancin doses of 1,000 mg and \n15 mg/kg, with mean values of 227 and 202 hours, respectively. The safety profile of dalbavancin in \nthe subjects aged between 12 and 16 years in this study was consistent with the safety profile observed \nin adults treated with dalbavancin.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nDalbavancin toxicity has been evaluated after daily intravenous administration for durations of up to \n\n\n\n11\n\n3 months in rats and dogs. Dose-dependent toxicity included serum chemistry and histological \nevidence of renal and hepatic injury, reduced red blood cell parameters and injection site irritation. In \ndogs only, infusion reactions characterised by skin swelling and/or redness (not associated with the \ninjection site), mucosal pallor, salivation, vomiting, sedation, and modest declines in blood pressure \nand increases in heart rate were observed in a dose-dependent manner. These infusion reactions were \ntransient (resolved within 1 hour post-dosing) and were attributed to histamine release. Dalbavancin \ntoxicity profile in juvenile rats was consistent with that previously observed in adult rats at the same \ndose (mg/kg /day) levels.\n\nReproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of a teratogenic effect. In rats, at \nexposures approximately 3 times above clinical exposure, there was reduced fertility and an increased \nincidence of embryo-lethality, reductions in foetal weight and skeletal ossification and increased \nneonatal mortality. In rabbits, abortion occurred in conjunction with maternal toxicity at exposures \nbelow the human therapeutic range.\n\nLong-term carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. Dalbavancin was not mutagenic or \nclastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests.\n\n6.

The content of each vial must be reconstituted by slowly adding 25 ml of water for \n\ninjections.\n2. Do not shake. To avoid foaming, alternate between gentle swirling and inversion of the \n\nvial, until its contents are completely dissolved. The reconstitution time may be up to \n5 minutes.\n\n3. The reconstituted concentrate in the vial contains 20 mg /ml dalbavancin.\n4. The reconstituted concentrate must be a clear, colourless to yellow solution with no \n\nvisible particles.\n5. The reconstituted concentrate must be further diluted with 50 mg/ml (5 %) glucose \n\nsolution for infusion.\n6. To dilute the reconstituted concentrate, the appropriate volume of the 20 mg/ml \n\nconcentrate must be transferred from the vial to an intravenous bag or bottle containing \n50 mg/ml (5 %) glucose solution for infusion. For example: 25 ml of the concentrate \ncontains 500 mg dalbavancin.\n\n7. After dilution the solution for infusion must have a final concentration of 1 to 5 mg/ml \ndalbavancin\n\n8. The solution for infusion must be clear, colourless to yellow solution with no visible \nparticles.\n\n9. If particulate matter or discoloration is identified, the solution must be discarded.\n\nXydalba must not be mixed with other medicinal products or intravenous solutions. Sodium chloride \ncontaining solutions can cause precipitation and should NOT be used for reconstitution or dilution. \nThe compatibility of reconstituted Xydalba concentrate has only been established with 50 mg/ml (5 %) \nglucose solution for infusion.\n\nIf a common intravenous line is being used to administer other medicinal products in addition to \nXydalba, the line should be flushed before and after each Xydalba infusion with 5% glucose solution \nfor infusion. \n\n\n\n29\n\nDisposal\n\nDiscard any portion of the reconstituted solution that remains unused.\n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
