QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nRIXUBIS 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nOne vial contains nominally 250 IU nonacog gamma, recombinant human coagulation factor IX \n\n(rDNA), corresponding to a concentration of 50 IU/ml after reconstitution with 5 ml solvent. \n\n \n\nRIXUBIS 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nOne vial contains nominally 500 IU nonacog gamma, recombinant human coagulation factor IX \n\n(rDNA), corresponding to a concentration of 100 IU/ml after reconstitution with 5 ml solvent. \n\n \n\nRIXUBIS 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nOne vial contains nominally 1000 IU nonacog gamma, recombinant human coagulation factor IX \n\n(rDNA), corresponding to a concentration of 200 IU/ml after reconstitution with 5 ml solvent. \n\n \n\nRIXUBIS 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nOne vial contains nominally 2000 IU nonacog gamma, recombinant human coagulation factor IX \n\n(rDNA), corresponding to a concentration of 400 IU/ml after reconstitution with 5 ml solvent. \n\n \n\nRIXUBIS 3000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nOne vial contains nominally 3000 IU nonacog gamma, recombinant human coagulation factor IX \n\n(rDNA), corresponding to a concentration of 600 IU/ml after reconstitution with 5 ml solvent. \n\n \n\nThe potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia one stage clotting assay. \n\nThe specific activity of RIXUBIS is approximately 200-390 IU/mg protein. \n\n \n\nNonacog gamma (recombinant coagulation factor IX) is a single-chain purified glycoprotein that \n\nhas 415 amino acids. It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary \n\n(CHO) cell line. \n\n \n\nExcipient(s) with known effect: \n\nOne vial contains 19 mg sodium. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n\nThe powder is white to off-white. The solvent is clear and colourless. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX \n\ndeficiency). \n\nRIXUBIS is indicated in patients of all age groups. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. \n\n \n\nTreatment monitoring \n\nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the \n\ndose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their \n\nresponse to factor IX, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight \n\nmay require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical \n\ninterventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation \n\nanalysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable. \n\n \n\nTo ensure that the desired factor IX activity plasma level has been attained, careful monitoring using \n\nan appropriate factor IX activity assay is advised and, if necessary, appropriate adjustments to the dose \n\nand the frequency of repeated infusions should be performed. When using an in vitro thromboplastin \n\ntime (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor IX activity in patients’ blood \n\nsamples, plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly affected by both the type of aPTT \n\nreagent and the reference standard used in the assay. This is of importance particularly when changing \n\nthe laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nDose and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, on \n\nthe location and extent of the bleeding, and on the patient’s clinical condition, age and \n\npharmacokinetic parameters of factor IX, such as incremental recovery and half-life. \n\n \n\nThe number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are \n\nrelated to the current WHO standard for factor IX products. Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed \n\neither as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an \n\nInternational Standard for factor IX in plasma). \n\n \n\nOne International Unit  of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of \n\nnormal human plasma. \n\n \n\nAdult population \n\nOn demand treatment: \n\nThe calculation of the required dose of factor IX is based on the empirical finding that 1 International \n\nUnit  factor IX per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity by 0.9 IU/dL (range \n\nfrom 0.5 to 1.4 IU/dL) or 0.9% of normal activity in patients 12 years and older (further information \n\nsee section 5.2). \n\n \n\nThe required dose is determined using the following formula: \n\n \n\nRequired \n\nunits \n\n= body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise \n\n(%) or (IU/dL) \n\nx reciprocal of observed \n\nrecovery (dL/kg) \n\n \n\nFor an incremental recovery of 0.9 IU/dL per IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows: \n\n \n\nRequired \n\nunits \n\n= body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise \n\n(%) or (IU/dL) \n\nx 1.1 dL/kg \n\n \n\nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the \n\nclinical effectiveness in the individual case. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given \n\nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dL) in the corresponding period. The following table can \n\nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n\n \n\nDegree of haemorrhage/Type \n\nof surgical procedure \n\nFactor IX level \n\nrequired (%) or \n\n(IU/dL) \n\nFrequency of doses \n\n(hours)/Duration \n\nof therapy (days) \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \n\nbleeding or oral bleeding \n\n \n\n \n\nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \n\nmuscle bleeding or haematoma \n\n \n\n \n\nLife-threatening haemorrhages. \n\n \n\n20 – 40 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n30 – 60 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n60 – 100 \n\n \n\nRepeat every 24 hours. At least 1 day, \n\nuntil the bleeding episode as indicated \n\nby pain is resolved or healing is \n\nachieved. \n\n \n\nRepeat infusion every 24 hours for  \n\n3 – 4 days or more until pain and \n\nacute disability are resolved. \n\n \n\nRepeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours \n\nuntil threat is resolved. \n\n \n\nSurgery \n\n \n\nMinor surgery including tooth \n\nextraction \n\n \n\n30 – 60 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEvery 24 hours, at least 1 day, until \n\nhealing is achieved. \n\n \n\nMajor surgery \n\n \n\n \n\n80 – 100 \n\n(pre- and postoperative) \n\n \n\nRepeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours \n\nuntil adequate wound healing, then \n\ntherapy for at least another 7 days to \n\nmaintain a factor IX activity of 30% \n\nto 60% (IU/dl). \n\n \n\nCareful monitoring of replacement therapy is especially important in cases of major surgery or \n\nlife-threatening haemorrhages. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis \n\nFor long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, the usual doses \n\nare 40 to 60 IU of factor IX per kilogram of body weight at intervals of 3 to 4 days for \n\npatients 12 years and older. In some cases, depending upon the individual patient´s pharmacokinetics, \n\nage, bleeding phenotype and physical activity, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be \n\nnecessary. \n\n \n\nContinuous infusion \n\nDo not administer RIXUBIS by continuous infusion. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPatients aged 12 to 17 years of age: \n\nPosology is the same in adults and paediatric population from 12 to 17. \n\n \n\nPatients less than 12 years of age: \n\nOn demand treatment \n\nThe calculation of the required dose of factor IX is based on the empirical finding that 1 International \n\nUnit factor IX per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity by 0.7 IU/dL (range \n\nfrom 0.31 to 1.0 IU/dL) or 0.7% of normal activity in patients less than 12 years of age (further \n\ninformation see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nThe required dosage is determined using the following formula: \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPatients less than 12 years \n\n \n\nRequired \n\nunits \n\n= body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise \n\n(%) or (IU/dL) \n\nx reciprocal of observed \n\nrecovery (dL/kg) \n\n \n\nFor an incremental recovery of 0.7 IU/dL per IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows: \n\n \n\nRequired \n\nunits \n\n= body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise \n\n(%) or (IU/dL) \n\nx 1.4 dL/kg \n\n \n\nThe same table as for adults can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery (see above). \n\n \n\nProphylaxis \n\nThe recommended dose range for paediatric patients less than 12 years is 40 to 80 IU/kg at intervals \n\nof 3 to 4 days. In some cases, depending upon the individual patient´s pharmacokinetics, age, bleeding \n\nphenotype and physical activity, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nIntravenous use. \n\nIn case of self-administration or administration by a caregiver appropriate training is needed. \n\nRIXUBIS should be administered using a rate that ensures the comfort of the patient, up to \n\na maximum of 10 ml/min. \n\n \n\nAfter reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH \n\nof 6.8 to 7.2. The osmolality is greater than 240 m osmol/kg. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\nOnly plastic luer-lock syringes should be used with this product. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nKnown allergic reaction to hamster protein. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTraceability  \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with RIXUBIS. The product contains \n\ntraces of hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients or their caregivers should \n\nbe advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. \n\nPatients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, \n\ngeneralised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. \n\n \n\nThe risk is highest during the early phases of initial exposure to factor IX concentrates in previously \n\nuntreated patients (PUPs), in particular in patients with high-risk gene mutations. There have been \n\nreports in the literature showing an association between the occurrence of a factor IX inhibitor and \n\nallergic reactions, in particular in patients with a high-risk gene mutation. Therefore, patients \n\nexperiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor. \n\n \n\nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nInhibitors \n\nAfter repeated treatment with human coagulation factor IX (rDNA) products, patients should be \n\nmonitored for the development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) that should be quantified in \n\nBethesda Units (BU) using appropriate biological testing. \n\n \n\nThere have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX \n\ninhibitor and allergic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated \n\nfor the presence of an inhibitor. It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an \n\nincreased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX. \n\n \n\nBecause of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial administrations of \n\nfactor IX should, according to the treating physician’s judgement, be performed under medical \n\nobservation where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided. \n\n \n\nNephrotic syndrome \n\nNephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in \n\nhaemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors. \n\n \n\nThromboembolism \n\nBecause of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for early signs of \n\nthrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when \n\nadministering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to new-born \n\ninfants, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC. In each of these situations, the benefit \n\nof treatment with RIXUBIS should be weighed against the risk of these complications. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular events \n\nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FIX may increase the \n\ncardiovascular risk. \n\n \n\nCatheter-related complications \n\nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \n\nlocal infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n\n \n\nExcipient related considerations \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\n\nfree’. Depending on body weight and Posology of RIXUBIS, patients could receive more than one \n\nvial. This should be taken into consideration if the patient is on a controlled sodium diet.  \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nClinical studies of RIXUBIS did not include subjects aged 65 and over. It is not known whether they \n\nrespond differently from younger subjects. As for all patients, dose selection for an elderly patient \n\nshould be individualised. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interactions of human coagulation factor IX (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have \n\nbeen reported. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of Factor IX in pregnant women. Animal \n\nreproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX. \n\nFactor IX should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated. \n\n\n\n7 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether Factor IX/metabolites are excreted in human milk. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere is no information on the effects of factor IX on fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nRIXUBIS has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \n\ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \n\nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \n\nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). In some cases, these \n\nreactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis, and they have occurred in close temporal association \n\nwith development of factor IX inhibitors (see also 4.4). \n\nNephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in \n\nhaemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nVery rarely development of antibodies to hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions has \n\nbeen observed. \n\n \n\nPatients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX. If such \n\ninhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it \n\nis recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted. \n\n \n\nThere is a potential risk of thromboembolic episodes following the administration of factor IX \n\nproducts, with a higher risk for low purity preparations. The use of low purity factor IX products has \n\nbeen associated with instances of myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, \n\nvenous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The use of high purity factor IX is rarely associated with \n\nsuch adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nClinical studies with RIXUBIS included 99 subjects with at least one exposure to RIXUBIS reporting \n\nin total 5 adverse reactions. The table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ \n\nclassification (SOC and Preferred Term Level). \n\n \n\nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (1/10), \n\ncommon (1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n\n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nAdverse Drug Reactions, from clinical trials and spontaneous reports \n\nMedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse reactions Frequency per Patient \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity a) Not known \n\nNervous system disorders Dysgeusia Common \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nPain in extremity Common \n\n \n\na) ADR explained in the section below. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\nAllergic type reactions have been manifested by dyspnoea, pruritus, generalised urticaria and rash. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults. \n\nHowever, no data are available on previously untreated patients as only previously treated patients \n\nhave been enrolled in the clinical studies; no immunogenicity investigation on inhibitor development \n\nwas therefore made in this at risk population. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \n\nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThe effects of higher than recommended doses of RIXUBIS have not been characterised. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor IX. ATC code: B02BD04. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nRIXUBIS contains recombinant coagulation factor IX (nonacog gamma). Factor IX is a single chain \n\nglycoprotein with a molecular mass of about 68,000 Dalton. It is a vitamin K-dependent coagulation \n\nfactor and it is synthesised in the liver. Factor IX is activated by factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation \n\npathway and by factor VII/tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway. Activated factor IX, in \n\ncombination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin \n\ninto thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot is formed. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nHaemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \n\nfactor IX and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously \n\nor as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor IX is \n\nincreased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the \n\nbleeding tendencies. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nProphylaxis and control of bleeding in previously treated patients 12 years and older \n\nThe efficacy of RIXUBIS has been evaluated in the open-label, uncontrolled part of a combined \n\nphase 1/3 study, in which a total of 73 male, previously treated patients (PTPs) \n\nbetween 12 and 59 years of age received RIXUBIS either for prophylaxis and/or for the treatment of \n\nbleeding episodes on an on-demand basis. All subjects had severe (factor IX level <1%) or moderately \n\nsevere (factor IX level ≤2%) haemophilia B. Fifty-nine PTPs received RIXUBIS for prophylaxis. \n\nFifty-six of these PTPs who received RIXUBIS for a minimum of 3 months were included in the \n\nefficacy evaluation for prophylaxis. An additional 14 PTPs received RIXUBIS for the treatment of \n\nbleeding episodes only. Subjects in the on-demand cohort had to have at least 12 documented bleeding \n\nepisodes requiring treatment within 12 months prior to enrollment. The mean treatment duration in the \n\non-demand cohort was 3.5±1.00 months (median 3.4, ranging from 1.2 to 5.1 months), the mean total \n\nannualised bleeding rate (ABR) was 33.9±17.37 with a median of 27.0, ranging from 12.9 to 73.1. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nThe median ABR on prophylaxis with RIXUBIS for all bleeds was 2.0, for spontaneous bleeds 0.0, \n\nand for joint bleeds 0.0. 24 subjects (42.9%) experienced zero bleeds. \n\n \n\nA total of 249 bleeding episodes were treated with RIXUBIS, of which 197 were joint bleeds \n\nand 52 non-joint bleeds (soft tissue, muscle, body cavity, intracranial and other). Of a total \n\nof 249 bleeding episodes, 163 were moderate, 71 were minor, and 15 were major. Treatment was \n\nindividualised based on the severity, cause and site of bleed. Of the 249 bleeding episodes, the \n\nmajority (211; 84.7%) were treated with 1-2 infusions. Haemostatic efficacy at resolution of bleed was \n\nrated excellent or good in 96% of all treated bleeding episodes. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis and control of bleeding in PTPs below 12 years: \n\nThe efficacy of RIXUBIS has been evaluated in a combined phase 2/3 study, in which a total \n\nof 23 male PTPs between 1.8 and 11.8 years (median age 7.10 years) with 11 patients < 6 years, \n\nreceived RIXUBIS for prophylaxis and control of bleeding episodes. All subjects had severe (factor \n\nIX level <1%) or moderately severe (factor IX level ≤2%) haemophilia B. All 23 subjects received \n\nprophylactic treatment with RIXUBIS for a minimum of 3 months and were included in the efficacy \n\nevaluation for prophylaxis. \n\n \n\nThe median ABR was 2.0, for spontaneous bleeds 0.0 and for joint bleeds 0.0. \n\nNine subjects (39.1%) experienced zero bleeds. \n\n \n\nA total of 26 bleeding episodes were treated with RIXUBIS, of which 23 bleeds were due to \n\ninjury, 2 spontaneous and 1 of unknown origin. 19 bleeds were non-joint (soft tissue, muscle, body \n\ncavity, intracranial and other) and 7 were joint bleeds of which 1 was a bleed into a target joint. \n\nOf the 26 bleeding episodes, 15 were minor, 9 moderate, and 2 major. Treatment was individualised \n\nbased on the severity, cause and site of bleed The majority (23; 88,5%) were treated \n\nwith 1-2 infusions. Haemostatic efficacy at resolution of a bleed was rated excellent or good \n\nin 96.2% of all treated bleeding episodes. \n\n \n\nPerioperative management: \n\nThe safety and efficacy in the perioperative setting was evaluated in a phase 3 prospective, open-label, \n\nuncontrolled, multicenter study in male PTPs with severe and moderately severe haemophilia B using \n\nRIXUBIS. The per-protocol efficacy analysis includes 37 surgeries performed in 27 patients \n\nbetween 17 and 57 years of age undergoing major or minor surgical, dental or other surgical invasive \n\nprocedures. Twenty procedures were major including 13 orthopaedic and 3 dental \n\nsurgeries. 17 procedures, including 10 dental extractions, were considered minor. Patients undergoing \n\nmajor surgeries had to perform a pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation. All patients were dosed based on \n\ntheir most recent individual incremental recovery. The recommended initial loading dose of RIXUBIS \n\nwas to ensure that during surgery, factor IX activity levels of 80-100% for major surgeries \n\nand 30-60% for minor surgeries were maintained. RIXUBIS was administered by bolus infusions. \n\n \n\nHaemostasis was maintained throughout the study duration.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nRIXUBIS in previously untreated patients in the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in \n\nhaemophilia B (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nPreviously treated patients 12 years and older: \n\nA randomised, blinded, controlled, crossover pharmacokinetic study of RIXUBIS and a comparator \n\nwas conducted in non-bleeding male subjects (≥15 years of age) as part of the combined \n\nphase 1/3 pivotal study. The subjects received either of the products as a single intravenous infusion. \n\nThe mean (± SD) and median dose of RIXUBIS in the per protocol analysis set (n=25) \n\nwere 74.69±2.37 and 74.25 IU/kg, respectively, with a range of 71.27 to 79.38 IU/kg. The \n\n\n\n10 \n\npharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from factor IX activitiy measurements in blood samples \n\nobtained up to 72 hours following each infusion. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic evaluation was repeated for RIXUBIS in an open-label, uncontrolled study with \n\nRIXUBIS in male subjects who participated in the initial PK crossover study and had received \n\nprophylaxis with RIXUBIS for 26±1 weeks (mean ± SD) and accumulated at least 30 exposure days \n\n(EDs) to RIXUBIS. The RIXUBIS dose range in the repeat pharmacokinetics study \n\nwas 64.48 to 79.18 IU/kg (n=23). \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic parameters for evaluable subjects (per-protocol analysis) are presented in the table \n\nbelow. \n\n \n\nParameter RIXUBIS \n\nInitial cross-over study \n\n(N=25) \n\nRIXUBIS \n\nRepeat Evaluation \n\n(N=23) \n\nAUC0-72h (IU.hr/dL)a \n\nMean±SD \n\nMedian (range) \n\n1067.81±238.42 \n\n1108.35 (696.07-1571.16) \n\n1156.15±259.44 \n\n1170.26 (753.85-1626.81) \n\nIncremental recovery at Cmax \n\n(IU/dL:IU/kg)b \n\nMean ±SD \n\nMedian (range) \n\n0.87±0.22 \n\n0.88 (0.53-1.35) \n\n0.95±0.25 \n\n0.93 (0.52-1.38) \n\nHalf-life (hr) \n\nMean±SD \n\nMedian (range) \n\n26.70±9.55 \n\n24.58 (15.83-52.34) \n\n25.36±6.86 \n\n24.59 (16.24-42.20) \n\nCmax (IU/dL) \n\nMean±SD \n\nMedian (range) \n\n66.22±15.80 \n\n68.10 (41.70-100.30) \n\n72.75±19.73 \n\n72.40 (38.50-106.30) \n\nMean residence time (hr) \n\nMean±SD \n\nMedian (range) \n\n30.82±7.26 \n\n28.93 (22.25-47.78) \n\n29.88±4.16 \n\n29.04 (21.32-37.52) \n\nVssc (dL/kg) \n\nMean±SD \n\nMedian (range) \n\n2.02±0.77 \n\n1.72 (1.10-3.94) \n\n1.79±0.45 \n\n1.74 (1.12-2.72) \n\nClearance (dL/(kg.hr)) \n\nMean±SD \n\nMedian (range) \n\n0.0644±0.0133 \n\n0.0622 (0.0426-0.0912) \n\n0.0602±0.0146 \n\n0.0576 (0.0413-0.0945) \n\na Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0-72 hours post-infusion. \nb Calculated as (Cmax-baseline factor IX) divided by the dose in IU/kg, where Cmax is the maximal \n\npost-infusion factor IX measurement. \nc Volume of distribution at steady state \n\n \n\nIncremental recovery 30 minutes after infusion was determined for all subjects in the combined \n\nphase 1/3 study at exposure day 1, at their week 5, 13, and 26 visits, and at the time of study \n\ncompletion or termination, if it did not coincide with the week 26 visit.

Turn the package over and insert the clear plastic spike through the solvent stopper. Grip the \n\npackage at its edge and pull the package off BAXJECT II (Fig. b). Do not remove the blue cap \n\nfrom the BAXJECT II device. \n\n7. With BAXJECT II attached to the solvent vial, invert the system so that the solvent vial is on \n\ntop of the device. Insert the white plastic spike through the RIXUBIS stopper. The vacuum will \n\ndraw the solvent into the RIXUBIS vial (Fig. c). \n\n\n\n14 \n\n8. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved. The product dissolves rapidly (within 2 minutes). \n\nBe sure that RIXUBIS is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will pass \n\nthrough the device filter. Reconstituted medicinal products should be inspected visually for \n\nparticulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The solution should be clear or \n\nslightly opalescent. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. \n\n \n\nFig. a  Fig. b Fig. c \n\n    \n \n\nDo not refrigerate the preparation after reconstitution. \n\nUse immediately. \n\n \n\nAdministration \n\nUse Aseptic Technique \n\n \n\n1. Remove the blue cap from BAXJECT II. Do not draw air into the syringe. Connect the \n\nsyringe to BAXJECT II (Fig. d). \n\n2. Invert the system (the vial with the reconstituted solution has to be on top). Draw the \n\nreconstituted solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly (Fig. e). \n\n3. Disconnect the syringe. \n\n4. Attach a butterfly needle to the syringe. Inject intravenously. The solution should be \n\nadministered slowly, at a rate as determined by the patient’s comfort level, not to exceed 10 ml \n\nper minute. \n\n \n\nFig. d Fig. e \n\n  \n \n\nWhenever possible, please record the name of the product and the batch number every time you use \n\nRIXUBIS (e.g. in your diary) to keep track of the products and product batches you have used. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

What RIXUBIS is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nRIXUBIS contains the active substance nonacog gamma and is a coagulation factor IX product. Factor \n\nIX is a normal constituent of human blood necessary for effective blood clotting. RIXUBIS is used in \n\npatients with haemophilia B (Christmas disease, an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of \n\nfactor IX). It works by replacing the missing factor IX to enable the patient’s blood to clot. \n\n \n\nRIXUBIS is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B of all \n\nage groups. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use RIXUBIS \n\n \n\nDo not use RIXUBIS \n\n- if you are allergic to nonacog gamma or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6) \n\n- if you are allergic to hamster proteins \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nAllergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with RIXUBIS. Stop your infusion and contact \n\nyour doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care if you experience early signs of \n\nhypersensitivity/allergic reactions like hives, rash, tightness of the chest, wheezing, low blood pressure \n\nor anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction that can cause difficulty in swallowing and/or breathing, red or \n\nswollen face and/or hands). Your doctor may need to treat you promptly for these reactions. Your \n\ndoctor may also do a blood test to check if you have developed activity-neutralising antibodies \n\n\n\n43 \n\n(inhibitors) against your medicine, as inhibitors may develop together with allergies. Patients with \n\nfactor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis during future treatment with factor IX. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor immediately if your bleeding does not stop as expected or if you experience a \n\nsignificant increase in your usage of RIXUBIS in order to control a bleed. Your doctor will do a blood \n\ntest to check if you have developed activity-neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against RIXUBIS. The \n\nrisk for developing inhibitors is highest in patients who have not been treated with a factor IX \n\nreplacement medicine before or in the early phases of treatment, i.e. for small children. \n\n \n\nThe production of factor IX in the body is controlled by the factor IX gene. Patients who have specific \n\nmutations of their factor IX gene such as major deletion may be more likely to have factor IX \n\ninhibitors and an allergic reaction in the early period with any factor IX concentrate. Therefore if you \n\nare known to have such a mutation, your doctor will monitor you more closely for signs of an allergic \n\nreaction. \n\n \n\nIf you suffer from liver or cardiac disease or if you have recently had major surgery, please inform \n\nyour doctor, as there is an increased risk for blood clotting (coagulation) complications. \n\n \n\nKidney disorders (nephrotic syndrome) have been reported following high doses of Factor IX in \n\nhaemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nWhenever possible, please record the name of the product and the batch number every time you use \n\nRIXUBIS (e.g. in your diary) to keep track of the products and product batches you have used. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and RIXUBIS \n\nTell your doctor if you are using or have recently used or might use any other medicines. No \n\ninteractions of RIXUBIS with other medicines are known. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. Haemophilia B very rarely occurs in women. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nRIXUBIS has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nRIXUBIS contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\n\nfree’. However, depending on your body weight and your dose of RIXUBIS, you could receive more \n\nthan one vial. This should be taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use RIXUBIS \n\n \n\nTreatment with RIXUBIS will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with \n\nhaemophilia B. \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \n\nsure. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will decide the dose of RIXUBIS you will receive. This dose and duration will depend on \n\nthe severity of your factor IX deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and on your \n\nclinical condition, age and how quickly your body uses up factor IX which will have to be checked \n\nregularly. \n\n \n\nRIXUBIS is administered by intravenous infusion (IV) after reconstitution of the powder with the \n\nprovided solvent by your doctor or nurse. You or somebody else might also administer RIXUBIS as \n\nan injection but only after receiving adequate training. \n\n\n\n44 \n\nReconstitution and administration \n\n \n\n- For reconstitution use only the solvent and the reconstitution device (BAXJECT II) provided in \nthe pack. \n\n- For administration the use of a luer-lock syringe is required. \n- Do not use if the BAXJECT II device, its sterile barrier system or its packaging is damaged or \n\nshows any sign of deterioration. \n\n \n\nReconstitution \n\nUse Aseptic Technique \n\n \n\n1. If the product is stored in a refrigerator, take both the RIXUBIS powder and solvent vials from \n\nthe refrigerator and let them reach room temperature (between 15°C and 30°C). \n\n2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. \n\n3. Remove caps from powder and solvent vials. \n\n4. Cleanse stoppers with alcohol swabs. Place the vials on a flat clean surface. \n\n5. Open the package of BAXJECT II device by peeling away the paper lid without touching the \n\ninside (Fig. a). Do not remove the device from the package. \n\n6. Turn the package over and insert the clear plastic spike through the solvent stopper. Grip the \n\npackage at its edge and pull the package off BAXJECT II (Fig. b). Do not remove the blue cap \n\nfrom the BAXJECT II device. \n\n7. With BAXJECT II attached to the solvent vial, invert the system so that the solvent vial is on \n\ntop of the device. Insert the white plastic spike through the RIXUBIS stopper. The vacuum will \n\ndraw the solvent into the RIXUBIS vial (Fig. c). \n\n8. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved. The product dissolves rapidly (within 2 minutes). \n\nBe sure that RIXUBIS is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will pass \n\nthrough the device filter. Reconstituted medicinal products should be inspected visually for \n\nparticulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The solution should be clear or \n\nslightly opalescent. Do not use solution that are cloudy or have deposits. \n\n \n\nFig. a  Fig. b Fig. c \n\n    \n \n\nDo not refrigerate the preparation after reconstitution. \n\nUse immediately. \n\n \n\nAdministration \n\nUse Aseptic Technique \n\n \n\n1. Remove the blue cap from BAXJECT II. Do not draw air into the syringe. Connect the \n\nsyringe to BAXJECT II (Fig. d). \n\n2. Invert the system (the vial with the reconstituted solution has to be on top). Draw the \n\nreconstituted solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly (Fig. e). \n\n3. Disconnect the syringe. \n\n\n\n45 \n\n4. Attach a butterfly needle to the syringe. Inject intravenously. The solution should be \n\nadministered slowly, at a rate as determined by the patient’s comfort level, not to exceed 10 ml \n\nper minute. \n\n \n\nFig. d Fig. e \n\n  \nWhenever possible, please record the name of the product and the batch number every time you use \n\nRIXUBIS (e.g. in your diary) to keep track of the products and product batches you have used. \n\n \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\nIf you use more RIXUBIS than you should \n\nAlways use RIXUBIS exactly as your doctor has told you. If you are not sure check with your doctor. \n\nIf you injected more RIXUBIS than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use RIXUBIS \n\nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as \n\nscheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using RIXUBIS \n\nDo not stop using RIXUBIS without consulting your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nAllergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with RIXUBIS. Such reactions may include \n\nburning sensations and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, lethargy, restlessness, tingling, \n\nhives, itching and rash, low blood pressure, fast heart rate, tightness of the chest, wheezing, swelling \n\nof the throat, anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), headache, nausea and vomiting. Please, contact \n\nyour doctor immediately if you experience such signs. Your doctor may need to treat you promptly for \n\nthese reactions (see section 2 ‘Warnings and precautions’). \n\n \n\nThe following side effects have been observed with RIXUBIS: \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 patients) \n\n- altered taste \n- pain in limbs. \n \n\nSide effects with unknown frequency (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n- allergic reactions (hypersensitivity). \n \n\nProblems from exaggerated blood clotting (thromboembolic episodes) have not been observed with \n\nthis product, but may occur with any factor IX products. These may include heart attack, blood clots in \n\nthe veins or blood clots in the lung. \n\n\n\n46 \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or, pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \n\nthis medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. How to store RIXUBIS \n\n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the outer box and vial label after \n\nEXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nStore below 30°C. \n\nDo not freeze. \n\n \n\nUse the reconstituted solution immediately. \n\n \n\nDo not use RIXUBIS if the solution is not clear and colourless. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via waste water or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Individual patients may vary in their \n\nresponse to factor IX, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight \n\nmay require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical \n\ninterventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation \n\nanalysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable. \n\n \n\nTo ensure that the desired factor IX activity plasma level has been attained, careful monitoring using \n\nan appropriate factor IX activity assay is advised and, if necessary, appropriate adjustments to the dose \n\nand the frequency of repeated infusions should be performed. When using an in vitro thromboplastin \n\ntime (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor IX activity in patients’ blood \n\nsamples, plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly affected by both the type of aPTT \n\nreagent and the reference standard used in the assay. This is of importance particularly when changing \n\nthe laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nDose and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, on \n\nthe location and extent of the bleeding, and on the patient’s clinical condition, age and \n\npharmacokinetic parameters of factor IX, such as incremental recovery and half-life. \n\n \n\nThe number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are \n\nrelated to the current WHO standard for factor IX products. Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed \n\neither as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an \n\nInternational Standard for factor IX in plasma). \n\n \n\nOne International Unit  of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of \n\nnormal human plasma. \n\n \n\nAdult population \n\nOn demand treatment: \n\nThe calculation of the required dose of factor IX is based on the empirical finding that 1 International \n\nUnit factor IX per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity by 0.9 IU/dL (range \n\nfrom 0.5 to 1.4 IU/dL) or 0.9% of normal activity in patients 12 years and older (further information \n\nsee section 5.2). \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n48 \n\nThe required dose is determined using the following formula: \n\n \n\nRequired \n\nunits \n\n= body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise \n\n(%) or (IU/dL) \n\nx reciprocal of observed \n\nrecovery (dL/kg) \n\n \n\nFor an incremental recovery of 0.9 IU/dL per IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows: \n\n \n\nRequired \n\nunits \n\n= body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise \n\n(%) or (IU/dL) \n\nx 1.1 dL/kg \n\n \n\nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the \n\nclinical effectiveness in the individual case. \n\n \n\nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given \n\nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dL) in the corresponding period. The following table can \n\nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n\n \n\nDegree of haemorrhage/Type \n\nof surgical procedure \n\nFactor IX level \n\nrequired (%) or \n\n(IU/dL) \n\nFrequency of doses \n\n(hours)/Duration \n\nof therapy (days) \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \n\nbleeding or oral bleeding \n\n \n\n \n\nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \n\nmuscle bleeding or haematoma \n\n \n\n \n\nLife-threatening haemorrhages. \n\n \n\n20 – 40 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n30 – 60 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n60 – 100 \n\n \n\nRepeat every 24 hours. At least 1 day, \n\nuntil the bleeding episode as indicated \n\nby pain is resolved or healing is \n\nachieved. \n\n \n\nRepeat infusion every 24 hours for  \n\n3 – 4 days or more until pain and \n\nacute disability are resolved. \n\n \n\nRepeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours \n\nuntil threat is resolved. \n\n \n\nSurgery \n\n \n\nMinor surgery including tooth \n\nextraction \n\n \n\n30 – 60 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEvery 24 hours, at least 1 day, until \n\nhealing is achieved. \n\n \n\nMajor surgery \n\n \n\n \n\n80 – 100 \n\n(pre- and postoperative) \n\n \n\nRepeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours \n\nuntil adequate wound healing, then \n\ntherapy for at least another 7 days to \n\nmaintain a factor IX activity of 30% \n\nto 60% (IU/dl). \n\n \n\nCareful monitoring of replacement therapy is especially important in cases of major surgery or \n\nlife-threatening haemorrhages. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis \n\nFor long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, the usual doses \n\nare 40 to 60 IU of factor IX per kilogram of body weight at intervals of 3 to 4 days for \n\npatients 12 years and older. In some cases, depending upon the individual patient´s pharmacokinetics, \n\nage, bleeding phenotype and physical activity, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be \n\nnecessary. \n\n \n\nContinuous infusion \n\nDo not administer RIXUBIS by continuous infusion. \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPatients aged 12 to 17 years of age: \n\nPosology is the same in adults and paediatric population from 12 to 17. \n\n \n\nPatients less than 12 years: \n\nOn demand treatment \n\nThe calculation of the required dose of factor IX is based on the empirical finding that 1 International \n\nUnit (IU) factor IX per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity by 0.7 IU/dL (range \n\nfrom 0.31 to 1.0 IU/dL) or 0.7% of normal activity in patients less than 12 years of age (further \n\ninformation see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nThe required dosage is determined using the following formula: \n\n \n\nPatients less than 12 years: \n\n \n\nRequired \n\nunits \n\n= body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise \n\n(%) or (IU/dL) \n\nx reciprocal of observed \n\nrecovery (dL/kg) \n\n \n\nFor an incremental recovery of 0.7 IU/dL per IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows: \n\n \n\nRequired \n\nunits \n\n= body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise \n\n(%) or (IU/dL) \n\nx 1.4 dL/kg \n\n \n\nThe same table as for adults can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery (see above). \n\n \n\nProphylaxis: \n\nThe recommended dose range for paediatric patients less than 12 years is 40 to 80 IU/kg at intervals \n\nof 3 to 4 days. In some cases, depending upon the individual patient´s pharmacokinetics, age, bleeding \n\nphenotype and physical activity, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
