NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nGRANUPAS 4 g gastro-resistant granules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach sachet contains 4 g of para-aminosalicylic acid.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGastro-resistant granules \n \nThe granules are small off white/ light brown coloured approximately 1.5 mm diameter. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nGRANUPAS is indicated for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for multi-drug \nresistant tuberculosis in adults and paediatric patients from 28 days of age and older when an effective \ntreatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability. \n \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \n4 g (one sachet) three times per day. \nThe recommended schedule is 4 g every 8 hours. GRANUPAS can be taken with food. \nMaximum daily dose is 12 g. Usual duration of treatment is 24 months. \n \nDesensitization \nDesensitization can be accomplished by starting with 10  mg para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) given as \na single dose. The dosage is doubled every 2 days until reaching a total of 1 gram after which the \ndosage is divided to follow the regular schedule of administration. If a mild temperature rise or \nskin reaction develops, the increment is to be dropped back one level or the progression held for one \ncycle. Reactions are rare after a total dosage of 1.5 g. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe optimal dose regimen in children is uncertain. Limited pharmacokinetic data suggest no \nsubstantial difference between adults and children. \nFor infants, children and adolescents the dosage will be adapted to the patient’s weight at 150 mg/kg \nper day, divided in two intakes. A dosing spoon is provided to measure small doses below 4 g \nfor young children. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of para-aminosalicylic acid in neonates have not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \n\n\n\nOral use. \n \nThe contents of the sachet should be added to a glass of orange or tomato juice. They will not \ndissolve, but swirling the juice in the glass will help re-suspend the granules if they sink. It should be \ndrunk at once ensuring that the granules are not left in the glass. Any granules left-over at the bottom \nof the glass should be swallowed immediately by adding a small quantity of liquid. Smaller doses in \nchildren should be measured using the dosing spoon and given by sprinkling on apple sauce or yogurt. \n \nThe medicinal product should be swallowed immediately after mixing with orange juice, tomato juice, \napple sauce and yogurt whilst the granules are intact. \n \nThe granules should not be crushed or chewed, as this impairs the gastro-resistant coating. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nSevere renal disease. Patients with severe renal impairment should not receive para-aminosalicylic \nacid. Patients with severe renal disease will accumulate the inactive acetyl metabolite of para-\naminosalicylic acid. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMild to moderate renal impairment \n \nGiven that the metabolites of para-aminosalicylic acid are largely excreted via glomerular filtration, \ncaution is warranted in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see also section 4.3). \n \nGastric ulcer \n \nPara-aminosalicylic acid should be used with caution in patients with peptic ulcer. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nPara-aminosalicylic acid should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nHepatic toxicity \n \nPara-aminosalicylic acid may cause hepatitis. The first symptoms usually appear within three months \nof the start of therapy with a rash as the most common adverse reaction followed by fever and much \nless frequently by gastrointestinal disturbances of anorexia, nausea or diarrhoea. Treatment should be \nstopped immediately in this case. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nThe patient must be monitored carefully during the first three months of therapy and treatment must \nbe discontinued immediately at the first sign of a rash, fever or other premonitory signs of intolerance. \nSee section 4.2 for posology adjustments for desensitization. \n\n \nHypothyroidism in HIV co-infected patients \n \nPara-aminosalicylic acid may be associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism in HIV co-\ninfected patients. Thyroid function should be monitored in HIV co-infected patients before \ncommencing treatment and regularly during treatment, in particular when para-aminosalicylic acid is \nco-administered with ethionamide/prothionamide. \n \n\n\n\nPatients should be advised that the skeletons of the granules may be seen in the stools. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed.  \n \nResults from literature suggest the following: \n \nVitamin B12 \n \nVitamin B12 absorption may be reduced by para-aminosalicylic acid with clinically significant \nerythrocyte abnormalities developing after depletion; patients on therapy of more than one month \nshould be considered for maintenance of vitamin B12. \n \nDigoxin \n \nPara-aminosalicylic acid may decrease the gastrointestinal absorption of digoxin, by inhibiting the \nabsorption function of intestinal cells. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored in patients on \nconcomitant therapy. \n \nEthionamide \n \nCo-administration of para- aminosalicylic acid and ethionamide may intensify adverse reactions of \npara-aminosalicylic acid, mainly the gastrointestinal effects, including jaundice, hepatitis, nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain or anorexia. Ethionamide should be withdrawn if these effects are \nsignificant. \n \nDiphenylhydramine \n \nThis medicinal product decreases the gastrointestinal absorption of para-aminosalicylic acid, and \nshould not be administered concomitantly. \n \nAntiretrovirals \n \nNo drug interaction studies have been conducted in patients with HIV infection taking antiretroviral \nagents and para-aminosalicylic acid. Given the metabolic pathway of para-aminosalicylic acid no \nsignificant drug interaction is anticipated. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of para-aminosalicylic acid in pregnant women. \nStudies in animals have shown some reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nGRANUPAS is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nLiterature reports on para- aminosalicylic acid in pregnant women always report co-administration of \nother medicinal products. As there are no adequate and well controlled studies of para- aminosalicylic \nacid in humans, para-aminosalicylic acid should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nPara-aminosalicylic acid is excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the effects of \npara-aminosalicylic acid in newborns/infants.. \n \n\n\n\nGRANUPAS should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nThere is no evidence available on the effect of para-aminosalicylic acid on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPara-aminosalicylic acid has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nMost frequent adverse reactions were related to the gastrointestinal system. Cutaneous \nhypersensitivity reactions were also frequent as well as adverse reactions related to the nervous \nsystem. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the table below all adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and by frequency. \nFrequency is defined as very common (≥  1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order \nof decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders Very rare \nThrombocytopenia, purpura, leukopenia, \nanemia, methemoglobinemia, agranulocytosis. \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nRare Hypothyroidism*. \nVery rare Hypoglycemia. \n\n \nNervous system disorders Very rare \n\nTendon pain, headache, visual abnormalities, \nperipheral neuropathy, dizziness. \n\nCommon Giddiness, vestibular syndrome. \n \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, bloating, diarrhea, soft stools. \nUncommon Anorexia. \n\n \nRare \n\nMalabsorption syndrome*, peptic ulcer, \ngastrointestinal bleeding, jaundice, metallic \ntaste. \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Unknown Hepatitis \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \nCommon Cutaneous hypersensitivity, skin rash. \n\nRare Urticaria. \nRenal and urinary disorders Very rare Crystalluria. \n\n \nInvestigations \n\n \nVery rare \n\nDecreased prothrombine level, hepatocytolysis. \nIncreased blood alkaline phosphatase, \ntransaminases, weight loss. \n\n \n*see Description of selected adverse reactions below \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHypothyroidism \n \nHypothyroidism in HIV co-infected patients is a very common event and occurs in ≥ 1/10 subjects, \nparticularly when para-aminosalicylic acid is administered with ethionamide/prothionamide. \n\n\n\n \nMalabsorption syndrome \n \nA malabsorption syndrome can develop in patients on para-aminosalicylic acid, but is usually not \ncomplete. The complete syndrome includes steatorrhoea, an abnormal small bowel pattern on x-ray, \nvillus atrophy, depressed cholesterol, reduced D-xylose and iron absorption. Triglyceride absorption \nis always normal. \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in \nadults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with overdose in humans.  In the event of overdose, it is recommended that \nthe patient is monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and that appropriate \nsymptomatic treatment is instituted immediately.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycobacterials, drugs for treatment of tuberculosis, ATC code: \nJ04AA01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAminosalicylic acid is bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It inhibits the onset of \nbacterial resistance to streptomycin and isoniazid. \nThe mechanism of action of para-aminosalicylic acid resembles the sulfonamides, competing with \nparaminobenzoic acid (PABA) for dihydropteroate synthetase (DHP), a key enzyme in the \nbiosynthesis of folates. However, para-aminosalicylic acid appears to be a weak inhibitor of DHP in \nvitro, raising the possibility that it may have a different target.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nGRANUPAS is a gastro-resistant preparation and, therefore, the acid-resistant coating of the granules \nprotects against degradation in the stomach therefore preventing the formation of meta-aminophenol (a \nknown hepatotoxin). The small granules are designed to escape the restriction on gastric emptying of \nlarge particles. Under neutral conditions as are found in the small intestine or in neutral foods, the \nacid-resistant coating is dissolved within one minute. \n \nCare must be taken in the administration of these granules to protect the acid-resistant coating by \nmaintaining the granules in an acidic food during dosage administration. \n \n\n\n\nBecause the granules are protected by an enteric coating, absorption does not commence until they \nleave the stomach. The soft skeletons of the granules remain and may be seen in the stools. \n \nIn a single dose (4 grams) pharmacokinetic study in healthy adult volunteers (N=11) the initial time to \na 2 µg/mL serum level of aminosalicylic acid was 2 hours with a range of 45 minutes to 24 hours; the \nmedian time to peak was 6 hours with a range of 1.5 to 24 hours; the mean peak level was 20 µg/mL \nwith a range of 9 to 35µg/mL: a level of 2 µg/mL was maintained for an average of 8 hours with a \nrange of 5 to 9.5 a level of 1 µg/mL was maintained for an average of 8.8 hours with a range of \n6 to 11.5 hours. \n \nDistribution \n \nPara-aminosalicylic acid is distributed in various tissues and fluids including the lungs, kidneys, liver \nand peritoneal fluid. Pleural or synovial fluid concentrations are approximately equal to plasma. The \ndrug does not cross the blood brain barrier in patients unless the meninges are inflamed, when the \nconcentration of para-aminosalicylic acid in cerebrospinal fluid is about 10 to 50% of the plasma. It is \nunknown whether it passes through the placental barrier. Small amounts of this agent are distributed in \nthe milk and bile. \nPlasma protein binding is about 50 to 60%, the kinetic distribution has a half-life of 0.94 hours and a \nvolume of distribution of 1.001 L/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nPara-aminosalicylic acid is acetylated in the liver and converted into the inactive metabolite, N-acetyl-\npara-aminosalicylic acid which is devoid of bacteriostatic activity. The plasma half-life of this agent is \nabout 1 hour, the concentration is not substantially altered in hepatic dysfunction. The concentration of \nthe metabolite may be increased in cases of renal failure. \n \nThe major metabolites of PAS are produced by conjugation to glycine in para-aminosalicyluric acid \n(PASU) for up to 25% of the dose and to N-acetyl in N-acetyl para-aminosalicylic acid (Ac-PAS) for \nup to 70% of the dose. Together they constitute more than 90% of the total metabolites of PAS found \nin urine. \n \nElimination \n \nIn a single dose study the plasma half-life of para-aminosalicylic acid administered as GRANUPAS \nwas 1.62 ± 0.85 h. \nPara-aminosalicylic acid and its metabolites are excreted by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. \nThe cumulative excretion of para-aminosalicylic after 24 hours is 84% of an oral dose of 4 g, 21% as \npara-aminosalicylic acid and 63% as the acetylated form. The acetylation process is not genetically \ndetermined as is the case for isoniazid. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology and repeated dose toxicity. \nThe data available from a rat embryofoetal development study, where animals were given sodium \naminosalicylate (3.85 to 385 mg/kg) were limited. Bone defects were observed at 77 mg/kg only.and \nincreased foetal weight was noted at the other doses. Other malformations were observed; however, \nthe exact nature of these findings is unknown. The lack of a dose-response relationship suggests that \nthe findings are not of clinical relevance, but it is noted that the findings were observed at doses below \nthose proposed clinically. In the rabbit, sodium aminosalicylate had no effects on embryofoetal \ndevelopment; however, the doses evaluated were below those proposed clinically. \n \nSodium aminosalicylic acid was not mutagenic in Ames test strain TA 100. In human lymphocyte \ncultures in-vitro clastogenic effects of achromatic, chromatid, isochromatic breaks or chromatid \ntranslocations were not seen at 153 or 600 µg /mL but at 1500 and 3000 µg /mL there was a dose \n\n\n\nrelated increase in chromatid aberrations.

What you need to know before you take GRANUPAS \n3. How to take GRANUPAS \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store GRANUPAS \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What GRANUPAS is and what it is used for \n \nGRANUPAS contains para-aminosalicylic acid which is used in adults and children aged 28 days and \nolder to treat resistant tuberculosis in combination with other medicines, in cases of resistance or \nintolerability with other treatments. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take GRANUPAS  \n\nDo not take GRANUPAS \n• if you are allergic to para-aminosalicylic acid or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n• if you have severe kidney disease. \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking GRANUPAS. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking GRANUPAS \n• if you have liver problems or mild or moderate kidney disease \n• if you have a stomach ulcer \n• if you are infected with HIV \n \nChildren  \nUse of GRANUPAS is not recommended in newborn babies (under 28 days of age). \n \nOther medicines and GRANUPAS \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIt is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: \n• Antituberculosis medicines or ethionamide (other treatments against tuberculosis) \n• Vitamin B12 \n• Digoxin (for heart disease) \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n• Diphenylhydramine (for allergic reactions) \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nGRANUPAS is not recommended during pregnancy and should only be used if advised by your \nphysician. \nDo not breastfeed whilst taking GRANUPAS. This is because small amounts of the medicine can \npass into mother’s milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nGRANUPAS is unlikely to affect your ability to drive any vehicle and use machines. \nIn case it does, please report it to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n3. How to take GRANUPAS \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose for adults is 1 sachet three times a day, with a schedule of 1 sachet every \n8 hours. Your physician may need to start with a lower dose to prevent possible side effects. \nDo not take more than 3 sachets per day. Treatment is usually given for two years (24 months). \n \n• Add the contents of the sachet to a drink of tomato or orange juice. \n• Drink straight away \n• If some granules are left in the glass, add some more juice and drink straight away. \n \nUse in infants, children and adolescents \nThe dose in infants, children and adolescents will be calculated by your doctor based on the patient’s \nbody weight. The recommended total dose per day is 150 mg for each kg of body weight. This daily \namount is divided into two doses spread out through the day. \n \n• Use the spoon that comes with the medicine to measure the dose. \n• To measure the dose: \n\no Lines on the spoon indicate the amount (in milligrams of para-aminosalicylic acid). \nTake the correct amount as prescribed by your doctor. \n\no Put granules directly into the spoon. \no Tap the spoon once on a table to give a horizontal level of granules and \n\ncontinue filling if necessary. \n• Sprinkle the granules onto apple sauce or yogurt. \n• Make your child eat it straight away. \n \nTaking this medicine \n• Do not crush or chew the granules. Swallow the granules whole. It is important that you do not \n\ndissolve, crush or chew the granules as they may not absorb properly and may cause stomach \nache or bleeding. \n\n• Do not use the sachet if it is swollen or the granules have lost their light brown colour. \n• You may notice granules appearing in your stools; this is normal. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n \n\nIf you take more GRANUPAS than you should \nSpeak to a doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you forget to take a dose of GRANUPAS \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Wait until the next dose is due, then take \nyour normal dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
