NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNovoMix 30 Penfill 100 units/ml suspension for injection in cartridge \nNovoMix 30 FlexPen 100 units/ml suspension for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nNovoMix 30 Penfill \n1 ml of the suspension contains 100 units soluble insulin aspart*/protamine-crystallised insulin aspart* \nin the ratio 30/70 (equivalent to 3.5 mg). 1 cartridge contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 units. \n \nNovoMix 30 FlexPen \n1 ml of the suspension contains 100 units soluble insulin aspart*/protamine-crystallised insulin aspart* \nin the ratio 30/70 (equivalent to 3.5 mg). 1 pre-filled pen contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 units. \n \n*Insulin aspart is produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \n \nThe suspension is cloudy, white and aqueous. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNovoMix 30 is indicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged \n10 years and above. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe potency of insulin analogues, including insulin aspart, is expressed in units, whereas the potency \nof human insulin is expressed in international units. \n \nNovoMix 30 dosing is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. Blood \nglucose monitoring and insulin dose adjustments are recommended to achieve optimal glycaemic \ncontrol. \n \nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, NovoMix 30 can be given as monotherapy. NovoMix 30 can also be \ngiven in combination with oral antidiabetic medicinal products and/or GLP-1 receptor agonists. For \npatients with type 2 diabetes, the recommended starting dose of NovoMix 30 is 6 units at breakfast \nand 6 units at dinner (evening meal). NovoMix 30 can also be initiated once daily with 12 units at \ndinner (evening meal). When using NovoMix 30 once daily, it is generally recommended to move to \ntwice daily when reaching 30 units by splitting the dose into equal breakfast and dinner doses. If twice \ndaily dosing with NovoMix 30 results in recurrent daytime hypoglycaemic episodes, the morning dose \ncan be split into morning and lunchtime doses (thrice daily dosing). \n \nThe following titration guideline is recommended for dose adjustments: \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPre-meal blood glucose level NovoMix 30 dose \nadjustment \n\n<4.4 mmol/l <80 mg/dl -2 units \n4.4â€“6.1 mmol/l 80â€“110 mg/dl 0 \n6.2â€“7.8 mmol/l 111â€“140 mg/dl +2 units \n7.9â€“10 mmol/l 141â€“180 mg/dl +4 units \n\n>10 mmol/l >180 mg/dl +6 units \n \nThe lowest of the three previous daysâ€™ pre-meal blood glucose levels should be used. The dose should \nnot be increased if hypoglycaemia occurred within these days. Dose adjustments can be made once a \nweek until target HbA1c is reached. Pre-meal blood glucose levels should be used to evaluate the \nadequacy of the preceding dose. \n \nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, a dose reduction of 20% is recommended for patients with an HbA1c \nless than 8% when a GLP-1 receptor agonist is added to NovoMix 30, to minimise the risk of \nhypoglycaemia. For patients with an HbA1c higher than 8% a dose reduction should be considered. \nSubsequently, dosage should be adjusted individually. \n \nIn patients with type 1 diabetes, the individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.5 and \n1.0 unit/kg/day. NovoMix 30 may fully or partially meet this requirement. \n \nAdjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their \nusual diet or during concomitant illness. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (â‰¥65 years old) \nNovoMix 30 can be used in elderly patients; however there is limited experience with the use of \nNovoMix 30 in combination with oral antidiabetic medicinal products in patients older than 75 years. \nIn elderly patients, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the insulin aspart dose adjusted on an \nindividual basis. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nRenal or hepatic impairment may reduce the patientâ€™s insulin requirements. \nIn patients with renal or hepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the insulin \naspart dose adjusted on an individual basis. \n \nPaediatric population \nNovoMix 30 can be used in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above when premixed insulin \nis preferred. There is limited clinical experience with NovoMix 30 in children aged 6â€“9 years (see \nsection 5.1).  \nNo data are available for NovoMix 30 in children below 6 years of age. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \n \nWhen transferring a patient from biphasic human insulin to NovoMix 30, start with the same dose and \nregimen. Then titrate according to individual needs (see the titration guideline in the table above). \nClose glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the initial weeks thereafter (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nNovoMix 30 is a biphasic suspension of the insulin analogue, insulin aspart. The suspension contains \nrapid-acting and intermediate-acting insulin aspart in the ratio 30/70. \n \nNovoMix 30 is for subcutaneous administration only.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nNovoMix 30 is administered subcutaneously by injection in the thigh or in the abdominal wall. If \nconvenient, the gluteal or deltoid region may be used. Injection sites should always be rotated within \nthe same region in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. The influence of different injection sites \non the absorption of NovoMix 30 has not been investigated. The duration of action will vary according \nto the dose, injection site, blood flow, temperature and level of physical activity. \n \nNovoMix 30 has a faster onset of action than biphasic human insulin and should generally be given \nimmediately before a meal. When necessary, NovoMix 30 can be given soon after a meal. \n \nFor detailed user instructions, please refer to the package leaflet. \n \nNovoMix 30 Penfill \nAdministration with an insulin delivery system \nNovoMix 30 Penfill is designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems and NovoFine \nor NovoTwist needles. NovoMix 30 Penfill is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a \nreusable pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n \nNovoMix 30 FlexPen \nAdministration with FlexPen \nNovoMix 30 FlexPen is a pre-filled pen (colour-coded) designed to be used with NovoFine or \nNovoTwist needles. FlexPen delivers 1â€“60 units in increments of 1 unit. NovoMix 30 FlexPen is only \nsuitable for subcutaneous injections. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNovoMix 30 must not be administered intravenously, as it may result in severe hypoglycaemia. \nIntramuscular administration should be avoided. NovoMix 30 is not to be used in insulin infusion \npumps. \n \nBefore travelling between different time zones, the patient should seek the doctorâ€™s advice since this \nmay mean that the patient has to take the insulin and meals at different times. \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nInadequate dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to \nhyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Usually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop \ngradually over a period of hours or days. They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, \nvomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. \nIn type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is \npotentially lethal. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nOmission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia.  \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In case \nof hypoglycaemia or if hypoglycaemia is suspected, NovoMix must not be injected. After stabilisation \nof the patientâ€™s blood glucose, adjustment of the dose should be considered (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and \n4.9). \n \nCompared with biphasic human insulin, NovoMix 30 may have a more pronounced glucose lowering \neffect up to 6 hours after injection. This may have to be compensated for in the individual patient \nthrough adjustment of insulin dose and/or food intake. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nPatients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may \nexperience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised \naccordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. \n \nTighter control of glucose levels can increase the potential for hypoglycaemic episodes and therefore \nrequire special attention during dose intensification as outlined in section 4.2. \n \nSince NovoMix 30 should be administered in immediate relation to a meal, the rapid onset of action \nshould be considered in patients with concomitant diseases or treatment where a delayed absorption of \nfood might be expected. \n \nConcomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patientâ€™s \ninsulin requirements. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or \nthyroid gland can require changes in the insulin dose. \n \nWhen patients are transferred between different types of insulin medicinal products, the early warning \nsymptoms of hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with \ntheir previous insulin. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products  \n \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal insulin, human insulin or \ninsulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may \nresult in the need for a change in dose. Patients transferred to NovoMix 30 from another type of \ninsulin may require an increased number of daily injections or a change in dose from that used with \ntheir usual insulin medicinal products. If an adjustment is needed, it may occur with the first dose or \nduring the first few weeks or months. \n \nInjection site reactions  \n \nAs with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, \ninflammation, bruising, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given \narea reduces the risk of developing these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few \nweeks. On rare occasions, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of NovoMix 30. \n \nCombination of NovoMix with pioglitazone \n \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and NovoMix is considered. If the combination \nis used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. \nPioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n \nAvoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors \n \nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between NovoMix and other insulin products. \n \nInsulin antibodies \n \nInsulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin \nantibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nA number of medicinal products are known to interact with the glucose metabolism. \n \nThe following substances may reduce the patientâ€™s insulin requirements: \nOral antidiabetic medicinal products, GLP-1 receptor agonists, monoamine oxidase inhibitors \n(MAOI), beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids \nand sulfonamides. \n \nThe following substances may increase the patientâ€™s insulin requirements: \nOral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth \nhormone and danazol. \n \nBeta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. \n \nOctreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. \n \nAlcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy  \n \nThere is limited clinical experience with NovoMix 30 in pregnancy. \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin aspart and human \ninsulin regarding embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. \n \nIn general, intensified blood glucose control and monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes are \nrecommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually \nfall in the first trimester and increase subsequently during the second and third trimesters. After \ndelivery, insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy levels. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment with NovoMix 30 during breast-feeding. Insulin treatment of the \nnursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the NovoMix 30 dose may need to be adjusted. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin aspart and human \ninsulin regarding fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patientâ€™s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or \noperating machinery). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving or operating a \nmachine. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning \nsigns of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving or \noperating a machine should be considered in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nAdverse reactions observed in patients using NovoMix are mainly due to the pharmacological effect of \ninsulin aspart. \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia. The frequencies of \nhypoglycaemia vary with patient population, dose regimens and level of glycaemic control, please see \nDescription of selected adverse reactions below. \n \nAt the beginning of the insulin treatment, refraction anomalies, oedema and injection site reactions \n(pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur. \nThese reactions are usually of a transitory nature. Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be \nassociated with acute painful neuropathy, which is usually reversible. Intensification of insulin therapy \nwith abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of \ndiabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of \ndiabetic retinopathy.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions listed below are based on clinical trial data and classified according to MedDRA \nfrequency and System Organ Class. Frequency categories are defined according to the following \nconvention: Very common (â‰¥1/10); common (â‰¥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (â‰¥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(â‰¥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \nImmune system disorders  Uncommon â€“ Urticaria, rash, eruptions \n\n \nVery rare â€“ Anaphylactic reactions* \n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n \n\nVery common â€“ Hypoglycaemia* \n \n\nNervous system disorders Rare â€“ Peripheral neuropathy (painful neuropathy) \n \n\nEye disorders  \n \n \n\nUncommon â€“ Refraction disorders \n \nUncommon â€“ Diabetic retinopathy \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon â€“ Lipodystrophy* \n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nUncommon â€“ Oedema \n \nUncommon â€“ Injection site reactions \n \n\n* see Description of selected adverse reactions \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAnaphylactic reactions:  \nThe occurrence of generalised hypersensitivity reactions (including generalised skin rash, itching, \nsweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulties in breathing, palpitation and \nreduction in blood pressure) is very rare but can potentially be life-threatening. \n \nHypoglycaemia: \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may occur if the insulin dose is too \nhigh in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or \nconvulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. \nThe symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale \n\n\n\n8 \n\nskin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty \nin concentrating, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation.  \n \nIn clinical trials, the frequency of hypoglycaemia varied with patient population, dose regimens and \nlevel of glycaemic control. During clinical trials, the overall rates of hypoglycaemia did not differ \nbetween patients treated with insulin aspart compared to human insulin. \n \nLipodystrophy: \nLipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) may occur at the injection site. Continuous \nrotation of the injection site within the particular area reduces the risk of developing these reactions. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nBased on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions observed in the paediatric population do not indicate any differences to the broader \nexperience in the general population. \n \nOther special populations \n \nBased on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not indicate \nany differences to the broader experience in the general population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nA specific overdose for insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over \nsequential stages if too high doses relative to the patientâ€™s requirement are administered: \n \nâ€¢ Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary \n\nproducts. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries sugar-containing \nproducts. \n\nâ€¢ Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated with \nglucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or with \nglucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given intravenously, \nif the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining \nconsciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in order to \nprevent a relapse. \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate- or long-acting combined with fast-acting. ATC code: A10AD05. \n \nNovoMix 30 is a biphasic suspension of 30% soluble insulin aspart (rapid-acting human insulin \nanalogue) and 70% protamine-crystallised insulin aspart (intermediate-acting human insulin \nanalogue). \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe blood glucose lowering effect of insulin aspart is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following \nbinding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose \noutput from the liver. \n \nNovoMix 30 is a biphasic insulin, which contains 30% soluble insulin aspart. This has a rapid onset of \naction, thus allowing it to be given closer to a meal (within zero to 10 minutes of the meal) when \ncompared to soluble human insulin. The crystalline phase (70%) consists of protamine-crystallised \ninsulin aspart, which has an activity profile similar to that of human NPH insulin. \n \nWhen NovoMix 30 is injected subcutaneously, the onset of action will occur within 10 to 20 minutes \nof injection. The maximum effect is exerted between 1 and 4 hours after injection. The duration of \naction is up to 24 hours (Figure 1). \n \n \n\nHours \n\nGlucose \ninfusion rate \n\n \n \nFigure 1: Activity profile of NovoMix 30 (___) and biphasic human insulin 30 (---) in healthy subjects. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nIn a 3 month trial in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, NovoMix 30 showed equal control of \nglycosylated haemoglobin compared to treatment with biphasic human insulin 30. Insulin aspart is \nequipotent to human insulin on a molar basis. Compared to biphasic human insulin 30, administration \nof NovoMix 30 before breakfast and dinner resulted in lower postprandial blood glucose after both \nmeals (breakfast and dinner). \n \nA meta-analysis including nine trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes showed that fasting \nblood glucose was higher in patients treated with NovoMix 30, than in patients treated with biphasic \nhuman insulin 30. \n \nIn one study, 341 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomised to treatment with NovoMix 30 either \nalone or in combination with metformin, or to metformin together with sulfonylurea. The primary \nefficacy variable - HbA1c after 16 weeks of treatment - did not differ between patients with NovoMix \n30 combined with metformin and patients with metformin plus sulfonylurea. In this trial, 57% of the \npatients had baseline HbA1c above 9%; in these patients, treatment with NovoMix 30 in combination \nwith metformin resulted in significantly lower HbA1c than metformin in combination with \nsulfonylurea. \n \nIn one study, patients with type 2 diabetes, insufficiently controlled on oral hypoglycaemic agents \nalone, were randomised to treatment with twice daily NovoMix 30 (117 patients) or once daily insulin \nglargine (116 patients). After 28 weeks of treatment following the dosing guideline outlined in section \n\n\n\n10 \n\n4.2, the mean reduction in HbA1c was 2.8% with NovoMix 30 (mean at baseline = 9.7%). With \nNovoMix 30, 66% and 42% of the patients reached HbA1c levels below 7% and 6.5%, respectively, \nand mean FPG was reduced by about 7 mmol/l (from 14.0 mmol/l at baseline to 7.1 mmol/l). \n \nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, a meta-analysis showed a reduced risk of overall nocturnal \nhypoglycaemic episodes and major hypoglycaemia with NovoMix 30 compared to biphasic human \ninsulin 30. The risk of overall daytime hypoglycaemic episodes was increased in patients treated with \nNovoMix 30. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nA 16-week clinical trial comparing postprandial glycaemic control of meal-related NovoMix 30 with \nmeal-related human insulin/biphasic human insulin 30 and bedtime NPH insulin was performed in \n167 patients aged 10 to 18 years. Mean HbA1c remained similar to baseline throughout the trial in both \ntreatment groups, and there was no difference in hypoglycaemia rate with NovoMix 30 or biphasic \nhuman insulin 30. \nIn a smaller (54 patients) and younger (age range 6 to 12 years) population, treated in a double-blind, \ncross-over trial (12 weeks on each treatment), the rate of hypoglycaemic episodes and the postprandial \nglucose increase were significantly lower with NovoMix 30 compared to biphasic human insulin 30. \nFinal HbA1c was significantly lower in the biphasic human insulin 30 treated group compared with \nNovoMix 30. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption, distribution and elimination \n \nIn insulin aspart, substitution of amino acid proline with aspartic acid at position B28 reduces the \ntendency to form hexamers as observed with soluble human insulin. The insulin aspart in the soluble \nphase of NovoMix 30 comprises 30% of the total insulin; this is absorbed more rapidly from the \nsubcutaneous layer than the soluble insulin component of biphasic human insulin. The remaining 70% \nis in crystalline form as protamine-crystallised insulin aspart; this has a prolonged absorption profile \nsimilar to human NPH insulin. \n \nThe maximum serum insulin concentration is, on average, 50% higher with NovoMix 30 than with \nbiphasic human insulin 30. The time to maximum concentration is, on average, half of that for \nbiphasic human insulin 30. In healthy volunteers, a mean maximum serum concentration of \n140 Â± 32 pmol/l was reached about 60 minutes after a subcutaneous dose of 0.20 unit/kg body weight. \nThe mean half life (tÂ½) of NovoMix 30, reflecting the absorption rate of the protamine bound fraction, \nwas about 8â€“9 hours. Serum insulin levels returned to baseline 15â€“18 hours after a subcutaneous dose. \nIn type 2 diabetic patients, the maximum concentration was reached about 95 minutes after dosing, \nand concentrations well above zero for not less than 14 hours post-dosing were measured. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of NovoMix 30 have not been investigated in elderly patients or in patients with \nrenal or hepatic impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of NovoMix 30 have not been investigated in children or adolescents. However, \nthe pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of soluble insulin aspart have been investigated \nin children (6â€“12 years) and adolescents (13â€“17 years) with type 1 diabetes. Insulin aspart was rapidly \nabsorbed in both age groups, with similar tmax as in adults. However, Cmax differed between the age \ngroups, stressing the importance of the individual titration of insulin aspart. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\n\n\n11 \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nIn in vitro tests, including binding to insulin and IGF-1 receptor sites and effects on cell growth, \ninsulin aspart behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also demonstrate \nthat the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin aspart is equivalent to human insulin. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNovoMix 50 Penfill 100 units/ml suspension for injection in cartridge \nNovoMix 50 FlexPen 100 units/ml suspension for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nNovoMix 50 Penfill \n1 ml of the suspension contains 100 units soluble insulin aspart*/protamine-crystallised insulin aspart* \nin the ratio 50/50 (equivalent to 3.5 mg). 1 cartridge contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 units. \n \nNovoMix 50 FlexPen \n1 ml of the suspension contains 100 units soluble insulin aspart*/protamine-crystallised insulin aspart* \nin the ratio 50/50 (equivalent to 3.5 mg). 1 pre-filled pen contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 units. \n \n*Insulin aspart is produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \n \nThe suspension is cloudy, white and aqueous. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNovoMix 50 is indicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe potency of insulin analogues, including insulin aspart, is expressed in units, whereas the potency \nof human insulin is expressed in international units. \n \nNovoMix 50 dosing is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. Blood \nglucose monitoring and insulin dose adjustments are recommended to achieve optimal glycaemic \ncontrol. \n \nThe individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.5 and 1.0 unit/kg/day. NovoMix 50 may fully \nor partially meet this requirement.  \n \nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, NovoMix 50 can be given as monotherapy or in combination with \nmetformin when the blood glucose is inadequately controlled with metformin alone. \n \nAdjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their \nusual diet or during concomitant illness. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nIn elderly patients (â‰¥65 years old) and in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, glucose \n\n\n\n15 \n\nmonitoring should be intensified and the insulin aspart dose adjusted on an individual basis.  \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment may reduce the patientâ€™s insulin requirements. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of NovoMix 50 in children below 18 years of age have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \n \nTransfer to NovoMix 50 from other insulin preparations may require adjustment of dose and timing of \nadministration. Close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the initial weeks \nthereafter (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nNovoMix 50 is a biphasic suspension of the insulin analogue, insulin aspart. The suspension contains \nrapid-acting and intermediate-acting insulin aspart in the ratio 50/50. \n \nNovoMix 50 is for subcutaneous administration only. \n \nNovoMix 50 is administered subcutaneously by injection in the thigh or in the abdominal wall. If \nconvenient, the gluteal or deltoid region may be used. Injection sites should always be rotated within \nthe same region in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. The influence of different injection sites \non the absorption of NovoMix 50 has not been investigated. The duration of action will vary according \nto the dose, injection site, blood flow, temperature and level of physical activity.  \n \nNovoMix 50 has a faster onset of action than biphasic human insulin and should generally be given \nimmediately before a meal. When necessary, NovoMix 50 can be given soon after a meal. \n \nFor detailed user instructions, please refer to the package leaflet. \n \nNovoMix 50 Penfill \nAdministration with an insulin delivery system \nNovoMix 50 Penfill is designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems and NovoFine \nor NovoTwist needles. NovoMix 50 Penfill is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a \nreusable pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n \nNovoMix 50 FlexPen \nAdministration with FlexPen \nNovoMix 50 FlexPen is a pre-filled pen (colour-coded) designed to be used with NovoFine or \nNovoTwist needles. FlexPen delivers 1â€“60 units in increments of 1 unit. NovoMix 50 FlexPen is only \nsuitable for subcutaneous injections. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNovoMix 50 must not be administered intravenously, as it may result in severe hypoglycaemia. \nIntramuscular administration should be avoided. NovoMix 50 is not to be used in insulin infusion \npumps. \n \nBefore travelling between different time zones, the patient should seek the doctorâ€™s advice since this \nmay mean that the patient has to take the insulin and meals at different times. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nHyperglycaemia \n \nInadequate dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to \nhyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Usually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop \ngradually over a period of hours or days. They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, \nvomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. \nIn type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is \npotentially lethal. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nOmission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In case \nof hypoglycaemia or if hypoglycaemia is suspected, NovoMix must not be injected. After stabilisation \nof the patientâ€™s blood glucose, adjustment of the dose should be considered (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and \n4.9). \n \nPatients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may \nexperience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised \naccordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. \n \nSince NovoMix 50 should be administered in immediate relation to a meal, the rapid onset of action \nshould be considered in patients with concomitant diseases or treatment where a delayed absorption of \nfood might be expected. \n \nConcomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patientâ€™s \ninsulin requirements. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or \nthyroid gland can require changes in the insulin dose. \n \nWhen patients are transferred between different types of insulin medicinal products, the early warning \nsymptoms of hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with \ntheir previous insulin. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \n \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal insulin, human insulin or \ninsulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may \nresult in the need for a change in dose. Patients transferred to NovoMix 50 from another type of \ninsulin may require an increased number of daily injections or a change in dose from that used with \ntheir usual insulin medicinal products. If an adjustment is needed, it may occur with the first dose or \nduring the first few weeks or months. \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nAs with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, \ninflammation, bruising, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given \narea reduces the risk of developing these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few \nweeks. On rare occasions, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of NovoMix 50. \n \nCombination of NovoMix with pioglitazone \n \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and NovoMix is considered. If the combination \n\n\n\n17 \n\nis used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. \nPioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n \nAvoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors \n \nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between NovoMix and other insulin products. \n \nInsulin antibodies \n \nInsulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin \nantibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of medicinal products are known to interact with the glucose metabolism. \n \nThe following substances may reduce the patientâ€™s insulin requirements: \nOral antidiabetic medicinal products, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), beta-blockers, \nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids and sulfonamides. \n \nThe following substances may increase the patientâ€™s insulin requirements: \nOral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth \nhormone and danazol. \n \nBeta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. \n \nOctreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. \n \nAlcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is limited clinical experience with NovoMix 50 in pregnancy. \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin aspart and human \ninsulin regarding embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. \n \nIn general, intensified blood glucose control and monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes are \nrecommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually \nfall in the first trimester and increase subsequently during the second and third trimesters. After \ndelivery, insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy levels. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment with NovoMix 50 during breast-feeding. Insulin treatment of the \nnursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the NovoMix 50 dose may need to be adjusted. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin aspart and human \ninsulin regarding fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nThe patientâ€™s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or \noperating machinery). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving or operating a \nmachine. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning \nsigns of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving or \noperating a machine should be considered in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdverse reactions observed in patients using NovoMix are mainly due to the pharmacological effect of \ninsulin aspart. \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia. The frequencies of \nhypoglycaemia vary with patient population, dose regimens and level of glycaemic control, please see \nDescription of selected adverse reactions below. \n \nAt the beginning of the insulin treatment, refraction anomalies, oedema and injection site reactions \n(pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur. \nThese reactions are usually of a transitory nature. Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be \nassociated with acute painful neuropathy, which is usually reversible. Intensification of insulin therapy \nwith abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of \ndiabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of \ndiabetic retinopathy.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions listed below are based on clinical trial data and classified according to MedDRA \nfrequency and System Organ Class. Frequency categories are defined according to the following \nconvention: Very common (â‰¥1/10); common (â‰¥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (â‰¥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(â‰¥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata).  \n \nImmune system disorders  Uncommon â€“ Urticaria, rash, eruptions \n\n \nVery rare â€“ Anaphylactic reactions* \n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n \n\nVery common â€“ Hypoglycaemia* \n \n\nNervous system disorders Rare â€“ Peripheral neuropathy (painful neuropathy) \n \n\nEye disorders  \n \n \n\nUncommon â€“ Refraction disorders \n \nUncommon â€“ Diabetic retinopathy  \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon â€“ Lipodystrophy* \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nUncommon â€“ Oedema \n \nUncommon â€“ Injection site reactions \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\n* see Description of selected adverse reactions \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAnaphylactic reactions: \nThe occurrence of generalised hypersensitivity reactions (including generalised skin rash, itching, \nsweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulties in breathing, palpitation and \nreduction in blood pressure) is very rare but can potentially be life-threatening. \n \nHypoglycaemia: \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may occur if the insulin dose is too \nhigh in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or \nconvulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. \nThe symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale \nskin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty \nin concentrating, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation.  \n \nIn clinical trials, the frequency of hypoglycaemia varied with patient population, dose regimens and \nlevel of glycaemic control. During clinical trials, the overall rates of hypoglycaemia did not differ \nbetween patients treated with insulin aspart compared to human insulin. \n \nLipodystrophy: \nLipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) may occur at the injection site. Continuous \nrotation of the injection site within the particular area reduces the risk of developing these reactions. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of NovoMix 50 in children below 18 years of age have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nOther special populations \n \nBased on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not indicate \nany differences to the broader experience in the general population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nA specific overdose for insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over \nsequential stages if too high doses relative to the patientâ€™s requirement are administered: \n \nâ€¢ Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary \n\nproducts. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries sugar-containing \nproducts. \n\nâ€¢ Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated with \nglucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or with \nglucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given intravenously, \nif the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining \nconsciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in order to \nprevent a relapse. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n20 \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, \nintermediate- or long-acting combined with fast-acting. ATC code: A10AD05. \n \nNovoMix 50 is a biphasic suspension of 50% soluble insulin aspart (rapid-acting human insulin \nanalogue) and 50% protamine-crystallised insulin aspart (intermediate-acting human insulin \nanalogue). \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe blood glucose lowering effect of insulin aspart is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following \nbinding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose \noutput from the liver. \n \nNovoMix 50 is a biphasic insulin, which contains 50% soluble insulin aspart. This has a rapid onset of \naction, thus allowing it to be given closer to a meal (within zero to 10 minutes of the meal) when \ncompared to soluble human insulin. The crystalline phase (50%) consists of protamine-crystallised \ninsulin aspart, which has an activity profile similar to that of human NPH insulin. \n \nWhen NovoMix 50 is injected subcutaneously, the onset of action will occur within 10 to 20 minutes \nof injection. The maximum effect is exerted between 1 and 4 hours after injection. The duration of \naction is 14 to 24 hours (Figure 1). \n \n \n\nHours \n\nG\nlu\n\nco\nse\n\n In\nfu\n\nsi\non\n\n R\nat\n\ne \n\nNovoMix 50  \n \nFigure 1: Activity Profile for NovoMix 50 in Healthy Caucasian Subjects. \n \nInsulin aspart is equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nAbsorption, distribution and elimination \n \nIn insulin aspart, substitution of amino acid proline with aspartic acid at position B28 reduces the \ntendency to form hexamers as observed with soluble human insulin. The insulin aspart in the soluble \nphase of NovoMix 50 comprises 50% of the total insulin; this is absorbed more rapidly from the \nsubcutaneous layer than the soluble insulin component of biphasic human insulin. The remaining 50% \nis in crystalline form as protamine-crystallised insulin aspart; this has a prolonged absorption profile \nsimilar to human NPH insulin. \n \nIn healthy volunteers, a mean maximum serum concentration of 445 Â± 135 pmol/l was reached about \n60 minutes after a subcutaneous dose of 0.30 unit/kg body weight. In type 2 patients with diabetes, the \nmaximum concentration was reached about 95 minutes after dosing. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of NovoMix 50 have not been investigated in paediatrics, elderly patients or in \npatients with renal or hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nIn in vitro tests, including binding to insulin and IGF-1 receptor sites and effects on cell growth, \ninsulin aspart behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also demonstrate \nthat the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin aspart is equivalent to human insulin.  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNovoMix 70 Penfill 100 units/ml suspension for injection in cartridge \nNovoMix 70 FlexPen 100 units/ml suspension for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nNovoMix 70 Penfill \n1 ml of the suspension contains 100 units soluble insulin aspart*/protamine-crystallised insulin aspart* \nin the ratio 70/30 (equivalent to 3.5 mg). 1 cartridge contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 units. \n \nNovoMix 70 FlexPen \n1 ml of the suspension contains 100 units soluble insulin aspart*/protamine-crystallised insulin aspart* \nin the ratio 70/30 (equivalent to 3.5 mg). 1 pre-filled pen contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 units. \n \n*Insulin aspart is produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \n \nThe suspension is cloudy, white and aqueous. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNovoMix 70 is indicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe potency of insulin analogues, including insulin aspart, is expressed in units, whereas the potency \nof human insulin is expressed in international units. \n \nNovoMix 70 dosing is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. Blood \nglucose monitoring and insulin dose adjustments are recommended to achieve optimal glycaemic \ncontrol. \n \nThe individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.5 and 1.0 unit/kg/day. NovoMix 70 may fully \nor partially meet this requirement. \n \nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, NovoMix 70 can be given as monotherapy or in combination with \nmetformin when the blood glucose is inadequately controlled with metformin alone. \n \nAdjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their \nusual diet or during concomitant illness. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nIn elderly patients (â‰¥65 years old) and in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, glucose \n\n\n\n25 \n\nmonitoring should be intensified and the insulin aspart dose adjusted on an individual basis. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment may reduce the patientâ€™s insulin requirements. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of NovoMix 70 in children below 18 years of age have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \n \nTransfer to NovoMix 70 from other insulin preparations may require adjustment of dose and timing of \nadministration. Close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the initial weeks \nthereafter (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nNovoMix 70 is a biphasic suspension of the insulin analogue, insulin aspart. The suspension contains \nrapid-acting and intermediate-acting insulin aspart in the ratio 70/30. \n \nNovoMix 70 is for subcutaneous administration only.  \n \nNovoMix 70 is administered subcutaneously by injection in the thigh or in the abdominal wall. If \nconvenient, the gluteal or deltoid region may be used. Injection sites should always be rotated within \nthe same region in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. The influence of different injection sites \non the absorption of NovoMix 70 has not been investigated. The duration of action will vary according \nto the dose, injection site, blood flow, temperature and level of physical activity.  \n \nNovoMix 70 has a faster onset of action than biphasic human insulin and should generally be given \nimmediately before a meal. When necessary, NovoMix 70 can be given soon after a meal. \n \nFor detailed user instructions, please refer to the package leaflet. \n \nNovoMix 70 Penfill \nAdministration with an insulin delivery system \nNovoMix 70 Penfill is designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems and NovoFine \nor NovoTwist needles. NovoMix 70 Penfill is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a \nreusable pen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n \nNovoMix 70 FlexPen \nAdministration with FlexPen \nNovoMix 70 FlexPen is a pre-filled pen (colour-coded) designed to be used with NovoFine or \nNovoTwist needles. FlexPen delivers 1â€“60 units in increments of 1 unit. NovoMix 70 FlexPen is only \nsuitable for subcutaneous injections. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNovoMix 70 must not be administered intravenously, as it may result in severe hypoglycaemia. \nIntramuscular administration should be avoided. NovoMix 70 is not to be used in insulin infusion \npumps. \n \nBefore travelling between different time zones, the patient should seek the doctorâ€™s advice since this \nmay mean that the patient has to take the insulin and meals at different times. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nHyperglycaemia \n \nInadequate dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to \nhyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Usually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop \ngradually over a period of hours or days. They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, \nvomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. \nIn type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is \npotentially lethal. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nOmission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia.  \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In case \nof hypoglycaemia or if hypoglycaemia is suspected, NovoMix must not be injected. After stabilisation \nof the patientâ€™s blood glucose, adjustment of the dose should be considered (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and \n4.9). \n \nPatients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may \nexperience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised \naccordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. \n \nSince NovoMix 70 should be administered in immediate relation to a meal, the rapid onset of action \nshould be considered in patients with concomitant diseases or treatment where a delayed absorption of \nfood might be expected. \n \nConcomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patientâ€™s \ninsulin requirements. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or \nthyroid gland can require changes in the insulin dose. \n \nWhen patients are transferred between different types of insulin medicinal products, the early warning \nsymptoms of hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with \ntheir previous insulin. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \n \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal insulin, human insulin or \ninsulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may \nresult in the need for a change in dose. Patients transferred to NovoMix 70 from another type of \ninsulin may require an increased number of daily injections or a change in dose from that used with \ntheir usual insulin medicinal products. If an adjustment is needed, it may occur with the first dose or \nduring the first few weeks or months. \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nAs with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, \ninflammation, bruising, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given \narea reduces the risk of developing these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few \nweeks. On rare occasions, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of NovoMix 70. \n \nCombination of NovoMix with pioglitazone \n \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and NovoMix is considered. If the combination \nis used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. \n\n\n\n27 \n\nPioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n \nAvoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors \n \nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between NovoMix and other insulin products. \n \nInsulin antibodies \n \nInsulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin \nantibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of medicinal products are known to interact with the glucose metabolism. \n \nThe following substances may reduce the patientâ€™s insulin requirements: \nOral antidiabetic medicinal products, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), beta-blockers, \nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids and sulfonamides. \n \nThe following substances may increase the patientâ€™s insulin requirements: \nOral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth \nhormone and danazol. \n \nBeta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. \n \nOctreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. \n \nAlcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is limited clinical experience with NovoMix 70 in pregnancy. \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin aspart and human \ninsulin regarding embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. \n \nIn general, intensified blood glucose control and monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes are \nrecommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually \nfall in the first trimester and increase subsequently during the second and third trimesters. After \ndelivery, insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy levels. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment with NovoMix 70 during breast-feeding. Insulin treatment of the \nnursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the NovoMix 70 dose may need to be adjusted. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin aspart and human \ninsulin regarding fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nThe patientâ€™s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or \noperating machinery). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving or operating a \nmachine. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning \nsigns of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving or \noperating a machine should be considered in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdverse reactions observed in patients using NovoMix are mainly due to the pharmacological effect of \ninsulin aspart. \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia. The frequencies of \nhypoglycaemia vary with patient population, dose regimens and level of glycaemic control, please see \nDescription of selected adverse reactions below. \n \nAt the beginning of the insulin treatment, refraction anomalies, oedema and injection site reactions \n(pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur. \nThese reactions are usually of a transitory nature. Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be \nassociated with acute painful neuropathy, which is usually reversible. Intensification of insulin therapy \nwith abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of \ndiabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of \ndiabetic retinopathy.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions listed below are based on clinical trial data and classified according to MedDRA \nfrequency and System Organ Class. Frequency categories are defined according to the following \nconvention: Very common (â‰¥1/10); common (â‰¥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (â‰¥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(â‰¥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \nImmune system disorders  Uncommon â€“ Urticaria, rash, eruptions \n\n \nVery rare â€“ Anaphylactic reactions* \n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n \n\nVery common â€“ Hypoglycaemia* \n \n\nNervous system disorders Rare â€“ Peripheral neuropathy (painful neuropathy) \n \n\nEye disorders  \n \n \n\nUncommon â€“ Refraction disorders \n \nUncommon â€“ Diabetic retinopathy \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon â€“ Lipodystrophy* \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nUncommon â€“ Oedema \n \nUncommon â€“ Injection site reactions \n \n\n* see Description of selected adverse reactions \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAnaphylactic reactions: \nThe occurrence of generalised hypersensitivity reactions (including generalised skin rash, itching, \nsweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulties in breathing, palpitation and \nreduction in blood pressure) is very rare but can potentially be life-threatening. \n \nHypoglycaemia: \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may occur if the insulin dose is too \nhigh in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or \nconvulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. \nThe symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale \nskin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty \nin concentrating, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation.  \n \nIn clinical trials, the frequency of hypoglycaemia varied with patient population, dose regimens and \nlevel of glycaemic control. During clinical trials, the overall rates of hypoglycaemia did not differ \nbetween patients treated with insulin aspart compared to human insulin. \n \nLipodystrophy: \nLipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) may occur at the injection site. Continuous \nrotation of the injection site within the particular area reduces the risk of developing these reactions. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of NovoMix 70 in children below 18 years of age have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nOther special populations  \n \nBased on post-marketing sources and clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not indicate \nany differences to the broader experience in the general population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nA specific overdose for insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over \nsequential stages if too high doses relative to the patientâ€™s requirement are administered: \n \nâ€¢ Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary \n\nproducts. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries sugar-containing \nproducts. \n\nâ€¢ Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated with \nglucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or with \nglucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given intravenously, \nif the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining \nconsciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in order to \nprevent a relapse. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n30 \n\n \n5.

What you need to know before you use NovoMix 30 \n3. How to use NovoMix 30 \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store NovoMix 30 \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What NovoMix 30 is and what it is used for \n \nNovoMix 30 is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with both a rapid-acting and an intermediate-\nacting effect, in the ratio 30/70. Modern insulin products are improved versions of human insulin. \n \nNovoMix 30 is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children aged \n10 years and above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not \nproduce enough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. \n \nNovoMix 30 will start to lower your blood sugar 10â€“20 minutes after you inject it, the maximum \neffect occurs between 1 and 4 hours after the injection, and the effect lasts for up to 24 hours. \n \nIn treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, NovoMix 30 may be used in combination with tablets for \ndiabetes and/or with injectable antidiabetic products. \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoMix 30 \n \nDo not use NovoMix 30  \n \nâ–º If you are allergic to insulin aspart or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (see section \n\n6, Contents of the pack and other information). \nâ–º If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting, see a) Summary of serious and very \n\ncommon side effects in section 4. \nâ–º In insulin infusion pumps. \nâ–º If the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed. \nâ–º If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5, How to store NovoMix \n\n30. \nâ–º If the resuspended insulin does not appear uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. \nâ–º If after resuspension, clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the \n\nbottom or the wall of the cartridge. \n \nIf any of these apply, do not use NovoMix 30. Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \nBefore using NovoMix 30 \n \nâ–º Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \nâ–º Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not \n\nuse it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white label band \nat the bottom of the cartridge. This could be the result of an insulin leakage. If you suspect that \nthe cartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further \ninstructions. \n\nâ–º Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \nâ–º Needles and NovoMix 30 Penfill must not be shared. \nâ–º NovoMix 30 Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to \n\nyour doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \nâ–º If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. \nâ–º If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \nâ–º If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \nâ–º If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nhereof. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nâ€¢ NovoMix 30 can be used in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above.  \nâ€¢ There is limited experience with NovoMix 30 in children aged 6â€“9 years.  \nâ€¢ No data are available for NovoMix 30 in children below 6 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and NovoMix 30 \n \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has \nto change. Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:  \nâ€¢ Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \nâ€¢ Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \nâ€¢ Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \nâ€¢ Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \nâ€¢ Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \nâ€¢ Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \nâ€¢ Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \nâ€¢ Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \nâ€¢ Glucocorticoids (such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ used to treat inflammation) \nâ€¢ Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \nâ€¢ Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \nâ€¢ Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the bodyâ€™s metabolic processes) \nâ€¢ Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \n\n\n\n65 \n\nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nDrinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 30 \n \nâ–º If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nâ–º If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. There is limited clinical experience with insulin aspart in \npregnancy. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. \nCareful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the \nhealth of your baby. \n\nâ–º There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoMix 30 during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nâ–º Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \nâ€¢ If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. \nâ€¢ If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore \nalso your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or \nothers. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients in NovoMix 30 \n \nNovoMix 30 contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. NovoMix 30 is essentially \nâ€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use NovoMix 30 \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. \nNovoMix 30 is generally taken immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of \nthe injection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, NovoMix 30 can be given soon after a meal. \nSee How and where to inject, below for information. \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. \n \nWhen NovoMix 30 is used in combination with tablets for diabetes and/or with injectable antidiabetic \nproducts your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor.  \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nNovoMix 30 can be used in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above when premixed insulin \nis preferred. Limited clinical data exists for children aged 6â€“9 years. No data are available for \nNovoMix 30 in children below 6 years of age. \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n \nHow and where to inject \n \nNovoMix 30 is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Never inject your insulin directly into a \nvein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). NovoMix 30 Penfill is only suitable for injecting \nunder the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another \nmethod. \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best \nplaces to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of \nyour thighs or upper arms. The insulin will work more quickly if you inject around the waist. You \nshould always measure your blood sugar regularly. \n \nâ–º Do not refill the cartridge. \nâ–º NovoMix 30 Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery \n\nsystems and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles.  \nâ–º If you are treated with NovoMix 30 Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge, you should use \n\ntwo insulin delivery systems, one for each type of insulin. \nâ–º Always carry a spare Penfill cartridge in case the one in use is lost or damaged. \n \nResuspension of NovoMix 30 \n \nAlways check if there is enough insulin left (at least 12 units) in the cartridge to allow even \nresuspension. If there is not enough insulin left, use a new one. See your pen manual for further \ninstructions. \n \nâ–º Every time you use a new NovoMix 30 Penfill (before you put the cartridge into the insulin \n\ndelivery system) \nâ€¢ Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. \nâ€¢ Roll the cartridge between your palms 10 times â€“ it is important that the cartridge is kept \n\nhorizontal (level with the ground) (see picture A).  \nâ€¢ Move the cartridge up and down between positions a and b (see picture B) 10 times so that the \n\nglass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other.  \nâ€¢ Repeat the rolling and moving procedures (see pictures A and B) until the liquid does appear \n\nuniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. Do not use the cartridge if the resuspended insulin does \nnot look uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. \n\nâ€¢ Complete the other stages of injection without delay. \nâ–º For every following injection  \n\n\n\n67 \n\nâ€¢ Move the delivery system with the cartridge inside up and down between a and b (see picture B) \nat least 10 times until the liquid appears uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. Do not use the \ncartridge if the resuspended insulin does not look uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. \n\nâ€¢ Complete the other stages of injection without delay. \n \n Picture A \n\n \n \n\n \n \nHow to inject NovoMix 30 \n \nâ–º Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse \n\nand as described in your pen manual. \nâ–º Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds. Keep the push-button fully depressed \n\nuntil the needle has been withdrawn from the skin. This will ensure correct delivery and limit \npossible flow of blood into the needle or insulin reservoir. \n\nâ–º After each injection, be sure to remove and discard the needle and store NovoMix 30 without \nthe needle attached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out, which can cause inaccurate dosing. \n\n \nIf you take more insulin than you should  \n \nIf you take too much insulin, your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of \nserious and very common side effects in section 4.  \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4.  \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) \nEffects from diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \n\n\n\n68 \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \na) Summary of serious and very common side effects  \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in \n10 people. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Inject too much insulin. \nâ€¢ Eat too little or miss a meal. \nâ€¢ Exercise more than usual. \nâ€¢ Drink alcohol (see Drinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 30 in section 2). \n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon given by someone who \nknows how to use it. If you are given glucagon, you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you \nare conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \nâ–º If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\nâ–º When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is \nstabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. \n\nâ–º If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an \ninjection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a \ndoctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink because you may choke. \n \nSerious allergic reactions to NovoMix 30 or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic \nreaction) is a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life-threatening. It may affect less than 1 in \n10,000 people. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \nâ€¢ If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \nâ€¢ If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \nâ–º If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nb) List of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, see your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n69 \n\nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary.  \n \nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection reduces the \nrisk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, \ntell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption \nof your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally, this soon disappears. If not, contact your doctor. \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nRare side effects  \nMay affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may \nget nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient.  \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \nc) Effects from diabetes \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Have not injected enough insulin. \nâ€¢ Forget to take your insulin or stop taking insulin. \nâ€¢ Repeatedly take less insulin than you need. \nâ€¢ Get an infection and/or a fever. \nâ€¢ Eat more than usual. \nâ€¢ Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \nâ–º If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \nâ–º These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5.

Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \nâ€¢ Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \nâ€¢ Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \nâ€¢ Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \nâ€¢ Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \nâ€¢ Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \nâ€¢ Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \nâ€¢ Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \nâ€¢ Glucocorticoids (such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ used to treat inflammation) \nâ€¢ Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \nâ€¢ Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \nâ€¢ Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the bodyâ€™s metabolic processes) \nâ€¢ Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nDrinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 30 \n \nâ–º If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nâ–º If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. There is limited clinical experience with insulin aspart in \npregnancy. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. \nCareful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the \nhealth of your baby. \n\nâ–º There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoMix 30 during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nâ–º Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \nâ€¢ If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. \nâ€¢ If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore \nalso your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or \nothers. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients in NovoMix 30 \n \nNovoMix 30 contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. NovoMix 30 is essentially \nâ€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use NovoMix 30 \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. \nNovoMix 30 is generally taken immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of \nthe injection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, NovoMix 30 can be given soon after a meal. \nSee How and where to inject, below for information.  \n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. \n \nWhen NovoMix 30 is used in combination with tablets for diabetes and/or with injectable antidiabetic \nproducts your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor.  \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nNovoMix 30 can be used in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above when premixed insulin \nis preferred. Limited clinical data exists for children aged 6â€“9 years. No data are available for \nNovoMix 30 in children below 6 years of age. \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n \nHow and where to inject \n \nNovoMix 30 is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Never inject your insulin directly into a \nvein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). NovoMix 30 FlexPen is only suitable for injecting \nunder the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best \nplaces to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of \nyour thighs or upper arms. The insulin will work more quickly if you inject around the waist. You \nshould always measure your blood sugar regularly. \n \nHow to handle NovoMix 30 FlexPen \n \nNovoMix 30 FlexPen is a pre-filled, colour-coded, disposable pen containing a mixture of rapid-acting \nand intermediate-acting insulin aspart in the ratio 30/70. \n \nRead carefully the instructions for use included in this package leaflet. You must use the pen as \ndescribed in the Instructions for use. \n \nAlways ensure you use the correct pen before you inject your insulin. \n \nIf you take more insulin than you should \n \nIf you take too much insulin, your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of \nserious and very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) \nEffects from diabetes in section 4.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n76 \n\na) Summary of serious and very common side effects  \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in \n10 people. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Inject too much insulin. \nâ€¢ Eat too little or miss a meal. \nâ€¢ Exercise more than usual. \nâ€¢ Drink alcohol (see Drinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 30 in section 2). \n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon given by someone who \nknows how to use it. If you are given glucagon, you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you \nare conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \nâ–º If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\nâ–º When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is \nstabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. \n\nâ–º If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an \ninjection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a \ndoctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink because you may choke. \n \nSerious allergic reactions to NovoMix 30 or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic \nreaction) is a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life-threatening. It may affect less than 1 in \n10,000 people. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \nâ€¢ If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \nâ€¢ If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \nâ–º If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nb) List of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, see your doctor. \n \nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection reduces the \nrisk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, \ntell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption \nof your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally, this soon disappears. If not, contact your doctor. \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this.  \n \nRare side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may \nget nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient.  \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \nc) Effects from diabetes \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Have not injected enough insulin. \nâ€¢ Forget to take your insulin or stop taking insulin. \nâ€¢ Repeatedly take less insulin than you need. \nâ€¢ Get an infection and/or a fever. \nâ€¢ Eat more than usual. \nâ€¢ Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \nâ–º If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \nâ–º These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat NovoMix 30 contains \n \nâ€¢ The active substance is insulin aspart. NovoMix 30 is a mixture consisting of 30% soluble \n\ninsulin aspart and 70% insulin aspart crystallised with protamine. 1 ml contains 100 units of \ninsulin aspart. Each pre-filled pen contains 300 units of insulin aspart in 3 ml suspension for \ninjection. \n\nâ€¢ The other ingredients are glycerol, phenol, metacresol, zinc chloride, disodium phosphate \ndihydrate, sodium chloride, protamine sulfate, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and water \nfor injections. \n\n \nWhat NovoMix 30 looks like and contents of the pack \n \nNovoMix 30 is presented as a suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. The cartridge contains a \nglass ball to facilitate resuspension. After resuspension, the liquid should appear uniformly white, \ncloudy and aqueous. Do not use the insulin, if it does not look uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous \nafter resuspension. \n \nPack sizes of 1 (with or without needles), 5 (without needles) and 10 (without needles) pre-filled pens \nof 3 ml. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \nThe suspension is cloudy, white and aqueous. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder \n \nNovo Nordisk A/S \nNovo AllÃ© \nDK-2880 BagsvÃ¦rd, Denmark \n \nManufacturer \n \nThe manufacturer can be identified by the batch number printed on the slip of the carton and on the \nlabel: \n \nâ€¢ If the second and third characters are S6, P5, K7, R7, VG, FG or ZF, the manufacturer is Novo \n\nNordisk A/S, Novo AllÃ©, DK-2880 BagsvÃ¦rd, Denmark. \n \n\n\n\n79 \n\nâ€¢ If the second and third characters are H7 or T6, the manufacturer is Novo Nordisk Production \nSAS, 45 Avenue dâ€™OrlÃ©ans, F-28000 Chartres, France. \n\n \nNow turn over for information on how to use your FlexPen. \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in  \n \nOther sources of information \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. \n  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n80 \n\nInstruction on how to use NovoMix 30 suspension for injection in FlexPen.  \n \nRead the following instructions carefully before using your FlexPen. If you do not follow the \ninstructions carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low \nblood sugar level. \n \nYour FlexPen is a pre-filled dial-a-dose insulin pen.  \nâ–º You can select doses from 1 to 60 units in increments of 1 unit.  \nâ–º FlexPen is designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable needles up to a length \n\nof 8 mm.  \nâ–º Always carry a spare insulin delivery device in case your FlexPen is lost or damaged. \n \n \n \n\nPen cap \n\nNovoMix 30 FlexPen Glass  \nball \n\nCartridge \n\nPointer \n\nDose \nselector \n\nPush- \nbutton \n\nBig outer \nneedle cap \n\nInner  \nneedle cap \n\nNeedle Paper tab \n\n12 units Residual \nscale \n\nNeedle (example) \n\n \n \nCaring for your pen \n \nâ–º Your FlexPen must be handled with care. If it is dropped, damaged or crushed, there is a risk of \n\ninsulin leakage. This may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to too high or too low blood \nsugar level.  \n\n \nâ–º You can clean the exterior of your FlexPen by wiping it with a medicinal swab. Do not soak, \n\nwash or lubricate it as it may damage the pen.  \n \nâ–º Do not refill your FlexPen. \n \nResuspending your insulin \n \nA \nCheck the name and coloured label of your pen to make sure that it contains the correct type of \ninsulin. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take the wrong \ntype of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. \n \nEvery time you use a new pen \nLet the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. \nPull off the pen cap.  \n \n A \n\n \n \nB \nBefore your first injection with a new FlexPen, you must resuspend the insulin: \nRoll the pen between your palms 10 times â€“ it is important that the pen is kept horizontal (level with \nthe ground).  \n \n\n\n\n81 \n\n B \n\n \n \nC \nThen move the pen up and down 10 times between the two positions as shown, so the glass ball \nmoves from one end of the cartridge to the other.  \n \nRepeat rolling and moving the pen until the liquid does appear uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous.  \n \nFor every following injection  \nMove the pen up and down between the two positions at least 10 times until the liquid does appear \nuniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. \n \nâ–º Always make sure that you have resuspended the insulin prior to each injection. This reduces \n\nthe risk of too high or too low blood sugar level. After you have resuspended the insulin, \ncomplete all the following steps of injection without delay. \n\n \n C \n\n \n \n\n Always check there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to allow resuspension. If \nthere are less than 12 units left, use a new FlexPen. 12 units are marked on the residual scale. \nSee the big picture on top of this instruction. \n\n \n Do not use the pen if the resuspended insulin does not look uniformly white, cloudy and \n\naqueous. \n \nAttaching a needle \n \nD \nTake a new needle and tear off the paper tab. \n \nScrew the needle straight and tightly onto your FlexPen. \n \n D \n\n \n \nE \nPull off the big outer needle cap and keep it for later.  \n \n E \n\n \n \nF \nPull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. \n\n\n\n82 \n\nNever try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the needle. \n \n F \n\n \n \n\n Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, \nleakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing.  \n\n \n Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. \n\n \nChecking the insulin flow \n \nPrior to each injection, small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To \navoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: \n \nG \nTurn the dose selector to select 2 units. \n \n G \n\n2 units \nselected \n\n \n \nH \nHold your FlexPen with the needle pointing upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a \nfew times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. \n \n H \n\n \n \nI \nKeeping the needle upwards, press the push-button all the way in. The dose selector returns to 0. \n \nA drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no \nmore than 6 times. \n \nIf a drop of insulin still does not appear, the pen is defective, and you must use a new one. \n \n I \n\n \n \n\n Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure that \nthe insulin flows. If no drop appears you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose \nselector may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little \n\ninsulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. \n \nSelecting your dose \n \nCheck that the dose selector is set at 0. \n \nJ \nTurn the dose selector to select the number of units you need to inject. \n \nThe dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the \ncorrect dose lines up with the pointer. When turning the dose selector, be careful not to push the push-\nbutton as insulin will come out. \n \nYou cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge. \n \n J \n\n5 units \nselected \n\n24 units \nselected \n\n \n \n\n Always use the dose selector and the pointer to see how many units you have selected before \ninjecting the insulin. \n\n \n Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may \n\nget too high or too low. Do not use the residual scale, it only shows approximately how much \ninsulin is left in your pen. \n\n \nMaking the injection \n \nInsert the needle into your skin. Use the injection technique shown by your doctor or nurse. \n \nK \nInject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until 0 lines up with the pointer. Be careful \nonly to push the push-button when injecting. \n \nTurning the dose selector will not inject insulin. \n \n K \n\n \n \nL \nâ–º Keep the push-button fully depressed and let the needle remain under the skin for at least \n\n6 seconds. This will make sure you get the full dose. \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \nâ–º Withdraw the needle from the skin, then release the pressure on the push-button. \n \nâ–º Always make sure that the dose selector returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose selector stops \n\nbefore it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too high blood \nsugar level. \n\n \n L \n\n \n \nM \nLead the needle into the big outer needle cap without touching it. When the needle is covered, \ncarefully push the big outer needle cap completely on and then unscrew the needle.  \n \nDispose of it carefully and put the pen cap back on your FlexPen. \n \n M \n\n \n \n\n Always remove the needle after each injection and store your FlexPen without the needle \nattached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles \nand inaccurate dosing. \n\n \nFurther important information \n \n\n Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles to reduce the risk of needle sticks \nand cross-infection. \n\n \n Dispose of the used FlexPen carefully without the needle attached. \n\n \n Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. \n\n \n Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. \n\n \n Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children. \n\n\n\n85 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nNovoMix 50 Penfill 100 units/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n50% soluble insulin aspart and 50% insulin aspart crystallised with protamine \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you \nâ€¢ Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \nâ€¢ If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.  \nâ€¢ This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What you need to know before you use NovoMix 50 \n3. How to use NovoMix 50 \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store NovoMix 50 \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What NovoMix 50 is and what it is used for  \n \nNovoMix 50 is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with both a rapid-acting and an intermediate-\nacting effect, in the ratio 50/50. Modern insulin products are improved versions of human insulin. \n \nNovoMix 50 is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). \nDiabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your \nblood sugar. NovoMix 50 may be used in combination with metformin.  \n \nNovoMix 50 will start to lower your blood sugar 10â€“20 minutes after you inject it, the maximum \neffect occurs between 1 and 4 hours after the injection, and the effect lasts for up to 14â€“24 hours. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoMix 50 \n \nDo not use NovoMix 50 \n \nâ–º If you are allergic to insulin aspart or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (see section \n\n6, Contents of the pack and other information). \nâ–º If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting, see a) Summary of serious and very \n\ncommon side effects in section 4. \nâ–º In insulin infusion pumps. \nâ–º If the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed. \nâ–º If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5, How to store NovoMix \n\n50. \nâ–º If the resuspended insulin does not appear uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. \nâ–º If after resuspension, clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the \n\nbottom or the wall of the cartridge. \n \nIf any of these apply, do not use NovoMix 50. Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. \n \nBefore using NovoMix 50 \n \n\n\n\n86 \n\nâ–º Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \nâ–º Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not \n\nuse it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white label band \nat the bottom of the cartridge. This could be the result of an insulin leakage. If you suspect that \nthe cartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further \ninstructions. \n\nâ–º Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \nâ–º Needles and NovoMix 50 Penfill must not be shared. \nâ–º NovoMix 50 Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to \n\nyour doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \nâ–º If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. \nâ–º If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \nâ–º If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \nâ–º If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nhereof. \n \nOther medicines and NovoMix 50 \n \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has \nto change. Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:  \nâ€¢ Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \nâ€¢ Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \nâ€¢ Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \nâ€¢ Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \nâ€¢ Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \nâ€¢ Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \nâ€¢ Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \nâ€¢ Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \nâ€¢ Glucocorticoids (such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ used to treat inflammation) \nâ€¢ Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \nâ€¢ Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \nâ€¢ Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the bodyâ€™s metabolic processes) \nâ€¢ Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \n\n\n\n87 \n\ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nDrinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 50 \n \nâ–º If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nâ–º If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. There is limited clinical experience with insulin aspart in \npregnancy. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. \nCareful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the \nhealth of your baby. \n\nâ–º There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoMix 50 during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nâ–º Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \nâ€¢ If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. \nâ€¢ If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore \nalso your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or \nothers. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients in NovoMix 50 \n \nNovoMix 50 contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. NovoMix 50 is essentially \nâ€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use NovoMix 50 \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. \nNovoMix 50 is generally taken immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of \nthe injection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, NovoMix 50 can be given soon after a meal. \nSee How and where to inject, below for information. \n \nWhen NovoMix 50 is used in combination with metformin the dose should be adjusted. \n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nNo clinical studies with NovoMix 50 have been carried out in children and adolescents under the age \n\n\n\n88 \n\nof 18 years. \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n \nHow and where to inject \n \nNovoMix 50 is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Never inject your insulin directly into a \nvein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). NovoMix 50 Penfill is only suitable for injecting \nunder the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another \nmethod. \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best \nplaces to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of \nyour thighs or upper arms. The insulin will work more quickly if you inject around the waist. You \nshould always measure your blood sugar regularly. \n \nâ–º Do not refill the cartridge. \nâ–º NovoMix 50 Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery \n\nsystems and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles. \nâ–º If you are treated with NovoMix 50 Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge, you should use \n\ntwo insulin delivery systems, one for each type of insulin. \nâ–º Always carry a spare Penfill cartridge in case the one in use is lost or damaged. \n \nResuspension of NovoMix 50 \n \nAlways check if there is enough insulin left (at least 12 units) in the cartridge to allow even \nresuspension. If there is not enough insulin left, use a new one. See your pen manual for further \ninstructions. \n \nâ–º Every time you use a new NovoMix 50 Penfill (before you put the cartridge into the insulin \n\ndelivery system) \nâ€¢ Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. \nâ€¢ Roll the cartridge between your palms 10 times â€“ it is important that the cartridge is kept \n\nhorizontal (level with the ground) (see picture A).  \nâ€¢ Move the cartridge up and down between positions a and b (see picture B) 10 times so that the \n\nglass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other.  \nâ€¢ Repeat the rolling and moving procedures (see pictures A and B) until the liquid does appear \n\nuniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. Do not use the cartridge if the resuspended insulin does \nnot look uniformly white and cloudy. \n\nâ€¢ Complete the other stages of injection without delay. \nâ–º For every following injection  \nâ€¢ Move the delivery system with the cartridge inside up and down between a and b (see picture B) \n\nat least 10 times until the liquid appears uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. Do not use the \ncartridge if the resuspended insulin does not look uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. \n\nâ€¢ If the moving procedure alone is not enough to give a uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous \nliquid, repeat the rolling and moving procedures described above until the liquid appears \nuniformly white, cloudy and aqueous.  \n\nâ€¢ Complete the other stages of injection without delay. \n \n\n\n\n89 \n\n Picture A \n\n \n \n\n \n \nHow to inject NovoMix 50 \n \nâ–º Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse \n\nand as described in your pen manual. \nâ–º Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds. Keep the push-button fully depressed \n\nuntil the needle has been withdrawn from the skin. This will ensure correct delivery and limit \npossible flow of blood into the needle or insulin reservoir. \n\nâ–º After each injection, be sure to remove and discard the needle and store NovoMix 50 without \nthe needle attached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out, which can cause inaccurate dosing. \n\n \nIf you take more insulin than you should  \n \nIf you take too much insulin, your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of \nserious and very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) \nEffects from diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \na) Summary of serious and very common side effects  \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in \n\n\n\n90 \n\n10 people. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Inject too much insulin. \nâ€¢ Eat too little or miss a meal. \nâ€¢ Exercise more than usual. \nâ€¢ Drink alcohol (see Drinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 50 in section 2). \n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon given by someone who \nknows how to use it. If you are given glucagon, you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you \nare conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \nâ–º If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\nâ–º When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is \nstabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. \n\nâ–º If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an \ninjection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a \ndoctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink because you may choke. \n \nSerious allergic reactions to NovoMix 50 or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic \nreaction) is a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life-threatening. It may affect less than 1 in \n10,000 people. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \nâ€¢ If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \nâ€¢ If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \nâ–º If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nb) List of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, see your doctor. \n \nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n \nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection reduces the \n\n\n\n91 \n\nrisk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, \ntell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption \nof your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally, this soon disappears. If not, contact your doctor. \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nRare side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may \nget nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \nc) Effects from diabetes \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Have not injected enough insulin. \nâ€¢ Forget to take your insulin or stop taking insulin. \nâ€¢ Repeatedly take less insulin than you need. \nâ€¢ Get an infection and/or a fever. \nâ€¢ Eat more than usual. \nâ€¢ Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \nâ–º If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \nâ–º These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5.

What NovoMix 50 is and what it is used for \n \nNovoMix 50 is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with both a rapid-acting and an intermediate-\nacting effect, in the ratio 50/50. Modern insulin products are improved versions of human insulin. \n \nNovoMix 50 is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). \nDiabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your \nblood sugar. NovoMix 50 may be used in combination with metformin. \n \nNovoMix 50 will start to lower your blood sugar 10â€“20 minutes after you inject it, the maximum \neffect occurs between 1 and 4 hours after the injection, and the effect lasts for up to 14â€“24 hours. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoMix 50 \n \nDo not use NovoMix 50 \n \nâ–º If you are allergic to insulin aspart or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (see section \n\n6, Contents of the pack and other information). \nâ–º If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting, see a) Summary of serious and very \n\ncommon side effects in section 4. \nâ–º In insulin infusion pumps. \nâ–º If FlexPen is dropped, damaged or crushed. \nâ–º If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5, How to store NovoMix \n\n50. \nâ–º If the resuspended insulin does not appear uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. \nâ–º If after resuspension, clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the \n\nbottom or the wall of the cartridge. \n \nIf any of these apply, do not use NovoMix 50. Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. \n \nBefore using NovoMix 50 \n \n\n\n\n94 \n\nâ–º Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \nâ–º Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \nâ–º Needles and NovoMix 50 FlexPen must not be shared. \nâ–º NovoMix 50 FlexPen is only suitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you \n\nneed to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \nâ–º If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. \nâ–º If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \nâ–º If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \nâ–º If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nhereof. \n \nOther medicines and NovoMix 50 \n \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.

If you are given glucagon, you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you \nare conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \nâ–º If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\nâ–º When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is \nstabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. \n\nâ–º If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an \ninjection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a \ndoctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink because you may choke. \n \nSerious allergic reactions to NovoMix 50 or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic \nreaction) is a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life-threatening. It may affect less than 1 in \n10,000 people. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \nâ€¢ If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \nâ€¢ If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \nâ–º If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nb) List of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, see your doctor. \n \nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n \nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection reduces the \nrisk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, \ntell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption \nof your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally, this soon disappears. If not, contact your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n98 \n\nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nRare side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may \nget nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \nc) Effects from diabetes \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Have not injected enough insulin. \nâ€¢ Forget to take your insulin or stop taking insulin. \nâ€¢ Repeatedly take less insulin than you need. \nâ€¢ Get an infection and/or a fever. \nâ€¢ Eat more than usual. \nâ€¢ Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \nâ–º If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \nâ–º These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat NovoMix 50 contains \n \nâ€¢ The active substance is insulin aspart. NovoMix 50 is a mixture consisting of 50% soluble \n\ninsulin aspart and 50% insulin aspart crystallised with protamine. 1 ml contains 100 units of \ninsulin aspart. Each pre-filled pen contains 300 units of insulin aspart in 3 ml suspension for \ninjection. \n\nâ€¢ The other ingredients are glycerol, phenol, metacresol, zinc chloride, disodium phosphate \ndihydrate, sodium chloride, protamine sulfate, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and water \nfor injections. \n\n \nWhat NovoMix 50 looks like and contents of the pack \n \nNovoMix 50 is presented as a suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. The cartridge contains a \nglass ball to facilitate resuspension. After resuspension, the liquid should appear uniformly white, \ncloudy and aqueous. Do not use the insulin, if it does not look uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous \nafter resuspension. \n \nPack sizes of 1, 5 and 10 pre-filled pens of 3 ml. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \nThe suspension is cloudy, white and aqueous. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \n \nNovo Nordisk A/S \nNovo AllÃ© \nDK-2880 BagsvÃ¦rd, Denmark \n \nNow turn over for information on how to use your FlexPen. \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in  \n \nOther sources of information \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n100 \n\nInstruction on how to use NovoMix 50 suspension for injection in FlexPen. \n \nRead the following instructions carefully before using your FlexPen. If you do not follow the \ninstructions carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low \nblood sugar level. \n \nYour FlexPen is a pre-filled dial-a-dose insulin pen.  \nâ–º You can select doses from 1 to 60 units in increments of 1 unit.  \nâ–º FlexPen is designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist disposable needles up to a length \n\nof 8 mm. \nâ–º Always carry a spare insulin delivery device in case your FlexPen is lost or damaged. \n \n \n \n\nPen cap \n\nNovoMix 50 FlexPen Glass  \nball \n\nCartridge \n\nPointer \n\nDose \nselector \n\nPush- \nbutton \n\nBig outer \nneedle cap \n\nInner  \nneedle cap \n\nNeedle Paper tab \n\n12 units Residual \nscale \n\nNeedle (example) \n\n \n \nCaring for your pen \n \nâ–º Your FlexPen must be handled with care. If it is dropped, damaged or crushed, there is a risk of \n\ninsulin leakage. This may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to too high or too low blood \nsugar level. \n\n \nâ–º You can clean the exterior of your FlexPen by wiping it with a medicinal swab. Do not soak, \n\nwash or lubricate it as it may damage the pen.  \n \nâ–º Do not refill your FlexPen. \n \nResuspending your insulin \n \nA \nCheck the name and coloured label of your pen to make sure that it contains the correct type of \ninsulin. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take the wrong \ntype of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. \n \nEvery time you use a new pen \nLet the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. \nPull off the pen cap.  \n \n A \n\n \n \nB \nBefore your first injection with a new FlexPen, you must resuspend the insulin: \nRoll the pen between your palms 10 times â€“ it is important that the pen is kept horizontal (level with \nthe ground).  \n \n\n\n\n101 \n\n B \n\n \n \nC \nThen move the pen up and down 10 times between the two positions as shown, so the glass ball \nmoves from one end of the cartridge to the other.  \n \nRepeat rolling and moving the pen until the liquid does appear uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous.  \n \nFor every following injection  \nMove the pen up and down between the two positions at least 10 times until the liquid does appear \nuniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. If the moving procedure alone is not enough to give a uniformly \nwhite, cloudy and aqueous liquid, repeat the rolling and moving procedures (see B and C) until the \nliquid does appear uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. \n \nâ–º Always make sure that you have resuspended the insulin prior to each injection. This reduces \n\nthe risk of too high or too low blood sugar level. After you have resuspended the insulin, \ncomplete all the following steps of injection without delay. \n\n \n C \n\n \n \n\n Always check there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to allow resuspension. If \nthere are less than 12 units left, use a new FlexPen. 12 units are marked on the residual scale. \nSee the big picture on top of this instruction. \n\n \n Do not use the pen if the resuspended insulin does not look uniformly white, cloudy and \n\naqueous. \n \nAttaching a needle \n \nD \nTake a new needle and tear off the paper tab.  \n \nScrew the needle straight and tightly onto your FlexPen. \n \n D \n\n \n \nE \nPull off the big outer needle cap and keep it for later.  \n \n E \n\n \n \n\n\n\n102 \n\nF \nPull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. \nNever try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the needle. \n \n F \n\n \n \n\n Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, \nleakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing.  \n\n \n Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. \n\n \nChecking the insulin flow \n \nPrior to each injection, small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To \navoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: \n \nG \nTurn the dose selector to select 2 units. \n \n G \n\n2 units \nselected \n\n \n \nH \nHold your FlexPen with the needle pointing upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a \nfew times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. \n \n H \n\n \n \nI \nKeeping the needle upwards, press the push-button all the way in. The dose selector returns to 0. \n \nA drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no \nmore than 6 times. \n \nIf a drop of insulin still does not appear, the pen is defective, and you must use a new one. \n \n I \n\n \n \n\n\n\n103 \n\n Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure that \nthe insulin flows. If no drop appears you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose \nselector may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. \n\n \n Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little \n\ninsulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. \n \nSelecting your dose \n \nCheck that the dose selector is set at 0. \n \nJ \nTurn the dose selector to select the number of units you need to inject. \n \nThe dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the \ncorrect dose lines up with the pointer. When turning the dose selector, be careful not to push the push-\nbutton as insulin will come out. \n \nYou cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge. \n \n J \n\n5 units \nselected \n\n24 units \nselected \n\n \n \n\n Always use the dose selector and the pointer to see how many units you have selected before \ninjecting the insulin. \n\n \n Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may \n\nget too high or too low. Do not use the residual scale, it only shows approximately how much \ninsulin is left in your pen. \n\n \nMaking the injection \n \nInsert the needle into your skin. Use the injection technique shown by your doctor or nurse. \n \nK \nInject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until 0 lines up with the pointer. Be careful \nonly to push the push-button when injecting. \n \nTurning the dose selector will not inject insulin. \n \n K \n\n \n \n\n\n\n104 \n\nL \nâ–º Keep the push-button fully depressed and let the needle remain under the skin for at least \n\n6 seconds. This will make sure you get the full dose.  \n \nâ–º Withdraw the needle from the skin, then release the pressure on the push-button. \n \nâ–º Always make sure that the dose selector returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose selector stops \n\nbefore it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too high blood \nsugar level. \n\n \n L \n\n \n \nM \nLead the needle into the big outer needle cap without touching it. When the needle is covered, \ncarefully push the big outer needle cap completely on and then unscrew the needle.  \n \nDispose of it carefully and put the pen cap back on your FlexPen. \n \n M \n\n \n \n\n Always remove the needle after each injection and store your FlexPen without the needle \nattached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles \nand inaccurate dosing. \n\n \nFurther important information \n \n\n Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles to reduce the risk of needle sticks \nand cross-infection. \n\n \n Dispose of the used FlexPen carefully without the needle attached. \n\n \n Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. \n\n \n Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. \n\n \n Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children. \n\n\n\n105 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nNovoMix 70 Penfill 100 units/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n70% soluble insulin aspart and 30% insulin aspart crystallised with protamine \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you \nâ€¢ Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \nâ€¢ If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \nâ€¢ This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \nâ€¢ If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What NovoMix 70 is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoMix 70 \n3. How to use NovoMix 70 \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store NovoMix 70 \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What NovoMix 70 is and what it is used for \n \nNovoMix 70 is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with both a rapid-acting and an intermediate-\nacting effect, in the ratio 70/30. Modern insulin products are improved versions of human insulin.  \n \nNovoMix 70 is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). \nDiabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your \nblood sugar. NovoMix 70 may be used in combination with metformin. \n \nNovoMix 70 will start to lower your blood sugar 10â€“20 minutes after you inject it, the maximum \neffect occurs between 1 and 4 hours after the injection, and the effect lasts for up to 14â€“24 hours. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoMix 70 \n \nDo not use NovoMix 70 \n \nâ–º If you are allergic to insulin aspart or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (see section \n\n6, Contents of the pack and other information). \nâ–º If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting, see a) Summary of serious and very \n\ncommon side effects in section 4. \nâ–º In insulin infusion pumps. \nâ–º If the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed. \nâ–º If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5, How to store NovoMix \n\n70. \nâ–º If the resuspended insulin does not appear uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. \nâ–º If after resuspension, clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the \n\nbottom or the wall of the cartridge. \n \nIf any of these apply, do not use NovoMix 70. Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. \n \nBefore using NovoMix 70 \n\n\n\n106 \n\n \nâ–º Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \nâ–º Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not \n\nuse it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white label band \nat the bottom of the cartridge. This could be the result of an insulin leakage. If you suspect that \nthe cartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further \ninstructions. \n\nâ–º Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \nâ–º Needles and NovoMix 70 Penfill must not be shared. \nâ–º NovoMix 70 Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to \n\nyour doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \nâ–º If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. \nâ–º If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \nâ–º If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \nâ–º If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nhereof. \n \nOther medicines and NovoMix 70 \n \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has \nto change. Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:  \nâ€¢ Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \nâ€¢ Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \nâ€¢ Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \nâ€¢ Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \nâ€¢ Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \nâ€¢ Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \nâ€¢ Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \nâ€¢ Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \nâ€¢ Glucocorticoids (such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ used to treat inflammation) \nâ€¢ Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \nâ€¢ Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \nâ€¢ Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the bodyâ€™s metabolic processes) \nâ€¢ Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \n\n\n\n107 \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nDrinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 70 \n \nâ–º If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nâ–º If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. There is limited clinical experience with insulin aspart in \npregnancy. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. \nCareful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the \nhealth of your baby.  \n\nâ–º There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoMix 70 during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nâ–º Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \nâ€¢ If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. \nâ€¢ If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore \nalso your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or \nothers. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients in NovoMix 70 \n \nNovoMix 70 contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. NovoMix 70 is essentially \nâ€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use NovoMix 70 \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. \nNovoMix 70 is generally taken immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of \nthe injection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, NovoMix 70 can be given soon after a meal. \nSee How and where to inject, below for information. \n \nWhen NovoMix 70 is used in combination with metformin the dose should be adjusted. \n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \n\n\n\n108 \n\nNo clinical studies with NovoMix 70 have been carried out in children and adolescents under the age \nof 18 years. \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n \nHow and where to inject \n \nNovoMix 70 is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Never inject your insulin directly into a \nvein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). NovoMix 70 Penfill is only suitable for injecting \nunder the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another \nmethod. \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best \nplaces to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of \nyour thighs or upper arms. The insulin will work more quickly if you inject around the waist. You \nshould always measure your blood sugar regularly. \n \nâ–º Do not refill the cartridge. \nâ–º NovoMix 70 Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery \n\nsystems and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles. \nâ–º If you are treated with NovoMix 70 Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge, you should use \n\ntwo insulin delivery systems, one for each type of insulin. \nâ–º Always carry a spare Penfill cartridge in case the one in use is lost or damaged. \n \nResuspension of NovoMix 70 \n \nAlways check if there is enough insulin left (at least 12 units) in the cartridge to allow even \nresuspension. If there is not enough insulin left, use a new one. See your pen manual for further \ninstructions. \n \nâ–º Every time you use a new NovoMix 70 Penfill (before you put the cartridge into the insulin \n\ndelivery system) \nâ€¢ Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. \nâ€¢ Roll the cartridge between your palms 10 times â€“ it is important that the cartridge is kept \n\nhorizontal (level with the ground) (see picture A). \nâ€¢ Move the cartridge up and down between positions a and b (see picture B) 10 times so that the \n\nglass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other.  \nâ€¢ Repeat the rolling and moving procedures (see pictures A and B) until the liquid appears \n\nuniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. Do not use the cartridge if the resuspended insulin does \nnot look uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. \n\nâ€¢ Complete the other stages of injection without delay. \nâ–º For every following injection  \nâ€¢ Move the delivery system with the cartridge inside up and down between a and b (see picture B) \n\nat least 10 times until the liquid appears uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. Do not use the \ncartridge if the resuspended insulin does not look uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. \n\nâ€¢ If the moving procedure alone is not enough to give a uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous \nliquid, repeat the rolling and moving procedures described above until the liquid appears \nuniformly white, cloudy and aqueous.  \n\nâ€¢ Complete the other stages of injection without delay. \n \n\n\n\n109 \n\n Picture A \n\n \n \n\n \n \nHow to inject NovoMix 70 \n \nâ–º Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse \n\nand as described in your pen manual. \nâ–º Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds. Keep the push-button fully depressed \n\nuntil the needle has been withdrawn from the skin. This will ensure correct delivery and limit \npossible flow of blood into the needle or insulin reservoir. \n\nâ–º After each injection, be sure to remove and discard the needle and store NovoMix 70 without \nthe needle attached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out, which can cause inaccurate dosing. \n\n \nIf you take more insulin than you should  \n \nIf you take too much insulin, your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of \nserious and very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) \nEffects from diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \na) Summary of serious and very common side effects  \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in \n\n\n\n110 \n\n10 people. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Inject too much insulin. \nâ€¢ Eat too little or miss a meal. \nâ€¢ Exercise more than usual. \nâ€¢ Drink alcohol (see Drinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 70 in section 2). \n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more \nquickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon given by someone who \nknows how to use it. If you are given glucagon, you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you \nare conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n \nWhat to do if you experience low blood sugar: \nâ–º If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, \n\nbiscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets \nor high sugar snacks with you, just in case. \n\nâ–º When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is \nstabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. \n\nâ–º If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an \ninjection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a \ndoctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nTell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of \npassing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they \nmust turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or \ndrink because you may choke. \n \nSerious allergic reactions to NovoMix 70 or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic \nreaction) is a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life-threatening. It may affect less than 1 in \n10,000 people. \n \nSeek medical advice immediately: \nâ€¢ If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. \nâ€¢ If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty \n\nin breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. \nâ–º If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. \n \nb) List of other side effects \n \nUncommon side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 100 people. \n \nSigns of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and \nitching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your \ninsulin. If they do not disappear, see your doctor. \n \nVision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the \ndisturbance is usually temporary. \n \nChanges at the injection site (lipodystrophy): The fatty tissue under the skin at the injection site may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Changing the site with each injection reduces the \n\n\n\n111 \n\nrisk of developing such skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, \ntell your doctor or nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption \nof your insulin, if you inject in such a site. \n \nSwollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles \nand other joints. Normally, this soon disappears. If not, contact your doctor. \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have \ndiabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. \nAsk your doctor about this. \n \nRare side effects \nMay affect less than 1 in 1,000 people. \n \nPainful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may \nget nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \nc) Effects from diabetes \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nHigh blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Have not injected enough insulin. \nâ€¢ Forget to take your insulin or stop taking insulin. \nâ€¢ Repeatedly take less insulin than you need. \nâ€¢ Get an infection and/or a fever. \nâ€¢ Eat more than usual. \nâ€¢ Exercise less than usual. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar: \nThe warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your \nappetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a \nfruity (acetone) smell of the breath. \n \nWhat to do if you experience high blood sugar: \nâ–º If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you \n\ncan, then seek medical advice immediately. \nâ–º These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this \ncould lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. \n\n \n \n5.

What you need to know before you use NovoMix 70 \n3. How to use NovoMix 70 \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store NovoMix 70 \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What NovoMix 70 is and what it is used for \n \nNovoMix 70 is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with both a rapid-acting and an intermediate-\nacting effect, in the ratio 70/30. Modern insulin products are improved versions of human insulin. \n \nNovoMix 70 is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). \nDiabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your \nblood sugar. NovoMix 70 may be used in combination with metformin. \n \nNovoMix 70 will start to lower your blood sugar 10â€“20 minutes after you inject it, the maximum \neffect occurs between 1 and 4 hours after the injection, and the effect lasts for up to 14â€“24 hours. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoMix 70 \n \nDo not use NovoMix 70 \n \nâ–º If you are allergic to insulin aspart or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (see section \n\n6, Contents of the pack and other information). \nâ–º If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting, see a) Summary of serious and very \n\ncommon side effects in section 4. \nâ–º In insulin infusion pumps. \nâ–º If FlexPen is dropped, damaged or crushed. \nâ–º If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5, How to store NovoMix \n\n70. \nâ–º If the resuspended insulin does not appear uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. \nâ–º If after resuspension, clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the \n\nbottom or the wall of the cartridge. \n \nIf any of these apply, do not use NovoMix 70. Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. \n \nBefore using NovoMix 70 \n \n\n\n\n114 \n\nâ–º Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. \nâ–º Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \nâ–º Needles and NovoMix 70 FlexPen must not be shared. \nâ–º NovoMix 70 FlexPen is only suitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you \n\nneed to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: \nâ–º If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands.  \nâ–º If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level. \nâ–º If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. \nâ–º If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing \n\nhereof. \n \nOther medicines and NovoMix 70 \n \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has \nto change. Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes \nâ€¢ Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) \nâ€¢ Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) \nâ€¢ Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure) \nâ€¢ Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) \nâ€¢ Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) \nâ€¢ Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \nâ€¢ Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \nâ€¢ Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) \nâ€¢ Glucocorticoids (such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ used to treat inflammation) \nâ€¢ Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) \nâ€¢ Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat \n\nasthma) \nâ€¢ Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced \n\ninfluence on the bodyâ€™s metabolic processes) \nâ€¢ Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually \noccurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may \neither increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nBeta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning \nsymptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nPioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) \nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were \ntreated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor \nas soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid \nincrease in weight or localised swelling (oedema).  \n \nIf you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \nDrinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 70 \n \nâ–º If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise \n\nor fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nâ–º If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. There is limited clinical experience with insulin aspart in \npregnancy. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. \nCareful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the \nhealth of your baby.  \n\nâ–º There are no restrictions on treatment with NovoMix 70 during breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nâ–º Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: \nâ€¢ If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. \nâ€¢ If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore \nalso your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or \nothers. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients in NovoMix 70 \n \nNovoMix 70 contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. NovoMix 70 is essentially \nâ€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use NovoMix 70 \n \nDose and when to take your insulin \n \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. \nNovoMix 70 is generally taken immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of \nthe injection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, NovoMix 70 can be given soon after a meal. \nSee How and where to inject, below for information.  \n \nWhen NovoMix 70 is used in combination with metformin the dose should be adjusted. \n \nDo not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one \ntype or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nNo clinical studies with NovoMix 70 have been carried out in children and adolescents under the age \nof 18 years. \n \nUse in special patient groups \n \nIf you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check \n\n\n\n116 \n\nyour blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. \n \nHow and where to inject \n \nNovoMix 70 is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Never inject your insulin directly into a \nvein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). NovoMix 70 FlexPen is only suitable for injecting \nunder the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWith each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may \nreduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best \nplaces to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of \nyour thighs or upper arms. The insulin will work more quickly if you inject around the waist. You \nshould always measure your blood sugar regularly. \n \nHow to handle NovoMix 70 FlexPen \n \nNovoMix 70 FlexPen is a pre-filled, colour-coded, disposable pen containing a mixture of rapid-acting \nand intermediate-acting insulin aspart in the ratio 70/30. \n \nRead carefully the instructions for use included in this package leaflet. You must use the pen as \ndescribed in the Instructions for use. \n \nAlways ensure you use the correct pen before you inject your insulin. \n \nIf you take more insulin than you should  \n \nIf you take too much insulin, your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of \nserious and very common side effects in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin \n \nIf you forget to take your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects \nfrom diabetes in section 4. \n \nIf you stop taking your insulin \n \nDo not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be \ndone. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) \nEffects from diabetes in section 4.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \na) Summary of serious and very common side effects  \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in \n10 people. \n \nLow blood sugar may occur if you: \nâ€¢ Inject too much insulin. \nâ€¢ Eat too little or miss a meal. \nâ€¢ Exercise more than usual. \nâ€¢ Drink alcohol (see Drinking alcohol and taking NovoMix 70 in section 2). \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \nSigns of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling \nvery hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness \nor tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. \n \nSevere low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not \ntreated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death.

If you take the wrong \ntype of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. \n \nEvery time you use a new pen \nLet the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. \nPull off the pen cap.  \n \n A \n\n \n \nB \n \nBefore your first injection with a new FlexPen, you must resuspend the insulin: \nRoll the pen between your palms 10 times â€“ it is important that the pen is kept horizontal (level with \nthe ground).  \n \n\n\n\n121 \n\n B \n\n \n \nC \nThen move the pen up and down 10 times between the two positions as shown, so the glass ball \nmoves from one end of the cartridge to the other.  \n \nRepeat rolling and moving the pen until the liquid does appear uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous.  \n \nFor every following injection  \nMove the pen up and down between the two positions at least 10 times until the liquid does appear \nuniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. If the moving procedure alone is not enough to give a uniformly \nwhite, cloudy and aqueous liquid, repeat the rolling and moving procedures (see B and C) until the \nliquid does appear uniformly white, cloudy and aqueous. \n \nâ–º Always make sure that you have resuspended the insulin prior to each injection. This reduces \n\nthe risk of too high or too low blood sugar level. After you have resuspended the insulin, \ncomplete all the following steps of injection without delay. \n\n \n C \n\n \n \n\n Always check there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to allow resuspension. If \nthere are less than 12 units left, use a new FlexPen. 12 units are marked on the residual scale. \nSee the big picture on top of this instruction. \n\n \n Do not use the pen if the resuspended insulin does not look uniformly white, cloudy and \n\naqueous. \n \nAttaching a needle \n \nD \nTake a new needle and tear off the paper tab.  \n \nScrew the needle straight and tightly onto your FlexPen. \n \n D \n\n \n \nE \nPull off the big outer needle cap and keep it for later.  \n \n E \n\n \n \n\n\n\n122 \n\nF \nPull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. \nNever try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the needle. \n \n F \n\n \n \n\n Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, \nleakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing.  \n\n \n Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use. \n\n \nChecking the insulin flow \n \nPrior to each injection, small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To \navoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: \n \nG \nTurn the dose selector to select 2 units. \n \n G \n\n2 units \nselected \n\n \n \nH \nHold your FlexPen with the needle pointing upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a \nfew times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. \n \n H \n\n \n \nI \nKeeping the needle upwards, press the push-button all the way in. The dose selector returns to 0. \n \nA drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no \nmore than 6 times. \n \nIf a drop of insulin still does not appear, the pen is defective, and you must use a new one. \n \n I \n\n \n \n\n\n\n123 \n\n Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure that \nthe insulin flows. If no drop appears you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose \nselector may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. \n\n \n Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little \n\ninsulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. \n \nSelecting your dose \n \nCheck that the dose selector is set at 0. \n \nJ \nTurn the dose selector to select the number of units you need to inject. \n \nThe dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the \ncorrect dose lines up with the pointer. When turning the dose selector, be careful not to push the push-\nbutton as insulin will come out. \n \nYou cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge. \n \n J \n\n5 units \nselected \n\n24 units \nselected \n\n \n \n\n Always use the dose selector and the pointer to see how many units you have selected before \ninjecting the insulin. \n\n \n Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may \n\nget too high or too low. Do not use the residual scale, it only shows approximately how much \ninsulin is left in your pen. \n\n \nMaking the injection \n \nInsert the needle into your skin. Use the injection technique shown by your doctor or nurse. \n \nK \nInject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until 0 lines up with the pointer. Be careful \nonly to push the push-button when injecting. \n \nTurning the dose selector will not inject insulin. \n \n K \n\n \n \n\n\n\n124 \n\nL \nâ–º Keep the push-button fully depressed and let the needle remain under the skin for at least \n\n6 seconds. This will make sure you get the full dose. \n \nâ–º Withdraw the needle from the skin, then release the pressure on the push-button. \n \nâ–º Always make sure that the dose selector returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose selector stops \n\nbefore it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too high blood \nsugar level. \n\n \n L \n\n \n \nM \nLead the needle into the big outer needle cap without touching it. When the needle is covered, \ncarefully push the big outer needle cap completely on and then unscrew the needle.  \n \nDispose of it carefully and put the pen cap back on your FlexPen. \n \n M \n\n \n \n\n Always remove the needle after each injection and store your FlexPen without the needle \nattached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles \nand inaccurate dosing. \n\n \nFurther important information \n \n\n Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles to reduce the risk of needle sticks \nand cross-infection. \n\n \n Dispose of the used FlexPen carefully without the needle attached. \n\n \n Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. \n\n \n Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. \n\n \n Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children. \n\n \n\n\n\tANNEX ISUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
