NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPixuvri 29 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial contains pixantrone dimaleate equivalent to 29 mg pixantrone  \n \nAfter reconstitution, each ml of concentrate contains pixantrone dimaleate equivalent to 5.8 mg \npixantrone. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nOne vial contains 39 mg sodium. \nUpon reconstitution and dilution, this medicinal product contains approximately 1g (43 mmol) sodium \nper dose, equivalent to 50% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an \nadult. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \nDark blue lyophilised powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPixuvri is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply relapsed or \nrefractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin B-cell Lymphomas (NHL). The benefit of pixantrone treatment has \nnot been established in patients when used as fifth line or greater chemotherapy in patients who are \nrefractory to last therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPixuvri must be administered by physicians who are familiar with the use of antineoplastic agents and \nhave the facilities for regular monitoring of clinical, haematological, and biochemical parameters during \nand after treatment (see section 6.6). \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 50 mg/m2 of pixantrone on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle for up to \n6 cycles.  \nPlease note: \nIn the EU recommended dose refers to the base of the active substance (pixantrone). Calculation of the \nindividual dose to be administered to a patient must be based on the strength of the reconstituted \nsolution that contains 5.8mg/ml pixantrone and the dose recommendation of 50 mg/m2. In some trials \nand publications, the recommended dose is based on the salt form (pixantrone dimaleate) \nHowever, the dose has to be adjusted before the start of each cycle based on nadir haematologic counts \nor maximum toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. The amount of Pixuvri in milligrams that is to \nbe administered to a patient should be determined on the basis of the patient’s body surface area (BSA). \nThe BSA should be determined using the institutional standard for BSA calculation and should use a \nweight measured on day 1 of every cycle. \n \nSome caution is advised in obese patients as data on BSA- based dosing is very limited for this group. \n \nDose modification guidelines  \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n \n\nDose modification and the timing of subsequent doses should be determined by clinical judgement \ndepending on the degree and duration of myelosuppression. For subsequent courses, the prior dose can \nusually be repeated if white blood cell and platelet counts have returned to acceptable levels. \n \nIf on day 1 of any cycle the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is < 1.0 x 109/l or platelet count is \n< 75 x 109/l it is recommended to delay treatment until ANC recovers to ≥ 1.0 x 109/l and platelet count \nto ≥ 75 x 109/l. \n \nTable 1 and Table 2 are recommended as guides to dosage adjustments for days 8 and 15 of the 28- day \ncycles. \n \n\nTable 1 \nDose modifications for hematologic toxicity on days 8 and 15 of any cycle \n\nGrade Platelet count ANC count Dose modification \n\n1-2 LLN* – 50 x 109/l LLN – 1.0 x 109/l No change in dose or schedule. \n\n3 < 50 – 25 x 109/l < 1.0 – 0.5 x 109/l Delay treatment until recovery to platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/l and ANC** ≥ 1.0 x 109/l. \n\n4 < 25 x 109/l < 0.5 x 109/l \nDelay treatment until recovery to platelet count \n≥ 50 x 109/l and ANC** ≥ 1.0 x 109/l. \nReduce the dose by 20%.\n\n* LLN: Lower Limit of the Normal range \n** ANC: Absolute Neutrophil Count \n \n \n\nTable 2 \nTreatment modifications for non-hematologic toxicities \n\nToxicity Modification  \nAny grade 3 or 4 drug-related non cardiac \ntoxicity other than nausea or vomiting  \n\nDelay treatment until recovery to grade 1. \nReduce the dose by 20%.\n\nAny grade 3 or 4 NYHA* cardiovascular \ntoxicity or persistent LVEF** decline  \n\nDelay treatment and monitor until \nrecovery.Consider discontinuation for persistent \ndecline in LVEF** of ≥ 15% of baseline value. \n\n* NYHA: New York Heart Association \n** LVEF: Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction\n \nSpecial populations \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Pixuvri in children aged < 18 years has not yet been established. No data are \navailable.  \n \nElderly \nNo specific dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of Pixuvri has not been established in patients with impaired renal function. \nPatients with serum creatinine > 2 x Upper Limit of the Normal range (ULN) were excluded from the \nrandomised studies. Thus, Pixuvri should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. \n \nPatients with impaired hepatic function \nThe safety and efficacy of Pixuvri in patients with impaired hepatic function has not been established. \nPixuvri should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver impairment. Pixuvri is not \nrecommended for use in patients with severe excretory hepatic impairment, (see section 4.3). \n \nPatients with poor performance status \nThere is currently no information on the safety and efficacy of patients with poor performance status \n(ECOG > 2). Caution should be exercised when treating such patients. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n \nMethod of administration \n \nPixuvri is for intravenous use only. The safety of intrathecal use has not been established. \n \nPixuvri is intended for administration as a slow intravenous infusion using an in-line filter (over a \nminimum of 60 minutes) only after reconstitution with 5 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution \nfor injection and after further dilution with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to a \nfinal volume of 250 ml. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to pixantrone dimaleate, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n- Immunisation with live virus vaccines \n- Profound bone marrow suppression \n- Severe abnormal hepatic function. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAll initial treatment with Pixuvri should be preceded by a careful baseline assessment of blood counts, \nserum levels of total bilirubin, serum levels of total creatinine, and cardiac function as measured by left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). \n \nMyelosuppression \nSevere myelosuppression may occur. Patients treated with Pixuvri are likely to experience \nmyelosuppression (neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia) with the \npredominant manifestation being neutropenia. With the recommended dose and schedule, neutropenia is \nusually transient, reaching its nadir on days 15-22 following administration on days 1, 8, and 15 with \nrecovery usually occurring by day 28.  \n \nCareful monitoring of blood counts is required, including leukocyte, red blood cells, platelet, and \nabsolute neutrophil counts. Recombinant hematopoietic growth factors may be used according to \ninstitutional or European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines. The dose modifications \nshould be considered (see section 4.2). \n \nCardiotoxicity \nChanges in cardiac function including decreased LVEF or fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) may \noccur during or after treatment with Pixuvri.  \n \nActive or dormant cardiovascular disease, prior therapy with anthracyclines or anthracenediones, prior \nor concurrent radiotherapy to the mediastinal area, or concurrent use of other cardiotoxic medicinal \nproducts may increase the risk of cardiac toxicity. Cardiac toxicity with Pixuvri may occur whether or \nnot cardiac risk factors are present. \n \nPatients with cardiac disease or risk factors such as a baseline LVEF value of < 45% by multigated \nradionuclide (MUGA) scan, clinically significant cardiovascular abnormalities (equal to New York \nHeart Association [NYHA] grade 3 or 4), myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, severe \narrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled angina, or prior cumulative doses of doxorubicin or \nequivalent exceeding 450 mg/m2 should receive careful risk versus benefit consideration before \nreceiving treatment with Pixuvri. \n \nCardiac function should be monitored before initiation and during the treatment with Pixuvri . If cardiac \ntoxicity is demonstrated during treatment, the risk versus benefit of continued therapy with Pixuvri must \nbe evaluated. \n \nSecondary malignancy \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nThe development of haematological malignancies such as secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or \nmyelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a recognised risk associated with anthracycline treatment and other \ntopoisomerase II inhibitors. The occurrence of secondary cancers, including AML and MDS, may occur \nduring or after treatment with Pixuvri. \n \nInfection \nInfections, including pneumonia, cellulitis, bronchitis, and sepsis have been reported during clinical \ntrials (see section 4.8). Infections have been associated with hospitalisation, septic shock, and death. \nPatients with neutropenia are more susceptible to infections, although, in the clinical studies there was \nno increased incidence of atypical, difficult-to-treat infections, such as systemic mycotic infections or \ninfections with opportunistic organisms such as Pneumocystis jiroveci. \n \nPixuvri should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection or in patients with a \nhistory of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose \nthem to serious infection.  \n \nTumour lysis syndrome \nPixantrone may induce hyperuricaemia as a consequence of the extensive purine catabolism that \naccompanies drug-induced rapid lysis of neoplastic cells (tumour lysis syndrome) and can lead to \nelectrolyte imbalances, which can result in kidney damage. Blood uric acid levels, potassium, calcium \nphosphate, and creatinine should be evaluated after treatment in patients at high risk for tumour lysis \n(elevated LDH, high tumour volume, high baseline uric acid or serum phosphate levels). Hydration, \nurine alkalinisation, and prophylaxis with allopurinol or other agents to prevent hyperuricaemia may \nminimise potential complications of tumour lysis syndrome. \n \nImmunisation \nImmunisation may be ineffective when given during Pixuvri therapy. Immunisation with live virus \nvaccines is contraindicated due to the immunosuppression associated with Pixuvri therapy (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nExtravasation  \nIf extravasation occurs the administration should be stopped immediately and restarted in another vein. \nThe non-vesicant properties of Pixuvri minimise the risk of local reaction following extravasation.  \n \nPrevention of photosensitivity reactions \nPhotosensitivity is a potential risk based on in vitro and in vivo non-clinical data. One case of \nphotosensitivity reaction has been reported in the clinical trial program considered as non-serious and \nwith outcome recovered. As a precaution, patients should be advised to follow sun protection strategies, \nincluding wearing sun protective clothing and using sunscreen. Since most medicinal product-induced \nphotosensitivity reactions are caused by wavelengths within the UV-A range, sunscreen that strongly \nabsorbs UV-A is recommended. \n \nPatients on a sodium restricted diet \nThis medicinal product contains approximately 1000 mg (43 mmol) sodium per dose after dilution. To \nbe taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo drug interactions have been reported in human subjects and no drug-drug interaction studies in \nhumans have been performed. \n \nIn vitro inhibition studies \nIn vitro studies with the most common human cytochrome P450 isoforms (including CYP1A2, 2B6, \n2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4) have shown a possible mixed-type inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 \nthat may be of clinical relevance. No other significant clinically relevant interactions with CYPP450s \nwere observed.  \n \nTheophylline: when co-administering the narrow-therapeutic index medicinal product theophylline, \nwhich is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2, there is a theoretical concern that this substrate may \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nincrease in concentration resulting in theophylline toxicity. Theophylline levels should be carefully \nmonitored in the weeks immediately following initiation of Pixuvri concurrent therapy. \n \nWarfarin is partially metabolised by CYP1A2, therefore, a theoretical concern exists with regard to \nco-administration of this medicinal product and the effect inhibition of its metabolism might have on its \nintended action. Coagulation parameters, specifically international normalised ratio (INR), should be \nmonitored in the days immediately following the initiation of Pixuvri concurrent therapy. \n \nAmitriptyline, haloperidol, clozapine, ondansetron and propranolol are metabolised by CYP1A2, and \ntherefore, a theoretical concern exists that co-administration of Pixuvri may increase blood levels of this \nmedicinal product. \n \nAlthough a risk to inhibition of pixantrone towards CYP2C8 could not be ascertained, caution should be \nobserved when co-administering substances that are primarily metabolised via CYP2C8, such as \nrepaglinide, rosiglitazone, or paclitaxel e.g. by careful monitoring for side effects. \n \nBased on in vitro studies, pixantrone was found to be a substrate for the membrane transport proteins \nP-gp/BRCP and OCT1 and agents which inhibit these transporters have the potential to decrease hepatic \nuptake and excretion efficiency of pixantrone. Blood counts should be closely monitored when \nco-administered with agents which inhibit such transporters such as cyclosporine A or tacrolimus, \ncommonly used to control chronic graft-versus-host disease, and the anti-HIV agents ritonavir, \nsaquinavir, or nelfinavir. \n \nIn addition, caution should be taken when pixantrone is continuously co-administered with efflux \ntransport inducers such as rifampicin, carbamazepin and glucocorticoids, as pixantrone excretion might \nbe increased with a consequent decrease of systemic exposure. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential and their partners should be advised to avoid pregnancies. \n \nWomen and men must use effective contraception during and up to 6 months after treatment. \n \nPregnancy  \nThere are no data from the use of pixantrone in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \nPixuvri is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether Pixuvri/metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \n \nA risk to the newborn/infants cannot be excluded. \n \nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Pixuvri. \n \nFertility \nAfter repeated administrations of Pixuvri at doses as low as 0,1 mg/kg/day, a dose-dependent testicular \natrophy was detected in the dogs. This effect has not been evaluated in humans. As with other agents in \nthe general class of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damaging agents, Pixuvri may be associated with \nfertility impairment. Whilst the effect on fertility has not been ascertained, a precaution will be to advise \nmale patients to use contraceptive methods (preferably barrier) during treatment and for a period of \n6 months post-treatment to allow new sperm to mature. To avoid the risk of long term infertility, sperm \nbanking should be considered. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nIt is not known whether Pixuvri has an effect on the ability to drive a car or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common toxicity is bone marrow suppression, particularly of the neutrophil lineage. Although \nthe incidence of severe marrow suppression with clinical consequences is relatively low, patients have \nbeen treated with Pixuvri were closely monitored by frequent blood counts, particularly for neutropenia. \nThe incidence of severe infections was low and opportunistic infections associated with \nimmunocompromise were not seen. Although the occurrence of cardiac toxicity manifested by CHF \nappears to be lower than that would be expected with related medicinal products such as anthracyclines, \nmonitoring of LVEF either by MUGA scans or ECHO is recommended to assess subclinical \ncardiotoxicity. Experience with pixantrone is limited to patients with LVEF ≥ 45% with most patients \nhaving values ≥ 50%. Experience administering Pixuvri to patients with more significant cardiac \ncompromise is limited and should only be undertaken in the context of a clinical trial. Other toxicities \nsuch as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea were generally infrequent, mild, reversible, manageable, and \nexpected in patients treated with cytotoxic agents. Effects on hepatic or renal function were minimal. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse drug reactions (ADR) reported with Pixuvri are from final data from all completed single agent \nstudies (n=197).

Importantly, growth factor support was \nnot routinely required and transfusions with red blood cells and platelets were uncommon. (See \nsection 4.4) \n \nCardiac toxicity \nIn the study PIX 301, decreased ejection fraction occurred in 13 patients (19.1%) in the Pixuvri group. \nIn 11 Pixuvri-treated patients, these events were grade 1-2 and in 2 patients they were grade 3; these \nevents were transient and not Pixuvri dose related. Cardiac failure events (MedDRA terms cardiac \nfailure, cardiac failure acute and cardiac failure congestive) occurred in 6 patients (8.8%) treated with \nPixuvri (2 patients with grade 1-2, 1 patient with grade 3, and 3 patients, 2 considered as unrelated, with \ngrade 5). Three Pixuvri patients (4.4%) had tachycardia, arrhythmia, sinus tachycardia, supraventricular \ntachycardia or bradycardia. Most patients had received prior doxorubicin or equivalent at dose of up to \n450 mg/m². \nA baseline cardiac evaluation with a MUGA scan or an ECHO is recommended, especially in patients \nwith risk factors for increased cardiac toxicity. Repeated MUGA scan or ECHO determinations of \nLVEF should be considered in patients with risk factors such as high cumulative exposure to prior \nanthracyclines or significant pre-existing cardiac disease. (See section 4.4) \n \nOther common toxicities \nSkin discolouration and chromaturia are known related effects of Pixuvri administration due to the \ncolour of the compound (blue). The skin discolouration generally disappears over a few days to weeks \nas the medicinal product is cleared. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national system listed in \nAppendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the clinical trial program, there has been one report of overdose with Pixuvri with no reported \nconcomitant adverse events. \n \nSingle doses of pixantrone up to 158 mg/m2 have been given in dose-escalation clinical trials without \nevidence of dose-related toxicity. \n \nIf overdose occurs, supportive management is recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, anthracyclines, and related substances.  \nATC code: L01DB11 \n \nMechanism of action \nThe active substance of Pixuvri is pixantrone , a cytotoxic aza-anthracenedione. \n \nUnlike approved anthracyclines (doxorubicin and others) and anthracenediones (mitoxantrone), \npixantrone is only a weak inhibitor of topoisomerase II. Moreover, unlike anthracyclines or \nanthracenediones, pixantrone directly alkylates DNA forming stable DNA adducts and cross-strand \nbreaks. Furthermore, because it incorporates a nitrogen heteroatom into the ring structure and does not \nhave ketone groups, pixantrone has less potential for generating reactive oxygen species, binding iron, \nand forming alcohol metabolites that are felt to cause the cardiac toxicity of anthracyclines. Due to this \nunique structure, pixantrone produced minimal cardiotoxicity in animal models compared with \ndoxorubicin or mitoxantrone. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\nA comprehensive retrospective population PK/PD analysis of Phase 1 trials and combination regimens \n(Phase 1/2) demonstrated that progression-free survival and Grade 2-3 neutropenia were related to \nPixuvri exposure. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe safety and efficacy of Pixuvri as single-agent therapy were evaluated in a multicentre, randomised, \nactive controlled trial in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL after receiving at least two \nprior therapies. This study randomised 140 patients (1:1) to treatment with either Pixuvri or to an \ninvestigator chosen single-agent chemotherapy on the comparator arm. Patient demographics and \nbaseline disease characteristics were well balanced between the treatment groups, and no statistically \nsignificant differences were noted. For the study overall, patient median age was 59, 61% were male, \n64% were Caucasian, 76% had Ann Arbor stage III/IV disease at baseline, 74% had a baseline \nInternational Prognostic Index (IPI) score ≥ 2, and 60% had received ≥ 3 prior chemotherapies. Mantle \ncell lymphoma patients were not included in the pivotal study. Patients in PIX 301 were required to \nhave been sensitive to prior anthracycline therapy (confirmed or unconfirmed CR or PR). \n \nThere is limited data in patients previously treated with rituximab (38 patients in the Pixuvri arm and \n39 patients in the comparator arm). \nTumour response was assessed by a blinded independent central review panel according to the \ninternational workshop to standardise response criteria for NHL. Patients treated with Pixuvri showed a \nsignificantly higher rate of complete responses and unconfirmed complete responses (CR/CRu), and a \nhigher objective response rate (ORR), compared to the comparator group (see Table 4). \n \n \n\nTable 4 \nSummary of response per independent assessment panel (ITT population) \n\n \nEnd-of-Treatment End-of-Study \nPixuvri \n(n=70) \n\nComparator \n(n=70) P-value \n\nPixuvri \n(n=70) \n\nComparator \n(n=70) P-value \n\nCR/CRu 14 (20.0%) 4 (5.7%) 0.021 17 (24.3%) 5 (7.1%) 0.009 \n\nCR 8 (11.4%) 0 (0%) \n \n\n11 (15.7%) 0 (0.0%) \n \n\nCRu 6 (8.6%) 4 (5.7%) 6 (8.6%) 5 (7.1%) \nORR (CR, Cru, and \nPR) 26 (37.1%) 10 (14.3%) 0.003 28 (40.0%) 10 (14.3%) 0.001 \n\nThe Fisher exact test was used to compare proportions in the Pixuvri and comparator chemotherapeutic \ngroups. \n \nPatients treated with Pixuvri demonstrated 40% improvement in progression-free-survival compared to \npatients treated with comparator agents with 2.7 months longer median PFS ( hazard ratio (HR)=0.60, \nlogrank p=0.005) (see Figure 1 below). \n \nThe median overall survival for patients treated with Pixuvri was 2.6 months longer compared to \npatients treated with comparator (HR=0.79, logrank p=0.25) (see Figure 2 below). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nFigure 1 \nPIX301 Progression-free survival - end of study \n\nPr\nog\n\nre\nss\n\nio\nn \n\nFr\nee\n\n S\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl P\nro\n\nba\nbi\n\nlit\ny \n\n \n\n \n Time from Randomization (Months) \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2 \nPIX 301 Overall survival–end of study \n\nO\nve\n\nra\nll \n\nSu\nrv\n\niv\nal\n\n P\nro\n\nba\nbi\n\nlit\ny \n\n \n\n \n\n \n Time from Randomization (Months) \n\n \n \nThe results in the rituximab pretreated patients still showed superior treatment benefit with Pixuvri over \nthe comparator for overall response rate (31.6% with Pixuvri versus 17.9% with the comparator) and \nmedian progression-free survival (3.3 months with Pixuvri versus 2.5 months with the comparator). \nHowever, the benefit of Pixuvri has not been established when used as fifth line or greater in patients \nrefractory to last therapy, and there is very limited data in this group of patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Pixuvri \nin all subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The pharmacokinetics of \nPixuvri was dose-independent in the 3 mg/m2 to105 mg/m2 dose range and no substantial differences \nwere observed when the medicinal product was given as a single agent or in combination studies. \nAverage exposures as single agent accounted for: \n \n\nPixuvri Dose (mg/m2) \n \n\nNumber of patients\n \n\nAUC (0-24h) (ng.hr/ml ) \n\n33 \n \n\n3 \n \n\n982  115 \n\n49 \n \n\n6 \n \n\n1727  474 \n\n88 \n \n\n2\n \n\n3811\n \nFrom an analysis of population PK data, for a target recorded dose of 50 mg/m2 of pixantrone the \nmedian 28-day cycle exposure was 6320 ng.hr/ml (90% CI, 5990-6800 ng.hr/ml), for 3 doses / 4 week \ncycle. \n \nDistribution \nPixuvri has a large volume of distribution of 25.8 l and is approximately 50% bound to plasma proteins. \n \nBiotransformation  \nAcetylated metabolites are the major biotransformation products of pixantrone. However, in vitro, \nconversion of pixantrone into the acetylated metabolites by either NAT1 or NAT2 was very limited. In \nhuman urine, the compound was mainly excreted unchanged, and very small amounts of phase I and \nphase II acetylated metabolites were found. Therefore, metabolism does not appear to be an important \nelimination pathway for pixantrone. Acetylated metabolites were pharmacologically inactive and \nmetabolically stable. \n \nElimination \nPixantrone has a moderate to high total plasma clearance of 72.7 l/hr and a low renal excretion \naccounting for less than 10% of the administered dose in 0-24 hours. The terminal half-life ranged from \n14.5 to 44.8 hr with a mean of 23.3  8.0 (n=14, CV=34%) and a median of 21.2 hr. Due to the limited \ncontribution of renal clearance, plasma clearance is mainly non-renal. Pixuvri may be metabolised in the \nliver and/or excreted in the bile. As metabolism appears to be limited, biliary excretion of unchanged \npixantrone may be the major elimination pathway. Hepatic clearance approximates the hepatic plasma \nflow, suggesting a high hepatic extraction ratio and, therefore, efficient parent active substance \nelimination. Hepatic uptake of pixantrone is possibly mediated by OCT1 active transporters and biliary \nexcretion by P-gp and BCRP. \n \nPixantrone had only a weak or no capability to inhibit P-gp, BCRP, and BSEP transport mechanism in \nvitro.  \n \nPixantrone did inhibit OCT1-mediated metformin transport in vitro, but is not expected to inhibit OTC1 \nin vivo at clinically relevant concentrations. \n \nPixantrone was a poor inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 uptake transporters in vitro. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nPharmacokinetics of pixantrone proved to be linear in a broad range of doses, from 3 \nmg/m2 to 105 mg/m2. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \nA relationship between plasma exposure to pixantrone and neutrophil count has been observed.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n \n\nAfter a single intravenous administration of Pixuvri at 29 mg/kg and 38 mg/kg, immediate deaths were \nseen in mice (114 mg/m2, LD10). Decreases in white and red blood cells and alterations in bone \nmarrow, spleen, kidney, and testes were observed. Similar findings were reported in rats, and in dogs at \n116 mg/m2. In dogs, tachycardia and electrocardiography (ECG) changes occurred immediately after \ntreatment. \n \nIn repeated-dose studies in mice, rats, and dogs, the main findings were myelotoxicity, nephrotoxicity \n(except dogs), and testicular damage. \n \nIn dogs, Pixuvri given at 0.5 to 0.9 mg/kg for six cycles did not cause mortality or severe clinical signs, \nincluding ECG or body weight changes. Males were more sensitive to treatment, with respect to \nreduction in white blood cells and platelet count (reversible) and lymphoid depletion (spleen and \nthymus), as well as the marked toxicity to reproductive organs, as expected from a cytotoxic agent. \nExcept for a transient increase in exposure in females after the third cycle, there were no marked \ndifferences in pharmacokinetic parameters. Males showed, however, slightly higher exposure than \nfemales. \n \nIn dogs, the heart was not affected by treatment, as no ECG changes were seen at different treatment \ntimes, nor heart changes were detected at gross- and histopathology. Kidney function and histology \nwere similarly not affected both in 4- and 26-week studies. \n \nThe cardiotoxic potential of Pixuvri compared with equiactive doses of doxorubicin and mitoxantrone in \ntreatment-naïve and doxorubicin-pre-treated mice was evaluated. Pixantrone dimaleate up to 27 mg/kg \ngiven twice a week for 4 weeks did not induce any cardiotoxic effects, while mitoxantrone, as expected, \nwas cardiotoxic at all tested doses (0.6, 1.6, and 1.5 mg/kg). Slight nephropathy was induced by Pixuvri. \nMinimal cardiotoxicity of Pixuvri was also demonstrated with repeat treatment cycles at the same doses.  \n \nGenotoxicity studies confirmed the potential for clastogenic effects in mammalian cells in vitro and in \nvivo. Pixuvri was mutagenic in the Ames test, increased the number of chromosomal aberrations in \nhuman lymphocytes, and increased the frequency of micronuclei in vivo.  \n \nPixuvri caused maternal and foetal toxicity in rats and rabbits, even at a dose as low as 1.8 mg/kg given \non days 9-11 of pregnancy, higher doses resulting in abortions and total embryo resorption. \nEmbryotoxicity was characterised by reduced mean foetal weight, foetal malformations and incomplete \nor delayed foetal ossification. No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the \ncarcinogenic potential of Pixuvri. No local tolerance study was conducted. \n \nPixuvri has been shown to cause phototoxic effects on 3T3 cells in vitro. \n \nIn a colony-forming units study in mice, the myelotoxicity of Pixuvri and mitoxantrone administered at \ntheir LD10 (pixantrone dimaleate 38 mg/kg and mitoxantrone 6.1 mg/kg) was similar. \n \n \n6.

What Pixuvri is and what it is used for  \n \nPixuvri belongs to a pharmacotherapeutic group of medicines known as ‘antineoplastic agents’. These \nare used to treat cancer.  \n \nPixuvri is used for the treatment of adult patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive \nNon-Hodgkin Lymphomas. Pixuvri kills cancer cells by binding to DNA, resulting in cell death. It is \nused for patients whose cancer does not respond or has returned after they have received other \nchemotherapy treatments. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Pixuvri \n \nDo not use Pixuvri  \n- if you are allergic to pixantrone dimaleate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n- if you have recently received a vaccine. \n- if you have been told that you have persistent, long-term low numbers of red blood cells, white \n\nblood cells, and platelets. \n- if you have very severe liver problems. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using Pixuvri: \n \n- if you have been told that your white blood cell count is very low. \n- if you have heart disease or uncontrolled high blood pressure, especially if you have ever been \n\ntold you had heart failure or if you have had a heart attack within the last six months. \n- if you have an infection. \n- if you have ever been treated for cancer.  \n- if you follow a specific sodium restricted diet. \n- if you are taking other medicines which could interact with Pixuvri (see ‘Taking other \n\nmedicines’ below). \n \nSkin sensitivity to sunlight \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nDuring treatment with pixantrone, you should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial \nsunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment).

Avoid contact with eyes and skin. Use gloves, masks, and protective eyewear when \nhandling and during decontamination procedures. If Pixuvri (lyophilised powder or reconstituted \nliquid solution) contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and flush the membranes thoroughly \nwith water.  \n \nReconstitution/preparation for intravenous administration \nEach single-use vial of Pixuvri contains pixantrone dimaleate equivalent to 29 mg pixantrone. After \nreconstitution with 5 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, each ml of \nconcentrate contains pixantrone dimaleate equivalent to 5.8 mg pixantrone. \n \nUsing sterile procedures, reconstitute each 29 mg vial with 5 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \nsolution for injection. The powder should completely dissolve in 60 seconds with agitation. This \nyields a dark blue solution with a pixantrone concentration of 5.8 mg/ml.  \n \nUsing sterile procedures, withdraw the volume needed for the required dose (based on 5.8 mg/ml \nconcentration) and further dilute with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to a final \nvolume of 250 ml. \n \nCompatibility with other diluents has not been determined. After transferring, thoroughly mix the \ncontents of the infusion bag. The mixture should be a dark blue solution. \nPolyethersulfone 0.2 µm pore size in-line filters should be used during administration of the diluted \nPixuvri solution. \n \nIn-use storage conditions \nPixuvri does not contain anything to prevent the growth of bacteria and it is therefore recommended \nthat it be used immediately after reconstitution. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and \nconditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and should not be longer than 24 hours at \n2C to 8C. \n \nThe reconstituted and diluted solution is stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature (15C to 25C) \nand daylight exposure in standard polyethylene (PE) infusion bags.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nSpecial precautions for disposal and handling \nPixuvri is a cytotoxic agent. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in \naccordance with local requirements. \n \nDevices and surfaces accidentally contaminated with Pixuvri must be treated with a solution of \nsodium hypochlorite (100 µl of water and 20 µl of sodium hypochlorite [7 ± 2% of available chlorine] \nfor 0.58 mg of Pixuvri).  \n \nEquipment such as vials, needles and syringes used for Pixuvri administration should be handled as \ntoxic waste. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
