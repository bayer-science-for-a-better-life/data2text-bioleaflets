NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \nOsigraft 3.3 mg powder for suspension for implantation  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \nEach vial contains 3.3 mg of eptotermin alfa* \n \n*Produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology  \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \nPowder for suspension for implantation. \n \nWhite to off-white granular powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \nTreatment of non-union of tibia of at least 9 month duration, secondary to trauma, in skeletally mature \npatients, in cases where previous treatment with autograft has failed or use of autograft is unfeasible. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \nPosology \nOsigraft should be used by an appropriately qualified surgeon.  \n \nThe recommended dose is one single administration in adults. Depending on the size of the bone \ndefect, more than one 1 g vial of Osigraft may be required. The recommended maximum dose should \nnot exceed 2 vials since efficacy in the treatment on non-unions requiring higher doses has not been \nestablished. \n \nPaediatric population \nOsigraft is contraindicated in children and adolescents (less than 18 years old) and the skeletally \nimmature (see section 4.3). \n \nMethod of administration: \nIntraosseous use. \n \nThe reconstituted product is administered by direct surgical placement at the non-union site in contact \nwith the prepared bone surface. The surrounding soft tissues are then closed around the implant. \nExperience from controlled clinical trials is limited to stabilisation of the fracture by intramedullary \nnailing. \n \n1. Using sterile technique, remove the vial from its packaging. \n \n2. Lift the plastic flip-top and remove the crimp from the vial.   \n\nHandle the crimp with care. The edges of the crimp are sharp and may cut or damage gloves. \n \n3. Using your thumb, pry up the edge of the stopper. Once the vacuum is broken, remove the vial \n\nstopper while holding the vial upright to prevent loss of powder. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nDo not insert a needle through the stopper. Puncture of the stopper with a needle may result in \nparticles of stopper material contaminating the powder. \n\n \n4. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section \n\n6.6. \n \n5. Debride fibrous, necrotic or sclerotic tissue and appropriately decorticate bone fragments so \n\nthat the reconstituted Osigraft is in direct contact with bleeding bone and viable osseous \ntissue. \n\n \n6. Provide adequate haemostasis to ensure that the implanted material is not dislodged from the \n\nsurgical site. Irrigate as necessary prior to the implantation of Osigraft. Where practical, \nsurgical manipulations to the site should be completed prior to implantation of the product. \n\n \n7. Apply the reconstituted product to the prepared osseous site using a sterile instrument such as \n\na spatula or curette. The amount of Osigraft used should approximate the size of the bone \ndefect. \n\n \n8. Do not use suction or irrigation directly at the implant site as the particles of Osigraft may be \n\nremoved. Remove excess fluid if necessary by suctioning adjacent to the implant site or \ncarefully blotting the area with sterile sponge. \n\n \n9. Close soft tissues around the defect containing the product using suture material of choice. \n\nClosure is critical for containment of the implant in the area of the bone defect. \n \n10. After closure of the soft tissues around the bone defect, irrigate field if necessary to remove \n\nany of the product which may have become dislodged during soft tissue closure. \n \n11. Do not place a drain directly in the implant site. If required, place it subcutaneously. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \nOsigraft must not be used in patients who: \n \n have a known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to collagen;  \n \n have skeletal immaturity; \n \n have known autoimmune disease, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus \n\nerythematosus, scleroderma, Sjögren’s syndrome and dermatomyositis/polymyositis; \n \n have active infection at the site of non-union or active systemic infection; \n \n have inadequate skin coverage and vascularity of the non-union site; \n \n have vertebral fractures; \n \n have a non-union resulting from pathological fractures, metabolic bone disease or tumours; \n \n have any tumour in the vicinity of the non-union site; \n \n are receiving chemotherapy, radiation treatment or immunosuppression;  \n \nOsigraft is contraindicated in children and adolescents (less than 18 years old) and the skeletally \nimmature (see section 4.2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \nPrecaution for use \nOsigraft does not provide any biomechanical strength and should be used with internal or external \nfixation where initial mechanical stabilisation is required. However, external fixation may not provide \nsufficient immobilisation. Motion in the non-union site may disrupt the fracture healing process. \nExperience from controlled clinical trials is limited to stabilisation of tibial non-union site using \nconcomitant intramedullary nailing. Locking intramedullary rods were used in the majority of cases. \n \nUse of Osigraft does not guarantee repair, additional surgery may be required. \n \nImplanted material dislodged from the non-union site can cause ectopic ossification in the surrounding \ntissues with potential complications. Therefore, Osigraft may only be administered to the defect site \nunder adequate vision and with utmost care. Special care must be taken to prevent any leakage of \nOsigraft due to wound irrigation, defective closure of surrounding tissue or inadequate haemostasis. \n \nAntibodies \nAntibodies to OP-1 protein were detected in 66% of patients in the tibial non-union study following \nthe administration of eptotermin alfa. Analysis of these antibodies showed that 9% had neutralizing \ncapacity. No association with clinical outcome or adverse event could be observed in clinical studies. \nAn immune response to Osigraft should be considered and appropriate tests for the presence of \nantibodies in serum should be performed in cases where an immune-mediated undesirable effect is \nsuspected, including cases where the product is ineffective. \n \nRepeat Use \nRepeated use of the product cannot be recommended. Studies with anti-OP-1 antibodies demonstrated \nsome cross-reactivity with closely related BMP proteins BMP-5 and BMP-6. Anti-OP-1 antibodies \nhave the ability to neutralise the in vitro biological activity of at least BMP-6. Therefore, upon re-\nadministration of eptotermin alfa, a risk of developing autoimmunity towards the endogenous BMP \nproteins may exist. \n \nInteraction with other medicine \nThe use of Osigraft with a synthetic bone void filler may lead to a risk of increase in local \ninflammation, infection and occasional migration of the implanted materials and is therefore not \nrecommended (see section 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \nThe pivotal clinical trial supporting the approval of Osigraft did not include the use of synthetic bone \nvoid fillers. Post market surveillance data has signalled that the use of the product in combination with \na synthetic bone void filler may lead to an increase in local inflammation, infection and occasional \nmigration of the implanted materials and it is therefore not recommended. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \nWomen of child-bearing potential \nWomen of child-bearing potential should inform their surgeon of the possibility of pregnancy prior to \ntreatment with the medicine. \n \nContraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception up to at least 12 \nmonths after treatment.  \n \nPregnancy \nAnimal studies were conducted that cannot rule out effects of anti-OP-1 antibodies on embryo-foetal \ndevelopment (see section 5.3). Due to the unknown risks to the foetus associated with the potential \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\ndevelopment of neutralizing antibodies to OP-1 protein, Osigraft should not be used during pregnancy \nunless the potential benefit justifies the potential risks to the foetus (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nIn animal studies, excretion of IgG class anti-OP-1 antibodies into milk has been shown. As human \nIgG is secreted into human milk, and the potential for harm to the infant is unknown, women should \nnot breast-fed during Osigraft therapy (see section 5.3). Osigraft should be given to breast-feeding \nwomen only when the attending physician decides that the benefits outweigh the risks. It is \nrecommended that breast-feeding be discontinued following treatment. \n \nFertility \nThere is no evidence to suggest that eptotermin alfa alters fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \nThe following table of adverse reactions was compiled from those observed and recorded during \nclinical trials. A similar pattern of adverse reactions has been recorded from spontaneous reporting \nwith an incidence significantly less than that seen in the clinical trials. Some patients treated with this \nproduct were also reported to have experienced various undesirable effects associated with recent \northopaedic surgery. \n \nThe following categories are used to rank the adverse reactions by frequency of occurrence: very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000); and very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse reactions  \n\n Common \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n \n\nBone formation increased \n(Heterotopic ossification / Myositis ossificans) \n\nInvestigations Antibody test positive \n(Antibody formation) \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications Postoperative wound site erythema  \n(Erythema) \n\n Post procedural tenderness \n(Tenderness) \n\n Post procedural swelling  \n(Swelling) \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n\n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases, bone morphogenetic proteins, ATC \ncode: M05BC02  \n \nOsigraft is an osteoinductive and osteoconductive medicinal product. \n \nMechanism of action \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=M05\n\n\n6 \n\nEptotermin alfa, the active substance, initiates bone formation through the induction of cellular \ndifferentiation in mesenchymal cells, which are recruited to the implant site from bone marrow, \nperiosteum and muscle. Once bound at the cell surface, the active substance induces a cascade of \ncellular events leading to the formation of chondroblasts and osteoblasts, which play a key role in the \nbone formation process. The collagen matrix is insoluble and consists of particles with a size range of \n75-425µm. This provides an appropriate bioresorbable scaffold for the anchorage dependent cell \nproliferation and differentiation processes induced by the active substance. The cellular events induced \nby the active substance take place within the collagen matrix. The matrix is also osteoconductive and \nit allows bone in-growth into the defect area from the surrounding healthy bone. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe new bone formed is mechanically and radiographically comparable to normal bone. The new bone \nremodels naturally, cortices are formed and marrow elements are generated. However, use of Osigraft \ndoes not guarantee repair; additional surgery may be required. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe Tibial Nonunion pivotal trial compared Osigraft with autograft, with a primary efficacy endpoint \nat 9 months post-treatment. Clinical outcomes of pain and weight-bearing were comparable to the \nautograft (81% success in the Osigraft group, 77% success in the autograft group). The radiographic \nhealing results of the Osigraft treatment group were slightly inferior compared to the autograft control \ngroup (68% and 79% respectively). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \nThere are no data on the pharmacokinetics of the active substance in man. However, results from \nOsigraft implantation studies in animals demonstrate that the active substance eptotermin alfa is \nlargely unavailable systemically. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \nSingle dose and repeat dose studies in a range of animal models (rats, dogs and primates) were \nperformed. The results of these showed no unanticipated or systemic effects of toxicity during the \nobservation period and after administration. \n \nIn a 2 year subcutaneous implantation study in rats, heterotopic bone formation was observed, as \nexpected. Sarcoma was associated with the long-term presence of the heterotopic bone. This effect, \ntermed solid state carcinogenicity, frequently has been observed in rats where solid materials (plastics \nor metals) were implanted subcutaneously. \n \nHeterotopic ossification commonly occurs in humans following accidental or surgical trauma. \nHeterotopic ossification may also occur following use (see section 4.8). However, there is evidence to \nsuggest that heterotopic ossification is not linked to sarcoma in humans. \n \nThe effect of anti-OP-1 antibodies on the bone healing process was studied in dogs following two long \nbone defects treated with repeat implantations. The results of radiological and histological \nexaminations in this non-clinical study showed bone healing with the initial and repeat exposure in the \nsame animal. Antibodies to OP-1 and bovine bone collagen type 1 were found after both exposures; \nthe antibody peak concentration was higher after the second implantation. The antibody levels \ndeclined towards baseline during the follow-up period.   \n \nControlled studies of the effects of exposure to eptotermin alfa on pre and postnatal development were \nperformed in rabbit models. Eptotermin alfa in Freund’s adjuvant was first administered \nsubcutaneously with booster doses given after 14 and 28 days. Blood and milk samples were collected \nat regular intervals and analysed using a solid phase enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) test. \nDetectable levels of IgG and IgM antibodies to eptotermin alfa developed and were found in the serum \nof all exposed adult animals. Antibodies to eptotermin alfa were found in sera from pooled foetal and \numbilical cord blood at levels that correlated to that of the maternal blood. Antibodies were detectable \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nin adults and offspring during the gestation and lactation periods. Significantly high titers of IgG class \nanti-OP-1 antibodies were detected in milk throughout the whole post-natal phase study until the \nlactation day 28 (see section 4.6). \n \nA statistically significant increase in foetal malformations (misaligned sternabrae) was seen in litters \nof the OP-1 immunized group. In another study a difference in body weight gain was seen in the \nimmunized adult females between lactation days 14 to 21 when compared to the control animals.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effect not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor. \n \nIn this leaflet: \n1. What Osigraft is and what it is used for \n2. Before you use Osigraft \n3. How to use Osigraft \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store Osigraft \n6. Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT OSIGRAFT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\n \nOsigraft is a type of medicine known as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). This group of \nmedicines cause new bone to grow at the location where the surgeon has placed (implanted) it. \nOsigraft is implanted in adult patients with fractures of the tibia which have failed to heal for at least 9 \nmonth duration in cases where treatment with autograft (transplanted bone from your hip) has failed or \nshould not be used. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE OSIGRAFT \n\n \nDo not use Osigraft \n\n- if you are allergic to eptotermin alfa or collagen, the other ingredient of Osigraft (see section 6).  \n- if you are an adolescent and your skeleton is not yet fully formed (still growing). \n- if you are a child (below 18 years old) \n- if you have an autoimmune disease (disease arising from or directed against your own tissues), \n\nincluding rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, Sjögren’s syndrome \nand dermatomyositis/ polymyositis. \n\n- if you have active infection at the site of non-union (inflammation and drainage at the site of \ninjury) or active systemic infection. \n\n- if your doctor determines that you have inadequate skin coverage (at the fracture site) and \ninadequate blood supply at your site of surgery. \n\n- for vertebral (spine) fractures. \n- for treating non-union resulting from pathological (disease-related) fractures, metabolic bone \n\ndisease or tumours. \n- when there are any tumours in the area of the non-union site. \n- if you are receiving chemotherapy, radiation treatment or immunosuppression \n \nTake special care with Osigraft \n\nThe following are precautions for use of Osigraft to be discussed with your doctor. \n \nOsigraft stimulates the growth of new bone as part of the treatment of a fracture non-union and needs \nthe support of specialised surgical devices to stabilise the broken bone while it heals.  \n \nUse of Osigraft does not guarantee repair; additional surgery may be required. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\nSpecial care is taken during surgery to prevent Osigraft leaking into the surrounding tissue in order to \navoid the possibility of new bone growing outside the treated non-union location.  \n \nThere is a possibility that new antibodies can form in your body after treatment with Osigraft. \nAntibodies are special proteins produced by the human body as part of the healing process in various \ndiseases; one such illness is a virus infection. Antibodies often form as part of the body’s response to \ntreatment with some medicines one of these is Osigraft. These newly formed antibodies have not been \nfound to cause any harm to patients. You will be monitored by your doctor if there is any medical \nsuspicion that new antibodies have formed.  \n \nRepeated use of Osigraft is not recommended because clinical trials of multiple surgical treatments at \ndifferent times have not been undertaken in patients. Laboratory studies have shown that antibodies to \nthe eptotermin alfa component of this medicine could react with similar antibodies that the body \nmakes naturally. The long-term impact of these antibodies is not known. \n \n\nThe use of Osigraft with a synthetic bone void filler may lead to a risk of increase in local \ninflammation, infection and occasional migration of the implanted materials and is therefore not \nrecommended. \n \nUsing other medicines \n\nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nOsigraft should not be used during pregnancy unless the expected benefits to the mother are thought to \noutweigh the possible risks to the unborn child. This is something that will be decided by your \nsurgeon. Women of child-bearing potential should inform their surgeon of the possibility of pregnancy \nbefore undergoing treatment with Osigraft. Women of childbearing potential are advised to use \neffective contraception up to at least 12 months after treatment.  \n \nThe potential for harm to the breast-feed infant is unknown. Women should not breast-feed during the \nperiod immediately following treatment with Osigraft. If you are a nursing mother you should be \ntreated with Osigraft only if your physician or surgeon considers the benefits to you outweigh the risks \nto your child.  \n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Osigraft \n\nOsigraft contains bovine collagen. If you have a known hypersensitivity to collagen you should not be \ntreated with this medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE OSIGRAFT \n\n \nOsigraft is only used by an appropriately qualified surgeon. This is usually done under a full general \nanaesthetic so you will not be awake during the surgery. Depending on the size of the gap in the \nbroken bone one or two vials of Osigraft may be administered. During surgery Osigraft is placed \ndirectly at the injury site in contact with the damaged bone surfaces. The surrounding muscle tissues \nare closed around the implanted medicine as is the skin on the top of the muscle.  \n \nThe maximum recommended dose for this medicine is 2 vials (2g) since its effectiveness at higher \ndoses has not been established. \n \n\n \n\n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n\n \nLike all medicines, Osigraft can have side effects, although not everybody gets them. The frequency of \npossible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention: \n very common (affects more than 1 user in 10) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\n common (affects 1 to 10 users in 100) \n uncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000) \n rare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000) \n very rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000) \n not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data \n \nIn clinical studies, the following undesirable effects have been reported:  \nCommon reported side effects included: \n discoloration of the wound site,  \n erythema (redness of the skin),  \n tenderness, and swelling over the implant site,  \n heterotopic ossification / myositis ossificans (bone formation outside of the fracture area).  \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious or if you notice any side effect not listed in this leaflet, please tell \nyour doctor. \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE OSIGRAFT \n\n \nThis medicine is only supplied to hospitals and specialist clinics. The hospital pharmacist or surgeon is \nresponsible for the correct storage of the product both before and during its use, as well as for the \ncorrect disposal. \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nThis medicine should not be used after the expiry date which is printed on the carton and the \nblister.The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator at (2C - 8C). \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.
