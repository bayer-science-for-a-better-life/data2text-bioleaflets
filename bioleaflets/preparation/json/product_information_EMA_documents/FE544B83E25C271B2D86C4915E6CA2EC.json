NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nPREZISTA 100 mg/ml oral suspension\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach ml of oral suspension contains 100 mg of darunavir (as ethanolate).\n\nExcipient with known effect: sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) 3.43 mg/ml.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nOral suspension\n\nWhite to off-white opaque suspension\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPREZISTA, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other \nantiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) \ninfection in adult and paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 15 kg body weight (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nPREZISTA, co-administered with cobicistat is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral \nmedicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adult \npatients (see section 4.2).\n\nIn deciding to initiate treatment with PREZISTA co-administered with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir,\ncareful consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns \nof mutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and \ntreatment history should guide the use of PREZISTA (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a health care provider experienced in the management of HIV \ninfection. After therapy with PREZISTA has been initiated, patients should be advised not to alter the \ndosage, dose form or discontinue therapy without discussing with their health care provider.\n\nThe interaction profile of darunavir depends on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as \npharmacokinetic enhancer. Darunavir may therefore have different contraindications and \nrecommendations for concomitant medications depending on whether the compound is boosted with \nritonavir or cobicistat (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nPosology\nPREZISTA must always be given orally with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic \nenhancer and in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. The Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of cobicistat or ritonavir as appropriate, must therefore be consulted prior to initiation \nof therapy with PREZISTA. Cobicistat is not indicated for use in twice daily regimens or for use in the \npaediatric population.\n\n\n\n3\n\nART-naïve adult patients\nThe recommended dose regimen is 800 mg once daily with cobicistat 150 mg once daily or ritonavir \n100 mg once daily taken with food.\n\nART-experienced adult patients\nThe recommended dose regimen is 600 mg twice daily taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily taken \nwith food.\n\nA dose regimen of 800 mg once daily with cobicistat 150 mg once daily or ritonavir 100 mg once \ndaily taken with food may be used in patients with prior exposure to antiretroviral medicinal products \nbut without darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 \nRNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l.\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V\n\nIf HIV-1 genotype testing is not available, the recommended dose regimen is PREZISTA 600 mg\ntwice daily taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily taken with food.\n\nART-naïve paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg)\nThe weight-based dose of PREZISTA and ritonavir in paediatric patients is provided in the table \nbelow. The dose of cobicistat to be used with PREZISTA in children less than 18 years of age has not \nbeen established.\n\nRecommended dose for treatment-naïve paediatric patients (3 to 17 years) with PREZISTA \nand ritonavira\n\nBody weight (kg) Dose (once daily with food)\n≥ 15 kg to < 30 kg 600 mg (6 ml) PREZISTA/100 mg (1.2 ml) ritonavir once daily\n≥ 30 kg to < 40 kg 675 mg (6.8 ml)b PREZISTA/100 mg (1.2 ml) ritonavir once daily\n≥ 40 kg 800 mg (8 ml) PREZISTA/100 mg (1.2 ml) ritonavir once daily\na\n\nritonavir oral solution: 80 mg/ml\nb\n\nrounded up for suspension dosing convenience\n\nART-experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg)\nPREZISTA twice daily taken with ritonavir taken with food is usually recommended.\n\nA once daily dose regimen of PREZISTA taken with ritonavir taken with food may be used in patients \nwith prior exposure to antiretroviral medicinal products but without darunavir resistance associated \nmutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell \ncount ≥ 100 cells x 106/l.\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V\n\nThe weight-based dose of PREZISTA and ritonavir in paediatric patients is provided in the table \nbelow. The recommended dose of PREZISTA with low dose ritonavir should not exceed the \nrecommended adult dose (600/100 mg twice daily or 800/100 mg once daily). The dose of cobicistat \nto be used with PREZISTA in children less than 18 years of age has not been established.\n\nRecommended dose for treatment-experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years) with \nPREZISTA and ritonavira\n\nBody weight (kg) Dose (once daily with food) Dose (twice daily with food)\n≥ 15 kg to < 30 kg 600 mg (6 ml) PREZISTA/100 mg \n\n(1.2 ml) ritonavir once daily\n380 mg (3.8 ml) PREZISTA/50 mg \n(0.6 ml) ritonavir twice daily\n\n≥ 30 kg to < 40 kg 675 mg (6.8 ml)b PREZISTA/100 mg \n(1.2 ml) ritonavir once daily\n\n460 mg (4.6 ml) PREZISTA/60 mg \n(0.8 ml) ritonavir twice daily\n\n≥ 40 kg 800 mg (8 ml) PREZISTA/100 mg \n(1.2 ml) ritonavir once daily\n\n600 mg (6 ml) PREZISTA/100 mg \n(1.2 ml) ritonavir twice daily\n\na\nritonavir oral solution: 80 mg/ml\n\nb\nrounded up for suspension dosing convenience\n\n\n\n4\n\nFor ART-experienced paediatric patients HIV genotypic testing is recommended. However, when HIV \ngenotypic testing is not feasible, the PREZISTA/ritonavir once daily dosing regimen is recommended \nin HIV protease inhibitor-naïve paediatric patients and the twice daily dosing regimen is \nrecommended in HIV protease inhibitor-experienced patients.\n\nPREZISTA oral suspension can be used in patients unable to swallow PREZISTA tablets. PREZISTA \nis also available as 75 mg, 150 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg film-coated tablets.\n\nAdvice on missed doses\nThe following guidance is based on the half-life of darunavir in the presence of cobicistat or ritonavir \nand the recommended dosing interval of approximately 12 hours (twice daily regimen) or \napproximately 24 hours (once daily regimen).\n\n If using the twice daily regimen: in case a dose of PREZISTA and/or ritonavir is missed within \n6 hours of the time it is usually taken, patients should be instructed to take the prescribed dose \nof PREZISTA and ritonavir with food as soon as possible. If this is noticed later than 6 hours \nafter the time it is usually taken, the missed dose should not be taken and the patient should \nresume the usual dosing schedule.\n\n If using the once daily regimen: in case a dose of PREZISTA and/or cobicistat or ritonavir is\nmissed within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, patients should be instructed to take the \nprescribed dose of PREZISTA and cobicistat or ritonavir with food as soon as possible. If this is\nnoticed later than 12 hours after the time it is usually taken, the missed dose should not be taken \nand the patient should resume the usual dosing schedule.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nLimited information is available in this population, and therefore, PREZISTA should be used with \ncaution in this age group (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nDarunavir is metabolised by the hepatic system. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with \nmild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, however, \nPREZISTA should be used with caution in these patients. No pharmacokinetic data are available in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment could result in an increase of \ndarunavir exposure and a worsening of its safety profile. Therefore, PREZISTA must not be used in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required for darunavir/ritonavir in patients with renal impairment (see sections \n4.4 and 5.2). Cobicistat has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis, and, therefore, no \nrecommendation can be made for the use of darunavir/cobicistat in these patients.\n\nCobicistat inhibits the tubular secretion of creatinine and may cause modest increases in serum \ncreatinine and modest declines in creatinine clearance. Hence, the use of creatinine clearance as an \nestimate of renal elimination capacity may be misleading. Cobicistat as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of \ndarunavir should, therefore, not be initiated in patients with creatine clearance less than 70 ml/min if \nany co-administered agent requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance: e.g. emtricitabine, \nlamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate, phosphate or succinate) or adefovir dipovoxil.\n\nFor information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.\n\nPaediatric population\nPREZISTA should not be used in children\n- below 3 years of age, because of safety concerns (see sections 4.4 and 5.3), or,\n- less than 15 kg body weight, as the dose for this population has not been established in a \n\nsufficient number of patients (see section 5.1).\n\n\n\n5\n\nThe weight-based dose regimen for PREZISTA and ritonavir is provided in the tables above. The dose \nof cobicistat to be used with PREZISTA has not been established in this patient population.\n\nPregnancy and postpartum\nNo dose adjustment is required for darunavir/ritonavir during pregnancy and postpartum. \nPREZISTA/ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk (see sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.2).\n\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg during pregnancy results in low darunavir exposure \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Therefore, therapy with PREZISTA/cobicistat should not be initiated during \npregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with PREZISTA/cobicistat should be \nswitched to an alternative regimen, (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). PREZISTA/ritonavir may be considered \nas an alternative.\n\nMethod of administration\nPatients should be instructed to take PREZISTA with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir within \n30 minutes after completion of a meal. The type of food does not affect the exposure to darunavir (see \nsections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2).\n\nPREZISTA suspension is administered orally. Shake the bottle vigorously prior to each dose. The \nsupplied oral dosing pipette should not be used for any other medicinal products.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nPatients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.\n\nConcomitant treatment with any of the following medicinal products given the expected decrease in \nplasma concentrations of darunavir, ritonavir and cobicistat and the potential for loss of therapeutic \neffect (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nApplicable to darunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat:\n- The combination product lopinavir/ritonavir (see section 4.5).\n- The strong CYP3A inducers rifampicin and herbal preparations containing St John’s wort \n\n(Hypericum perforatum). Co-administration is expected to reduce plasma concentrations of \ndarunavir, ritonavir and cobicistat, which could lead to loss of therapeutic effect and possible \ndevelopment of resistance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nApplicable to darunavir boosted with cobicistat, not when boosted with ritonavir:\n- Darunavir boosted with cobicistat is more sensitive for CYP3A induction than darunavir \n\nboosted with ritonavir. Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers is contraindicated, since \nthese may reduce the exposure to cobicistat and darunavir leading to loss of therapeutic effect. \nStrong CYP3A inducers include e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (see sections \n4.4 and 4.5).\n\nDarunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat inhibits the elimination of active substances that \nare highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance, which results in increased exposure to the \nco-administered medicinal product. Therefore, concomitant treatment with such medicinal products \nfor which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is \ncontraindicated (applies to darunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat). These active \nsubstances include e.g.:\n- alfuzosin\n- amiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine, quinidine, ranolazine\n- astemizole, terfenadine\n- colchicine when used in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see section 4.5)\n\n\n\n6\n\n- ergot derivatives (e.g. dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergonovine)\n- elbasvir/grazoprevir\n- cisapride\n- dapoxetine\n- domperidone\n- naloxegol\n- lurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine, sertindole (see section 4.5)\n- triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, \n\nsee section 4.5)\n- sildenafil - when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, avanafil\n- simvastatin, lovastatin, lomitapide (see section 4.5)\n- dabigatran, ticagrelor (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nRegular assessment of virological response is advised. In the setting of lack or loss of virological \nresponse, resistance testing should be performed.\n\nPREZISTA must always be given orally with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic \nenhancer and in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products (see section 5.2). The \nSummary of Product Characteristics of cobicistat or ritonavir as appropriate, must therefore be \nconsulted prior to initiation of therapy with PREZISTA.\n\nIncreasing the dose of ritonavir from that recommended in section 4.2 did not significantly affect \ndarunavir concentrations. It is not recommended to alter the dose of cobicistat or ritonavir.\n\nDarunavir binds predominantly to 1-acid glycoprotein. This protein binding is \nconcentration-dependent indicative for saturation of binding. Therefore, protein displacement of \nmedicinal products highly bound to 1-acid glycoprotein cannot be ruled out (see section 4.5).\n\nART-experienced patients – once daily dosing\nPREZISTA used in combination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir once daily in ART-experienced \npatients should not be used in patients with one or more darunavir resistance associated mutations \n(DRV-RAMs) or HIV-1 RNA ≥ 100,000 copies/ml or CD4+ cell count < 100 cells x 106/l (see section \n4.2). Combinations with optimised background regimen (OBRs) other than ≥ 2 NRTIs have not been \nstudied in this population. Limited data are available in patients with HIV-1 clades other than B (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nPaediatric population\nPREZISTA is not recommended for use in paediatric patients below 3 years of age or less than 15 kg \nbody weight (see sections 4.2 and 5.3).\n\nPregnancy\nPREZISTA/ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. Caution should be used in pregnant women with concomitant medications which may \nfurther decrease darunavir exposure (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).\n\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg once daily during the second and third trimester has \nbeen shown to result in low darunavir exposure, with a reduction of around 90% in Cmin levels (see \nsection 5.2). Cobicistat levels decrease and may not provide sufficient boosting. The substantial \nreduction in darunavir exposure may result in virological failure and an increased risk of mother to \nchild transmission of HIV infection. Therefore, therapy with PREZISTA/cobicistat should not be \ninitiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with \n\n\n\n7\n\nPREZISTA/cobicistat should be switched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.6). \nPREZISTA given with low dose ritonavir may be considered as an alternative.\n\nElderly\nAs limited information is available on the use of PREZISTA in patients aged 65 and over, caution \nshould be exercised in the administration of PREZISTA in elderly patients, reflecting the greater \nfrequency of decreased hepatic function and of concomitant disease or other therapy (see sections 4.2 \nand 5.2).\n\nSevere skin reactions\nDuring the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N=3,063), severe skin reactions, which \nmay be accompanied with fever and/or elevations of transaminases, have been reported in 0.4% of \npatients. DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome has been rarely (< 0.1%) reported, and during post-marketing experience toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis and acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. PREZISTA should be \ndiscontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include,\nbut are not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or \njoint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia.\n\nRash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing \nPREZISTA/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to patients receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir without \nraltegravir or raltegravir without PREZISTA (see section 4.8).\n\nDarunavir contains a sulphonamide moiety. PREZISTA should be used with caution in patients with a \nknown sulphonamide allergy.\n\nHepatotoxicity\nDrug-induced hepatitis (e.g. acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with PREZISTA. \nDuring the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N=3,063), hepatitis was reported in \n0.5% of patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir. Patients with \npre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for \nliver function abnormalities including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of \nconcomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for \nthese medicinal products.\n\nAppropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with PREZISTA used in \ncombination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir and patients should be monitored during treatment. \nIncreased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, \ncirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first \nseveral months of PREZISTA used in combination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir treatment.\n\nIf there is evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of \nliver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver \ntenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients using PREZISTA used in combination with cobicistat or low \ndose ritonavir, interruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered promptly.\n\nPatients with coexisting conditions\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe safety and efficacy of PREZISTA have not been established in patients with severe underlying \nliver disorders and PREZISTA is therefore contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nDue to an increase in the unbound darunavir plasma concentrations, PREZISTA should be used with \ncaution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo special precautions or dose adjustments for darunavir/ritonavir are required in patients with renal \nimpairment. As darunavir and ritonavir are highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that they \n\n\n\n8\n\nwill be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Therefore, no special \nprecautions or dose adjustments are required in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Cobicistat has \nnot been studied in patients receiving dialysis, therefore, no recommendation can be made for the use \nof darunavir/cobicistat in these patients (see section 4.2).\n\nCobicistat decreases the estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of \ncreatinine. This should be taken into consideration if darunavir with cobicistat is administered to \npatients in whom the estimated creatinine clearance is used to adjust doses of co-administered \nmedicinal products (see section 4.2 and cobicistat SmPC).\n\nThere are currently inadequate data to determine whether co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and \ncobicistat is associated with a greater risk of renal adverse reactions compared with regimens that \ninclude tenofovir disoproxil without cobicistat.\n\nHaemophiliac patients\nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthrosis in patients with haemophilia type A and B treated with PIs. In some patients additional \nfactor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with PIs was continued or \nreintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship has been suggested, although \nthe mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should, therefore, be made \naware of the possibility of increased bleeding.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.\n\nOsteonecrosis\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant \nexamples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and \npneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any \ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. In addition, \nreactivation of herpes simplex and herpes zoster has been observed in clinical studies with PREZISTA \nco-administered with low dose ritonavir.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).\n\nInteractions with medicinal products\nSeveral of the interaction studies have been performed with darunavir at lower than recommended \ndoses. The effects on co-administered medicinal products may thus be underestimated and clinical \nmonitoring of safety may be indicated. For full information on interactions with other medicinal \nproducts see section 4.5.\n\n\n\n9\n\nPharmacokinetic enhancer and concomitant medications\nDarunavir has different interaction profiles depending on whether the compound is boosted with \nritonavir or cobicistat:\n- Darunavir boosted with cobicistat is more sensitive for CYP3A induction: concomitant use of\n\ndarunavir/cobicistat and strong CYP3A inducers is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3), \nand concomitant use with weak to moderate CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section\n4.5). Concomitant use of darunavir/ritonavir and darunavir/cobicistat with lopinavir/ritonavir, \nrifampicin and herbal products containing St John’s wort, Hypericum perforatum, is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.5).\n\n- Unlike ritonavir, cobicistat does not have inducing effects on enzymes or transport proteins (see \nsection 4.5). If switching the pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat, caution is required \nduring the first two weeks of treatment with darunavir/cobicistat, particularly if doses of any \nconcomitantly administered medicinal products have been titrated or adjusted during use of \nritonavir as a pharmacoenhancer. A dose reduction of the co-administered drug may be needed \nin these cases.\n\nEfavirenz in combination with boosted PREZISTA may result in sub-optimal darunavir Cmin. If \nefavirenz is to be used in combination with PREZISTA, the PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice \ndaily regimen should be used. See the Summary of Product Characteristics for PREZISTA 75 mg, \n150 mg and 600 mg tablets (see section 4.5).\n\nLife-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp; see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nPREZISTA oral suspension contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) which may cause \nallergic reactions (possibly delayed).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe interaction profile of darunavir may differ depending on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as \npharmacoenhancer. The recommendations given for concomitant use of darunavir and other medicinal \nproducts may therefore differ depending on whether darunavir is boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat \n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4), and caution is also required during the first time of treatment if switching \nthe pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat (see section 4.4).\n\nMedicinal products that affect darunavir exposure (ritonavir as pharmacoenhancer)\nDarunavir and ritonavir are metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity \nwould be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, resulting in lowered plasma \nconcentrations of these compounds and consequently that of darunavir, leading to loss of therapeutic \neffect and possible development of resistance (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). CYP3A inducers that are \ncontraindicated include rifampicin, St John’s wort and lopinavir.\n\nCo-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may \ndecrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, which may result in increased plasma concentrations \nof darunavir and ritonavir. Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended and \ncaution is warranted, these interactions are described in the interaction table below (e.g. indinavir, \nazole antifungals such as clotrimazole).\n\nMedicinal products that affect darunavir exposure (cobicistat as pharmacoenhancer)\nDarunavir and cobicistat are metabolised by CYP3A, and co-administration with CYP3A inducers \nmay therefore result in subtherapeutic plasma exposure to darunavir. Darunavir boosted with \ncobicistat is more sensitive to CYP3A induction than ritonavir-boosted darunavir: co-administration of \ndarunavir/cobicistat with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g. St John’s wort, \nrifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nCo-administration of darunavir/cobicistat with weak to moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. efavirenz, \netravirine, nevirapine, boceprevir, fluticasone, and bosentan) is not recommended (see interaction \ntable below).\n\n\n\n10\n\nFor co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, the same recommendations apply independent \nof whether darunavir is boosted with ritonavir or with cobicistat (see section above).\n\nMedicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boosted with ritonavir\nDarunavir and ritonavir are inhibitors of CYP3A, CYP2D6 and P-gp. Co-administration of \ndarunavir/ritonavir with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A and/or CYP2D6 or \ntransported by P-gp may result in increased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which \ncould increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.\n\nDarunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir must not be combined with medicinal products that \nare highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which increased systemic exposure is associated \nwith serious and/or life-threatening events (narrow therapeutic index) (see section 4.3).\n\nThe overall pharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14-fold increase in \nthe systemic exposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in \ncombination with ritonavir at 100 mg twice daily. Therefore, darunavir must only be used in \ncombination with a pharmacokinetic enhancer (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nA clinical study utilising a cocktail of medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochromes \nCYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and \ninhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, which may be attributed to the \npresence of low dose ritonavir. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with medicinal products \nwhich are primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 (such as flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol) may result \nin increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their \ntherapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with medicinal \nproducts primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 (such as warfarin) and CYP2C19 (such as methadone) \nmay result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or \nshorten their therapeutic effect.\n\nAlthough the effect on CYP2C8 has only been studied in vitro, co-administration of darunavir and \nritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 (such as paclitaxel, rosiglitazone,\nrepaglinide) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could \ndecrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.\n\nRitonavir inhibits the transporters P-glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and co-administration \nwith substrates of these transporters can result in increased plasma concentrations of these compounds \n(e.g. dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, statins and bosentan; see the Interaction table below).\n\nMedicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boosted with cobicistat\nThe recommendations for darunavir boosted with ritonavir are adequate also for darunavir boosted \nwith cobicistat with regard to substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, P-glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and \nOATP1B3 (see contraindications and recommendations presented in the section above). Cobicistat \n150 mg given with darunavir 800 mg once daily enhances darunavir pharmacokinetic parameters in a \ncomparable way to ritonavir (see section 5.2).\n\nUnlike ritonavir, cobicistat does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or \nUGT1A1. For further information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product \nCharacteristics.\n\nInteraction table\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nSeveral of the interaction studies (indicated by # in the table below) have been performed at lower than \nrecommended doses of darunavir or with a different dosing regimen (see section 4.2 Posology). The \neffects on co-administered medicinal products may thus be underestimated and clinical monitoring of \nsafety may be indicated.\n\n\n\n11\n\nThe interaction profile of darunavir depends on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as \npharmacokinetic enhancer. Darunavir may therefore have different recommendations for concomitant \nmedications depending on whether the compound is boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat. The same \nrecommendations apply, unless specifically indicated. For further information on cobicistat, consult \nthe cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.\n\nInteractions between darunavir/ritonavir and antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral medicinal products \nare listed in the table below. The direction of the arrow for each pharmacokinetic parameter is based \non the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio being within (↔), below (↓) or above (↑) \nthe 80-125% range (not determined as “ND”).\n\nIn the table below the specific pharmacokinetic enhancer is specified when recommendations differ. \nWhen the recommendation is the same for PREZISTA when co-administered with a low dose ritonavir \nor cobicistat, the term “boosted PREZISTA” is used.\n\nThe below list of examples of drug drug interactions is not comprehensive and therefore the label of \neach drug that is co-administered with PREZISTA should be consulted for information related to the \nroute of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with \nregards to co-administration.\n\nINTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS\nMedicinal products by \ntherapeutic areas\n\nInteraction\nGeometric mean change (%)\n\nRecommendations concerning \nco-administration\n\nHIV ANTIRETROVIRALS\nIntegrase strand transfer inhibitors\n\nDolutegravir dolutegravir AUC ↓ 22%\ndolutegravir C24h ↓ 38%\ndolutegravir Cmax ↓ 11%\ndarunavir ↔*\n* Using cross-study comparisons to historical \npharmacokinetic data\n\nBoosted PREZISTA and \ndolutegravir can be used without \ndose adjustment.\n\nRaltegravir Some clinical studies suggest raltegravir \nmay cause a modest decrease in \ndarunavir plasma concentrations.\n\nAt present the effect of raltegravir \non darunavir plasma \nconcentrations does not appear to \nbe clinically relevant.

Concomitant use of \nsildenafil or tadalafil for the treatment of \npulmonary arterial hypertension and \nboosted PREZISTA may increase plasma \nconcentrations of sildenafil or tadalafil.\n(CYP3A inhibition)\n\nA safe and effective dose of \nsildenafil for the treatment of \npulmonary arterial hypertension \nco-administered with boosted \nPREZISTA has not been \nestablished. There is an increased \npotential for sildenafil-associated \nadverse events (including visual \ndisturbances, hypotension, \nprolonged erection and syncope). \nTherefore, co-administration of \nboosted PREZISTA and sildenafil \nwhen used for the treatment of \npulmonary arterial hypertension is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\nCo-administration of tadalafil for \nthe treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension with boosted \nPREZISTA is not recommended.\n\nPROTON PUMP INHIBITORS\nOmeprazole\n20 mg once daily\n\n#\ndarunavir AUC ↔\n\n#\ndarunavir Cmin ↔\n\n#\ndarunavir Cmax ↔\n\nBoosted PREZISTA can be \nco-administered with proton pump \ninhibitors without dose \nadjustments.\n\n\n\n24\n\nSEDATIVES/HYPNOTICS\nBuspirone\nClorazepate\nDiazepam\nEstazolam\nFlurazepam\nMidazolam (parenteral)\nZolpidem\n\nMidazolam (oral)\nTriazolam\n\nNot studied.

According to current treatment guidelines, dual \ntherapy with protease inhibitors is generally not recommended.\n\n‡\nStudy was conducted with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg once daily.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nAs a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in \npregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, \nthe animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account.\n\nThere are no adequate and well controlled studies on pregnancy outcome with darunavir in pregnant \nwomen. Studies in animals do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).\n\nPREZISTA co-administered with low dose ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the \npotential benefit justifies the potential risk.\n\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg during pregnancy results in low darunavir exposure \n(see section 5.2), which may be associated with an increased risk of treatment failure and an increased \nrisk of HIV transmission to the child. Therapy with PREZISTA/cobicistat should not be initiated \n\n\n\n25\n\nduring pregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with PREZISTA/cobicistat \nshould be switched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether darunavir is excreted in human milk. Studies in rats have demonstrated that \ndarunavir is excreted in milk and at high levels (1,000 mg/kg/day) resulted in toxicity. Because of both \nthe potential for HIV transmission and the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, mothers \nshould be instructed not to breast-feed under any circumstances if they are receiving PREZISTA.\n\nFertility\nNo human data on the effect of darunavir on fertility are available. There was no effect on mating or \nfertility with darunavir treatment in rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPREZISTA in combination with cobicistat or ritonavir has no or negligible influence on the ability to \ndrive and use machines. However, dizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with \nregimens containing PREZISTA co-administered with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir and should be \nborne in mind when considering a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nDuring the clinical development program (N=2,613 treatment-experienced subjects who initiated \ntherapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily), 51.3% of subjects experienced at least one \nadverse reaction. The total mean treatment duration for subjects was 95.3 weeks. The most frequent \nadverse reactions reported in clinical trials and as spontaneous reports are diarrhoea, nausea, rash, \nheadache and vomiting. The most frequent serious reactions are acute renal failure, myocardial \ninfarction, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, \ndiarrhoea, hepatitis and pyrexia.\n\nIn the 96 week analysis, the safety profile of PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily in \ntreatment-naïve subjects was similar to that seen with PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily in \ntreatment-experienced subjects except for nausea which was observed more frequently in \ntreatment-naïve subjects. This was driven by mild intensity nausea. No new safety findings were \nidentified in the 192 week analysis of the treatment-naïve subjects in which the mean treatment \nduration of PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily was 162.5 weeks.\n\nDuring the Phase III clinical trial GS-US-216-130 with darunavir/cobicistat (N=313 treatment-naïve \nand treatment-experienced subjects), 66.5% of subjects experienced at least one adverse reaction. The \nmean treatment duration was 58.4 weeks. The most frequent adverse reactions reported were diarrhoea \n(28%), nausea (23%), and rash (16%). Serious adverse reactions are diabetes mellitus, (drug) \nhypersensitivity, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, rash and vomiting.\n\nFor information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency category. Within each \nfrequency category, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

reactions\n\nRash\nIn clinical trials, rash was mostly mild to moderate, often occurring within the first four weeks of \ntreatment and resolving with continued dosing. In cases of severe skin reaction see the warning in \nsection 4.4. In a single arm trial investigating darunavir 800 mg once daily in combination with \ncobicistat 150 mg once daily and other antiretrovirals 2.2% of patients discontinued treatment due to \nrash.\n\nDuring the clinical development program of raltegravir in treatment-experienced patients, rash, \nirrespective of causality, was more commonly observed with regimens containing \nPREZISTA/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to those containing PREZISTA/ritonavir without \nraltegravir or raltegravir without PREZISTA/ritonavir. Rash considered by the investigator to be \ndrug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9, \n4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3 \nper 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity \nand did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nMetabolic parameters\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nMusculoskeletal abnormalities\nIncreased CPK, myalgia, myositis and rarely, rhabdomyolysis have been reported with the use of \nprotease inhibitors, particularly in combination with NRTIs.\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nBleeding in haemophiliac patients\nThere have been reports of increased spontaneous bleeding in haemophiliac patients receiving \nantiretroviral protease inhibitors (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety assessment in paediatric patients is based on the 48-week analysis of safety data from three \nPhase II trials. The following patient populations were evaluated (see section 5.1):\n 80 ART-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 6 to 17 years and weighing at \n\nleast 20 kg who received PREZISTA tablets with low dose ritonavir twice daily in combination \nwith other antiretroviral agents.\n\n\n\n30\n\n 21 ART-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 3 to < 6 years and weighing \n10 kg to < 20 kg (16 participants from 15 kg to < 20 kg) who received PREZISTA oral \nsuspension with low dose ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents.\n\n 12 ART-naïve HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 12 to 17 years and weighing at least \n40 kg who received PREZISTA tablets with low dose ritonavir once daily in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents (see section 5.1).\n\nOverall, the safety profile in these paediatric patients was similar to that observed in the adult \npopulation.\n\nOther special populations\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus\nAmong 1,968 treatment-experienced patients receiving PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir \n600/100 mg twice daily, 236 patients were co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Co-infected patients were \nmore likely to have baseline and treatment emergent hepatic transaminase elevations than those \nwithout chronic viral hepatitis (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nHuman experience of acute overdose with PREZISTA co-administered with cobicistat or low dose \nritonavir is limited. Single doses up to 3,200 mg of darunavir as oral solution alone and up to 1,600 mg \nof the tablet formulation of darunavir in combination with ritonavir have been administered to healthy \nvolunteers without untoward symptomatic effects.\n\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with PREZISTA. Treatment of overdose with PREZISTA \nconsists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient. Since darunavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be \nbeneficial in significant removal of the active substance.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE10.\n\nMechanism of action\nDarunavir is an inhibitor of the dimerisation and of the catalytic activity of the HIV-1 protease \n(KD of 4.5 x 10\n\n-12M). It selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded Gag-Pol polyproteins in virus \ninfected cells, thereby preventing the formation of mature infectious virus particles.\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\nDarunavir exhibits activity against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 and laboratory \nstrains of HIV-2 in acutely infected T-cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and \nhuman monocytes/macrophages with median EC50 values ranging from 1.2 to 8.5 nM (0.7 to \n5.0 ng/ml). Darunavir demonstrates antiviral activity in vitro against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M \n(A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and group O primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from < 0.1 to 4.3 nM.\n\nThese EC50 values are well below the 50% cellular toxicity concentration range of 87 µM to \n> 100 µM.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n31\n\nResistance\nIn vitro selection of darunavir-resistant virus from wild type HIV-1 was lengthy (> 3 years). The \nselected viruses were unable to grow in the presence of darunavir concentrations above 400 nM. \nViruses selected in these conditions and showing decreased susceptibility to darunavir (range: \n23-50-fold) harboured 2 to 4 amino acid substitutions in the protease gene. The decreased \nsusceptibility to darunavir of the emerging viruses in the selection experiment could not be explained \nby the emergence of these protease mutations.\n\nThe clinical trial data from ART-experienced patients (TITAN trial and the pooled analysis of the \nPOWER 1, 2 and 3 and DUET 1 and 2 trials) showed that virologic response to PREZISTA\nco-administered with low dose ritonavir was decreased when 3 or more darunavir RAMs (V11I, V32I, \nL33F, I47V, I50V, I54L or M, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V) were present at baseline or when these \nmutations developed during treatment.\n\nIncreasing baseline darunavir fold change in EC50 (FC) was associated with decreasing virologic \nresponse. A lower and upper clinical cut-off of 10 and 40 were identified. Isolates with baseline FC \n≤ 10 are susceptible; isolates with FC > 10 to 40 have decreased susceptibility; isolates with FC > 40\nare resistant (see Clinical results).\n\nViruses isolated from patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily experiencing virologic \nfailure by rebound that were susceptible to tipranavir at baseline remained susceptible to tipranavir \nafter treatment in the vast majority of cases.\n\nThe lowest rates of developing resistant HIV virus are observed in ART-naïve patients who are treated \nfor the first time with darunavir in combination with other ART.\n\nThe table below shows the development of HIV-1 protease mutations and loss of susceptibility to PIs \nin virologic failures at endpoint in the ARTEMIS, ODIN and TITAN trials.\n\nARTEMIS\nWeek 192\n\nODIN\nWeek 48\n\nTITAN\nWeek 48\n\nPREZISTA/ \nritonavir\n\n800/100 mg\nonce daily\n\nN=343\n\nPREZISTA/ \nritonavir\n\n800/100 mg\nonce daily\n\nN=294\n\nPREZISTA/ \nritonavir\n\n600/100 mg\ntwice daily\n\nN=296\n\nPREZISTA/ \nritonavir\n\n600/100 mg\ntwice daily\n\nN=298\nTotal number of \nvirologic failures\n\na\n, n \n\n(%)\n\n55 (16.0%) 65 (22.1%) 54 (18.2%) 31 (10.4%)\n\nRebounders 39 (11.4%) 11 (3.7%) 11 (3.7%) 16 (5.4%)\nNever suppressed \nsubjects\n\n16 (4.7%) 54 (18.4%) 43 (14.5%) 15 (5.0%)\n\nNumber of subjects with virologic failure and paired baseline/endpoint genotypes, developing mutations\nb\n\nat \nendpoint, n/N\n\nPrimary (major) PI \nmutations\n\n0/43 1/60 0/42 6/28\n\nPI RAMs 4/43 7/60 4/42 10/28\nNumber of subjects with virologic failure and paired baseline/endpoint phenotypes, showing loss of \nsusceptibility to PIs at endpoint compared to baseline, n/N\nPI\n\ndarunavir 0/39 1/58 0/41 3/26\namprenavir 0/39 1/58 0/40 0/22\natazanavir 0/39 2/56 0/40 0/22\nindinavir 0/39 2/57 0/40 1/24\nlopinavir 0/39 1/58 0/40 0/23\nsaquinavir 0/39 0/56 0/40 0/22\ntipranavir 0/39 0/58 0/41 1/25\n\n\n\n32\n\na\nTLOVR non-VF censored algorithm based on HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml, except for TITAN (HIV-1 RNA \n< 400 copies/ml)\n\nb\nIAS-USA lists\n\nLow rates of developing resistant HIV-1 virus were observed in ART-naïve patients who are treated \nfor the first time with darunavir/cobicistat once daily in combination with other ART, and in \nART-experienced patients with no darunavir RAMs receiving darunavir/cobicistat in combination \nwith other ART.

Virologic response was preserved throughout the \nstudy period in both arms. No mother to child transmission occurred in the infants born to the \n31 subjects who stayed on the antiretroviral treatment through delivery. There were no new clinically \nrelevant safety findings compared with the known safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir in HIV-1 \ninfected adults (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of darunavir, co-administered with cobicistat or ritonavir, have been \nevaluated in healthy adult volunteers and in HIV-1 infected patients. Exposure to darunavir was higher \nin HIV-1 infected patients than in healthy subjects. The increased exposure to darunavir in HIV-1 \ninfected patients compared to healthy subjects may be explained by the higher concentrations of \nα1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) in HIV-1 infected patients, resulting in higher darunavir binding to \nplasma AAG and, therefore, higher plasma concentrations.\n\nDarunavir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Cobicistat and ritonavir inhibit CYP3A, thereby \nincreasing the plasma concentrations of darunavir considerably.\n\nFor information on cobicistat pharmacokinetic properties, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product \nCharacteristics.\n\nAbsorption\nDarunavir was rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Maximum plasma concentration of \ndarunavir in the presence of low dose ritonavir is generally achieved within 2.5-4.0 hours.\n\nThe absolute oral bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of darunavir alone was approximately 37% \nand increased to approximately 82% in the presence of 100 mg twice daily ritonavir. The overall \npharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14-fold increase in the systemic \nexposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with \nritonavir at 100 mg twice daily (see section 4.4).\n\nWhen administered without food, the relative bioavailability of darunavir in the presence of cobicistat \nor low dose ritonavir is lower as compared to intake with food. Therefore, PREZISTA tablets should \nbe taken with cobicistat or ritonavir and with food. The type of food does not affect exposure to \ndarunavir.\n\nDistribution\nDarunavir is approximately 95% bound to plasma protein. Darunavir binds primarily to plasma α1-acid \nglycoprotein.\n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the volume of distribution of darunavir alone was 88.1 ± 59.0 l \n(Mean ± SD) and increased to 131 ± 49.9 l (Mean ± SD) in the presence of 100 mg twice-daily \nritonavir.\n\n\n\n39\n\nBiotransformation\nIn vitro experiments with human liver microsomes (HLMs) indicate that darunavir primarily \nundergoes oxidative metabolism. Darunavir is extensively metabolised by the hepatic CYP system and \nalmost exclusively by isozyme CYP3A4. A 14C-darunavir trial in healthy volunteers showed that a \nmajority of the radioactivity in plasma after a single 400/100 mg darunavir with ritonavir dose was due \nto the parent active substance. At least 3 oxidative metabolites of darunavir have been identified in \nhumans; all showed activity that was at least 10-fold less than the activity of darunavir against wild \ntype HIV.\n\nElimination\nAfter a 400/100 mg 14C-darunavir with ritonavir dose, approximately 79.5% and 13.9% of the \nadministered dose of 14C-darunavir could be retrieved in faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged \ndarunavir accounted for approximately 41.2% and 7.7% of the administered dose in faeces and urine, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of darunavir was approximately 15 hours when \ncombined with ritonavir.\nThe intravenous clearance of darunavir alone (150 mg) and in the presence of low dose ritonavir was \n32.8 l/h and 5.9 l/h, respectively.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken twice daily in\n74 treatment-experienced paediatric patients, aged 6 to 17 years and weighing at least 20 kg, showed \nthat the administered weight-based doses of PREZISTA/ritonavir resulted in darunavir exposure \ncomparable to that in adults receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily (see section 4.2).\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken twice daily in \n14 treatment-experienced paediatric patients, aged 3 to < 6 years and weighing at least 15 kg to \n< 20 kg, showed that weight-based dosages resulted in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that \nachieved in adults receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily (see section 4.2).\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken once daily in 12 ART-naïve \npaediatric patients, aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg, showed that \nPREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily results in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that \nachieved in adults receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily. Therefore the same once \ndaily dosage may be used in treatment-experienced adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing at \nleast 40 kg without darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma \nHIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.2).\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken once daily in \n10 treatment-experienced paediatric patients, aged 3 to < 6 years and weighing at least 14 kg to \n< 20 kg, showed that weight-based dosages resulted in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that \nachieved in adults receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily (see section 4.2). In addition, \npharmacokinetic modeling and simulation of darunavir exposures in paediatric patients across the ages \nof 3 to < 18 years confirmed the darunavir exposures as observed in the clinical studies and allowed \nthe identification of weight-based PREZISTA/ritonavir once daily dosing regimens for paediatric \npatients weighing at least 15 kg that are either ART-naïve or treatment-experienced paediatric patients \nwithout DRV-RAMs* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count \n≥ 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.2).\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V\n\nElderly\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV infected patients showed that darunavir pharmacokinetics \nare not considerably different in the age range (18 to 75 years) evaluated in HIV infected patients \n(n=12, age ≥ 65) (see section 4.4). However, only limited data were available in patients above the age \nof 65 year.\n\n\n\n40\n\nGender\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed a slightly higher darunavir exposure (16.8%) in HIV \ninfected females compared to males. This difference is not clinically relevant.\n\nRenal impairment\nResults from a mass balance study with 14C-darunavir with ritonavir showed that approximately 7.7% \nof the administered dose of darunavir is excreted in the urine unchanged.\n\nAlthough darunavir has not been studied in patients with renal impairment, population \npharmacokinetic analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of darunavir were not significantly \naffected in HIV infected patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl between 30-60 ml/min, n=20) \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nDarunavir is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. In a multiple dose study with \nPREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg) twice daily, it was demonstrated that the total \nplasma concentrations of darunavir in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, n=8) and moderate \n(Child-Pugh Class B, n=8) hepatic impairment were comparable with those in healthy subjects. \nHowever, unbound darunavir concentrations were approximately 55% (Child-Pugh Class A) and\n100% (Child-Pugh Class B) higher, respectively. The clinical relevance of this increase is unknown \ntherefore, PREZISTA should be used with caution. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of darunavir has not been studied (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nPregnancy and postpartum\nThe exposure to total darunavir and ritonavir after intake of darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice \ndaily and darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen was generally \nlower during pregnancy compared with postpartum. However, for unbound (i.e. active) darunavir, the \npharmacokinetic parameters were less reduced during pregnancy compared to postpartum, due to an \nincrease in the unbound fraction of darunavir during pregnancy compared to postpartum.\n\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/ritonavir at \n600/100 mg twice daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum\nPharmacokinetics of \ntotal darunavir\n(mean ± SD)\n\nSecond trimester of \npregnancy\n\n(n=12)a\n\nThird trimester of \npregnancy\n\n(n=12)\n\nPostpartum \n(6-12 weeks)\n\n(n=12)\nCmax, ng/ml 4,668 ± 1,097 5,328 ± 1,631 6,659 ± 2,364\nAUC12h, ng.h/ml 39,370 ± 9,597 45,880 ± 17,360 56,890 ± 26,340\nCmin, ng/ml 1,922 ± 825 2,661 ± 1,269 2,851 ± 2,216\na\n\nn=11 for AUC12h\n\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/ritonavir at \n800/100 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum\nPharmacokinetics of \ntotal darunavir\n(mean ± SD)\n\nSecond trimester of \npregnancy\n\n(n=17)\n\nThird Trimester of \npregnancy\n\n(n=15)\n\nPostpartum \n(6-12 weeks)\n\n(n=16)\nCmax, ng/ml 4,964 ± 1,505 5,132 ± 1,198 7,310 ± 1,704\nAUC24h, ng.h/ml 62,289 ± 16,234 61,112 ± 13,790 92,116 ± 29,241\nCmin, ng/ml 1,248 ± 542 1,075 ± 594 1,473 ± 1,141\n\nIn women receiving darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily during the second trimester of \npregnancy, mean intra-individual values for total darunavir Cmax, AUC12h and Cmin were 28%, 26% and \n26% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total \ndarunavir Cmax, AUC12h and Cmin values were 18%, 16% lower and 2% higher, respectively, as \ncompared with postpartum.\n\n\n\n41\n\nIn women receiving darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily during the second trimester of \npregnancy, mean intra-individual values for total darunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin were 33%, 31% and \n30% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total \ndarunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were 29%, 32% and 50% lower, respectively, as compared \nwith postpartum.\n\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg once daily during pregnancy results in low darunavir \nexposure. In women receiving darunavir/cobicistat during the second trimester of pregnancy, mean \nintra-individual values for total darunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin were 49%, 56% and 92% lower, \nrespectively, as compared with postpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total darunavir \nCmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were 37%, 50% and 89% lower, respectively, as compared with \npostpartum. The unbound fraction was also substantially reduced, including around 90% reductions of \nCmin levels. The main cause of these low exposures is a marked reduction in cobicistat exposure as a \nconsequence of pregnancy-associated enzyme induction (see below).\n\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/cobicistat \n800/150 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, the third trimester of pregnancy, and postpartum\nPharmacokinetics of \ntotal darunavir\n(mean ± SD)\n\nSecond trimester \nof pregnancy\n\n(n=7)\n\nThird trimester \nof pregnancy\n\n(n=6)\n\nPostpartum \n(6-12 weeks)\n\n(n=6)\nCmax, ng/mL 4,340 ± 1,616 4,910 ± 970 7,918 ± 2,199\nAUC24h, ng.h/mL 47,293 ± 19,058 47,991 ± 9,879 99,613 ± 34,862\nCmin, ng/mL 168 ± 149 184 ± 99 1,538 ± 1,344\n\nThe exposure to cobicistat was lower during pregnancy, potentially leading to suboptimal boosting of \ndarunavir. During the second trimester of pregnancy, cobicistat Cmax, AUC24h, and Cmin were 50%, \n63%, and 83% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum. During the third trimester of \npregnancy, cobicistat Cmax, AUC24h, and Cmin, were 27%, 49%, and 83% lower, respectively, as \ncompared with postpartum.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAnimal toxicology studies have been conducted at exposures up to clinical exposure levels with \ndarunavir alone, in mice, rats and dogs and in combination with ritonavir in rats and dogs.\n\nIn repeated-dose toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs, there were only limited effects of treatment \nwith darunavir. In rodents the target organs identified were the haematopoietic system, the blood \ncoagulation system, liver and thyroid. A variable but limited decrease in red blood cell-related \nparameters was observed, together with increases in activated partial thromboplastin time.\n\nChanges were observed in liver (hepatocyte hypertrophy, vacuolation, increased liver enzymes) and \nthyroid (follicular hypertrophy). In the rat, the combination of darunavir with ritonavir lead to a small \nincrease in effect on RBC parameters, liver and thyroid and increased incidence of islet fibrosis in the \npancreas (in male rats only) compared to treatment with darunavir alone. In the dog, no major toxicity \nfindings or target organs were identified up to exposures equivalent to clinical exposure at the \nrecommended dose.\n\nIn a study conducted in rats, the number of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased in the \npresence of maternal toxicity. Otherwise, there were no effects on mating or fertility with darunavir \ntreatment up to 1,000 mg/kg/day and exposure levels below (AUC-0.5 fold) of that in human at the \nclinically recommended dose. Up to same dose levels, there was no teratogenicity with darunavir in \nrats and rabbits when treated alone nor in mice when treated in combination with ritonavir. The \nexposure levels were lower than those with the recommended clinical dose in humans. In a pre- and \npostnatal development assessment in rats, darunavir with and without ritonavir, caused a transient \nreduction in body weight gain of the offspring pre-weaning and there was a slight delay in the opening \n\n\n\n42\n\nof eyes and ears. Darunavir in combination with ritonavir caused a reduction in the number of pups \nthat exhibited the startle response on day 15 of lactation and a reduced pup survival during lactation. \nThese effects may be secondary to pup exposure to the active substance via the milk and/or maternal \ntoxicity. No post weaning functions were affected with darunavir alone or in combination with \nritonavir. In juvenile rats receiving darunavir up to days 23-26, increased mortality was observed with \nconvulsions in some animals. Exposure in plasma, liver and brain was considerably higher than in \nadult rats after comparable doses in mg/kg between days 5 and 11 of age. After day 23 of life, the \nexposure was comparable to that in adult rats. The increased exposure was likely at least partly due to \nimmaturity of the drug-metabolising enzymes in juvenile animals. No treatment related mortalities \nwere noted in juvenile rats dosed at 1,000 mg/kg darunavir (single dose) on day 26 of age or at \n500 mg/kg (repeated dose) from day 23 to 50 of age, and the exposures and toxicity profile were \ncomparable to those observed in adult rats.\n\nDue to uncertainties regarding the rate of development of the human blood brain barrier and liver \nenzymes, PREZISTA with low dose ritonavir should not be used in paediatric patients below 3 years \nof age.\n\nDarunavir was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats up \nto 104 weeks. Daily doses of 150, 450 and 1,000 mg/kg were administered to mice and doses of 50, \n150 and 500 mg/kg were administered to rats. Dose-related increases in the incidences of \nhepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were observed in males and females of both species. Thyroid \nfollicular cell adenomas were noted in male rats. Administration of darunavir did not cause a \nstatistically significant increase in the incidence of any other benign or malignant neoplasm in mice or \nrats. The observed hepatocellular and thyroid tumours in rodents are considered to be of limited \nrelevance to humans. Repeated administration of darunavir to rats caused hepatic microsomal enzyme \ninduction and increased thyroid hormone elimination, which predispose rats, but not humans, to \nthyroid neoplasms. At the highest tested doses, the systemic exposures (based on AUC) to darunavir \nwere between 0.4- and 0.7-fold (mice) and 0.7- and 1-fold (rats), relative to those observed in humans \nat the recommended therapeutic doses.\n\nAfter 2 years administration of darunavir at exposures at or below the human exposure, kidney \nchanges were observed in mice (nephrosis) and rats (chronic progressive nephropathy).\n\nDarunavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including \nbacterial reverse mutation (Ames), chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes and in vivo\nmicronucleus test in mice.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPREZISTA, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other \nantiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV-1) infection (see section 4.2).\n\nPREZISTA 75 mg, 150 mg, and 600 mg tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens (see \nsection 4.2):\n For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral treatment (ART)-experienced adult \n\npatients, including those that have been highly pre-treated.\n For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least \n\n15 kg body weight.\n\nIn deciding to initiate treatment with PREZISTA co-administered with low dose ritonavir, careful \nconsideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of \nmutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and \ntreatment history should guide the use of PREZISTA (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n\n\n45\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a health care provider experienced in the management of HIV \ninfection. After therapy with PREZISTA has been initiated, patients should be advised not to alter the \ndosage, dose form or discontinue therapy without discussing with their health care provider.\n\nPosology\nPREZISTA must always be given orally with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer and in \ncombination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. The Summary of Product Characteristics of \nritonavir must, therefore, be consulted prior to initiation of therapy with PREZISTA.\n\nPREZISTA is also available as an oral suspension for use in patients who are unable to swallow \nPREZISTA tablets (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for PREZISTA oral \nsuspension).\n\nART-experienced adult patients\nThe recommended dose regimen is 600 mg twice daily taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily taken \nwith food. PREZISTA 75 mg, 150 mg, and 600 mg tablets can be used to construct the twice daily \n600 mg regimen.\n\nThe use of 75 mg and 150 mg tablets to achieve the recommended dose is appropriate when there is a \npossibility of hypersensitivity to specific colouring agents, or difficulty in swallowing the 600 mg \ntablets.\n\nART-naïve adult patients\nFor dosage recommendations in ART-naïve patients see the Summary of Product Characteristics for \nPREZISTA 400 mg and 800 mg tablets.\n\nART-naïve paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg)\nThe weight-based dose of PREZISTA and ritonavir in paediatric patients is provided in the table \nbelow.\n\nRecommended dose for treatment-naïve paediatric patients (3 to 17 years) with PREZISTA \ntablets and ritonavira\n\nBody weight (kg) Dose (once daily with food)\n≥ 15 kg to < 30 kg 600 mg PREZISTA/100 mg ritonavir once daily\n≥ 30 kg to < 40 kg 675 mg PREZISTA/100 mg ritonavir once daily\n≥ 40 kg 800 mg PREZISTA/100 mg ritonavir once daily\na\n\nritonavir oral solution: 80 mg/ml\n\nART-experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg)\nPREZISTA twice daily taken with ritonavir taken with food is usually recommended.\n\nA once daily dose regimen of PREZISTA taken with ritonavir taken with food may be used in patients \nwith prior exposure to antiretroviral medicinal products but without darunavir resistance associated \nmutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell \ncount ≥ 100 cells x 106/l.\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V\n\nThe weight-based dose of PREZISTA and ritonavir in paediatric patients is provided in the table \nbelow. The recommended dose of PREZISTA with low dose ritonavir should not exceed the \nrecommended adult dose (600/100 mg twice daily or 800/100 mg once daily).\n\n\n\n46\n\nRecommended dose for treatment-experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years) with\nPREZISTA tablets and ritonavira\n\nBody weight (kg) Dose (once daily with food) Dose (twice daily with food)\n≥ 15 kg–< 30 kg 600 mg PREZISTA/100 mg ritonavir \n\nonce daily\n375 mg PREZISTA/50 mg ritonavir \ntwice daily\n\n≥ 30 kg–< 40 kg 675 mg PREZISTA/100 mg ritonavir \nonce daily\n\n450 mg PREZISTA/60 mg ritonavir \ntwice daily\n\n≥ 40 kg 800 mg PREZISTA/100 mg ritonavir \nonce daily\n\n600 mg PREZISTA/100 mg ritonavir \ntwice daily\n\na\nritonavir oral solution: 80 mg/ml\n\nFor ART-experienced paediatric patients HIV genotypic testing is recommended. However, when HIV \ngenotypic testing is not feasible, the PREZISTA/ritonavir once daily dosing regimen is recommended \nin HIV protease inhibitor-naïve paediatric patients and the twice daily dosing regimen is \nrecommended in HIV protease inhibitor-experienced patients.\n\nThe use of only 75 mg and 150 mg tablets or the 100 mg/ml oral suspension to achieve the \nrecommended dose of PREZISTA could be appropriate when there is a possibility of hypersensitivity \nto specific colouring agents.\n\nAdvice on missed doses\nIn case a dose of PREZISTA and/or ritonavir is missed within 6 hours of the time it is usually taken, \npatients should be instructed to take the prescribed dose of PREZISTA and ritonavir with food as soon \nas possible. If this is noticed later than 6 hours after the time it is usually taken, the missed dose should \nnot be taken and the patient should resume the usual dosing schedule.\n\nThis guidance is based on the 15 hour half-life of darunavir in the presence of ritonavir and the \nrecommended dosing interval of approximately 12 hours.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nLimited information is available in this population, and therefore, PREZISTA should be used with \ncaution in this age group (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nDarunavir is metabolised by the hepatic system. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with \nmild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, however, \nPREZISTA should be used with caution in these patients. No pharmacokinetic data are available in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment could result in an increase of \ndarunavir exposure and a worsening of its safety profile. Therefore, PREZISTA must not be used in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nPREZISTA/ritonavir should not be used in children with a body weight of less than 15 kg as the dose \nfor this population has not been established in a sufficient number of patients (see section 5.1). \nPREZISTA/ritonavir should not be used in children below 3 years of age because of safety concerns \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.3).\n\nThe weight-based dose regimen for PREZISTA and ritonavir is provided in the tables above.\n\n\n\n47\n\nPregnancy and postpartum\nNo dose adjustment is required for darunavir/ritonavir during pregnancy and postpartum. \nPREZISTA/ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk (see sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.2).\n\nMethod of administration\nPatients should be instructed to take PREZISTA with low dose ritonavir within 30 minutes after \ncompletion of a meal. The type of food does not affect the exposure to darunavir (see sections 4.4, 4.5 \nand 5.2).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nPatients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.\n\nCombination of rifampicin with PREZISTA with concomitant low dose ritonavir (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with the combination product lopinavir/ritonavir (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with herbal preparations containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nCo-administration of PREZISTA with low dose ritonavir, with active substances that are highly \ndependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with \nserious and/or life-threatening events. These active substances include e.g.:\n- alfuzosin\n- amiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine, quinidine, ranolazine\n- astemizole, terfenadine\n- colchicine when used in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see section 4.5)\n- ergot derivatives (e.g. dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergonovine)\n- elbasvir/grazoprevir\n- cisapride\n- dapoxetine\n- domperidone\n- naloxegol\n- lurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine, sertindole (see section 4.5)\n- triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, \n\nsee section 4.5)\n- sildenafil - when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, avanafil\n- simvastatin, lovastatin and lomitapide (see section 4.5)\n- dabigatran, ticagrelor (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nRegular assessment of virological response is advised. In the setting of lack or loss of virological \nresponse, resistance testing should be performed.\n\nPREZISTA must always be given orally with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer and in \ncombination with other antiretroviral medicinal products (see section 5.2). The Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of ritonavir as appropriate, must therefore be consulted prior to initiation of therapy \nwith PREZISTA.\n\n\n\n48\n\nIncreasing the dose of ritonavir from that recommended in section 4.2 did not significantly affect \ndarunavir concentrations It is not recommended to alter the dose of ritonavir.\n\nDarunavir binds predominantly to 1-acid glycoprotein. This protein binding is \nconcentration-dependent indicative for saturation of binding. Therefore, protein displacement of \nmedicinal products highly bound to 1-acid glycoprotein cannot be ruled out (see section 4.5).\n\nART-experienced patients – once daily dosing\nPREZISTA used in combination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir once daily in ART-experienced \npatients should not be used in patients with one or more darunavir resistance associated mutations \n(DRV-RAMs) or HIV-1 RNA ≥ 100,000 copies/ml or CD4+ cell count < 100 cells x 106/l (see section \n4.2). Combinations with optimised background regimen (OBRs) other than ≥ 2 NRTIs have not been \nstudied in this population. Limited data are available in patients with HIV-1 clades other than B (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nPaediatric population\nPREZISTA is not recommended for use in paediatric patients below 3 years of age or less than 15 kg \nbody weight (see sections 4.2 and 5.3).\n\nPregnancy\nPREZISTA/ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. Caution should be used in pregnant women with concomitant medications which may \nfurther decrease darunavir exposure (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).\n\nElderly\nAs limited information is available on the use of PREZISTA in patients aged 65 and over, caution \nshould be exercised in the administration of PREZISTA in elderly patients, reflecting the greater \nfrequency of decreased hepatic function and of concomitant disease or other therapy (see sections 4.2 \nand 5.2).\n\nSevere skin reactions\nDuring the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N=3,063), severe skin reactions, which \nmay be accompanied with fever and/or elevations of transaminases, have been reported in 0.4% of \npatients. DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome has been rarely (< 0.1%) reported, and during post-marketing experience toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis and acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. PREZISTA should be \ndiscontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include,\nbut are not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or \njoint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia.\n\nRash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing \nPREZISTA/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to patients receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir without \nraltegravir or raltegravir without PREZISTA (see section 4.8).\n\nDarunavir contains a sulphonamide moiety. PREZISTA should be used with caution in patients with a \nknown sulphonamide allergy.\n\nHepatotoxicity\nDrug-induced hepatitis (e.g. acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with PREZISTA. \nDuring the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N=3,063), hepatitis was reported in \n0.5% of patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir. Patients with \npre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for \nliver function abnormalities including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of\nconcomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for \nthese medicinal products.\n\n\n\n49\n\nAppropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with \nPREZISTA/ritonavir and patients should be monitored during treatment. Increased AST/ALT \nmonitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients \nwho have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first several months of \nPREZISTA/ritonavir treatment.\n\nIf there is evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of \nliver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver \ntenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients using PREZISTA/ritonavir, interruption or discontinuation of \ntreatment should be considered promptly.\n\nPatients with coexisting conditions\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe safety and efficacy of PREZISTA have not been established in patients with severe underlying \nliver disorders and PREZISTA is therefore contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nDue to an increase in the unbound darunavir plasma concentrations, PREZISTA should be used with \ncaution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo special precautions or dose adjustments for darunavir/ritonavir are required in patients with renal \nimpairment. As darunavir and ritonavir are highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that they \nwill be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Therefore, no special \nprecautions or dose adjustments are required in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nHaemophiliac patients\nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthrosis in patients with haemophilia type A and B treated with PIs. In some patients additional \nfactor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with PIs was continued or \nreintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship has been suggested, although \nthe mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should, therefore, be made \naware of the possibility of increased bleeding.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.\n\nOsteonecrosis\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant \nexamples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and \npneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any \ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. In addition, \nreactivation of herpes simplex and herpes zoster has been observed in clinical studies with PREZISTA \nco-administered with low dose ritonavir.\n\n\n\n50\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).\n\nInteractions with medicinal products\nSeveral of the interaction studies have been performed with darunavir at lower than recommended \ndoses. The effects on co-administered medicinal products may thus be underestimated and clinical \nmonitoring of safety may be indicated. For full information on interactions with other medicinal \nproducts see section 4.5.\n\nEfavirenz in combination with boosted PREZISTA once daily may result in sub-optimal darunavir \nCmin. If efavirenz is to be used in combination with PREZISTA, the PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg \ntwice daily regimen should be used (see section 4.5).\n\nLife-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp; see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nPREZISTA 600 mg tablets contain sunset yellow FCF (E110) which may cause an allergic reaction.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nMedicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boosted with ritonavir\nDarunavir and ritonavir are inhibitors of CYP3A, CYP2D6 and P-gp. Co-administration of \ndarunavir/ritonavir with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A and/or CYP2D6 or \ntransported by P-gp may result in increased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which \ncould increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.\n\nPREZISTA co-administered with low dose ritonavir must not be combined with medicinal products \nthat are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which increased systemic exposure is\nassociated with serious and/or life-threatening events (narrow therapeutic index) (see section 4.3).\n\nThe overall pharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14-fold increase in \nthe systemic exposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in \ncombination with ritonavir at 100 mg twice daily. Therefore, PREZISTA must only be used in \ncombination with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nA clinical study utilising a cocktail of medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochromes \nCYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and \ninhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, which may be attributed to the \npresence of low dose ritonavir. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with medicinal products \nwhich are primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 (such as flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol) may result \nin increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their \ntherapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with medicinal \nproducts primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 (such as warfarin) and CYP2C19 (such as methadone) \nmay result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or \nshorten their therapeutic effect.\n\nAlthough the effect on CYP2C8 has only been studied in vitro, co-administration of darunavir and \nritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 (such as paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, \nrepaglinide) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could \ndecrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.\n\n\n\n51\n\nRitonavir inhibits the transporters P-glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and co-administration \nwith substrates of these transporters can result in increased plasma concentrations of these compounds \n(e.g. dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, statins and bosentan; see the Interaction table below).\n\nMedicinal products that affect darunavir/ritonavir exposure\nDarunavir and ritonavir are metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity \nwould be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, resulting in lowered plasma \nconcentrations of darunavir and ritonavir (e.g. rifampicin, St John’s wort, lopinavir). \nCo-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may \ndecrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir and may result in increased plasma concentrations of \ndarunavir and ritonavir (e.g. indinavir, azole antifungals like clotrimazole). These interactions are \ndescribed in the interaction table below.\n\nInteraction table\nInteractions between PREZISTA/ritonavir and antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral medicinal products \nare listed in the table below. The direction of the arrow for each pharmacokinetic parameter is based \non the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio being within (↔), below (↓) or above (↑) \nthe 80-125% range (not determined as “ND”).\n\nSeveral of the interaction studies (indicated by # in the table below) have been performed at lower than \nrecommended doses of darunavir or with a different dosing regimen (see section 4.2 Posology). The \neffects on co-administered medicinal products may thus be underestimated and clinical monitoring of \nsafety may be indicated.\n\nThe below list of examples of drug drug interactions is not comprehensive and therefore the label of \neach drug that is co-administered with PREZISTA should be consulted for information related to the \nroute of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with \nregards to co-administration.\n\nINTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS\nMedicinal products by \ntherapeutic areas\n\nInteraction\nGeometric mean change (%)\n\nRecommendations concerning \nco-administration\n\nHIV ANTIRETROVIRALS\nIntegrase strand transfer inhibitors\n\nDolutegravir dolutegravir AUC ↓ 22%\ndolutegravir C24h ↓ 38%\ndolutegravir Cmax ↓ 11%\ndarunavir ↔*\n* Using cross-study comparisons to historical \npharmacokinetic data\n\nPREZISTA co-administered with \nlow dose ritonavir and dolutegravir \ncan be used without dose \nadjustment.\n\nRaltegravir Some clinical studies suggest raltegravir \nmay cause a modest decrease in \ndarunavir plasma concentrations.\n\nAt present the effect of raltegravir \non darunavir plasma \nconcentrations does not appear to \nbe clinically relevant.

Studies in animals do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).\n\nPREZISTA co-administered with low dose ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the \npotential benefit justifies the potential risk.\n\n\n\n65\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether darunavir is excreted in human milk. Studies in rats have demonstrated that \ndarunavir is excreted in milk and at high levels (1,000 mg/kg/day) resulted in toxicity. Because of both \nthe potential for HIV transmission and the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, mothers \nshould be instructed not to breast-feed under any circumstances if they are receiving PREZISTA.\n\nFertility\nNo human data on the effect of darunavir on fertility are available. There was no effect on mating or \nfertility with darunavir treatment in rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPREZISTA in combination with ritonavir has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use \nmachines. However, dizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens \ncontaining PREZISTA co-administered with low dose ritonavir and should be borne in mind when \nconsidering a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nDuring the clinical development program (N=2,613 treatment-experienced subjects who initiated \ntherapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily), 51.3% of subjects experienced at least one \nadverse reaction. The total mean treatment duration for subjects was 95.3 weeks. The most frequent \nadverse reactions reported in clinical trials and as spontaneous reports are diarrhoea, nausea, rash, \nheadache and vomiting. The most frequent serious reactions are acute renal failure, myocardial \ninfarction, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, \ndiarrhoea, hepatitis and pyrexia.\n\nIn the 96 week analysis, the safety profile of PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily in \ntreatment-naïve subjects was similar to that seen with PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily in \ntreatment-experienced subjects except for nausea which was observed more frequently in \ntreatment-naïve subjects. This was driven by mild intensity nausea.

In cases of severe skin reaction see the warning in \nsection 4.4.\n\nDuring the clinical development program of raltegravir in treatment-experienced patients, rash, \nirrespective of causality, was more commonly observed with regimens containing \nPREZISTA/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to those containing PREZISTA/ritonavir without \nraltegravir or raltegravir without PREZISTA/ritonavir. Rash considered by the investigator to be \ndrug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9, \n4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3 \nper 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity \nand did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nMetabolic parameters\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nMusculoskeletal abnormalities\nIncreased CPK, myalgia, myositis and rarely, rhabdomyolysis have been reported with the use of \nprotease inhibitors, particularly in combination with NRTIs.\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nBleeding in haemophiliac patients\nThere have been reports of increased spontaneous bleeding in haemophiliac patients receiving \nantiretroviral protease inhibitors (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety assessment in paediatric patients is based on the 48-week analysis of safety data from three \nPhase II trials. The following patient populations were evaluated (see section 5.1):\n 80 ART-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 6 to 17 years and weighing at \n\nleast 20 kg who received PREZISTA tablets with low dose ritonavir twice daily in combination \nwith other antiretroviral agents.\n\n 21 ART-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 3 to < 6 years and weighing \n10 kg to < 20 kg (16 participants from 15 kg to < 20 kg) who received PREZISTA oral \nsuspension with low dose ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents.\n\n 12 ART-naïve HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 12 to 17 years and weighing at least \n40 kg who received PREZISTA tablets with low dose ritonavir once daily in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents (see section 5.1).\n\nOverall, the safety profile in these paediatric patients was similar to that observed in the adult \npopulation.\n\n\n\n69\n\nOther special populations\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus\nAmong 1,968 treatment-experienced patients receiving PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir \n600/100 mg twice daily, 236 patients were co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Co-infected patients were \nmore likely to have baseline and treatment emergent hepatic transaminase elevations than those \nwithout chronic viral hepatitis (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nHuman experience of acute overdose with PREZISTA co-administered with low dose ritonavir is \nlimited. Single doses up to 3,200 mg of darunavir as oral solution alone and up to 1,600 mg of the \ntablet formulation of darunavir in combination with ritonavir have been administered to healthy \nvolunteers without untoward symptomatic effects.\n\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with PREZISTA. Treatment of overdose with PREZISTA \nconsists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient. Since darunavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be \nbeneficial in significant removal of the active substance.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE10.\n\nMechanism of action\nDarunavir is an inhibitor of the dimerisation and of the catalytic activity of the HIV-1 protease\n(KD of 4.5 x 10\n\n-12M). It selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded Gag-Pol polyproteins in virus \ninfected cells, thereby preventing the formation of mature infectious virus particles.\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\nDarunavir exhibits activity against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 and laboratory \nstrains of HIV-2 in acutely infected T-cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and \nhuman monocytes/macrophages with median EC50 values ranging from 1.2 to 8.5 nM (0.7 to\n5.0 ng/ml). Darunavir demonstrates antiviral activity in vitro against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M \n(A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and group O primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from < 0.1 to 4.3 nM.\n\nThese EC50 values are well below the 50% cellular toxicity concentration range of 87 µM to \n> 100 µM.\n\nResistance\nIn vitro selection of darunavir-resistant virus from wild type HIV-1 was lengthy (> 3 years). The \nselected viruses were unable to grow in the presence of darunavir concentrations above 400 nM. \nViruses selected in these conditions and showing decreased susceptibility to darunavir (range: \n23-50-fold) harboured 2 to 4 amino acid substitutions in the protease gene. The decreased \nsusceptibility to darunavir of the emerging viruses in the selection experiment could not be explained \nby the emergence of these protease mutations.\n\nThe clinical trial data from ART-experienced patients (TITAN trial and the pooled analysis of the \nPOWER 1, 2 and 3 and DUET 1 and 2 trials) showed that virologic response to PREZISTA\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n70\n\nco-administered with low dose ritonavir was decreased when 3 or more darunavir RAMs (V11I, V32I, \nL33F, I47V, I50V, I54L or M, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V) were present at baseline or when these \nmutations developed during treatment.\n\nIncreasing baseline darunavir fold change in EC50 (FC) was associated with decreasing virologic \nresponse. A lower and upper clinical cut-off of 10 and 40 were identified. Isolates with baseline FC \n≤ 10 are susceptible; isolates with FC > 10 to 40 have decreased susceptibility; isolates with FC > 40\nare resistant (see Clinical results).\n\nViruses isolated from patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily experiencing virologic \nfailure by rebound that were susceptible to tipranavir at baseline remained susceptible to tipranavir \nafter treatment in the vast majority of cases.\n\nThe lowest rates of developing resistant HIV virus are observed in ART-naïve patients who are treated \nfor the first time with darunavir in combination with other ART.\n\nThe table below shows the development of HIV-1 protease mutations and loss of susceptibility to PIs \nin virologic failures at endpoint in the ARTEMIS, ODIN and TITAN trials.\n\nARTEMIS\nWeek 192\n\nODIN\nWeek 48\n\nTITAN\nWeek 48\n\nPREZISTA/\nritonavir\n\n800/100 mg\nonce daily\n\nN=343\n\nPREZISTA/\nritonavir\n\n800/100 mg\nonce daily\n\nN=294\n\nPREZISTA/\nritonavir\n\n600/100 mg\ntwice daily\n\nN=296\n\nPREZISTA/\nritonavir\n\n600/100 mg\ntwice daily\n\nN=298\nTotal number of \nvirologic failures\n\na\n, n \n\n(%)\n\n55 (16.0%) 65 (22.1%) 54 (18.2%) 31 (10.4%)\n\nRebounders 39 (11.4%) 11 (3.7%) 11 (3.7%) 16 (5.4%)\nNever suppressed \nsubjects\n\n16 (4.7%) 54 (18.4%) 43 (14.5%) 15 (5.0%)\n\nNumber of subjects with virologic failure and paired baseline/endpoint genotypes, developing mutations\nb\n\nat \nendpoint, n/N\n\nPrimary (major) PI \nmutations\n\n0/43 1/60 0/42 6/28\n\nPI RAMs 4/43 7/60 4/42 10/28\nNumber of subjects with virologic failure and paired baseline/endpoint phenotypes, showing loss of \nsusceptibility to PIs at endpoint compared to baseline, n/N\nPI\n\ndarunavir 0/39 1/58 0/41 3/26\namprenavir 0/39 1/58 0/40 0/22\natazanavir 0/39 2/56 0/40 0/22\nindinavir 0/39 2/57 0/40 1/24\nlopinavir 0/39 1/58 0/40 0/23\nsaquinavir 0/39 0/56 0/40 0/22\ntipranavir 0/39 0/58 0/41 1/25\n\na\nTLOVR non-VF censored algorithm based on HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml, except for TITAN (HIV-1 RNA \n< 400 copies/ml)\n\nb\nIAS-USA lists\n\nCross-resistance\nDarunavir FC was less than 10 for 90% of 3,309 clinical isolates resistant to amprenavir, atazanavir, \nindinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir and/or tipranavir showing that viruses resistant to \nmost PIs remain susceptible to darunavir.\n\nIn the virologic failures of the ARTEMIS trial no cross-resistance with other PIs was observed.\n\n\n\n71\n\nClinical results\n\nAdult patients\nFor clinical trial results in ART-naïve adult patients, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics \nfor PREZISTA 400 mg and 800 mg tablets or 100 mg/ml oral suspension.\n\nEfficacy of PREZISTA 600 mg twice daily co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily in \nART-experienced patients\nThe evidence of efficacy of PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) in \nART-experienced patients is based on the 96 weeks analysis of the Phase III trial TITAN in \nART-experienced lopinavir naïve patients, on the 48 week analysis of the Phase III trial ODIN in \nART-experienced patients with no DRV-RAMs, and on the analyses of 96 weeks data from the \nPhase IIb trials POWER 1 and 2 in ART-experienced patients with high level of PI resistance.\n\nTITAN is a randomised, controlled, open-label Phase III trial comparing PREZISTA co-administered\nwith ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) versus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) in \nART-experienced, lopinavir naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients.

Of the 44 patients \ntaking ritonavir oral solution, 27 switched to the 100 mg capsule formulation and exceeded the \nweight-based ritonavir dose without changes in observed safety.\n\n\n\n74\n\nDELPHI\n\nOutcomes at week 48\nPREZISTA/ritonavir\n\nN=80\nHIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mla 47.5% (38)\nCD4+ cell count mean change from baselineb 147\na\n\nImputations according to the TLOVR algorithm.\nb\n\nNon-completer is failure imputation: patients who discontinued prematurely are imputed with a change equal to 0.\n\nAccording to the TLOVR non-virologic failure censored algorithm 24 (30.0%) patients experienced \nvirological failure, of which 17 (21.3%) patients were rebounders and 7 (8.8%) patients were \nnon-responders.\n\nART-experienced paediatric patients from the age of 3 to < 6 years\nThe pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and efficacy of PREZISTA/ritonavir twice daily in \ncombination with other antiretroviral agents in 21 ART-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients \naged 3 to < 6 years and weighing 10 kg to < 20 kg was evaluated in an open-label, Phase II trial, \nARIEL. Patients received a weight-based twice daily treatment regimen, patients weighing 10 kg to \n< 15 kg received darunavir/ritonavir 25/3 mg/kg twice daily, and patients weighing 15 kg to < 20 kg\nreceived darunavir/ritonavir 375/50 mg twice daily. At week 48, the virologic response, defined as the \npercentage of patients with confirmed plasma viral load < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml, was evaluated in \n16 paediatric patients 15 kg to < 20 kg and 5 paediatric patients 10 kg to < 15 kg receiving \nPREZISTA/ritonavir in combination with other antiretroviral agents (see section 4.2 for dosage \nrecommendations per body weight).\n\nARIEL\nOutcomes at week 48 PREZISTA/ritonavir\n\n10 kg to < 15 kg\nN=5\n\n15 kg to < 20 kg\nN=16\n\nHIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mla 80.0% (4) 81.3% (13)\nCD4+ percent change from baselineb 4 4\nCD4+ cell count mean change from baselineb 16 241\na\n\nImputations according to the TLOVR algorithm.\nb\n\nNC=F\n\nLimited efficacy data are available in paediatric patients below 15 kg and no recommendation on a \nposology can be made.\n\nPregnancy and postpartum\nDarunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily or 800/100 mg once daily) in combination with a \nbackground regimen was evaluated in a clinical trial of 36 pregnant women (18 in each arm) during \nthe second and third trimesters, and postpartum. Virologic response was preserved throughout the \nstudy period in both arms. No mother to child transmission occurred in the infants born to the \n31 subjects who stayed on the antiretroviral treatment through delivery. There were no new clinically \nrelevant safety findings compared with the known safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir in HIV-1 \ninfected adults (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of darunavir, co-administered with ritonavir, have been evaluated in \nhealthy adult volunteers and in HIV-1 infected patients. Exposure to darunavir was higher in HIV-1 \ninfected patients than in healthy subjects. The increased exposure to darunavir in HIV-1 infected \npatients compared to healthy subjects may be explained by the higher concentrations of α1-acid \nglycoprotein (AAG) in HIV-1 infected patients, resulting in higher darunavir binding to plasma AAG \nand, therefore, higher plasma concentrations.\n\n\n\n75\n\nDarunavir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A, thereby increasing the \nplasma concentrations of darunavir considerably.\n\nAbsorption\nDarunavir was rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Maximum plasma concentration of \ndarunavir in the presence of low dose ritonavir is generally achieved within 2.5-4.0 hours.\n\nThe absolute oral bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of darunavir alone was approximately 37% \nand increased to approximately 82% in the presence of 100 mg twice daily ritonavir. The overall \npharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14-fold increase in the systemic \nexposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with \nritonavir at 100 mg twice daily (see section 4.4).\n\nWhen administered without food, the relative bioavailability of darunavir in the presence of low dose \nritonavir is 30% lower as compared to intake with food. Therefore, PREZISTA tablets should be taken \nwith ritonavir and with food. The type of food does not affect exposure to darunavir.\n\nDistribution\nDarunavir is approximately 95% bound to plasma protein. Darunavir binds primarily to plasma α1-acid \nglycoprotein.\n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the volume of distribution of darunavir alone was 88.1 ± 59.0 l \n(Mean ± SD) and increased to 131 ± 49.9 l (Mean ± SD) in the presence of 100 mg twice-daily \nritonavir.\n\nBiotransformation\nIn vitro experiments with human liver microsomes (HLMs) indicate that darunavir primarily \nundergoes oxidative metabolism. Darunavir is extensively metabolised by the hepatic CYP system and \nalmost exclusively by isozyme CYP3A4. A 14C-darunavir trial in healthy volunteers showed that a \nmajority of the radioactivity in plasma after a single 400/100 mg darunavir with ritonavir dose was due \nto the parent active substance. At least 3 oxidative metabolites of darunavir have been identified in \nhumans; all showed activity that was at least 10-fold less than the activity of darunavir against wild \ntype HIV.\n\nElimination\nAfter a 400/100 mg 14C-darunavir with ritonavir dose, approximately 79.5% and 13.9% of the \nadministered dose of 14C-darunavir could be retrieved in faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged \ndarunavir accounted for approximately 41.2% and 7.7% of the administered dose in faeces and urine, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of darunavir was approximately 15 hours when \ncombined with ritonavir.\nThe intravenous clearance of darunavir alone (150 mg) and in the presence of low dose ritonavir was \n32.8 l/h and 5.9 l/h, respectively.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken twice daily in \n74 treatment-experienced paediatric patients, aged 6 to 17 years and weighing at least 20 kg, showed \nthat the administered weight-based doses of PREZISTA/ritonavir resulted in darunavir exposure \ncomparable to that in adults receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily (see section 4.2).\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken twice daily in\n14 treatment-experienced paediatric patients, aged 3 to < 6 years and weighing at least 15 kg to \n< 20 kg, showed that weight-based dosages resulted in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that \nachieved in adults receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily (see section 4.2).\n\n\n\n76\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken once daily in 12 ART-naïve \npaediatric patients, aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg, showed that \nPREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily results in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that \nachieved in adults receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily. Therefore the same once \ndaily dosage may be used in treatment-experienced adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing at \nleast 40 kg without darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma \nHIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.2).\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken once daily in \n10 treatment-experienced paediatric patients, aged 3 to < 6 years and weighing at least 14 kg to \n< 20 kg, showed that weight-based dosages resulted in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that \nachieved in adults receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily (see section 4.2). In addition, \npharmacokinetic modeling and simulation of darunavir exposures in paediatric patients across the ages \nof 3 to < 18 years confirmed the darunavir exposures as observed in the clinical studies and allowed \nthe identification of weight-based PREZISTA/ritonavir once daily dosing regimens for paediatric \npatients weighing at least 15 kg that are either ART-naïve or treatment-experienced paediatric patients \nwithout DRV-RAMs* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count \n≥ 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.2).\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V\n\nElderly\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV infected patients showed that darunavir pharmacokinetics \nare not considerably different in the age range (18 to 75 years) evaluated in HIV infected patients \n(n=12, age ≥ 65) (see section 4.4). However, only limited data were available in patients above the age \nof 65 year.\n\nGender\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed a slightly higher darunavir exposure (16.8%) in HIV \ninfected females compared to males. This difference is not clinically relevant.\n\nRenal impairment\nResults from a mass balance study with 14C-darunavir with ritonavir showed that approximately 7.7% \nof the administered dose of darunavir is excreted in the urine unchanged.\n\nAlthough darunavir has not been studied in patients with renal impairment, population \npharmacokinetic analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of darunavir were not significantly \naffected in HIV infected patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl between 30-60 ml/min, n=20) \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nDarunavir is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. In a multiple dose study with \nPREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg) twice daily, it was demonstrated that the total \nplasma concentrations of darunavir in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, n=8) and moderate \n(Child-Pugh Class B, n=8) hepatic impairment were comparable with those in healthy subjects. \nHowever, unbound darunavir concentrations were approximately 55% (Child-Pugh Class A) and \n100% (Child-Pugh Class B) higher, respectively. The clinical relevance of this increase is unknown \ntherefore, PREZISTA should be used with caution. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of darunavir has not been studied (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nPregnancy and postpartum\nThe exposure to total darunavir and ritonavir after intake of darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice \ndaily and darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen was generally \nlower during pregnancy compared with postpartum. However, for unbound (i.e. active) darunavir, the \npharmacokinetic parameters were less reduced during pregnancy compared to postpartum, due to an \nincrease in the unbound fraction of darunavir during pregnancy compared to postpartum.\n\n\n\n77\n\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/ritonavir at \n600/100 mg twice daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum\nPharmacokinetics of \ntotal darunavir\n(mean ± SD)\n\nSecond trimester of \npregnancy\n\n(n=12)a\n\nThird trimester of \npregnancy\n\n(n=12)\n\nPostpartum \n(6-12 weeks)\n\n(n=12)\nCmax, ng/ml 4,668 ± 1,097 5,328 ± 1,631 6,659 ± 2,364\nAUC12h, ng.h/ml 39,370 ± 9,597 45,880 ± 17,360 56,890 ± 26,340\nCmin, ng/ml 1,922 ± 825 2,661 ± 1,269 2,851 ± 2,216\na\n\nn=11 for AUC12h\n\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/ritonavir at \n800/100 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum\nPharmacokinetics of \ntotal darunavir\n(mean ± SD)\n\nSecond trimester of \npregnancy\n\n(n=17)\n\nThird Trimester of \npregnancy\n\n(n=15)\n\nPostpartum \n(6-12 weeks)\n\n(n=16)\nCmax, ng/ml 4,964 ± 1,505 5,132 ± 1,198 7,310 ± 1,704\nAUC24h, ng.h/ml 62,289 ± 16,234 61,112 ± 13,790 92,116 ± 29,241\nCmin, ng/ml 1,248 ± 542 1,075 ± 594 1,473 ± 1,141\n\nIn women receiving darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily during the second trimester of \npregnancy, mean intra-individual values for total darunavir Cmax, AUC12h and Cmin were 28%, 26% and \n26% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total \ndarunavir Cmax, AUC12h and Cmin values were 18%, 16% lower and 2% higher, respectively, as \ncompared with postpartum.\n\nIn women receiving darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily during the second trimester of \npregnancy, mean intra-individual values for total darunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin were 33%, 31% and \n30% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total \ndarunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were 29%, 32% and 50% lower, respectively, as compared \nwith postpartum.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAnimal toxicology studies have been conducted at exposures up to clinical exposure levels with \ndarunavir alone, in mice, rats and dogs and in combination with ritonavir in rats and dogs.\n\nIn repeated-dose toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs, there were only limited effects of treatment \nwith darunavir. In rodents the target organs identified were the haematopoietic system, the blood \ncoagulation system, liver and thyroid. A variable but limited decrease in red blood cell-related \nparameters was observed, together with increases in activated partial thromboplastin time.\n\nChanges were observed in liver (hepatocyte hypertrophy, vacuolation, increased liver enzymes) and \nthyroid (follicular hypertrophy). In the rat, the combination of darunavir with ritonavir lead to a small \nincrease in effect on RBC parameters, liver and thyroid and increased incidence of islet fibrosis in the \npancreas (in male rats only) compared to treatment with darunavir alone. In the dog, no major toxicity \nfindings or target organs were identified up to exposures equivalent to clinical exposure at the \nrecommended dose.\n\nIn a study conducted in rats, the number of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased in the \npresence of maternal toxicity. Otherwise, there were no effects on mating or fertility with darunavir \ntreatment up to 1,000 mg/kg/day and exposure levels below (AUC-0.5 fold) of that in human at the \nclinically recommended dose. Up to same dose levels, there was no teratogenicity with darunavir in \nrats and rabbits when treated alone nor in mice when treated in combination with ritonavir. The \nexposure levels were lower than those with the recommended clinical dose in humans. In a pre- and \npostnatal development assessment in rats, darunavir with and without ritonavir, caused a transient \n\n\n\n78\n\nreduction in body weight gain of the offspring pre-weaning and there was a slight delay in the opening \nof eyes and ears. Darunavir in combination with ritonavir caused a reduction in the number of pups \nthat exhibited the startle response on day 15 of lactation and a reduced pup survival during lactation. \nThese effects may be secondary to pup exposure to the active substance via the milk and/or maternal \ntoxicity. No post weaning functions were affected with darunavir alone or in combination with \nritonavir. In juvenile rats receiving darunavir up to days 23-26, increased mortality was observed with \nconvulsions in some animals. Exposure in plasma, liver and brain was considerably higher than in \nadult rats after comparable doses in mg/kg between days 5 and 11 of age. After day 23 of life, the \nexposure was comparable to that in adult rats. The increased exposure was likely at least partly due to \nimmaturity of the drug-metabolising enzymes in juvenile animals. No treatment related mortalities \nwere noted in juvenile rats dosed at 1,000 mg/kg darunavir (single dose) on day 26 of age or at \n500 mg/kg (repeated dose) from day 23 to 50 of age, and the exposures and toxicity profile were \ncomparable to those observed in adult rats.\n\nDue to uncertainties regarding the rate of development of the human blood brain barrier and liver \nenzymes, PREZISTA with low dose ritonavir should not be used in paediatric patients below 3 years \nof age.\n\nDarunavir was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats up \nto 104 weeks. Daily doses of 150, 450 and 1,000 mg/kg were administered to mice and doses of 50, \n150 and 500 mg/kg were administered to rats. Dose-related increases in the incidences of \nhepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were observed in males and females of both species. Thyroid \nfollicular cell adenomas were noted in male rats. Administration of darunavir did not cause a \nstatistically significant increase in the incidence of any other benign or malignant neoplasm in mice or \nrats. The observed hepatocellular and thyroid tumours in rodents are considered to be of limited \nrelevance to humans. Repeated administration of darunavir to rats caused hepatic microsomal enzyme \ninduction and increased thyroid hormone elimination, which predispose rats, but not humans, to \nthyroid neoplasms. At the highest tested doses, the systemic exposures (based on AUC) to darunavir \nwere between 0.4- and 0.7-fold (mice) and 0.7- and 1-fold (rats), relative to those observed in humans \nat the recommended therapeutic doses.\n\nAfter 2 years administration of darunavir at exposures at or below the human exposure, kidney \nchanges were observed in mice (nephrosis) and rats (chronic progressive nephropathy).\n\nDarunavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including \nbacterial reverse mutation (Ames), chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes and in vivo\nmicronucleus test in mice.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPREZISTA, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other \nantiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV-1) infection.\n\nPREZISTA, co-administered with cobicistat is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral \nmedicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adult \npatients (see section 4.2).\n\nPREZISTA 400 mg and 800 mg tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens for the \ntreatment of HIV-1 infection in adult and paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 40 kg \nbody weight who are:\n antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve (see section 4.2).\n ART-experienced with no darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs) and who \n\nhave plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l. In \ndeciding to initiate treatment with PREZISTA in such ART-experienced patients, genotypic \ntesting should guide the use of PREZISTA (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a health care provider experienced in the management of HIV \ninfection. After therapy with PREZISTA has been initiated, patients should be advised not to alter the \ndosage, dose form or discontinue therapy without discussing with their health care provider.\n\n\n\n82\n\nThe interaction profile of darunavir depends on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as \npharmacokinetic enhancer. Darunavir may therefore have different contraindications and \nrecommendations for concomitant medications depending on whether the compound is boosted with \nritonavir or cobicistat (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nPosology\nPREZISTA must always be given orally with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic \nenhancer and in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. The Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of cobicistat or ritonavir as appropriate, must therefore be consulted prior to initiation \nof therapy with PREZISTA. Cobicistat is not indicated for use in twice daily regimens or for use in the \npaediatric population.\n\nPREZISTA is also available as an oral suspension for use in patients who are unable to swallow \nPREZISTA tablets (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for PREZISTA oral \nsuspension).\n\nART-naïve adult patients\nThe recommended dose regimen is 800 mg once daily with cobicistat 150 mg once daily or ritonavir \n100 mg once daily taken with food. PREZISTA 400 mg and 800 mg tablets can be used to construct \nthe once daily 800 mg regimen.\n\nART-experienced adult patients\nThe recommended dose regimens are as follows:\n In ART-experienced patients with no darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* \n\nand who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l\n(see section 4.1) a regimen of 800 mg once daily with cobicistat 150 mg once daily or ritonavir \n100 mg once daily taken with food may be used. PREZISTA 400 mg and 800 mg tablets can be \nused to construct the once daily 800 mg regimen.\n\n In all other ART-experienced patients or if HIV-1 genotype testing is not available, the \nrecommended dose regimen is 600 mg twice daily taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily taken \nwith food. See the Summary of Product Characteristics for PREZISTA 100 mg/ml oral \nsuspension, 75 mg, 150 mg or 600 mg tablets.\n\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V\n\nART-naïve paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg)\nThe recommended dose regimen is 800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily taken with \nfood. The dose of cobicistat to be used with PREZISTA in children less than 18 years of age has not \nbeen established.\n\nART-experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg)\nThe dose of cobicistat to be used with PREZISTA in children less than 18 years of age has not been \nestablished.\n\nThe recommended dose regimens are as follows:\n In ART-experienced patients without DRV-RAMs* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA \n\n< 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.1) a regimen of \n800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily taken with food may be used. PREZISTA \n400 mg and 800 mg tablets can be used to construct the once daily 800 mg regimen.\n\n In all other ART-experienced patients or if HIV-1 genotype testing is not available, the \nrecommended dose regimen is described in the Summary of Product Characteristics for \nPREZISTA 100 mg/ml oral suspension,75 mg, 150 mg and 600 mg tablets.\n\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V\n\nAdvice on missed doses\nIf a once daily dose of PREZISTA and/or cobicistat or ritonavir is missed within 12 hours of the time \nit is usually taken, patients should be instructed to take the prescribed dose of PREZISTA and \ncobicistat or ritonavir with food as soon as possible. If this is noticed later than 12 hours after the time \n\n\n\n83\n\nit is usually taken, the missed dose should not be taken and the patient should resume the usual dosing \nschedule.\n\nThis guidance is based on the half-life of darunavir in the presence of cobicistat or ritonavir and the \nrecommended dosing interval of approximately 24 hours.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nLimited information is available in this population, and therefore, PREZISTA should be used with \ncaution in this age group (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nDarunavir is metabolised by the hepatic system. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with \nmild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, however, \nPREZISTA should be used with caution in these patients. No pharmacokinetic data are available in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment could result in an increase of \ndarunavir exposure and a worsening of its safety profile. Therefore, PREZISTA must not be used in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required for darunavir/ritonavir in patients with renal impairment (see sections \n4.4 and 5.2). Cobicistat has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis, and, therefore, no \nrecommendation can be made for the use of darunavir/cobicistat in these patients.\n\nCobicistat inhibits the tubular secretion of creatinine and may cause modest increases in serum \ncreatinine and modest declines in creatinine clearance. Hence, the use of creatinine clearance as an \nestimate of renal elimination capacity may be misleading. Cobicistat as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of \ndarunavir should, therefore, not be initiated in patients with creatine clearance less than 70 ml/min if \nany co-administered agent requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance: e.g. emtricitabine, \nlamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate, phosphate or succinate) or adefovir dipovoxil.\nFor information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.\n\nPaediatric population\nPREZISTA should not be used in paediatric patients below 3 years of age or less than 15 kg body \nweight (see sections 4.4 and 5.3).\n\nART-naïve paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg)\nThe recommended dose regimen is 800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily taken with \nfood.\n\nART-experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg)\nIn ART-experienced patients without DRV-RAMs* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA \n< 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l, a regimen of 800 mg once daily with \nritonavir 100 mg once daily taken with food may be used.\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V\n\nPaediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing less than 40 kg)\nThe 400 and 800 mg tablets are not suitable for this patient population. Other formulations are \navailable, see the Summary of Product Characteristics for PREZISTA 75 mg, 150 mg, 600 mg tablets \nand 100 mg/ml oral suspension.\n\nThe dose of cobicistat to be used with PREZISTA has not been established in this patient population.\n\n\n\n84\n\nPregnancy and postpartum\nNo dose adjustment is required for darunavir/ritonavir during pregnancy and postpartum. \nPREZISTA/ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk (see sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.2).\n\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg during pregnancy results in low darunavir exposure \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Therefore, therapy with PREZISTA/cobicistat should not be initiated during \npregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with PREZISTA/cobicistat should be \nswitched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). PREZISTA/ritonavir may be considered \nas an alternative.\n\nMethod of administration\nPatients should be instructed to take PREZISTA with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir within \n30 minutes after completion of a meal. The type of food does not affect the exposure to darunavir (see \nsections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nPatients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.\n\nConcomitant treatment with any of the following medicinal products given the expected decrease in \nplasma concentrations of darunavir, ritonavir and cobicistat and the potential for loss of therapeutic \neffect (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nApplicable to darunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat:\n- The combination product lopinavir/ritonavir (see section 4.5).\n- The strong CYP3A inducers rifampicin and herbal preparations containing St John’s wort \n\n(Hypericum perforatum). Co-administration is expected to reduce plasma concentrations of \ndarunavir, ritonavir and cobicistat, which could lead to loss of therapeutic effect and possible \ndevelopment of resistance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nApplicable to darunavir boosted with cobicistat, not when boosted with ritonavir:\n- Darunavir boosted with cobicistat is more sensitive for CYP3A induction than darunavir \n\nboosted with ritonavir. Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers is contraindicated, since \nthese may reduce the exposure to cobicistat and darunavir leading to loss of therapeutic effect. \nStrong CYP3A inducers include e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (see sections \n4.4 and 4.5).\n\nDarunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat inhibits the elimination of active substances that \nare highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance, which results in increased exposure to the \nco-administered medicinal product. Therefore, concomitant treatment with such medicinal products \nfor which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is \ncontraindicated (applies to darunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat). These active \nsubstances include e.g.:\n- alfuzosin\n- amiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine, quinidine, ranolazine\n- astemizole, terfenadine\n- colchicine when used in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see section 4.5)\n- ergot derivatives (e.g. dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergonovine)\n- elbasvir/grazoprevir\n- cisapride\n- dapoxetine\n- domperidone\n- naloxegol\n- lurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine, sertindole (see section 4.5)\n\n\n\n85\n\n- triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, \nsee section 4.5)\n\n- sildenafil - when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, avanafil\n- simvastatin, lovastatin and lomitapide (see section 4.5)\n- dabigatran, ticagrelor (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission\nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nRegular assessment of virological response is advised. In the setting of lack or loss of virological \nresponse, resistance testing should be performed.\n\nPREZISTA 400 mg or 800 mg must always be given orally with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir as a \npharmacokinetic enhancer and in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products (see section \n5.2). The Summary of Product Characteristics of cobicistat or ritonavir as appropriate, must therefore \nbe consulted prior to initiation of therapy with PREZISTA.\n\nIncreasing the dose of ritonavir from that recommended in section 4.2 did not significantly affect \ndarunavir concentrations. It is not recommended to alter the dose of cobicistat or ritonavir.\n\nDarunavir binds predominantly to 1-acid glycoprotein. This protein binding is \nconcentration-dependent indicative for saturation of binding. Therefore, protein displacement of \nmedicinal products highly bound to 1-acid glycoprotein cannot be ruled out (see section 4.5).\n\nART-experienced patients – once daily dosing\nPREZISTA used in combination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir once daily in ART-experienced \npatients should not be used in patients with one or more darunavir resistance associated mutations \n(DRV-RAMs) or HIV-1 RNA ≥ 100,000 copies/ml or CD4+ cell count < 100 cells x 106/l (see section \n4.2). Combinations with optimised background regimen (OBRs) other than ≥ 2 NRTIs have not been \nstudied in this population. Limited data are available in patients with HIV-1 clades other than B (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nPaediatric population\nPREZISTA is not recommended for use in paediatric patients below 3 years of age or less than 15 kg \nbody weight (see sections 4.2 and 5.3).\n\nPregnancy\nPREZISTA/ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk. Caution should be used in pregnant women with concomitant medications which may \nfurther decrease darunavir exposure (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).\n\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg once daily during the second and third trimester has \nbeen shown to result in low darunavir exposure, with a reduction of around 90% in Cmin levels (see \nsection 5.2). Cobicistat levels decrease and may not provide sufficient boosting. The substantial \nreduction in darunavir exposure may result in virological failure and an increased risk of mother to \nchild transmission of HIV infection. Therefore, therapy with PREZISTA/cobicistat should not be \ninitiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with \nPREZISTA/cobicistat should be switched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.6). \nPREZISTA given with low dose ritonavir may be considered as an alternative.\n\nElderly\nAs limited information is available on the use of PREZISTA in patients aged 65 and over, caution \nshould be exercised in the administration of PREZISTA in elderly patients, reflecting the greater \n\n\n\n86\n\nfrequency of decreased hepatic function and of concomitant disease or other therapy (see sections 4.2 \nand 5.2).\n\nSevere skin reactions\nDuring the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N=3,063), severe skin reactions, which \nmay be accompanied with fever and/or elevations of transaminases, have been reported in 0.4% of \npatients. DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome has been rarely (< 0.1%) reported, and during post-marketing experience toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis and acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. PREZISTA should be \ndiscontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include,\nbut are not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or \njoint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia.\n\nRash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing \nPREZISTA/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to patients receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir without \nraltegravir or raltegravir without PREZISTA (see section 4.8).\n\nDarunavir contains a sulphonamide moiety. PREZISTA should be used with caution in patients with a \nknown sulphonamide allergy.\n\nHepatotoxicity\nDrug-induced hepatitis (e.g. acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with PREZISTA. \nDuring the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N=3,063), hepatitis was reported in \n0.5% of patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir. Patients with \npre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for \nliver function abnormalities including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of \nconcomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for \nthese medicinal products.\n\nAppropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with PREZISTA used in \ncombination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir and patients should be monitored during treatment. \nIncreased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, \ncirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first \nseveral months of PREZISTA used in combination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir treatment.\n\nIf there is evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of \nliver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver \ntenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients using PREZISTA used in combination with cobicistat or low \ndose ritonavir, interruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered promptly.\n\nPatients with coexisting conditions\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe safety and efficacy of PREZISTA have not been established in patients with severe underlying \nliver disorders and PREZISTA is therefore contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nDue to an increase in the unbound darunavir plasma concentrations, PREZISTA should be used with \ncaution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo special precautions or dose adjustments for darunavir/ritonavir are required in patients with renal \nimpairment. As darunavir and ritonavir are highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that they \nwill be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Therefore, no special \nprecautions or dose adjustments are required in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Cobicistat has \nnot been studied in patients receiving dialysis, therefore, no recommendation can be made for the use \nof darunavir/cobicistat in these patients (see section 4.2).\n\n\n\n87\n\nCobicistat decreases the estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of \ncreatinine. This should be taken into consideration if darunavir with cobicistat is administered to \npatients in whom the estimated creatinine clearance is used to adjust doses of co-administered \nmedicinal products (see section 4.2 and cobicistat SmPC).\n\nThere are currently inadequate data to determine whether co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and \ncobicistat is associated with a greater risk of renal adverse reactions compared with regimens that \ninclude tenofovir disoproxil without cobicistat.\n\nHaemophiliac patients\nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthrosis in patients with haemophilia type A and B treated with PIs. In some patients additional \nfactor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with PIs was continued or \nreintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship has been suggested, although \nthe mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should, therefore, be made \naware of the possibility of increased bleeding.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.\n\nOsteonecrosis\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant \nexamples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and \npneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any \ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. In addition, \nreactivation of herpes simplex and herpes zoster has been observed in clinical studies with PREZISTA \nco-administered with low dose ritonavir.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).\n\nInteractions with medicinal products\nSeveral of the interaction studies have been performed with darunavir at lower than recommended \ndoses. The effects on co-administered medicinal products may thus be underestimated and clinical \nmonitoring of safety may be indicated. For full information on interactions with other medicinal \nproducts see section 4.5.\n\nPharmacokinetic enhancer and concomitant medications\nDarunavir has different interaction profiles depending on whether the compound is boosted with \nritonavir or cobicistat:\n- Darunavir boosted with cobicistat is more sensitive for CYP3A induction: concomitant use of \n\ndarunavir/cobicistat and strong CYP3A inducers is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3), \n\n\n\n88\n\nand concomitant use with weak to moderate CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section \n4.5). Concomitant use of darunavir/ritonavir and darunavir/cobicistat with lopinavir/ritonavir, \nrifampicin and herbal products containing St John’s wort, Hypericum perforatum, is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.5).\n\n- Unlike ritonavir, cobicistat does not have inducing effects on enzymes or transport proteins (see \nsection 4.5). If switching the pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat, caution is required \nduring the first two weeks of treatment with darunavir/cobicistat, particularly if doses of any \nconcomitantly administered medicinal products have been titrated or adjusted during use of \nritonavir as a pharmacoenhancer. A dose reduction of the co-administered drug may be needed \nin these cases.\n\nEfavirenz in combination with PREZISTA may result in sub-optimal darunavir Cmin. If efavirenz is to \nbe used in combination with PREZISTA, the PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily regimen \nshould be used. See the Summary of Product Characteristics for PREZISTA 75 mg, 150 mg and\n600 mg tablets (see section 4.5).\n\nLife-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp; see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nPREZISTA 400 mg tablets contain sunset yellow FCF (E110) which may cause an allergic reaction.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe interaction profile of darunavir may differ depending on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as \npharmacoenhancer. The recommendations given for concomitant use of darunavir and other medicinal \nproducts may therefore differ depending on whether darunavir is boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat \n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4), and caution is also required during the first time of treatment if switching \nthe pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat (see section 4.4).\n\nMedicinal products that affect darunavir exposure (ritonavir as pharmacoenhancer)\nDarunavir and ritonavir are metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity \nwould be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, resulting in lowered plasma \nconcentrations of these compounds and consequently that of darunavir, leading to loss of therapeutic \neffect and possible development of resistance (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). CYP3A inducers that are \ncontraindicated include rifampicin, St John’s wort and lopinavir.\n\nCo-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may \ndecrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, which may result in increased plasma concentrations \nof darunavir and ritonavir. Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended and \ncaution is warranted, these interactions are described in the interaction table below (e.g. indinavir, \nazole antifungals like clotrimazole).\n\nMedicinal products that affect darunavir exposure (cobicistat as pharmacoenhancer)\nDarunavir and cobicistat are metabolised by CYP3A, and co-administration with CYP3A inducers \nmay therefore result in subtherapeutic plasma exposure to darunavir. Darunavir boosted with \ncobicistat is more sensitive to CYP3A induction than ritonavir-boosted darunavir: co-administration of \ndarunavir/cobicistat with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g. St John’s wort, \nrifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \nCo-administration of darunavir/cobicistat with weak to moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. efavirenz, \netravirine, nevirapine, boceprevir, fluticasone, and bosentan) is not recommended (see interaction \ntable below).\n\nFor co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, the same recommendations apply independent \nof whether darunavir is boosted with ritonavir or with cobicistat (see section above).\n\n\n\n89\n\nMedicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boosted with ritonavir\nDarunavir and ritonavir are inhibitors of CYP3A, CYP2D6 and P-gp. Co-administration of \ndarunavir/ritonavir with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A and/or CYP2D6 or \ntransported by P-gp may result in increased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which \ncould increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.\n\nDarunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir must not be combined with medicinal products that \nare highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which increased systemic exposure is associated \nwith serious and/or life-threatening events (narrow therapeutic index) (see section 4.3).\n\nThe overall pharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14-fold increase in \nthe systemic exposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in \ncombination with ritonavir at 100 mg twice daily. Therefore, darunavir must only be used in \ncombination with a pharmacokinetic enhancer (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nA clinical study utilising a cocktail of medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochromes \nCYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and \ninhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, which may be attributed to the \npresence of low dose ritonavir. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with medicinal products \nwhich are primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 (such as flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol) may result \nin increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their \ntherapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal \nproducts primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 (such as warfarin) and CYP2C19 (such as methadone) \nmay result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or \nshorten their therapeutic effect.\n\nAlthough the effect on CYP2C8 has only been studied in vitro, co-administration of darunavir and \nritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 (such as paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, \nrepaglinide) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could \ndecrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.\n\nRitonavir inhibits the transporters P-glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and co-administration \nwith substrates of these transporters can result in increased plasma concentrations of these compounds \n(e.g. dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, statins and bosentan; see the Interaction table below).\n\nMedicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boosted with cobicistat\nThe recommendations for darunavir boosted with ritonavir are adequate also for darunavir boosted \nwith cobicistat with regard to substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, P-glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and \nOATP1B3 (see contraindications and recommendations presented in the section above). Cobicistat \n150 mg given with darunavir 800 mg once daily enhances darunavir pharmacokinetic parameters in a \ncomparable way to ritonavir (see section 5.2).\n\nUnlike ritonavir, cobicistat does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or \nUGT1A1. For further information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product \nCharacteristics.\n\nInteraction table\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nSeveral of the interaction studies (indicated by # in the table below) have been performed at lower than \nrecommended doses of darunavir or with a different dosing regimen (see section 4.2 Posology). The \neffects on co-administered medicinal products may thus be underestimated and clinical monitoring of \nsafety may be indicated.\n\nThe interaction profile of darunavir depends on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as \npharmacokinetic enhancer. Darunavir may therefore have different recommendations for concomitant \nmedications depending on whether the compound is boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat. No \n\n\n\n90\n\ninteraction studies presented in the table have been performed with darunavir boosted with cobicistat. \nThe same recommendations apply, unless specifically indicated. For further information on cobicistat, \nconsult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.\n\nInteractions between darunavir/ritonavir and antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral medicinal products \nare listed in the table below. The direction of the arrow for each pharmacokinetic parameter is based \non the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio being within (↔), below (↓) or above (↑) \nthe 80-125% range (not determined as “ND”).\n\nIn the table below the specific pharmacokinetic enhancer is specified when recommendations differ. \nWhen the recommendation is the same for PREZISTA when co-administered with a low dose ritonavir \nor cobicistat, the term “boosted PREZISTA” is used.\n\nThe below list of examples of drug drug interactions is not comprehensive and therefore the label of \neach drug that is co-administered with PREZISTA should be consulted for information related to the \nroute of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with \nregards to co-administration.\n\nINTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS\nMedicinal products by \ntherapeutic areas\n\nInteraction\nGeometric mean change (%)\n\nRecommendations concerning \nco-administration\n\nHIV ANTIRETROVIRALS\nIntegrase strand transfer inhibitors\n\nDolutegravir dolutegravir AUC ↓ 22%\ndolutegravir C24h ↓ 38%\ndolutegravir Cmax ↓ 11%\ndarunavir ↔*\n* Using cross-study comparisons to historical \npharmacokinetic data\n\nBoosted PREZISTA and \ndolutegravir can be used without \ndose adjustment.\n\nRaltegravir Some clinical studies suggest raltegravir \nmay cause a modest decrease in \ndarunavir plasma concentrations.\n\nAt present the effect of raltegravir \non darunavir plasma \nconcentrations does not appear to \nbe clinically relevant.

If concomitant use of \nboosted PREZISTA with \nsildenafil, vardenafil or tadalafil is \nindicated, sildenafil at a single \ndose not exceeding 25 mg in \n48 hours, vardenafil at a single \ndose not exceeding 2.5 mg in \n72 hours or tadalafil at a single \ndose not exceeding 10 mg in \n72 hours is recommended.\n\nFor the treatment of \npulmonary arterial \nhypertension\n\nSildenafil\nTadalafil\n\nNot studied. Concomitant use of \nsildenafil or tadalafil for the treatment of \npulmonary arterial hypertension and \nboosted PREZISTA may increase plasma \nconcentrations of sildenafil or tadalafil.\n(CYP3A inhibition)\n\nA safe and effective dose of \nsildenafil for the treatment of \npulmonary arterial hypertension \nco-administered with boosted \nPREZISTA has not been \nestablished. There is an increased \npotential for sildenafil-associated \nadverse events (including visual \ndisturbances, hypotension, \nprolonged erection and syncope). \nTherefore, co-administration of \nboosted PREZISTA and sildenafil \nwhen used for the treatment of \npulmonary arterial hypertension is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\nCo-administration of tadalafil for \nthe treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension with boosted \nPREZISTA is not recommended.\n\nPROTON PUMP INHIBITORS\nOmeprazole\n20 mg once daily\n\n#\ndarunavir AUC ↔\n\n#\ndarunavir Cmin ↔\n\n#\ndarunavir Cmax ↔\n\nBoosted PREZISTA can be \nco-administered with proton pump \ninhibitors without dose \nadjustments.\n\n\n\n103\n\nSEDATIVES/HYPNOTICS\nBuspirone\nClorazepate\nDiazepam\nEstazolam\nFlurazepam\nMidazolam (parenteral)\nZolpidem\n\nMidazolam (oral)\nTriazolam\n\nNot studied.

According to current treatment guidelines, dual \ntherapy with protease inhibitors is generally not recommended.\n\n‡\nStudy was conducted with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg once daily.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nAs a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in \npregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, \nthe animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account.\n\nThere are no adequate and well controlled studies on pregnancy outcome with darunavir in pregnant \nwomen. Studies in animals do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).\n\nPREZISTA co-administered with low dose ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the \npotential benefit justifies the potential risk.\n\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg during pregnancy results in low darunavir exposure \n(see section 5.2), which may be associated with an increased risk of treatment failure and an increased \nrisk of HIV transmission to the child. Therapy with PREZISTA/cobicistat should not be initiated \n\n\n\n104\n\nduring pregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with PREZISTA/cobicistat \nshould be switched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether darunavir is excreted in human milk. Studies in rats have demonstrated that \ndarunavir is excreted in milk and at high levels (1,000 mg/kg/day) resulted in toxicity. Because of both \nthe potential for HIV transmission and the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, mothers \nshould be instructed not to breast-feed under any circumstances if they are receiving PREZISTA.\n\nFertility\nNo human data on the effect of darunavir on fertility are available. There was no effect on mating or \nfertility with darunavir treatment in rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPREZISTA in combination with cobicistat or ritonavir has no or negligible influence on the ability to \ndrive and use machines. However, dizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with \nregimens containing PREZISTA co-administered with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir and should be \nborne in mind when considering a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nDuring the clinical development program (N=2,613 treatment-experienced subjects who initiated \ntherapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily), 51.3% of subjects experienced at least one \nadverse reaction. The total mean treatment duration for subjects was 95.3 weeks. The most frequent \nadverse reactions reported in clinical trials and as spontaneous reports are diarrhoea, nausea, rash, \nheadache and vomiting. The most frequent serious reactions are acute renal failure, myocardial \ninfarction, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, \ndiarrhoea, hepatitis and pyrexia.\n\nIn the 96 week analysis, the safety profile of PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily in \ntreatment-naïve subjects was similar to that seen with PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily in \ntreatment-experienced subjects except for nausea which was observed more frequently in \ntreatment-naïve subjects. This was driven by mild intensity nausea. No new safety findings were \nidentified in the 192 week analysis of the treatment-naïve subjects in which the mean treatment \nduration of PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily was 162.5 weeks.\n\nDuring the Phase III clinical trial GS-US-216-130 with darunavir/cobicistat (N=313 treatment-naïve \nand treatment-experienced subjects), 66.5% of subjects experienced at least one adverse reaction. The \nmean treatment duration was 58.4 weeks. The most frequent adverse reactions reported were diarrhoea \n(28%), nausea (23%), and rash (16%). Serious adverse reactions are diabetes mellitus, (drug) \nhypersensitivity, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, rash and vomiting.\n\nFor information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency category. Within each \nfrequency category, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequency \ncategories are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and not known (frequency cannot be

too.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nRash\nIn clinical trials, rash was mostly mild to moderate, often occurring within the first four weeks of \ntreatment and resolving with continued dosing. In cases of severe skin reaction see the warning in \nsection 4.4. In a single arm trial investigating darunavir 800 mg once daily in combination with \ncobicistat 150 mg once daily and other antiretrovirals 2.2% of patients discontinued treatment due to \nrash.\n\nDuring the clinical development program of raltegravir in treatment-experienced patients, rash, \nirrespective of causality, was more commonly observed with regimens containing \nPREZISTA/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to those containing PREZISTA/ritonavir without \nraltegravir or raltegravir without PREZISTA/ritonavir. Rash considered by the investigator to be \ndrug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9, \n4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3 \nper 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity \nand did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nMetabolic parameters\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nMusculoskeletal abnormalities\nIncreased CPK, myalgia, myositis and rarely, rhabdomyolysis have been reported with the use of \nprotease inhibitors, particularly in combination with NRTIs.\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nBleeding in haemophiliac patients\nThere have been reports of increased spontaneous bleeding in haemophiliac patients receiving \nantiretroviral protease inhibitors (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety assessment in paediatric patients is based on the 48-week analysis of safety data from three \nPhase II trials. The following patient populations were evaluated (see section 5.1):\n 80 ART-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 6 to 17 years and weighing at \n\nleast 20 kg who received PREZISTA tablets with low dose ritonavir twice daily in combination \nwith other antiretroviral agents.\n\n\n\n109\n\n 21 ART-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 3 to < 6 years and weighing \n10 kg to < 20 kg (16 participants from 15 kg to < 20 kg) who received PREZISTA oral \nsuspension with low dose ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents.\n\n 12 ART-naïve HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 12 to 17 years and weighing at least \n40 kg who received PREZISTA tablets with low dose ritonavir once daily in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents (see section 5.1).\n\nOverall, the safety profile in these paediatric patients was similar to that observed in the adult \npopulation.\n\nOther special populations\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus\nAmong 1,968 treatment-experienced patients receiving PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir \n600/100 mg twice daily, 236 patients were co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Co-infected patients were \nmore likely to have baseline and treatment emergent hepatic transaminase elevations than those \nwithout chronic viral hepatitis (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nHuman experience of acute overdose with PREZISTA co-administered with cobicistat or low dose \nritonavir is limited. Single doses up to 3,200 mg of darunavir as oral solution alone and up to 1,600 mg \nof the tablet formulation of darunavir in combination with ritonavir have been administered to healthy \nvolunteers without untoward symptomatic effects.\n\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with PREZISTA. Treatment of overdose with PREZISTA \nconsists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient. Since darunavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be \nbeneficial in significant removal of the active substance.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE10.\n\nMechanism of action\nDarunavir is an inhibitor of the dimerisation and of the catalytic activity of the HIV-1 protease \n(KD of 4.5 x 10\n\n-12M). It selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded Gag-Pol polyproteins in virus \ninfected cells, thereby preventing the formation of mature infectious virus particles.\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\nDarunavir exhibits activity against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 and laboratory \nstrains of HIV-2 in acutely infected T-cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and \nhuman monocytes/macrophages with median EC50 values ranging from 1.2 to 8.5 nM (0.7 to\n5.0 ng/ml). Darunavir demonstrates antiviral activity in vitro against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M \n(A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and group O primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from < 0.1 to 4.3 nM.\n\nThese EC50 values are well below the 50% cellular toxicity concentration range of 87 µM to \n> 100 µM.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n110\n\nResistance\nIn vitro selection of darunavir-resistant virus from wild type HIV-1 was lengthy (> 3 years). The \nselected viruses were unable to grow in the presence of darunavir concentrations above 400 nM. \nViruses selected in these conditions and showing decreased susceptibility to darunavir (range: \n23-50-fold) harboured 2 to 4 amino acid substitutions in the protease gene. The decreased \nsusceptibility to darunavir of the emerging viruses in the selection experiment could not be explained \nby the emergence of these protease mutations.\n\nThe clinical trial data from ART-experienced patients (TITAN trial and the pooled analysis of the \nPOWER 1, 2 and 3 and DUET 1 and 2 trials) showed that virologic response to PREZISTA\nco-administered with low dose ritonavir was decreased when 3 or more darunavir RAMs (V11I, V32I, \nL33F, I47V, I50V, I54L or M, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V) were present at baseline or when these \nmutations developed during treatment.\n\nIncreasing baseline darunavir fold change in EC50 (FC) was associated with decreasing virologic \nresponse. A lower and upper clinical cut-off of 10 and 40 were identified. Isolates with baseline FC \n≤ 10 are susceptible; isolates with FC > 10 to 40 have decreased susceptibility; isolates with FC > 40\nare resistant (see Clinical results).\n\nViruses isolated from patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily experiencing virologic \nfailure by rebound that were susceptible to tipranavir at baseline remained susceptible to tipranavir \nafter treatment in the vast majority of cases.\n\nThe lowest rates of developing resistant HIV virus are observed in ART-naïve patients who are treated \nfor the first time with darunavir in combination with other ART.\n\nThe table below shows the development of HIV-1 protease mutations and loss of susceptibility to PIs \nin virologic failures at endpoint in the ARTEMIS, ODIN and TITAN trials.\n\nARTEMIS\nWeek 192\n\nODIN\nWeek 48\n\nTITAN\nWeek 48\n\nPREZISTA/ \nritonavir\n\n800/100 mg\nonce daily\n\nN=343\n\nPREZISTA/ \nritonavir\n\n800/100 mg\nonce daily\n\nN=294\n\nPREZISTA/ \nritonavir\n\n600/100 mg\ntwice daily\n\nN=296\n\nPREZISTA/ \nritonavir\n\n600/100 mg\ntwice daily\n\nN=298\nTotal number of \nvirologic failures\n\na\n, n \n\n(%)\n\n55 (16.0%) 65 (22.1%) 54 (18.2%) 31 (10.4%)\n\nRebounders 39 (11.4%) 11 (3.7%) 11 (3.7%) 16 (5.4%)\nNever suppressed \nsubjects\n\n16 (4.7%) 54 (18.4%) 43 (14.5%) 15 (5.0%)\n\nNumber of subjects with virologic failure and paired baseline/endpoint genotypes, developing mutations\nb\n\nat \nendpoint, n/N\n\nPrimary (major) PI \nmutations\n\n0/43 1/60 0/42 6/28\n\nPI RAMs 4/43 7/60 4/42 10/28\nNumber of subjects with virologic failure and paired baseline/endpoint phenotypes, showing loss of \nsusceptibility to PIs at endpoint compared to baseline, n/N\nPI\n\ndarunavir 0/39 1/58 0/41 3/26\namprenavir 0/39 1/58 0/40 0/22\natazanavir 0/39 2/56 0/40 0/22\nindinavir 0/39 2/57 0/40 1/24\nlopinavir 0/39 1/58 0/40 0/23\nsaquinavir 0/39 0/56 0/40 0/22\ntipranavir 0/39 0/58 0/41 1/25\n\n\n\n111\n\na\nTLOVR non-VF censored algorithm based on HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml, except for TITAN (HIV-1 RNA \n< 400 copies/ml)\n\nb\nIAS-USA lists\n\nLow rates of developing resistant HIV-1 virus were observed in ART-naïve patients who are treated \nfor the first time with darunavir/cobicistat once daily in combination with other ART, and in \nART-experienced patients with no darunavir RAMs receiving darunavir/cobicistat in combination \nwith other ART.

Virologic response was preserved throughout the \nstudy period in both arms. No mother to child transmission occurred in the infants born to the \n31 subjects who stayed on the antiretroviral treatment through delivery. There were no new clinically \nrelevant safety findings compared with the known safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir in HIV-1 \ninfected adults (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of darunavir, co-administered with cobicistat or ritonavir, have been \nevaluated in healthy adult volunteers and in HIV-1 infected patients. Exposure to darunavir was higher \nin HIV-1 infected patients than in healthy subjects. The increased exposure to darunavir in HIV-1 \ninfected patients compared to healthy subjects may be explained by the higher concentrations of \nα1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) in HIV-1 infected patients, resulting in higher darunavir binding to \nplasma AAG and, therefore, higher plasma concentrations.\n\nDarunavir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Cobicistat and ritonavir inhibit CYP3A, thereby \nincreasing the plasma concentrations of darunavir considerably.\n\nFor information on cobicistat pharmacokinetic properties, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product \nCharacteristics.\n\nAbsorption\nDarunavir was rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Maximum plasma concentration of \ndarunavir in the presence of low dose ritonavir is generally achieved within 2.5-4.0 hours.\n\n\n\n115\n\nThe absolute oral bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of darunavir alone was approximately 37% \nand increased to approximately 82% in the presence of 100 mg twice daily ritonavir. The overall \npharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14-fold increase in the systemic \nexposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with \nritonavir at 100 mg twice daily (see section 4.4).\n\nWhen administered without food, the relative bioavailability of darunavir in the presence of cobicistat \nor low dose ritonavir is lower as compared to intake with food. Therefore, PREZISTA tablets should \nbe taken with cobicistat or ritonavir and with food. The type of food does not affect exposure to \ndarunavir.\n\nDistribution\nDarunavir is approximately 95% bound to plasma protein. Darunavir binds primarily to plasma α1-acid \nglycoprotein.\n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the volume of distribution of darunavir alone was 88.1 ± 59.0 l \n(Mean ± SD) and increased to 131 ± 49.9 l (Mean ± SD) in the presence of 100 mg twice-daily \nritonavir.\n\nBiotransformation\nIn vitro experiments with human liver microsomes (HLMs) indicate that darunavir primarily \nundergoes oxidative metabolism. Darunavir is extensively metabolised by the hepatic CYP system and \nalmost exclusively by isozyme CYP3A4. A 14C-darunavir trial in healthy volunteers showed that a \nmajority of the radioactivity in plasma after a single 400/100 mg darunavir with ritonavir dose was due \nto the parent active substance. At least 3 oxidative metabolites of darunavir have been identified in \nhumans; all showed activity that was at least 10-fold less than the activity of darunavir against wild \ntype HIV.\n\nElimination\nAfter a 400/100 mg 14C-darunavir with ritonavir dose, approximately 79.5% and 13.9% of the \nadministered dose of 14C-darunavir could be retrieved in faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged \ndarunavir accounted for approximately 41.2% and 7.7% of the administered dose in faeces and urine, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of darunavir was approximately 15 hours when \ncombined with ritonavir.\nThe intravenous clearance of darunavir alone (150 mg) and in the presence of low dose ritonavir was \n32.8 l/h and 5.9 l/h, respectively.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken twice daily in\n74 treatment-experienced paediatric patients, aged 6 to 17 years and weighing at least 20 kg, showed \nthat the administered weight-based doses of PREZISTA/ritonavir resulted in darunavir exposure \ncomparable to that in adults receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily (see section 4.2).\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken twice daily in \n14 treatment-experienced paediatric patients, aged 3 to < 6 years and weighing at least 15 kg to \n< 20 kg, showed that weight-based dosages resulted in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that \nachieved in adults receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily (see section 4.2).\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken once daily in 12 ART-naïve \npaediatric patients, aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg, showed that \nPREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily results in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that \nachieved in adults receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily. Therefore the same once \ndaily dosage may be used in treatment-experienced adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing at \nleast 40 kg without darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma \nHIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.2).\n\n\n\n116\n\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken once daily in \n10 treatment-experienced paediatric patients, aged 3 to < 6 years and weighing at least 14 kg to \n< 20 kg, showed that weight-based dosages resulted in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that \nachieved in adults receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily (see section 4.2). In addition, \npharmacokinetic modeling and simulation of darunavir exposures in paediatric patients across the ages \nof 3 to < 18 years confirmed the darunavir exposures as observed in the clinical studies and allowed \nthe identification of weight-based PREZISTA/ritonavir once daily dosing regimens for paediatric \npatients weighing at least 15 kg that are either ART-naïve or treatment-experienced paediatric patients \nwithout DRV-RAMs* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count \n≥ 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.2).\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V\n\nElderly\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV infected patients showed that darunavir pharmacokinetics \nare not considerably different in the age range (18 to 75 years) evaluated in HIV infected patients \n(n=12, age ≥ 65) (see section 4.4). However, only limited data were available in patients above the age \nof 65 year.\n\nGender\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed a slightly higher darunavir exposure (16.8%) in HIV \ninfected females compared to males. This difference is not clinically relevant.\n\nRenal impairment\nResults from a mass balance study with 14C-darunavir with ritonavir showed that approximately 7.7% \nof the administered dose of darunavir is excreted in the urine unchanged.\n\nAlthough darunavir has not been studied in patients with renal impairment, population \npharmacokinetic analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of darunavir were not significantly \naffected in HIV infected patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl between 30-60 ml/min, n=20) \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nDarunavir is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. In a multiple dose study with \nPREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg) twice daily, it was demonstrated that the total \nplasma concentrations of darunavir in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, n=8) and moderate \n(Child-Pugh Class B, n=8) hepatic impairment were comparable with those in healthy subjects. \nHowever, unbound darunavir concentrations were approximately 55% (Child-Pugh Class A) and\n100% (Child-Pugh Class B) higher, respectively. The clinical relevance of this increase is unknown \ntherefore, PREZISTA should be used with caution. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of darunavir has not been studied (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nPregnancy and postpartum\nThe exposure to total darunavir and ritonavir after intake of darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice \ndaily and darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen was generally \nlower during pregnancy compared with postpartum. However, for unbound (i.e. active) darunavir, the \npharmacokinetic parameters were less reduced during pregnancy compared to postpartum, due to an \nincrease in the unbound fraction of darunavir during pregnancy compared to postpartum.\n\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/ritonavir at \n600/100 mg twice daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum\nPharmacokinetics of \ntotal darunavir\n(mean ± SD)\n\nSecond trimester of \npregnancy\n\n(n=12)a\n\nThird trimester of \npregnancy\n\n(n=12)\n\nPostpartum \n(6-12 weeks)\n\n(n=12)\nCmax, ng/ml 4,668 ± 1,097 5,328 ± 1,631 6,659 ± 2,364\n\n\n\n117\n\nAUC12h, ng.h/ml 39,370 ± 9,597 45,880 ± 17,360 56,890 ± 26,340\nCmin, ng/ml 1,922 ± 825 2,661 ± 1,269 2,851 ± 2,216\na\n\nn=11 for AUC12h\n\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/ritonavir at \n800/100 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum\nPharmacokinetics of \ntotal darunavir\n(mean ± SD)\n\nSecond trimester of \npregnancy\n\n(n=17)\n\nThird Trimester of \npregnancy\n\n(n=15)\n\nPostpartum \n(6-12 weeks)\n\n(n=16)\nCmax, ng/ml 4,964 ± 1,505 5,132 ± 1,198 7,310 ± 1,704\nAUC24h, ng.h/ml 62,289 ± 16,234 61,112 ± 13,790 92,116 ± 29,241\nCmin, ng/ml 1,248 ± 542 1,075 ± 594 1,473 ± 1,141\n\nIn women receiving darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily during the second trimester of \npregnancy, mean intra-individual values for total darunavir Cmax, AUC12h and Cmin were 28%, 26% and \n26% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total \ndarunavir Cmax, AUC12h and Cmin values were 18%, 16% lower and 2% higher, respectively, as \ncompared with postpartum.\n\nIn women receiving darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily during the second trimester of \npregnancy, mean intra-individual values for total darunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin were 33%, 31% and \n30% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total \ndarunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were 29%, 32% and 50% lower, respectively, as compared \nwith postpartum.\n\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg once daily during pregnancy results in low darunavir \nexposure. In women receiving darunavir/cobicistat during the second trimester of pregnancy, mean \nintra-individual values for total darunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin were 49%, 56% and 92% lower, \nrespectively, as compared with postpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total darunavir \nCmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were 37%, 50% and 89% lower, respectively, as compared with \npostpartum. The unbound fraction was also substantially reduced, including around 90% reductions of \nCmin levels. The main cause of these low exposures is a marked reduction in cobicistat exposure as a \nconsequence of pregnancy-associated enzyme induction (see below).\n\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/cobicistat \n800/150 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, the third trimester of pregnancy, and postpartum\nPharmacokinetics of \ntotal darunavir\n(mean ± SD)\n\nSecond trimester \nof pregnancy\n\n(n=7)\n\nThird trimester \nof pregnancy\n\n(n=6)\n\nPostpartum \n(6-12 weeks)\n\n(n=6)\nCmax, ng/mL 4,340 ± 1,616 4,910 ± 970 7,918 ± 2,199\nAUC24h, ng.h/mL 47,293 ± 19,058 47,991 ± 9,879 99,613 ± 34,862\nCmin, ng/mL 168 ± 149 184 ± 99 1,538 ± 1,344\n\nThe exposure to cobicistat was lower during pregnancy, potentially leading to suboptimal boosting of \ndarunavir. During the second trimester of pregnancy, cobicistat Cmax, AUC24h, and Cmin were 50%, \n63%, and 83% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum. During the third trimester of \npregnancy, cobicistat Cmax, AUC24h, and Cmin, were 27%, 49%, and 83% lower, respectively, as \ncompared with postpartum.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAnimal toxicology studies have been conducted at exposures up to clinical exposure levels with \ndarunavir alone, in mice, rats and dogs and in combination with ritonavir in rats and dogs.\n\n\n\n118\n\nIn repeated-dose toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs, there were only limited effects of treatment \nwith darunavir. In rodents the target organs identified were the haematopoietic system, the blood \ncoagulation system, liver and thyroid. A variable but limited decrease in red blood cell-related \nparameters was observed, together with increases in activated partial thromboplastin time.\n\nChanges were observed in liver (hepatocyte hypertrophy, vacuolation, increased liver enzymes) and \nthyroid (follicular hypertrophy). In the rat, the combination of darunavir with ritonavir lead to a small \nincrease in effect on RBC parameters, liver and thyroid and increased incidence of islet fibrosis in the \npancreas (in male rats only) compared to treatment with darunavir alone. In the dog, no major toxicity \nfindings or target organs were identified up to exposures equivalent to clinical exposure at the \nrecommended dose.\n\nIn a study conducted in rats, the number of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased in the \npresence of maternal toxicity. Otherwise, there were no effects on mating or fertility with darunavir \ntreatment up to 1,000 mg/kg/day and exposure levels below (AUC-0.5 fold) of that in human at the \nclinically recommended dose. Up to same dose levels, there was no teratogenicity with darunavir in \nrats and rabbits when treated alone nor in mice when treated in combination with ritonavir. The \nexposure levels were lower than those with the recommended clinical dose in humans. In a pre- and \npostnatal development assessment in rats, darunavir with and without ritonavir, caused a transient \nreduction in body weight gain of the offspring pre-weaning and there was a slight delay in the opening \nof eyes and ears. Darunavir in combination with ritonavir caused a reduction in the number of pups \nthat exhibited the startle response on day 15 of lactation and a reduced pup survival during lactation. \nThese effects may be secondary to pup exposure to the active substance via the milk and/or maternal \ntoxicity. No post weaning functions were affected with darunavir alone or in combination with \nritonavir. In juvenile rats receiving darunavir up to days 23-26, increased mortality was observed with \nconvulsions in some animals. Exposure in plasma, liver and brain was considerably higher than in \nadult rats after comparable doses in mg/kg between days 5 and 11 of age. After day 23 of life, the \nexposure was comparable to that in adult rats. The increased exposure was likely at least partly due to \nimmaturity of the drug-metabolising enzymes in juvenile animals. No treatment related mortalities \nwere noted in juvenile rats dosed at 1,000 mg/kg darunavir (single dose) on day 26 of age or at \n500 mg/kg (repeated dose) from day 23 to 50 of age, and the exposures and toxicity profile were \ncomparable to those observed in adult rats.\n\nDue to uncertainties regarding the rate of development of the human blood brain barrier and liver \nenzymes, PREZISTA with low dose ritonavir should not be used in paediatric patients below 3 years \nof age.\n\nDarunavir was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats up \nto 104 weeks. Daily doses of 150, 450 and 1,000 mg/kg were administered to mice and doses of 50, \n150 and 500 mg/kg were administered to rats. Dose-related increases in the incidences of \nhepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were observed in males and females of both species. Thyroid \nfollicular cell adenomas were noted in male rats. Administration of darunavir did not cause a \nstatistically significant increase in the incidence of any other benign or malignant neoplasm in mice or \nrats. The observed hepatocellular and thyroid tumours in rodents are considered to be of limited \nrelevance to humans. Repeated administration of darunavir to rats caused hepatic microsomal enzyme \ninduction and increased thyroid hormone elimination, which predispose rats, but not humans, to \nthyroid neoplasms. At the highest tested doses, the systemic exposures (based on AUC) to darunavir \nwere between 0.4- and 0.7-fold (mice) and 0.7- and 1-fold (rats), relative to those observed in humans \nat the recommended therapeutic doses.\n\nAfter 2 years administration of darunavir at exposures at or below the human exposure, kidney \nchanges were observed in mice (nephrosis) and rats (chronic progressive nephropathy).\n\nDarunavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including \nbacterial reverse mutation (Ames), chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes and in vivo\nmicronucleus test in mice.\n\n\n\n119\n\n6.

What PREZISTA is and what it is used for\n\nWhat is PREZISTA?\nPREZISTA contains the active substance darunavir. PREZISTA is an antiretroviral medicine used in \nthe treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled protease inhibitors. PREZISTA works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. This will \nimprove your immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.\n\nWhat it is used for?\nPREZISTA is used to treat HIV infected adults as well as HIV infected children of 3 years of age and \nabove, and at least 15 kilogram body weight (see How to take PREZISTA).\n\nPREZISTA must be taken in combination with a low dose of cobicistat or ritonavir and other anti-HIV \nmedicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take PREZISTA\n\nDo not take PREZISTA\n- if you are allergic to darunavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section\n\n6) or to cobicistat or ritonavir.\n- if you have severe liver problems. Ask your doctor if you are unsure about the severity of your \n\nliver disease. Some additional tests might be necessary.\n\nDo not combine PREZISTA with any of the following medicines\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor about switching to another medicine.\n\nMedicine Purpose of the medicine\nAvanafil to treat erectile dysfunction \nAstemizole or terfenadine to treat allergy symptoms\nTriazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety\nCisapride to treat some stomach conditions\nColchicine (if you have kidney and/or liver\nproblems)\n\nto treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever\n\n\n\n141\n\nLurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine or sertindole to treat psychiatric conditions\nErgot alkaloids like ergotamine, \ndihydroergotamine, ergometrine and \nmethylergonovine\n\nto treat migraine headaches\n\nAmiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine,\nquinidine, ranolazine \n\nto treat certain heart disorders e.g. abnormal \nheart beat\n\nLovastatin, simvastatin and lomitapide to lower cholesterol levels\nRifampicin to treat some infections such as tuberculosis\nThe combination product lopinavir/ritonavir this anti-HIV medicine belongs to the same class \n\nas PREZISTA\nElbasvir/grazoprevir to treat hepatitis C infection\nAlfuzosin to treat enlarged prostate\nSildenafil to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation\nDabigatran, ticagrelor to help stop the clumping of platelets in the \n\ntreatment of patients with a history of a heart \nattack\n\nNaloxegol to treat opioid induced constipation\nDapoxetine to treat premature ejaculation\nDomperidone to treat nausea and vomiting\n\nDo not combine PREZISTA with products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking PREZISTA.\n\nPREZISTA is not a cure for HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nPeople taking PREZISTA may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \nYou must keep in regular contact with your doctor.\n\nPeople taking PREZISTA may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or \npotentially life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.\n\nIn patients taking PREZISTA and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) \nmay occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately.\n\nTell your doctor about your situation BEFORE and DURING your treatment\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.\n- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C\n\ninfection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \ntake PREZISTA.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. PREZISTA might increase sugar levels in the blood.\n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged \n\nlymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may \noccur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an \nimprovement in the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may \nhave been present with no obvious symptoms.\n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \n\n\n\n142\n\nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. PREZISTA might increase the risk of bleeding.\n- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).\n- Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking \n\ncombination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of \nbone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination \nantiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, \nhigher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing \nthis disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, \nknee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor.\n\nElderly\nPREZISTA has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this \nage group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use PREZISTA.\n\nChildren\nPREZISTA is not for use in children younger than 3 years of age or weighing less than 15 kilograms.\n\nOther medicines and PREZISTA\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.\n\nThere are some medicines that you must not combine with PREZISTA. These are mentioned above \nunder the heading ‘Do not combine PREZISTA with any of the following medicines:’\n\nIn most cases, PREZISTA can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class [e.g. \nNRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors), CCR5 antagonists and FIs (fusion inhibitors)]. PREZISTA with cobicistat or ritonavir has \nnot been tested with all PIs (protease inhibitors) and must not be used with other HIV PIs. In some \ncases dosage of other medicines might need to be changed. Therefore always tell your doctor if you \ntake other anti-HIV medicines and follow your doctor’s instruction carefully on which medicines can \nbe combined.\n\nThe effects of PREZISTA might be reduced if you take any of the following products. Tell your \ndoctor if you take:\n- Phenobarbital, phenytoin (to prevent seizures)\n- Dexamethasone (corticosteroid)\n- Efavirenz (HIV infection)\n- Boceprevir (hepatitis C infection)\n- Rifapentine, rifabutin (medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)\n- Saquinavir (HIV infection).\n\nThe effects of other medicines might be influenced if you take PREZISTA. Tell your doctor if you \ntake:\n- Amlodipine, diltiazem, disopyramide, carvedilol, felodipine, flecainide, lidocaine, metoprolol,\n\nmexiletine, nifedipine, nicardipine, propafenone, timolol, verapamil (for heart disease) as the \ntherapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines may be increased.\n\n- Apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, warfarin (to reduce clotting of the blood) as their therapeutic \neffect or side effects may be altered; your doctor may have to check your blood.\n\n- Oestrogen-based hormonal contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy. PREZISTA \nmight reduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, alternative methods of \nnon-hormonal contraception are recommended.\n\n- Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. PREZISTA might increase the risk for elevated potassium levels \nby drospirenone.\n\n\n\n143\n\n- Atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). The risk of muscle damage\nmight be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol lowering regimen is best for \nyour specific situation.\n\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)\n- Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as \n\nthe therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased. Your doctor might \nwant to do some additional tests.\n\n- Corticosteroids including betamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, \ntriamcinolone. These medicines are used to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel \ndiseases, inflammatory conditions of the eyes, joints and muscles and other inflammatory \nconditions. If alternatives cannot be used, its use should only take place after medical evaluation \nand under close monitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid side effects.\n\n- Buprenorphine/naloxone (medicines to treat opioid dependence)\n- Salmeterol (medicine to treat asthma)\n- Artemether/lumefantrine (a combination medicine to treat malaria)\n- Dasatinib, everolimus, irinotecan, nilotinib, vinblastine, vincristine (to treat cancer)\n- Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction or to treat a heart and lung disorder \n\ncalled pulmonary arterial hypertension)\n- Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, simeprevir (to treat hepatitis C infection)\n- Fentanyl, oxycodone, tramadol (to treat pain)\n- Fesoterodine, solifenacin (to treat urologic disorders).\n\nThe dosage of other medicines might need to be changed since either their own or PREZISTA’s \ntherapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined.\nTell your doctor if you take:\n- Alfentanil (injectable strong and short-acting painkiller that is used for surgical procedures)\n- Digoxin (to treat certain heart disorders)\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)\n- Itraconazole, isavuconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, clotrimazole (to treat fungal \n\ninfections). Voriconazole should only be taken after medical evaluation.\n- Rifabutin (against bacterial infections)\n- Sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (for erectile dysfunction or high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation)\n- Amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone (to treat \n\ndepression and anxiety)\n- Maraviroc (to treat HIV infection)\n- Methadone (to treat opiate dependance)\n- Carbamazepine, clonazepam (to prevent seizures or to treat certain types of nerve pain)\n- Colchicine (to treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever)\n- Bosentan (to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation)\n- Buspirone, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, midazolam when used as injection, \n\nzolpidem (sedative agents)\n- Perphenazine, risperidone, thioridazine (to treat psychiatric conditions)\n- Metformin (to treat type 2 diabetes).\n\nThis is not a complete list of medicines.

Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take PREZISTA with ritonavir unless \nspecifically directed by the doctor. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take PREZISTA \nwith cobicistat.\n\n\n\n144\n\nIt is recommended that HIV infected women must not breast-feed their infants because of both the \npossibility of your baby becoming infected with HIV through your breast milk and because of the \nunknown effects of the medicine on your baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not operate machines or drive if you feel dizzy after taking PREZISTA.\n\nPREZISTA oral suspension contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate. This ingredient may\ncause allergic reactions (sometimes delayed).\n\n3.

What PREZISTA is and what it is used for\n\nWhat is PREZISTA?\nPREZISTA contains the active substance darunavir. PREZISTA is an antiretroviral medicine used in \nthe treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled protease inhibitors. PREZISTA works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. This will \nimprove your immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.\n\nWhat it is used for?\nPREZISTA is used to treat adults and children of 3 years of age and above, and at least 15 kilogram \nbody weight who are infected by HIV and who have already used other antiretroviral medicines.\n\nPREZISTA must be taken in combination with a low dose of ritonavir and other anti-HIV medicines. \nYour doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take PREZISTA\n\nDo not take PREZISTA\n- if you are allergic to darunavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6) or to ritonavir.\n- if you have severe liver problems. Ask your doctor if you are unsure about the severity of your \n\nliver disease. Some additional tests might be necessary.\n\nDo not combine PREZISTA with any of the following medicines\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor about switching to another medicine.\n\nMedicine Purpose of the medicine\nAvanafil to treat erectile dysfunction \nAstemizole or terfenadine to treat allergy symptoms\nTriazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety\nCisapride to treat some stomach conditions\nColchicine (if you have kidney and/or liver \nproblems)\n\nto treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever\n\n\n\n152\n\nLurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine or sertindole to treat psychiatric conditions\nErgot alkaloids like ergotamine, \ndihydroergotamine, ergometrine and \nmethylergonovine\n\nto treat migraine headaches\n\nAmiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine,\nquinidine, ranolazine \n\nto treat certain heart disorders e.g. abnormal \nheart beat\n\nLovastatin, simvastatin and lomitapide to lower cholesterol levels\nRifampicin to treat some infections such as tuberculosis\nThe combination product lopinavir/ritonavir this anti-HIV medicine belongs to the same class \n\nas PREZISTA\nElbasvir/grazoprevir to treat hepatitis C infection\nAlfuzosin to treat enlarged prostate\nSildenafil to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation\nDabigatran, ticagrelor to help stop the clumping of platelets in the \n\ntreatment of patients with a history of a heart \nattack\n\nNaloxegol to treat opioid induced constipation\nDapoxetine to treat premature ejaculation\nDomperidone to treat nausea and vomiting\n\nDo not combine PREZISTA with products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking PREZISTA.\n\nPREZISTA is not a cure for HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nPeople taking PREZISTA may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \nYou must keep in regular contact with your doctor.\n\nPeople taking PREZISTA may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or \npotentially life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.\n\nIn patients taking PREZISTA and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) \nmay occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately.\n\nTell your doctor about your situation BEFORE and DURING your treatment\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.\n- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C\n\ninfection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \ntake PREZISTA.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. PREZISTA might increase sugar levels in the blood.\n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged \n\nlymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may \noccur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an \nimprovement in the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may \nhave been present with no obvious symptoms.\n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \n\n\n\n153\n\nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. PREZISTA might increase the risk of bleeding.\n- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).\n- Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking \n\ncombination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of \nbone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination \nantiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, \nhigher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing \nthis disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, \nknee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor.\n\nElderly\nPREZISTA has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this \nage group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use PREZISTA.\n\nChildren\nPREZISTA is not for use in children younger than 3 years of age or weighing less than 15 kilograms.\n\nOther medicines and PREZISTA\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.\n\nThere are some medicines that you must not combine with PREZISTA. These are mentioned above \nunder the heading ‘Do not combine PREZISTA with any of the following medicines:’\n\nIn most cases, PREZISTA can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class [e.g. \nNRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors), CCR5 antagonists and FIs (fusion inhibitors)]. PREZISTA with ritonavir has not been \ntested with all PIs (protease inhibitors) and must not be used with other HIV PIs. In some cases dosage \nof other medicines might need to be changed. Therefore always tell your doctor if you take other \nanti-HIV medicines and follow your doctor’s instruction carefully on which medicines can be \ncombined.\n\nThe effects of PREZISTA might be reduced if you take any of the following products. Tell your \ndoctor if you take:\n- Phenobarbital, phenytoin (to prevent seizures)\n- Dexamethasone (corticosteroid)\n- Efavirenz (HIV infection)\n- Boceprevir (hepatitis C infection)\n- Rifapentine, rifabutin (medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)\n- Saquinavir (HIV infection).\n\nThe effects of other medicines might be influenced if you take PREZISTA. Tell your doctor if you \ntake:\n- Amlodipine, diltiazem, disopyramide, carvedilol, felodipine, flecainide, lidocaine, metoprolol,\n\nmexiletine, nifedipine, nicardipine, propafenone, timolol, verapamil (for heart disease) as the \ntherapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines may be increased.\n\n- Apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, warfarin (to reduce clotting of the blood) as their therapeutic \neffect or side effects may be altered; your doctor may have to check your blood.\n\n- Oestrogen-based hormonal contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy. PREZISTA \nmight reduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, alternative methods of \nnon-hormonal contraception are recommended.\n\n- Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. PREZISTA might increase the risk for elevated potassium levels \nby drospirenone.\n\n\n\n154\n\n- Atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). The risk of muscle damage\nmight be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol lowering regimen is best for \nyour specific situation.\n\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)\n- Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as \n\nthe therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased. Your doctor might \nwant to do some additional tests.\n\n- Corticosteroids including betamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, \ntriamcinolone. These medicines are used to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel \ndiseases, inflammatory conditions of the eyes, joints and muscles and other inflammatory \nconditions. If alternatives cannot be used, its use should only take place after medical evaluation \nand under close monitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid side effects.\n\n- Buprenorphine/naloxone (medicines to treat opioid dependence)\n- Salmeterol (medicine to treat asthma)\n- Artemether/lumefantrine (a combination medicine to treat malaria)\n- Dasatinib, everolimus, irinotecan, nilotinib, vinblastine, vincristine (to treat cancer)\n- Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction or to treat a heart and lung disorder \n\ncalled pulmonary arterial hypertension)\n- Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, simeprevir (to treat hepatitis C infection)\n- Fentanyl, oxycodone, tramadol (to treat pain)\n- Fesoterodine, solifenacin (to treat urologic disorders).\n\nThe dosage of other medicines might need to be changed since either their own or PREZISTA’s \ntherapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined.\nTell your doctor if you take:\n- Alfentanil (injectable strong and short-acting painkiller that is used for surgical procedures)\n- Digoxin (to treat certain heart disorders)\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)\n- Itraconazole, isavuconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, clotrimazole (to treat fungal \n\ninfections). Voriconazole should only be taken after medical evaluation.\n- Rifabutin (against bacterial infections)\n- Sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (for erectile dysfunction or high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation)\n- Amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone (to treat \n\ndepression and anxiety)\n- Maraviroc (to treat HIV infection)\n- Methadone (to treat opiate dependance)\n- Carbamazepine, clonazepam (to prevent seizures or to treat certain types of nerve pain)\n- Colchicine (to treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever)\n- Bosentan (to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation)\n- Buspirone, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, midazolam when used as injection, \n\nzolpidem (sedative agents)\n- Perphenazine, risperidone, thioridazine (to treat psychiatric conditions).\n\nThis is not a complete list of medicines. Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines that you are \ntaking.\n\nPREZISTA with food and drink\nSee section 3 ‘How to take PREZISTA.’\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or if you are \nbreast-feeding. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take PREZISTA with ritonavir unless \nspecifically directed by the doctor. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take PREZISTA \nwith cobicistat.\n\n\n\n155\n\nIt is recommended that HIV infected women must not breast-feed their infants because of both the \npossibility of your baby becoming infected with HIV through your breast milk and because of the \nunknown effects of the medicine on your baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not operate machines or drive if you feel dizzy after taking PREZISTA.\n\n3.

Possible side effects\n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nTell your doctor if you develop any of the following side effects.\n\nLiver problems that may occasionally be severe have been reported. Your doctor should do blood tests \nbefore you start PREZISTA. If you have chronic hepatitis B or C infection, your doctor should check \nyour blood tests more often because you have an increased chance of developing liver problems. Talk \nto your doctor about the signs and symptoms of liver problems. These may include yellowing of your \nskin or whites of your eyes, dark (tea coloured) urine, pale coloured stools (bowel movements), \nnausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching, or pain and discomfort on your right side below \nyour ribs.\n\nSkin rash (more often when used in combination with raltegravir), itching. The rash is usually mild to \nmoderate. A skin rash might also be a symptom of a rare severe situation. It is therefore important to\ntalk to your doctor if you develop a rash. Your doctor will advise you how to deal with your symptoms \nor whether PREZISTA must be stopped.\n\nOther severe side effects were diabetes (common) and inflammation of the pancreas (uncommon).\n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)\n- diarrhoea.\n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n- vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain or distension, dyspepsia, flatulence\n- headache, tiredness, dizziness, drowsiness, numbness, tingling or pain in hands or feet, loss of \n\nstrength, difficulty falling asleep.\n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)\n- chest pain, changes in electrocardiogram, rapid heart beating\n- decreased or abnormal skin sensibility, pins and needles, attention disturbance, loss of memory, \n\nproblems with your balance\n- difficulty breathing, cough, nosebleed, throat irritation\n- inflammation of the stomach or mouth, heartburn, retching, dry mouth, discomfort of the \n\nabdomen, constipation, belching\n- kidney failure, kidney stones, difficult discharge of urine, frequent or excessive passage of \n\nurine, sometimes at night\n- urticaria, severe swelling of the skin and other tissues (most often the lips or the eyes), eczema, \n\nexcessive sweating, night sweats, hair loss, acne, scaly skin, colouration of nails\n- muscle pain, muscle cramps or weakness, pain in extremity, osteoporosis\n- slowing down of the thyroid gland function. This can be seen in a blood test.\n- high blood pressure, flushing\n- red or dry eyes\n- fever, swelling of lower limbs due to fluids, malaise, irritability, pain\n- symptoms of infection, herpes simplex\n\n\n\n158\n\n- erectile dysfunction, enlargement of breasts\n- sleeping problems, sleepiness, depression, anxiety, abnormal dreams, decrease in sexual drive\n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)\n- a reaction called DRESS [severe rash, which may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, swelling of \n\nthe face or lymph glands, increase of eosinophils (type of white blood cells), effects on liver, \nkidney or lung]\n\n- heart attack, slow heart beating, palpitations\n- visual disturbance\n- chills, feeling abnormal\n- a feeling of confusion or disorientation, altered mood, restlessness\n- fainting, epileptic fits, changes or loss of taste\n- mouth sores, vomiting blood, inflamation of the lips, dry lips, coated tongue\n- running nose\n- skin lesions, dry skin\n- stiffness of muscles or joints, joint pain with or without inflammation\n- changes in some values of your blood cells or chemistry.

What PREZISTA is and what it is used for\n\nWhat is PREZISTA?\nPREZISTA contains the active substance darunavir. PREZISTA is an antiretroviral medicine used in \nthe treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled protease inhibitors. PREZISTA works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. This will \nimprove your immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.\n\nWhat it is used for?\nPREZISTA is used to treat adults and children of 3 years of age and above, and at least 15 kilogram \nbody weight who are infected by HIV and who have already used other antiretroviral medicines.\n\nPREZISTA must be taken in combination with a low dose of ritonavir and other anti-HIV medicines. \nYour doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take PREZISTA\n\nDo not take PREZISTA\n- if you are allergic to darunavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6) or to ritonavir.\n- if you have severe liver problems. Ask your doctor if you are unsure about the severity of your \n\nliver disease. Some additional tests might be necessary.\n\nDo not combine PREZISTA with any of the following medicines\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor about switching to another medicine.\n\nMedicine Purpose of the medicine\nAvanafil to treat erectile dysfunction \nAstemizole or terfenadine to treat allergy symptoms\nTriazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety\nCisapride to treat some stomach conditions\nColchicine (if you have kidney and/or liver \nproblems)\n\nto treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever\n\n\n\n162\n\nLurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine or sertindole to treat psychiatric conditions\nErgot alkaloids like ergotamine, \ndihydroergotamine, ergometrine and \nmethylergonovine\n\nto treat migraine headaches\n\nAmiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine,\nquinidine, ranolazine \n\nto treat certain heart disorders e.g. abnormal \nheart beat\n\nLovastatin, simvastatin and lomitapide to lower cholesterol levels\nRifampicin to treat some infections such as tuberculosis\nThe combination product lopinavir/ritonavir this anti-HIV medicine belongs to the same class \n\nas PREZISTA\nElbasvir/grazoprevir to treat hepatitis C infection\nAlfuzosin to treat enlarged prostate\nSildenafil to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation\nDabigatran, ticagrelor to help stop the clumping of platelets in the \n\ntreatment of patients with a history of a heart \nattack\n\nNaloxegol to treat opioid induced constipation\nDapoxetine to treat premature ejaculation\nDomperidone to treat nausea and vomiting\n\nDo not combine PREZISTA with products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking PREZISTA.\n\nPREZISTA is not a cure for HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nPeople taking PREZISTA may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \nYou must keep in regular contact with your doctor.\n\nPeople taking PREZISTA may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or \npotentially life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.\n\nIn patients taking PREZISTA and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) \nmay occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately.\n\nTell your doctor about your situation BEFORE and DURING your treatment\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.\n- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C\n\ninfection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \ntake PREZISTA.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. PREZISTA might increase sugar levels in the blood.\n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged \n\nlymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may \noccur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an \nimprovement in the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may \nhave been present with no obvious symptoms.\n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \n\n\n\n163\n\nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. PREZISTA might increase the risk of bleeding.\n- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).\n- Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking \n\ncombination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of \nbone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination \nantiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, \nhigher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing \nthis disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, \nknee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor.\n\nElderly\nPREZISTA has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this \nage group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use PREZISTA.\n\nChildren\nPREZISTA is not for use in children younger than 3 years of age or weighing less than 15 kilograms.\n\nOther medicines and PREZISTA\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.\n\nThere are some medicines that you must not combine with PREZISTA. These are mentioned above \nunder the heading ‘Do not combine PREZISTA with any of the following medicines:’\n\nIn most cases, PREZISTA can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class [e.g. \nNRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors), CCR5 antagonists and FIs (fusion inhibitors)]. PREZISTA with ritonavir has not been \ntested with all PIs (protease inhibitors) and must not be used with other HIV PIs. In some cases dosage \nof other medicines might need to be changed. Therefore always tell your doctor if you take other \nanti-HIV medicines and follow your doctor’s instruction carefully on which medicines can be \ncombined.\n\nThe effects of PREZISTA might be reduced if you take any of the following products. Tell your \ndoctor if you take:\n- Phenobarbital, phenytoin (to prevent seizures)\n- Dexamethasone (corticosteroid)\n- Efavirenz (HIV infection)\n- Boceprevir (hepatitis C infection)\n- Rifapentine, rifabutin (medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)\n- Saquinavir (HIV infection).\n\nThe effects of other medicines might be influenced if you take PREZISTA. Tell your doctor if you \ntake:\n- Amlodipine, diltiazem, disopyramide, carvedilol, felodipine, flecainide, lidocaine, metoprolol,\n\nmexiletine, nifedipine, nicardipine, propafenone, timolol, verapamil (for heart disease) as the \ntherapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines may be increased.\n\n- Apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, warfarin (to reduce clotting of the blood) as their therapeutic \neffect or side effects may be altered; your doctor may have to check your blood.\n\n- Oestrogen-based hormonal contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy. PREZISTA \nmight reduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, alternative methods of \nnon-hormonal contraception are recommended.\n\n- Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. PREZISTA might increase the risk for elevated potassium levels \nby drospirenone.\n\n\n\n164\n\n- Atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). The risk of muscle damage\nmight be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol lowering regimen is best for \nyour specific situation.\n\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)\n- Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as \n\nthe therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased. Your doctor might \nwant to do some additional tests.\n\n- Corticosteroids including betamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, \ntriamcinolone. These medicines are used to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel \ndiseases, inflammatory conditions of the eyes, joints and muscles and other inflammatory \nconditions. If alternatives cannot be used, its use should only take place after medical evaluation \nand under close monitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid side effects.\n\n- Buprenorphine/naloxone (medicines to treat opioid dependence)\n- Salmeterol (medicine to treat asthma)\n- Artemether/lumefantrine (a combination medicine to treat malaria)\n- Dasatinib, everolimus, irinotecan, nilotinib, vinblastine, vincristine (to treat cancer)\n- Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction or to treat a heart and lung disorder \n\ncalled pulmonary arterial hypertension)\n- Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, simeprevir (to treat hepatitis C infection)\n- Fentanyl, oxycodone, tramadol (to treat pain)\n- Fesoterodine, solifenacin (to treat urologic disorders).\n\nThe dosage of other medicines might need to be changed since either their own or PREZISTA’s \ntherapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined.\nTell your doctor if you take:\n- Alfentanil (injectable strong and short-acting painkiller that is used for surgical procedures)\n- Digoxin (to treat certain heart disorders)\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)\n- Itraconazole, isavuconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, clotrimazole (to treat fungal \n\ninfections). Voriconazole should only be taken after medical evaluation.\n- Rifabutin (against bacterial infections)\n- Sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (for erectile dysfunction or high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation)\n- Amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone (to treat \n\ndepression and anxiety)\n- Maraviroc (to treat HIV infection)\n- Methadone (to treat opiate dependance)\n- Carbamazepine, clonazepam (to prevent seizures or to treat certain types of nerve pain)\n- Colchicine (to treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever)\n- Bosentan (to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation)\n- Buspirone, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, midazolam when used as injection, \n\nzolpidem (sedative agents)\n- Perphenazine, risperidone, thioridazine (to treat psychiatric conditions).\n\nThis is not a complete list of medicines. Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines that you are \ntaking.\n\nPREZISTA with food and drink\nSee section 3 ‘How to take PREZISTA.’\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or if you are \nbreast-feeding. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take PREZISTA with ritonavir unless \nspecifically directed by the doctor. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take PREZISTA \nwith cobicistat.\n\n\n\n165\n\nIt is recommended that HIV infected women must not breast-feed their infants because of both the \npossibility of your baby becoming infected with HIV through your breast milk and because of the \nunknown effects of the medicine on your baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not operate machines or drive if you feel dizzy after taking PREZISTA.\n\n3.

Possible side effects\n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nTell your doctor if you develop any of the following side effects.\n\nLiver problems that may occasionally be severe have been reported. Your doctor should do blood tests \nbefore you start PREZISTA. If you have chronic hepatitis B or C infection, your doctor should check \nyour blood tests more often because you have an increased chance of developing liver problems. Talk \nto your doctor about the signs and symptoms of liver problems. These may include yellowing of your \nskin or whites of your eyes, dark (tea coloured) urine, pale coloured stools (bowel movements), \nnausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching, or pain and discomfort on your right side below \nyour ribs.\n\nSkin rash (more often when used in combination with raltegravir), itching. The rash is usually mild to \nmoderate. A skin rash might also be a symptom of a rare severe situation. It is therefore important to \ntalk to your doctor if you develop a rash. Your doctor will advise you how to deal with your symptoms \nor whether PREZISTA must be stopped.\n\nOther severe side effects were diabetes (common) and inflammation of the pancreas (uncommon).\n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)\n- diarrhoea.\n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n- vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain or distension, dyspepsia, flatulence\n- headache, tiredness, dizziness, drowsiness, numbness, tingling or pain in hands or feet, loss of \n\nstrength, difficulty falling asleep.\n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)\n- chest pain, changes in electrocardiogram, rapid heart beating\n- decreased or abnormal skin sensibility, pins and needles, attention disturbance, loss of memory, \n\nproblems with your balance\n- difficulty breathing, cough, nosebleed, throat irritation\n- inflammation of the stomach or mouth, heartburn, retching, dry mouth, discomfort of the \n\nabdomen, constipation, belching\n- kidney failure, kidney stones, difficult discharge of urine, frequent or excessive passage of \n\nurine, sometimes at night\n- urticaria, severe swelling of the skin and other tissues (most often the lips or the eyes), eczema, \n\nexcessive sweating, night sweats, hair loss, acne, scaly skin, colouration of nails\n- muscle pain, muscle cramps or weakness, pain in extremity, osteoporosis\n- slowing down of the thyroid gland function. This can be seen in a blood test.\n- high blood pressure, flushing\n- red or dry eyes\n- fever, swelling of lower limbs due to fluids, malaise, irritability, pain\n- symptoms of infection, herpes simplex\n\n\n\n168\n\n- erectile dysfunction, enlargement of breasts\n- sleeping problems, sleepiness, depression, anxiety, abnormal dreams, decrease in sexual drive\n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)\n- a reaction called DRESS [severe rash, which may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, swelling of \n\nthe face or lymph glands, increase of eosinophils (type of white blood cells), effects on liver, \nkidney or lung]\n\n- heart attack, slow heart beating, palpitations\n- visual disturbance\n- chills, feeling abnormal\n- a feeling of confusion or disorientation, altered mood, restlessness\n- fainting, epileptic fits, changes or loss of taste\n- mouth sores, vomiting blood, inflamation of the lips, dry lips, coated tongue\n- running nose\n- skin lesions, dry skin\n- stiffness of muscles or joints, joint pain with or without inflammation\n- changes in some values of your blood cells or chemistry.

What PREZISTA is and what it is used for\n\nWhat is PREZISTA?\nPREZISTA contains the active substance darunavir. PREZISTA is an antiretroviral medicine used in \nthe treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled protease inhibitors. PREZISTA works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. This will \nimprove your immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.\n\nWhat it is used for?\nThe PREZISTA 400 milligram tablet is used to treat adults and children (3 years of age and above, at \nleast 40 kilograms body weight) who are infected by HIV and\n- who have not used antiretroviral medicines before.\n- in certain patients who have used antiretroviral medicines before (your doctor will determine \n\nthis).\n\nPREZISTA must be taken in combination with a low dose of cobicistat or ritonavir and other anti-HIV \nmedicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take PREZISTA\n\nDo not take PREZISTA\n- if you are allergic to darunavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6) or to cobicistat or ritonavir.\n- if you have severe liver problems. Ask your doctor if you are unsure about the severity of your \n\nliver disease. Some additional tests might be necessary.\n\nDo not combine PREZISTA with any of the following medicines\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor about switching to another medicine.\n\nMedicine Purpose of the medicine\nAvanafil to treat erectile dysfunction \nAstemizole or terfenadine to treat allergy symptoms\n\n\n\n172\n\nTriazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety\nCisapride to treat some stomach conditions\nColchicine (if you have kidney and/or liver \nproblems)\n\nto treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever\n\nLurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine or sertindole to treat psychiatric conditions\nErgot alkaloids like ergotamine, \ndihydroergotamine, ergometrine and \nmethylergonovine\n\nto treat migraine headaches\n\nAmiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine,\nquinidine, ranolazine \n\nto treat certain heart disorders e.g. abnormal \nheart beat\n\nLovastatin, simvastatin and lomitapide to lower cholesterol levels\nRifampicin to treat some infections such as tuberculosis\nThe combination product lopinavir/ritonavir this anti-HIV medicine belongs to the same class \n\nas PREZISTA\nElbasvir/grazoprevir to treat hepatitis C infection\nAlfuzosin to treat enlarged prostate\nSildenafil to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation\nDabigatran, ticagrelor to help stop the clumping of platelets in the \n\ntreatment of patients with a history of a heart \nattack\n\nNaloxegol to treat opioid induced constipation\nDapoxetine to treat premature ejaculation\nDomperidone to treat nausea and vomiting\n\nDo not combine PREZISTA with products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking PREZISTA.\n\nPREZISTA is not a cure for HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nPeople taking PREZISTA may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \nYou must keep in regular contact with your doctor.\n\nPeople taking PREZISTA may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or \npotentially life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.\n\nIn patients taking PREZISTA and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) \nmay occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately.\n\nTell your doctor about your situation BEFORE and DURING your treatment\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.\n- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C\n\ninfection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \ntake PREZISTA.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. PREZISTA might increase sugar levels in the blood.\n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged \n\nlymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may \noccur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an \nimprovement in the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may \nhave been present with no obvious symptoms.\n\n\n\n173\n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek\nnecessary treatment.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. PREZISTA might increase the risk of bleeding.\n- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).\n- Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking \n\ncombination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of \nbone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination \nantiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, \nhigher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing \nthis disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, \nknee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor.\n\nElderly\nPREZISTA has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this \nage group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use PREZISTA.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThe PREZISTA 400 milligram tablet is not for use in children younger than 3 years of age or \nweighing less than 40 kilograms.\n\nOther medicines and PREZISTA\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.\n\nThere are some medicines that you must not combine with PREZISTA. These are mentioned above \nunder the heading ‘Do not combine PREZISTA with any of the following medicines:’\n\nIn most cases, PREZISTA can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class [e.g. \nNRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors), CCR5 antagonists and FIs (fusion inhibitors)]. PREZISTA with cobicistat or ritonavir has \nnot been tested with all PIs (protease inhibitors) and must not be used with other HIV PIs. In some \ncases dosage of other medicines might need to be changed. Therefore always tell your doctor if you \ntake other anti-HIV medicines and follow your doctor’s instruction carefully on which medicines can \nbe combined.\n\nThe effects of PREZISTA might be reduced if you take any of the following products. Tell your \ndoctor if you take:\n- Phenobarbital, phenytoin (to prevent seizures)\n- Dexamethasone (corticosteroid)\n- Efavirenz (HIV infection)\n- Boceprevir (hepatitis C infection)\n- Rifapentine, rifabutin (medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)\n- Saquinavir (HIV infection).\n\nThe effects of other medicines might be influenced if you take PREZISTA. Tell your doctor if you \ntake:\n- Amlodipine, diltiazem, disopyramide, carvedilol, felodipine, flecainide, lidocaine, metoprolol,\n\nmexiletine, nifedipine, nicardipine, propafenone, timolol, verapamil (for heart disease) as the \ntherapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines may be increased.\n\n- Apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, warfarin (to reduce clotting of the blood) as their therapeutic \neffect or side effects may be altered; your doctor may have to check your blood.\n\n\n\n174\n\n- Oestrogen-based hormonal contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy. PREZISTA \nmight reduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, alternative methods of \nnon-hormonal contraception are recommended.\n\n- Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. PREZISTA might increase the risk for elevated potassium levels \nby drospirenone.\n\n- Atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). The risk of muscle damage\nmight be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol lowering regimen is best for \nyour specific situation.\n\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)\n- Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as \n\nthe therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased. Your doctor might \nwant to do some additional tests.\n\n- Corticosteroids including betamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, \ntriamcinolone. These medicines are used to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel \ndiseases, inflammatory conditions of the eyes, joints and muscles and other inflammatory \nconditions. If alternatives cannot be used, its use should only take place after medical evaluation \nand under close monitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid side effects.\n\n- Buprenorphine/naloxone (medicines to treat opioid dependence)\n- Salmeterol (medicine to treat asthma)\n- Artemether/lumefantrine (a combination medicine to treat malaria)\n- Dasatinib, everolimus, irinotecan, nilotinib, vinblastine, vincristine (to treat cancer)\n- Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction or to treat a heart and lung disorder \n\ncalled pulmonary arterial hypertension)\n- Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, simeprevir (to treat hepatitis C infection)\n- Fentanyl, oxycodone, tramadol (to treat pain)\n- Fesoterodine, solifenacin (to treat urologic disorders).\n\nThe dosage of other medicines might need to be changed since either their own or PREZISTA’s \ntherapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined.\nTell your doctor if you take:\n- Alfentanil (injectable strong and short-acting painkiller that is used for surgical procedures)\n- Digoxin (to treat certain heart disorders)\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)\n- Itraconazole, isavuconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, clotrimazole (to treat fungal \n\ninfections). Voriconazole should only be taken after medical evaluation.\n- Rifabutin (against bacterial infections)\n- Sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (for erectile dysfunction or high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation)\n- Amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone (to treat \n\ndepression and anxiety)\n- Maraviroc (to treat HIV infection)\n- Methadone (to treat opiate dependance)\n- Carbamazepine, clonazepam (to prevent seizures or to treat certain types of nerve pain)\n- Colchicine (to treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever)\n- Bosentan (to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation)\n- Buspirone, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, midazolam when used as injection, \n\nzolpidem (sedative agents)\n- Perphenazine, risperidone, thioridazine (to treat psychiatric conditions)\n- Metformin (to treat type 2 diabetes).\n\nThis is not a complete list of medicines. Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines that you are \ntaking.\n\nPREZISTA with food and drink\nSee section 3 ‘How to take PREZISTA.’\n\n\n\n175\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or if you are \nbreast-feeding. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take PREZISTA with ritonavir unless \nspecifically directed by the doctor. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take PREZISTA \nwith cobicistat.\n\nIt is recommended that HIV infected women must not breast-feed their infants because of both the \npossibility of your baby becoming infected with HIV through your breast milk and because of the \nunknown effects of the medicine on your baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not operate machines or drive if you feel dizzy after taking PREZISTA.\n\nPREZISTA tablets contain sunset yellow FCF (E110) which may cause allergic reactions.\n\n3.

What PREZISTA is and what it is used for\n\nWhat is PREZISTA?\nPREZISTA contains the active substance darunavir. PREZISTA is an antiretroviral medicine used in \nthe treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled protease inhibitors. PREZISTA works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. This will \nimprove your immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.\n\nWhat it is used for?\nPREZISTA is used to treat adults and children of 3 years of age and above, and at least 15 kilogram \nbody weight who are infected by HIV and who have already used other antiretroviral medicines.\n\nPREZISTA must be taken in combination with a low dose of ritonavir and other anti-HIV medicines. \nYour doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take PREZISTA\n\nDo not take PREZISTA\n- if you are allergic to darunavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6) or to ritonavir.\n- if you have severe liver problems. Ask your doctor if you are unsure about the severity of your \n\nliver disease. Some additional tests might be necessary.\n\nDo not combine PREZISTA with any of the following medicines\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor about switching to another medicine.\n\nMedicine Purpose of the medicine\nAvanafil to treat erectile dysfunction \nAstemizole or terfenadine to treat allergy symptoms\nTriazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety\nCisapride to treat some stomach conditions\nColchicine (if you have kidney and/or liver \nproblems)\n\nto treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever\n\n\n\n182\n\nLurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine or sertindole to treat psychiatric conditions\nErgot alkaloids like ergotamine, \ndihydroergotamine, ergometrine and \nmethylergonovine\n\nto treat migraine headaches\n\nAmiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine,\nquinidine, ranolazine\n\nto treat certain heart disorders e.g. abnormal \nheart beat\n\nLovastatin, simvastatin and lomitapide to lower cholesterol levels\nRifampicin to treat some infections such as tuberculosis\nThe combination product lopinavir/ritonavir this anti-HIV medicine belongs to the same class \n\nas PREZISTA\nElbasvir/grazoprevir to treat hepatitis C infection\nAlfuzosin to treat enlarged prostate\nSildenafil to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation\nDabigatran, ticagrelor to help stop the clumping of platelets in the \n\ntreatment of patients with a history of a heart \nattack\n\nNaloxegol to treat opioid induced constipation\nDapoxetine to treat premature ejaculation\nDomperidone to treat nausea and vomiting\n\nDo not combine PREZISTA with products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking PREZISTA.\n\nPREZISTA is not a cure for HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nPeople taking PREZISTA may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \nYou must keep in regular contact with your doctor.\n\nPeople taking PREZISTA may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or \npotentially life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.\n\nIn patients taking PREZISTA and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) \nmay occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately.\n\nTell your doctor about your situation BEFORE and DURING your treatment\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.\n- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C\n\ninfection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \ntake PREZISTA.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. PREZISTA might increase sugar levels in the blood.\n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged\n\nlymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may \noccur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an \nimprovement in the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may \nhave been present with no obvious symptoms.\n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \n\n\n\n183\n\nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. PREZISTA might increase the risk of bleeding.\n- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).\n- Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking \n\ncombination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of \nbone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination \nantiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, \nhigher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing \nthis disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, \nknee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor.\n\nElderly\nPREZISTA has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this \nage group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use PREZISTA.\n\nChildren\nPREZISTA is not for use in children younger than 3 years of age or weighing less than 15 kilograms.\n\nOther medicines and PREZISTA\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.\n\nThere are some medicines that you must not combine with PREZISTA. These are mentioned above \nunder the heading ‘Do not combine PREZISTA with any of the following medicines:’\n\nIn most cases, PREZISTA can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class [e.g. \nNRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors), CCR5 antagonists and FIs (fusion inhibitors)]. PREZISTA with ritonavir has not been \ntested with all PIs (protease inhibitors) and must not be used with other HIV PIs. In some cases dosage \nof other medicines might need to be changed. Therefore always tell your doctor if you take other \nanti-HIV medicines and follow your doctor’s instruction carefully on which medicines can be \ncombined.\n\nThe effects of PREZISTA might be reduced if you take any of the following products. Tell your \ndoctor if you take:\n- Phenobarbital, phenytoin (to prevent seizures)\n- Dexamethasone (corticosteroid)\n- Efavirenz (HIV infection)\n- Boceprevir (hepatitis C infection)\n- Rifapentine, rifabutin (medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)\n- Saquinavir (HIV infection).\n\nThe effects of other medicines might be influenced if you take PREZISTA. Tell your doctor if you \ntake:\n- Amlodipine, diltiazem, disopyramide, carvedilol, felodipine, flecainide, lidocaine, metoprolol,\n\nmexiletine, nifedipine, nicardipine, propafenone, timolol, verapamil (for heart disease) as the \ntherapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines may be increased.\n\n- Apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, warfarin (to reduce clotting of the blood) as their therapeutic \neffect or side effects may be altered; your doctor may have to check your blood.\n\n- Oestrogen-based hormonal contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy. PREZISTA \nmight reduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, alternative methods of \nnon-hormonal contraception are recommended.\n\n- Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. PREZISTA might increase the risk for elevated potassium levels \nby drospirenone.\n\n\n\n184\n\n- Atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). The risk of muscle damage\nmight be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol lowering regimen is best for \nyour specific situation.\n\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)\n- Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as \n\nthe therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased. Your doctor might \nwant to do some additional tests.\n\n- Corticosteroids including betamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, \ntriamcinolone. These medicines are used to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel \ndiseases, inflammatory conditions of the eyes, joints and muscles and other inflammatory \nconditions. If alternatives cannot be used, its use should only take place after medical evaluation \nand under close monitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid side effects.\n\n- Buprenorphine/naloxone (medicines to treat opioid dependence)\n- Salmeterol (medicine to treat asthma)\n- Artemether/lumefantrine (a combination medicine to treat malaria)\n- Dasatinib, everolimus, irinotecan, nilotinib, vinblastine, vincristine (to treat cancer)\n- Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction or to treat a heart and lung disorder \n\ncalled pulmonary arterial hypertension)\n- Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, simeprevir (to treat hepatitis C infection)\n- Fentanyl, oxycodone, tramadol (to treat pain)\n- Fesoterodine, solifenacin (to treat urologic disorders).\n\nThe dosage of other medicines might need to be changed since either their own or PREZISTA’s \ntherapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined.\nTell your doctor if you take:\n- Alfentanil (injectable strong and short-acting painkiller that is used for surgical procedures)\n- Digoxin (to treat certain heart disorders)\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)\n- Itraconazole, isavuconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, clotrimazole (to treat fungal \n\ninfections). Voriconazole should only be taken after medical evaluation.\n- Rifabutin (against bacterial infections)\n- Sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (for erectile dysfunction or high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation)\n- Amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone (to treat \n\ndepression and anxiety)\n- Maraviroc (to treat HIV infection)\n- Methadone (to treat opiate dependance)\n- Carbamazepine, clonazepam (to prevent seizures or to treat certain types of nerve pain)\n- Colchicine (to treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever)\n- Bosentan (to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation)\n- Buspirone, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, midazolam when used as injection, \n\nzolpidem (sedative agents)\n- Perphenazine, risperidone, thioridazine (to treat psychiatric conditions).\n\nThis is not a complete list of medicines. Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines that you are \ntaking.\n\nPREZISTA with food and drink\nSee section 3 ‘How to take PREZISTA.’\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or if you are \nbreast-feeding. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take PREZISTA with ritonavir unless \nspecifically directed by the doctor. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take PREZISTA \nwith cobicistat.\n\n\n\n185\n\nIt is recommended that HIV infected women must not breast-feed their infants because of both the \npossibility of your baby becoming infected with HIV through your breast milk and because of the \nunknown effects of the medicine on your baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not operate machines or drive if you feel dizzy after taking PREZISTA.\n\nPREZISTA tablets contain sunset yellow FCF (E110) which may cause allergic reactions.\n\n3.

Your doctor will test for these changes.\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nTell your doctor if you develop any of the following side effects.\n\nLiver problems that may occasionally be severe have been reported. Your doctor should do blood tests \nbefore you start PREZISTA. If you have chronic hepatitis B or C infection, your doctor should check \nyour blood tests more often because you have an increased chance of developing liver problems. Talk \nto your doctor about the signs and symptoms of liver problems. These may include yellowing of your \nskin or whites of your eyes, dark (tea coloured) urine, pale coloured stools (bowel movements), \nnausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching, or pain and discomfort on your right side below \nyour ribs.\n\nSkin rash (more often when used in combination with raltegravir), itching. The rash is usually mild to \nmoderate. A skin rash might also be a symptom of a rare severe situation. It is therefore important to \ntalk to your doctor if you develop a rash.

What PREZISTA is and what it is used for\n\nWhat is PREZISTA?\nPREZISTA contains the active substance darunavir. PREZISTA is an antiretroviral medicine used in \nthe treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled protease inhibitors. PREZISTA works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. This will \nimprove your immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.\n\nWhat it is used for?\nThe PREZISTA 800 milligram tablet is used to treat adults and children (3 years of age and above, at \nleast 40 kilograms body weight) who are infected by HIV and\n- who have not used antiretroviral medicines before.\n- in certain patients who have used antiretroviral medicines before (your doctor will determine \n\nthis).\n\nPREZISTA must be taken in combination with a low dose of cobicistat or ritonavir and other anti-HIV \nmedicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take PREZISTA\n\nDo not take PREZISTA\n- if you are allergic to darunavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6) or to cobicistat or ritonavir.\n- if you have severe liver problems. Ask your doctor if you are unsure about the severity of your \n\nliver disease. Some additional tests might be necessary.\n\nDo not combine PREZISTA with any of the following medicines\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor about switching to another medicine.\n\nMedicine Purpose of the medicine\nAvanafil to treat erectile dysfunction \nAstemizole or terfenadine to treat allergy symptoms\nTriazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety\n\n\n\n192\n\nCisapride to treat some stomach conditions\nColchicine (if you have kidney and/or liver \nproblems)\n\nto treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever\n\nLurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine or sertindole to treat psychiatric conditions\nErgot alkaloids like ergotamine, \ndihydroergotamine, ergometrine and \nmethylergonovine\n\nto treat migraine headaches\n\nAmiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine\nquinidine, ranolazine \n\nto treat certain heart disorders e.g. abnormal \nheart beat\n\nLovastatin, simvastatin and lomitapide to lower cholesterol levels\nRifampicin to treat some infections such as tuberculosis\nThe combination product lopinavir/ritonavir this anti-HIV medicine belongs to the same class \n\nas PREZISTA\nElbasvir/grazoprevir to treat hepatitis C infection\nAlfuzosin to treat enlarged prostate\nSildenafil to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation\nDabigatran, ticagrelor to help stop the clumping of platelets in the \n\ntreatment of patients with a history of a heart \nattack\n\nNaloxegol to treat opioid induced constipation\nDapoxetine to treat premature ejaculation\nDomperidone to treat nausea and vomiting\n\nDo not combine PREZISTA with products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking PREZISTA.\n\nPREZISTA is not a cure for HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nPeople taking PREZISTA may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \nYou must keep in regular contact with your doctor.\n\nPeople taking PREZISTA may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or \npotentially life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.\n\nIn patients taking PREZISTA and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) \nmay occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately.\n\nTell your doctor about your situation BEFORE and DURING your treatment\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.\n- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C\n\ninfection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \ntake PREZISTA.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. PREZISTA might increase sugar levels in the blood.\n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged \n\nlymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may \noccur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an \nimprovement in the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may \nhave been present with no obvious symptoms.\n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \n\n\n\n193\n\nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. PREZISTA might increase the risk of bleeding.\n- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).\n- Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking \n\ncombination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of \nbone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination \nantiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, \nhigher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing \nthis disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, \nknee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor.\n\nElderly\nPREZISTA has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this \nage group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use PREZISTA.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThe PREZISTA 800 milligram tablet is not for use in children younger than 3 years of age or \nweighing less than 40 kilograms.\n\nOther medicines and PREZISTA\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.\n\nThere are some medicines that you must not combine with PREZISTA. These are mentioned above \nunder the heading ‘Do not combine PREZISTA with any of the following medicines:’\n\nIn most cases, PREZISTA can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class [e.g. \nNRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors), CCR5 antagonists and FIs (fusion inhibitors)]. PREZISTA with cobicistat or ritonavir has \nnot been tested with all PIs (protease inhibitors) and must not be used with other HIV PIs. In some \ncases dosage of other medicines might need to be changed. Therefore always tell your doctor if you \ntake other anti-HIV medicines and follow your doctor’s instruction carefully on which medicines can \nbe combined.\n\nThe effects of PREZISTA might be reduced if you take any of the following products. Tell your \ndoctor if you take:\n- Phenobarbital, phenytoin (to prevent seizures)\n- Dexamethasone (corticosteroid)\n- Efavirenz (HIV infection)\n- Boceprevir (hepatitis C infection)\n- Rifapentine, rifabutin (medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)\n- Saquinavir (HIV infection).\n\nThe effects of other medicines might be influenced if you take PREZISTA. Tell your doctor if you \ntake:\n- Amlodipine, diltiazem, disopyramide, carvedilol, felodipine, flecainide, lidocaine, metoprolol,\n\nmexiletine, nifedipine, nicardipine, propafenone, timolol, verapamil (for heart disease) as the \ntherapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines may be increased.\n\n- Apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, warfarin (to reduce clotting of the blood) as their therapeutic \neffect or side effects may be altered; your doctor may have to check your blood.\n\n- Oestrogen-based hormonal contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy. PREZISTA \nmight reduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, alternative methods of \nnon-hormonal contraception are recommended.\n\n\n\n194\n\n- Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. PREZISTA might increase the risk for elevated potassium levels \nby drospirenone.\n\n- Atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). The risk of muscle damage\nmight be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol lowering regimen is best for \nyour specific situation.\n\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)\n- Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as \n\nthe therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased. Your doctor might \nwant to do some additional tests.\n\n- Corticosteroids including betamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, \ntriamcinolone. These medicines are used to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel \ndiseases, inflammatory conditions of the eyes, joints and muscles and other inflammatory \nconditions. If alternatives cannot be used, its use should only take place after medical evaluation \nand under close monitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid side effects.\n\n- Buprenorphine/naloxone (medicines to treat opioid dependence)\n- Salmeterol (medicine to treat asthma)\n- Artemether/lumefantrine (a combination medicine to treat malaria)\n- Dasatinib, everolimus, irinotecan, nilotinib, vinblastine, vincristine (to treat cancer)\n- Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction or to treat a heart and lung disorder \n\ncalled pulmonary arterial hypertension)\n- Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, simeprevir (to treat hepatitis C infection)\n- Fentanyl, oxycodone, tramadol (to treat pain)\n- Fesoterodine, solifenacin (to treat urologic disorders).\n\nThe dosage of other medicines might need to be changed since either their own or PREZISTA’s \ntherapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined.\nTell your doctor if you take:\n- Alfentanil (injectable strong and short-acting painkiller that is used for surgical procedures)\n- Digoxin (to treat certain heart disorders)\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)\n- Itraconazole, isavuconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, clotrimazole (to treat fungal \n\ninfections). Voriconazole should only be taken after medical evaluation.\n- Rifabutin (against bacterial infections)\n- Sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (for erectile dysfunction or high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation)\n- Amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone (to treat \n\ndepression and anxiety)\n- Maraviroc (to treat HIV infection)\n- Methadone (to treat opiate dependance)\n- Carbamazepine, clonazepam (to prevent seizures or to treat certain types of nerve pain)\n- Colchicine (to treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever)\n- Bosentan (to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation)\n- Buspirone, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, midazolam when used as injection, \n\nzolpidem (sedative agents)\n- Perphenazine, risperidone, thioridazine (to treat psychiatric conditions)\n- Metformin (to treat type 2 diabetes).\n\nThis is not a complete list of medicines. Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines that you are \ntaking.\n\nPREZISTA with food and drink\nSee section 3 ‘How to take PREZISTA.’\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or if you are \nbreast-feeding. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take PREZISTA with ritonavir unless \n\n\n\n195\n\nspecifically directed by the doctor. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take PREZISTA \nwith cobicistat.\n\nIt is recommended that HIV infected women must not breast-feed their infants because of both the \npossibility of your baby becoming infected with HIV through your breast milk and because of the \nunknown effects of the medicine on your baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not operate machines or drive if you feel dizzy after taking PREZISTA.\n\n3.

Your doctor will test for these changes.\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\n\n\n197\n\nTell your doctor if you develop any of the following side effects.\n\nLiver problems that may occasionally be severe have been reported. Your doctor should do blood tests \nbefore you start PREZISTA. If you have chronic hepatitis B or C infection, your doctor should check \nyour blood tests more often because you have an increased chance of developing liver problems. Talk \nto your doctor about the signs and symptoms of liver problems. These may include yellowing of your \nskin or whites of your eyes, dark (tea coloured) urine, pale coloured stools (bowel movements), \nnausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching, or pain and discomfort on your right side below \nyour ribs.\n\nSkin rash (more often when used in combination with raltegravir), itching. The rash is usually mild to \nmoderate. A skin rash might also be a symptom of a rare severe situation. It is therefore important to \ntalk to your doctor if you develop a rash.
