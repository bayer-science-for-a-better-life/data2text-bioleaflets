NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nFareston 60 mg tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains 60 mg toremifene (as citrate).\n\nExcipient with known effect\nOne tablet contains 28.5 mg of lactose. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nTablet.\nWhite, round, flat, bevelled edge tablet with TO 60 on one side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nFirst line hormone treatment of hormone-dependent metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal patients.\nFareston is not recommended for patients with estrogen receptor negative tumours.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose is 60 mg daily.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal insufficiency.\n\nHepatic impairment\nToremifene should be used cautiously in patients with liver impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of Fareston in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nToremifene is administered orally. Toremifene can be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Pre-existing endometrial hyperplasia and severe hepatic failure are contra-indications in long-\nterm use of toremifene.\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n- Both in preclinical investigations and in humans, changes in cardiac electrophysiology have been\n\nobserved following exposure to toremifene, in the form of QT prolongation. For reasons of drug\nsafety, toremifene is therefore contraindicated in patients with:\n\n- Congenital or documented acquired QT prolongation\n- Electrolyte disturbances, particularly in uncorrected hypokalaemia\n\n\n\n3\n\n- Clinically relevant bradycardia\n- Clinically relevant heart failure with reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction\n- Previous history of symptomatic arrhythmias.\n\nToremifene should not be used concurrently with other drugs that prolong the QT interval (see also\nsection 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGynaecological examination should be performed before treatment administration, closely looking at\npre-existing endometrial abnormality. Afterwards gynaecological examination should be repeated at\nleast once a year. Patients with additional risk of endometrial cancer, e.g. patients suffering from\nhypertension or diabetes, having high BMI (> 30) or history of hormone replacement therapy should be\nclosely monitored (see also section 4.8).\n\nAnemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia have been reported. Red blood cell, leukocyte or platelet\ncounts should be monitored when using Fareston.\n\nCases of liver injury, including elevation of liver enzymes (> 10 times upper limit of normal), hepatitis\nand jaundice have been reported with toremifene. Most of them occurred during the first months of\ntreatment. The pattern of the liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular.\n\nPatients with a history of severe thromboembolic disease should generally not be treated with toremifene\n(see also section 4.8).\n\nFareston has been shown to prolong the QTc interval on the electrocardiogram in some patients in a\ndose-related manner. The following information regarding QT-prolongation is of special importance (for\ncontraindications see section 4.3).\n\nA QT clinical study with a 5-arm parallel design (placebo, moxifloxacin 400 mg, toremifene 20 mg,\n80 mg, and 300 mg) has been performed in 250 male patients to characterize the effects of toremifene\non the QTc interval duration. The results of this study show a clear positive effect of toremifene in the\n80 mg group with mean prolongations of 21 - 26 ms. Regarding the 20 mg group, this effect is\nsignificant as well, according to ICH guidelines, with upper confidence interval of 10 - 12 ms. These\nresults strongly suggest an important dose-dependent effect. As women tend to have a longer baseline\nQTc interval compared with men, they may be more sensitive to QTc-prolonging medications. Elderly\npatients may also be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval.\n\nFareston should be used with caution in patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions (especially\nelderly patients) such as acute myocardial ischaemia or QT prolongation as this may lead to an\nincreased risk for ventricular arrhythmias (incl. Torsade de pointes) and cardiac arrest (see also section\n4.3).\nIf signs or symptoms that may be associated with cardiac arrhythmia occur during treatment with\nFareston, treatment should be stopped and an ECG should be performed.\n\nIf the QTc interval is > 500 ms, Fareston should not be used.\n\nPatients with non-compensated cardiac insufficiency or severe angina pectoris should be closely\nmonitored.\n\nHypercalcemia may occur at the beginning of toremifene treatment in patients with bone metastasis and\nthus these patients should be closely monitored.\n\nThere are no systematic data available from patients with labile diabetes, from patients with severely\naltered performance status or from patients with cardiac failure.\n\n\n\n4\n\nFareston tablets contain lactose (28.5 mg/tablet). Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose\nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this\nmedicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nAn additive effect on QT interval prolongation between Fareston and the following drugs and other\nmedicinal products that may prolong the QTc interval cannot be excluded. This might lead to an\nincreased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including Torsade de pointes. Therefore co-administration of\nFareston with any of the following medicinal products is contraindicated (see also section 4.3):\n- antiarrhythmics class IA (e.g. quinidine, hydroquinidine, disopyramide) or\n- antiarrhythmics class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide),\n- neuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, pimozide, sertindole, haloperidol, sultopride),\n- certain antimicrobials agents (moxifloxacin, erythromycin IV, pentamidine, antimalarials\n\nparticularly halofantrine),\n- certain antihistaminics (terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine),\n-  others (cisapride, vincamine IV, bepridil, diphemanil).\n\nDrugs which decrease renal calcium excretion, e.g. thiazide diuretics, may increase the risk of\nhypercalcaemia.\n\nEnzyme inducers, like phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, may increase the rate of toremifene\nmetabolism thus lowering the steady-state concentration in serum. In such cases doubling of the daily\ndose may be necessary.\n\nThere is a known interaction between anti-estrogens and warfarin-type anticoagulants leading to a\nseriously increased bleeding time. Therefore, the concomitant use of toremifene with such drugs should\nbe avoided.\n\nTheoretically the metabolism of toremifene is inhibited by drugs known to inhibit the CYP3A enzyme\nsystem which is reported to be responsible for its main metabolic pathways. Examples of such drugs are\nantifungal imidazoles (ketoconazole); other antifungal agents (itraconazole, voriconazole,\nposaconazole); protease inhibitors (ritonavir, nelfinavir), macrolides (clarithromycin, erythromycin,\ntelithromycine). Concomitant use of those drugs with toremifene should be carefully considered.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of Fareston in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown\nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.\n\nFareston should not be used during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIn rats, decreased body weight gain of the offspring during lactation was observed.\n\nFareston should not be used during lactation.\n\nFertility\nToremifene is recommended for postmenopausal patients.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nToremifene has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions are hot flushes, sweating, uterine bleeding, leukorrhea, fatigue,\nnausea, rash, itching, dizziness and depression. The reactions are usually mild and mostly due to the\nhormonal action of toremifene.\n\nThe frequencies of the adverse reactions are classified as follows:\nVery common (≥ 1/10)\nCommon (≥ 1/100 to <1/10)\nUncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100)\nRare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000)\nVery rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nSystem organ\nclass\n\nVery\ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare Not known\n\nNeoplasms\nbeningn,\nmalignant and\nunspecified\n(including cysts\nand polyps)\n\nendometrial\ncancer\n\nBlood and\nlymphatic\nsystem\ndisorders\n\nThrombocytopenia,\nanaemia and\nleukopenia\n\nMetabolism\nand nutrition\ndisorders\n\nloss of appetite\n\nPsychiatric\ndisorders\n\ndepression insomnia\n\nNervous system\ndisorders\n\ndizziness headache\n\nEye disorders transient\ncorneal\nopacity\n\nEar and\nlabyrinth\ndisorders\n\nvertigo\n\nVascular\ndisorders\n\nhot\nflushes\n\nthromboembolic\nevents\n\nRespiratory,\nthoracic and\nmediastinal\ndisorders\n\ndyspnoea\n\nGastrointestinal\ndisorders\n\nnausea,\nvomiting\n\nconstipation\n\nHepatobiliary\ndisorders\n\nincrease of\ntransaminases\n\njaundice hepatitis,\nhepatic steatosis\n\nSkin and\nsubcutaneous\ntissue disorders\n\nsweating rash,\nitching\n\nalopecia\n\nReproductive\nsystem and\n\nuterine\nbleeding\n\nendometrial\nhypertrophy\n\nendometrial\npolyps\n\nendometrial\nhyperplasia,\n\n\n\n6\n\nbreast disorders leukorrhea\nGeneral\ndisorders and\nadministration\nsite conditions\n\nfatigue\noedema\n\nweight increase,\n\nThromboembolic events include deep venous thrombosis, thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism\n(see also section 4.4).\n\nToremifene treatment has been associated with changes in liver enzyme levels (increases of\ntransaminases) and in very rare occasions with more severe liver function abnormalities (jaundice).\n\nA few cases of hypercalcaemia have been reported in patients with bone metastases at the beginning of\ntoremifene treatment.\n\nEndometrial hypertrophy may develop during the treatment due to the partial estrogenic effect of\ntoremifene. There is a risk of increased endometrial changes including hyperplasia, polyps and cancer.\nThis may be due to the underlying mechanism/estrogenic stimulation (see also section 4.4).\nFareston increases the QT interval in a dose-related manner (see also section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed\nin Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nVertigo, headache and dizziness were observed in healthy volunteer studies at daily dose of 680 mg. The\ndose-related QTc interval prolongation potential of Fareston should also be taken into account in cases\nof overdose. There is no specific antidote and the treatment is symptomatic.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-estrogens, ATC code: L02BA02\n\nToremifene is a nonsteroidal triphenylethylene derivative. As other members of this class, e.g. tamoxifen\nand clomifene, toremifene binds to estrogen receptors and may produce estrogenic, anti-estrogenic or\nboth effects, depending upon the duration of treatment, animal species, gender, target organ and variable\nselected. In general, however, nonsteroidal triphenylethylene derivatives are predominantly anti-\nestrogenic in rats and man and estrogenic in mice.\n\nIn post-menopausal breast cancer patients, toremifene treatment is associated with modest reductions in\nboth total serum cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL).\n\nToremifene binds specifically to estrogen receptors, competitively with oestradiol, and inhibits estrogen-\ninduced stimulation of DNA synthesis and cell replication. In some experimental cancers and/or using\nhigh-dose, toremifene displays anti-tumour effects which are not estrogen-dependent.\n\nThe anti-tumour effect of toremifene in breast cancer is mainly due to the anti-estrogenic effect,\nalthough other mechanisms (changes in oncogene expression, growth factor secretion, induction of\napoptosis and influence on cell cycle kinetics) may also be involved in the anti-tumour effect.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nToremifene is readily absorbed after oral administration. Peak concentrations in serum are obtained\nwithin 3 (range 2 - 5) hours. Food intake has no effect on the extent of absorption but may delay the\npeak concentrations by 1.5 - 2 hours. The changes due to food intake are not clinically significant.\n\nDistribution\nThe serum concentration curve can be described by a biexponential equation. The half-life of the first\n(distribution) phase is 4 (range 2 - 12) hours, and of the second (elimination) phase 5 (range 2 -\n10) days. The basal disposition parameters (CL and V) could not be estimated due to the lack of\nintravenous study. Toremifene binds extensively (> 99.5%) to serum proteins, mainly to albumin.\nToremifene obeys linear serum kinetics at oral daily doses between 11 and 680 mg. The mean\nconcentration of toremifene at steady-state is 0.9 (range 0.6 - 1.3) µg/ml at the recommended dose of\n60 mg per day.\n\nBiotransformation\nToremifene is extensively metabolised. In human serum the main metabolite is N-demethyltoremifene\nwith mean half-life of 11 (range 4 - 20) days. Its steady-state concentrations are about twice compared\nto those of the parent compound. It has similar anti-estrogenic, albeit weaker anti-tumour activity than\nthe parent compound.\n\nIt is bound to plasma proteins even more extensively than toremifene, the protein bound fraction being\n> 99.9%. Three minor metabolites have been detected in human serum: (deaminohydroxy)toremifene,\n4-hydroxytoremifene, and N,N-didemethyltoremifene. Although they have theoretically interesting\nhormonal effects, their concentrations during toremifene treatment are too low to have any major\nbiological importance.\n\nElimination\nToremifene is eliminated mainly as metabolites to the faeces. Enterohepatic circulation can be expected.\nAbout 10% of the administered dose is eliminated via urine as metabolites. Owing to the slow\nelimination, steady-state concentrations in serum are reached in 4 to 6 weeks.\n\nCharacteristics in patients\nClinical anti-tumour efficacy and serum concentrations have no positive correlation at the recommended\ndaily dose of 60 mg.\n\nNo information is available concerning polymorphic metabolism. Enzyme complex, known to be\nresponsible for the metabolism of toremifene in humans, is cytochrome P450-dependent hepatic mixed\nfunction oxidase. The main metabolic pathway, N-demethylation, is mediated mainly by CYP3A.\n\nPharmacokinetics of toremifene were investigated in an open study with four parallel groups of ten\nsubjects: normal subjects, patients with impaired (mean AST 57 U/L - mean ALT 76 U/L - mean\ngamma GT 329 U/L) or activated liver function (mean AST 25 U/L - mean ALT 30 U/L - mean gamma\nGT 91 U/L - patients treated with antiepileptics) and patients with impaired renal function (creatinine:\n176 µmol/L). In this study the kinetics of toremifene in patients with impaired renal function were not\nsignificantly altered as compared to normal subjects. The elimination of toremifene and its metabolites\nwas significantly increased in patients with activated liver function and decreased in patients with\nimpaired liver function.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nThe acute toxicity of toremifene is low with LD-50 in rats and mice of more than 2000 mg/kg. In\nrepeated toxicity studies the cause of death in rats is gastric dilatation. In the acute and chronic toxicity\n\n\n\n8\n\nstudies most of the findings are related to the hormonal effects of toremifene. The other findings are not\ntoxicologically significant. Toremifene has not shown any genotoxicity and has not been found to be\ncarcinogenic in rats. In mice, estrogens induce ovarian and testicular tumours as well as hyperostosis\nand osteosarcomas. Toremifene has a species-specific estrogen-like effect in mice and causes similar\ntumours. These findings are postulated to be of little relevance for the safety in man, where toremifene\nacts mainly as an anti-estrogen.\n\nNon clinical in vitro and in vivo studies have evidenced the potential of toremifene and its metabolite to\nprolong cardiac repolarisation and this can be attributed to the blockade of hERG channels.\n\nIn vivo, high plasma concentrations in monkeys caused a 24% prolongation in QTc, which is in line\nwith QTc findings in humans.\n\nIt is also to be noted that the Cmax observed in the monkeys (1800 ng/ml) is two-fold compared to the\nmean Cmax observed in humans at a daily dose of 60 mg.\n\nAction potential studies in isolated rabbit heart have shown that toremifene induce cardiac\nelectrophysiological changes which start to develop at concentrations approximately 10 fold compared\nto the calculated free therapeutic plasma concentration in human.\n\n6.
