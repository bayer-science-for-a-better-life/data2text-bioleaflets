NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNULOJIX 250 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 250 mg of belatacept. \nAfter reconstitution, each ml of concentrate contains 25 mg belatacept. \n \nBelatacept is a fusion protein produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA \ntechnology. \n \nExcipient with known effect  \nEach vial contains 0.65 mmol sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate). \n \nThe powder is a white to off-white whole or fragmented cake. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNULOJIX, in combination with corticosteroids and a mycophenolic acid (MPA), is indicated for \nprophylaxis of graft rejection  in adults receiving a renal transplant (see section 5.1 for data on renal \nfunction). It is recommended to add an interleukin (IL)-2 receptor antagonist for induction therapy to \nthis belatacept-based regimen. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be prescribed and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \nmanagement of immunosuppressive therapy and of renal transplant patients. \n \nBelatacept has not been studied in patients with Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA) > 30% (who often \nrequire increased immunosuppression). Because of the risk of a high total burden of \nimmunosuppression, belatacept should only be used in these patients after consideration of alternative \ntherapy (see section 4.4).  \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is based on patient body weight (kg). The dose and treatment frequency is \ngiven below. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTable 1:  Dose of belatacept for renal transplant recipients \n\nInitial phase Dose \n\nDay of transplantation, prior to implantation (Day 1) 10 mg/kg \n\nDay 5, Day 14 and Day 28  10 mg/kg \n\nEnd of Week 8 and Week 12 after transplantation 10 mg/kg \n\nMaintenance phase Dose \n\nEvery 4 weeks (± 3 days), starting at the end of week 16 after transplantation 5 mg/kg \n \nFor more details on the dose calculation, see section 6.6. \n \nPatients do not require pre-medication prior to administration of belatacept. \n \nNULOJIX should be administered in combination with basiliximab induction, mycophenolate mofetil, \nand corticosteroids. Corticosteroid tapering in patients taking belatacept should be implemented \ncautiously, particularly in patients with 4 to 6 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1) \n \nInfusion-related reactions have been reported with belatacept administration in clinical studies. If any \nserious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, belatacept therapy should be discontinued \nimmediately and appropriate therapy initiated (see section 4.4). \n \nTherapeutic monitoring of belatacept is not required. \n \nDuring clinical studies, there was no dose modification of belatacept for a change in body weight of \nless than 10%. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is required (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment or undergoing dialysis (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo patients with hepatic impairment were studied in renal transplant protocols, therefore dose \nmodification of belatacept in hepatic impairment can not be recommended.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of belatacept in children and adolescents 0 to 18 years of age have not yet \nbeen established. No data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration \nNULOJIX is for intravenous use only. \n \nThe diluted solution must be administered as an intravenous infusion at a relatively constant rate over \n30 minutes. Infusion of the first dose should be given in the immediate preoperative period or during \nsurgery, but before completion of the transplant vascular anastomoses.  \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nTransplant recipients who are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seronegative or serostatus unknown. \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nPost-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)  \nIn the Phase 2 and 3 studies (3 studies), the incidence of PTLD was higher in belatacept-treated \npatients than in ciclosporin-treated patients (see section 4.8). Belatacept-treated transplant recipients \nwho are EBV seronegative are at an increased risk for PTLD compared with those who are EBV \npositive (see section 4.8). EBV serology should be ascertained before starting administration of \nbelatacept. Transplant recipients who are EBV seronegative or serostatus unknown should not receive \nbelatacept (see section 4.3). \n \nIn addition to EBV seronegative status, other known risk factors for PTLD include cytomegalovirus \n(CMV) infection and T-cell-depleting therapy, which was more commonly used to treat acute rejection \nin belatacept-treated patients in Phase 3 clinical studies (see section 5.1). \n \nPTLD in belatacept-treated patients most often presented in the central nervous system (CNS). \nPhysicians should consider PTLD in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening \nneurologic, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. \n \nInfections \nUse of immunosuppressants, including belatacept, can increase susceptibility to infection, including \nfatal infections, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, and herpes (see progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy (PML) warning below and also section 4.8). \n \nCMV prophylaxis is recommended for at least 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients \nat increased risk for CMV infection. Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis is recommended for at \nleast 6 months following transplantation. \n \nTuberculosis was more frequently observed in patients receiving belatacept than ciclosporin in clinical \nstudies (see section 4.8). The majority of cases of tuberculosis occurred in patients who currently live \nor previously lived in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. Patients should be evaluated \nfor tuberculosis and tested for latent infection prior to initiating belatacept. Adequate treatment of \nlatent tuberculosis infection should be instituted prior to belatacept use. \n \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  \nPML is a rare, often rapidly progressive and fatal, opportunistic infection of the CNS that is caused by \nthe John Cunningham (JC) virus. In clinical studies with belatacept, 2 cases of PML were reported in \npatients receiving belatacept at doses higher than the recommended regimen. In the renal transplant \nstudies of belatacept, one case of PML was reported in a patient who received an IL-2 receptor \nantagonist, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids as concomitant treatment. In the liver \ntransplant study, the patient received MMF and corticosteroids as concomitant treatment. As an \nincreased risk of PML and of other infections has been associated with high levels of overall \nimmunosuppression, the recommended doses of belatacept and concomitant immunosuppressives, \nincluding MMF or MPA, should not be exceeded (see section 4.5). \n \nEarly diagnosis and treatment may mitigate the impact of PML. Physicians should consider PML in \nthe differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening neurologic, cognitive or behavioural signs \nor symptoms. PML is usually diagnosed by brain imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC viral DNA by \npolymerase chain reaction (PCR). When the clinical suspicion for PML is high, brain biopsy should be \n\n\n\n5 \n\nconsidered in subjects if the diagnosis of PML cannot be established via CSF PCR and neuroimaging. \nConsultation with a neurologist is recommended for any suspected or confirmed cases of PML. \n \nIf PML is diagnosed, reduction or withdrawal of immunosuppression is recommended taking into \naccount the risk to the graft. Plasmapheresis may accelerate removal of belatacept. \n \nMalignancies \nIn addition to PTLD, patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens, including belatacept, are at \nincreased risk of malignancies, including skin cancer (see section 4.8). Exposure to sunlight and \nultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a \nhigh protection factor. \n \nGraft thrombosis \nIn clinical trials, an increased incidence of graft thrombosis was observed in the post-transplant period \nin recipients of extended criteria donor allografts. In postmarketing experience in patients with other \npredisposing risk factors for thrombosis of the renal allograft, renal allograft thrombosis has occurred \nwhen the initial dose of anti-thymocyte globulin, as immunosuppressive induction, was \ncoadministered at the same or nearly the same time with the first dose of belatacept. (see section 4.8). \n \nLiver transplantation \nThe safety and efficacy of belatacept have not been established in liver transplant patients, and \ntherefore such use is not recommended. In a single Phase 2 clinical study in de novo liver transplant \npatients, an increase in the number of deaths was observed in 2 of 3 belatacept-containing regimens \nstudied. These belatacept dosing regimens differed from those studied in renal transplant recipients \n(see section 5.1). \n \nConcomitant use with other immunosuppressive agents \nBelatacept has been administered with the following immunosuppressive agents in clinical studies: \nbasiliximab, an MPA and corticosteroids. \n \nLymphocyte Depleting Therapies and MPA: As the total burden of immunosuppression is a risk factor \nfor malignancies and opportunistic infections, higher than the recommended doses of concomitant \nimmunosuppressive agents should be avoided. Lymphocyte depleting therapies to treat acute rejection \nshould be used cautiously.  \nPatients with high PRA often require increased immunosuppression. Belatacept has not been studied \nin patients with PRA > 30% (see section 4.2). \n \nCorticosteroid Taper: Corticosteroid tapering in patients taking belatacept should be implemented \ncautiously, particularly in patients at high immunologic risk, such as those with 4 to 6 human \nleukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches. In postmarketing experience, use of belatacept in conjunction \nwith basiliximab induction, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroid taper to 5 mg/day by Week 6 \npost-transplant was associated with an increased rate of acute rejection, particularly Grade III \nrejection. These Grade III rejections occurred in patients with 4 to 6 HLA mismatches (see sections \n4.2 and 5.1). \n \nFor patients who may be switched from belatacept to another immunosuppressant, physicians should \nbe aware of the 8-10 day half-life of belatacept to avoid potential under- or over-immunosuppression \nfollowing discontinuation of belatacept.  \n \nAllergic reactions \nInfusion-related reactions have been reported with belatacept administration in the clinical studies. \nPatients are not required to be pre-treated to prevent allergic reactions (see section 4.8). Special \ncaution should be exercised in patients with a history of allergic reactions to belatacept or to any of the \nexcipients. Anaphylaxis has been reported during post marketing surveillance (see section 4.8). If any \nserious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, NULOJIX therapy should be discontinued \nimmediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nVaccinations \nImmunosuppressant therapy may affect response to vaccination. Therefore, during treatment with \nbelatacept, vaccinations may be less effective although this has not been studied in clinical trials. The \nuse of live vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nAutoimmune process \nThere is a theoretical concern that treatment with belatacept might increase the risk of autoimmune \nprocesses (see section 4.8). \n \nImmunogenicity \nAlthough there were few patients that developed antibodies and there was no apparent correlation of \nantibody development to clinical response or adverse events, the data are too limited to make a \ndefinitive assessment (see section 4.8). \nThe safety and efficacy of retreatment with belatacept has not been studied. The potential impact of \npre-existing antibodies to belatacept should be taken into account when considering retreatment with \nbelatacept following prolonged discontinuation, particularly in patients who have not received \ncontinuous immunosuppression. \n \nPatients on controlled sodium diet \nThis medicinal product contains 0.65 mmol or 15 mg sodium per vial. This corresponds to 1.95 mmol \n(or 45 mg) sodium per maximum dose of 3 vials. This should be taken into consideration when treating \npatients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBelatacept is a fusion protein that is not expected to be metabolised by the cytochrome P450 enzymes \n(CYPs) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs).  Belatacept appears not to have any relevant \ndirect effects on cytokine levels in liver transplant recipients or in healthy volunteers. Belatacept is \ntherefore not expected to affect cytochrome P450 enzymes via effects on cytokines. \n \nBelatacept is not expected to interrupt the enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. At a given dose of \nMMF, MPA exposure is approximately 40% higher with belatacept coadministration than with \nciclosporin coadministration. \n \nImmunosuppressant therapy may affect response to vaccination. Therefore, during treatment with \nbelatacept, vaccinations may be less effective although this has not been studied in clinical trials. The \nuse of live vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with belatacept \nand up to 8 weeks after the last dose of treatment since the potential risk to embryonic/foetal \ndevelopment is unknown. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from use of belatacept in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to embryonal/foetal development at doses up to 16-fold \nand 19-fold a human 10 mg/kg dose based on AUC. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, \nlimited changes in immune function were observed at 19-fold a human 10 mg/kg dose based on AUC \n(see section 5.3). Belatacept should not be used in pregnant women unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \nStudies in rats have shown excretion of belatacept in milk. It is unknown whether belatacept is \nexcreted in human milk (see section 5.3). Women should not breast-feed while on treatment with a \nbelatacept-based regimen. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nFertility \nThere are no data on use of belatacept and effect on fertility in humans. In rats, belatacept had no \nundesirable effects on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBelatacept has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines since it may cause fatigue, \nmalaise and/or nausea. Patients should be instructed that if they experience these symptoms they \nshould avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe adverse reaction profile associated with immunosuppressive agents is often difficult to establish \ndue to the underlying disease and the concurrent use of multiple medicinal products. \n \nThe most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 2%) reported with belatacept in both regimens (more \nintensive [MI] and less intensive [LI]) cumulative up to Year 3 were urinary tract infection, CMV \ninfection, pyrexia, increased blood creatinine, pyelonephritis, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, graft \ndysfunction, leukopenia, pneumonia, basal cell carcinoma, anaemia, dehydration. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) among patients treated with both belatacept-\nbased regimens (MI and LI) up to Year 3 are diarrhoea, anaemia, urinary tract infection, peripheral \noedema, constipation, hypertension, pyrexia, nausea, graft dysfunction, cough, vomiting, leukopenia, \nhypophosphataemia, and headache. \n \nAdverse reactions resulting in interruption or discontinuation of belatacept in ≥ 1% of patients up to \nYear 3 were renal vein thrombosis and CMV infection. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nPresented in Table 2, by system organ classification and frequency categories, is the list of adverse \nreactions with at least a suspected causal relationship, reported in clinical trials cumulatively up to \nYear 3 and pooled for both belatacept regimens (MI and LI). \n \nThe frequency categories are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Within each frequency category adverse reactions are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 2:  Adverse reactions in clinical trials \n \nInfections and infestations

median of 3.3 years in the Phase 3 studies, and a median of approximately 7 years in the Phase 2 study. \n \nLong-term extension in Study 1 and Study 2 \nOf the 1209 randomized and transplanted patients in the two Phase 3 studies (see section 5.1), \n761 patients continued after Year 3 in a long-term extension period for up to an additional 4 years and \ncontinued to receive the study drug according to their original treatment assignment. As compared to \nthe results from the initial 3 years, no new adverse reactions or increasing incidence of adverse \nreactions (listed above from the initial 3-year period) were detected during the 4-year long-term open \nlabel extension. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMalignancies and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease  \nYear 1 and 3 frequencies of malignancies are shown in Table 3, except for cases of PTLD which are \npresented at 1 year and > 3 years (median days of follow-up were 1,199 days for belatacept MI, \n1,206 days for belatacept LI, and 1,139 days for ciclosporin). The Year 3 frequency of malignant \nneoplasms, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, was similar in the belatacept LI and ciclosporin \ngroups and higher in the belatacept MI group. PTLD occurred at a higher rate in both belatacept \ntreatment groups versus ciclosporin (see section 4.4). Non-melanoma skin cancers occurred less \nfrequently with the belatacept LI regimen than with the ciclosporin or belatacept MI regimens. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 3: Malignancies occurring by treatment group (%) \n Up to Year 1 Up to Year 3*,** \n\nBelatacept \nMI \n\nN= 477 \n \n\nBelatacept \nLI \n\nN= 472 \n\nCiclosporin\nN= 476 \n\n \n\nBelatacept \nMI \n\nN= 477 \n\nBelatacept \nLI \n\nN= 472 \n \n\nCiclosporin\nN= 476 \n\n \n\nAny malignant \nneoplasm \n\n3.4 1.9 3.4 8.6 5.7 7.1 \n\nNon-melanoma \nskin cancer \n\n1.0 0.2 1.5 4.2 1.5 3.6 \n\nMalignant \nneoplasms \nexcluding non-\nmelanoma skin \ncancers \n\n2.3 1.7 1.9 4.4 4.2 3.6 \n\nPTLD 0.8 0.8 0.2 1.7 1.3 0.6 \nMalignancies \nexcluding non-\nmelanoma skin \ncancer and PTLD \n\n1.5 0.8 1.7 2.7 3.2 3.4 \n\n*Median follow-up excluding PTLD for pooled studies is 1,092 days for each treatment group. \n**Median follow-up for PTLD for pooled studies is 1,199 days for MI, 1,206 days for LI, and 1,139 days for ciclosporin. \n \nIn the 3 studies (one Phase 2 and two Phase 3 studies, Study 1 and Study 2), the cumulative frequency \nof PTLD was higher in belatacept treated patients at the recommended dosing regimen (LI) (1.3%; \n6/472) than in the ciclosporin group (0.6%; 3/476), and was highest in the belatacept MI group (1.7%; \n8/477). Nine of 14 cases of PTLD in belatacept-treated patients were located in the CNS; within the \nobservation period, 8 of 14 cases were fatal (6 of the fatal cases involved the CNS). Of the \n6 PTLD cases in the LI regimen, 3 involved the CNS and were fatal. \n \nEBV seronegative patients receiving immunosuppressants are at a particularly increased risk for PTLD \n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4). In clinical studies, belatacept-treated transplant recipients with EBV \nseronegative status were at an increased risk for PTLD compared with those who were EBV positive \n(7.7%; 7/91 versus 0.7%; 6/810, respectively). At the recommended dosing regimen of belatacept \nthere were 404 EBV positive recipients and 4 cases of PTLD occurred (1.0%); 2 of these presented in \nthe CNS. \n \nDuring the long-term extension period, malignancies (including PTLD) were reported in 10.3%, 8.4%, \nand 14.7% of patients in the belatacept MI, belatacept LI, and ciclosporin groups, respectively, in \nStudy 1; and in 19.2%, 13.3% and 16.1% of patients in the belatacept MI, belatacept LI, and \nciclosporin groups, respectively, in Study 2. Cases of PTLD varied by serostatus. In Study 1, one \nadditional case of PTLD was reported in the ciclosporin group, in a patient who was EBV seropositive \nat the time of transplant. In Study 2, among patients who were EBV seropositive at the time of \ntransplant, there was one case of PTLD in each of the three treatment groups. Among Study 2 patients \nwho were EBV seronegative at the time of transplant (for whom use of belatacept is not \nrecommended), there were three cases of PTLD in the belatacept LI group, and none in the belatacept \nMI and ciclosporin groups. \n \nInfections \nYear 1 and Year 3 frequencies of infections occurring by treatment group are shown in Table 4. The \noverall occurrence of tuberculosis infections and non-serious herpes infections were higher for \nbelatacept regimens than for the ciclosporin regimen. The majority of cases of tuberculosis occurred in \npatients who currently live or previously lived in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis (see \nsection 4.4). Overall occurrences of polyoma virus infections and fungal infections were numerically \nlower in the belatacept LI group compared with the belatacept MI and ciclosporin groups. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nWithin the belatacept clinical program, there were 2 patients diagnosed with PML. One fatal case of \nPML was reported in a renal transplant recipient treated with belatacept MI regimen, an IL-2 receptor \nantagonist, MMF, and corticosteroids for 2 years in a Phase 3 trial. The other case of PML was \nreported in a liver transplant recipient in a Phase 2 trial who received 6 months of treatment with an \naugmented belatacept MI regimen, MMF at doses higher than the recommended dose and \ncorticosteroids (see section 4.4). \n \nInfections involving the CNS were more frequent in the belatacept MI group (8 cases, including the \nPML case discussed above; 1.7%) than the belatacept LI (2 cases, 0.4%) and ciclosporin (one case; \n0.2%) groups. The most common CNS infection was cryptococcal meningitis. \n \nTable 4:  Infections occurring by treatment group (%) \n Up to Year 1 Up to Year 3* \n\nBelatacept \nMI \n\nN= 477 \n \n\nBelatacept \nLI  \n\nN= 472 \n \n\nCiclosporin \nN= 476 \n\n \n\nBelatacept \nMI  \n\nN= 477 \n \n\nBelatacept \nLI  \n\nN= 472 \n \n\nCiclosporin \nN= 476 \n\n \n\nInfections and \ninfestations  \n\n70.7 71.8 73.7 79.2 82.0 80.6 \n\nSerious infections  26.8 23.3 27.3 35.8 33.5 37.8 \nViral infections  26.4 25.0 27.7 38.8 39.0 36.1 \n CMV  11.1 11.9 13.7 13.8 13.8 14.7\n Polyomavirus 4.8 2.3 4.8 6.3 3.8 5.7\n Herpes  8.0 6.6 6.1 15.5 14.2 10.7\nFungal infections  13.8 11.0 15.1 22.9 16.7 20.6 \nTuberculosis  0.4 0.4 0.2 1.3 1.3 0.2 \n*Median exposure for pooled studies is 1,092 days for each treatment group. \n \nDuring the long-term extension period, serious infections occurred in 30.3% and 23.5% of patients in \nthe belatacept MI and LI groups, respectively, and in 27.2% of patients in the ciclosporin group in \nStudy 1; and in 35.6% and 38.1% of patients in the belatacept MI and LI groups, respectively, and in \n37.9% of patients in the ciclosporin group in Study 2. There was one case of PML reported (Study 1) \nin the ciclosporin group at 82 months post-transplant (more than 56 days after discontinuing therapy). \n \nGraft thrombosis \nIn a Phase 3 study in recipients of extended criteria donor (ECD) kidneys (Study 2), graft thrombosis \noccurred more frequently in the belatacept groups (4.3% and 5.1% for the MI and LI regimens \nrespectively), versus 2.2% for ciclosporin. In another Phase 3 study in recipients of living donor and \nstandard criteria deceased donor kidneys (Study 1), the incidence of graft thrombosis was 2.3% and \n0.4% for the MI and LI regimens respectively, versus 1.8% for ciclosporin. In a Phase 2 study, there \nwere 2 cases of graft thrombosis, 1 each in MI and LI (incidence of 1.4% for both) versus 0 in the \nciclosporin group. In general, these events occurred early and the majority resulted in graft loss. In \npostmarketing experience in patients with other predisposing risk factors for thrombosis of the renal \nallograft, renal allograft thrombosis has been reported when the initial dose of anti-thymocyte globulin \nwas coadministered at the same or nearly the same time with the first dose of belatacept. (see section \n4.4). \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nAnaphylaxis has been reported post marketing(see section 4.4). \n \nAcute infusion-related reactions (reactions occurring within one hour of infusion) occurred in 5.5% of \npatients in the belatacept MI group and 4.4% of patients in the belatacept LI group up to Year 3. The \nmost frequently reported acute infusion-related reactions in combined belatacept regimens were \nhypotension, hypertension, flushing and headache. Most events were not serious, were mild to \nmoderate in intensity, and did not recur. When belatacept was compared to placebo infusions, there \n\n\n\n13 \n\nwere no differences in event rates (placebo infusions were administered at Weeks 6 and 10 of the \nbelatacept LI regimen to blind the MI and LI regimens). \n \nImmunogenicity  \nAntibodies directed against the belatacept molecule were assessed in 796 kidney transplant recipients \n(551 of these treated for at least 3 years) in the two Phase 3 studies. An additional 51 patients were \ntreated for an average of 7 years in the long-term extension of a Phase 2 study. Anti-belatacept \nantibody development was not associated with altered clearance of belatacept. \n \nA total of 45 of 847 patients (5.3%) developed antibodies during treatment with belatacept. In the \nindividual studies, the percentage of patients with antibodies ranged from 4.5% and 5.2% in the \nPhase 3 studies to 11.8% in the long-term extension of the Phase 2 study. However, immunogenicity \nrate normalised for duration of exposure was consistent at 2.0 to 2.1 per 100 patient years among the \nthree studies. In 153 patients assessed for antibodies at least 56 days (approximately 7 half-lives) after \ndiscontinuation of belatacept, an additional 10 (6.5%) developed antibodies. In general, antibody titers \nwere low, not usually persistent, and often became undetectable with continued treatment. \n \nTo assess for the presence of neutralising antibodies, samples from 29 patients with confirmed binding \nactivity to the modified cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) region of the \nmolecule were assessed by an in vitro assay; 8 (27.6%) patients were shown to possess neutralising \nantibodies. The clinical relevance of such antibodies is unclear.  \n \nAutoimmunity \nThe occurrence of autoimmune events across the core clinical studies was infrequent, occurring at \nrates of 1.7%, 1.7%, and 1.9% by Year 3 for the MI, LI, and ciclosporin groups respectively. One \npatient on belatacept MI regimen developed Guillian-Barré syndrome which led to treatment \ndiscontinuation and subsequently resolved. Overall, the few reports across clinical studies suggest that \nprolonged exposure to belatacept does not predispose patients to an increased risk of development of \nautoimmune events. \n \nDuring the long-term extension period, autoimmune events occurred in 2.6% and 3.0% of patients in \nthe belatacept MI and LI groups, respectively, and in 3.7% of patients in the ciclosporin group in \nStudy 1; and in 5.8% and 3.5% of patients in the belatacept MI and LI groups, respectively, and in 0% \nof patients in ciclosporin group in Study 2. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSingle doses up to 20 mg/kg have been administered without apparent toxic effect. In case of \noverdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse \nreactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: \nL04AA28. \n \nBelatacept, a selective costimulation blocker, is a soluble fusion protein consisting of a modified \nextracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) fused to a \n\n\n\n14 \n\nportion (hinge-CH2-CH3 domains) of the Fc domain of a human immunoglobulin G1 antibody. \nBelatacept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell expression system. Two \namino acid substitutions (L104 to E; A29 to Y) were made in the ligand binding region of CTLA-4. \n \nMechanism of action \nBelatacept binds to CD80 and CD86 on antigen presenting cells. As a result, belatacept blocks CD28 \nmediated co-stimulation of T cells inhibiting their activation. Activated T cells are the predominant \nmediators of immunologic response to the transplanted kidney. Belatacept, a modified form of \nCTLA4-Ig, binds CD80 and CD86 more avidly than the parent CTLA4-Ig molecule from which it is \nderived. This increased avidity provides a level of immunosuppression that is necessary for preventing \nimmune-mediated allograft failure and dysfunction.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn a clinical study, approximately 90% saturation of CD86 receptors on the surface of antigen-\npresenting cells in the peripheral blood was observed following the initial administration of belatacept. \nDuring the first month post-transplantation, 85% saturation of CD86 was maintained. Up to month 3 \npost-transplantation with the recommended dosing regimen, the level of CD86 saturation was \nmaintained at approximately 70% and at month 12, approximately 65%. \n  \nClinical efficacy and safety  \nStudy 1 and 2: Phase 3 studies in renal transplant recipients \nThe safety and efficacy of belatacept as part of an immunosuppressive regimen following renal \ntransplantation were assessed in two randomised, partially-blinded, multicenter, 3 year studies with the \nprimary endpoint specified at Year 1. These studies compared two dose regimens of belatacept (MI \nand LI) with ciclosporin in recipients of standard criteria (Study 1) or extended criteria (Study 2) \ndonor organs. All patients received basiliximab, MMF, and corticosteroids. The more intensive (MI) \nregimen, which included higher and more frequent dosing during the first 6 months post transplant, \nresulted in 2-fold higher exposure to belatacept than the less intensive (LI) regimen during Months 2 \nthrough 7 post transplant. Efficacy was similar between MI and LI while the overall safety profile was \nbetter for the LI. Therefore, the recommended dose of belatacept is the LI dosage regimen. \n \nStudy 1: Recipients of Living Donor and Standard Criteria Deceased Donor Kidneys \nStandard criteria donor organs were defined as organs from a living donor, or a deceased donor with \nanticipated cold ischemia time of < 24 hours and not meeting the definition of extended criteria donor \norgans. Study 1 excluded (1) recipients undergoing a first transplant whose current PRA were ≥50%; \n(2) recipients undergoing a retransplantation whose current PRA were ≥30%; (3) recipients when \nprevious graft loss was due to acute rejection and in case of a positive T-cell lymphocytotoxic cross \nmatch. \n \nIn this study, 666 patients were enrolled, randomised, and transplanted; 219 to belatacept MI, 226 to \nbelatacept LI, and 221 to ciclosporin. The median age was 45 years; 58% of donor organs were from \nliving patients;  3% were re-transplanted; 69% of the study population was male; 61% of patients were \nwhite, 8% were black/African-American, 31% were categorised as of other races; 16% had PRA ≥ \n10%; and 41% had 4 to 6 HLA mismatches.  \n \nThe dose of corticosteroids used in all treatment groups was tapered during the first 6 months \nfollowing transplantation. The median corticosteroid doses administered with the belatacept \nrecommended regimen up to months 1, 3, and 6 were 20 mg, 12 mg and 10 mg, respectively. \n \nStudy  2: Recipients of Extended Criteria Donor Kidneys \nExtended criteria donors were defined as deceased donors with at least one of the following: (1) donor \nage ≥ 60 years; (2) donor age ≥ 50 years and other donor comorbidities (≥ 2 of the following: stroke, \nhypertension, serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl); (3) donation after cardiac death or (4) anticipated cold \nischemia time of ≥ 24 hours. Study 2 excluded recipients with a current PRA ≥ 30%, re-transplanted \npatients, and in case of a positive T-cell lymphocytotoxic cross match. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nIn this study, 543 patients were enrolled, randomised, and transplanted; 184 to belatacept MI, 175 to \nbelatacept LI, and 184 to ciclosporin. The median age was 58 years; 67% of the study population was \nmale; 75% of patients were white, 13% were black/African-American, 12% were categorised as of \nother races; 3% had PRA ≥ 10%; and 53% had 4 to 6 HLA mismatches.  \n \nThe dose of corticosteroids used in all treatment groups was tapered during the first 6 months \nfollowing transplantation. The median corticosteroid doses administered with the belatacept \nrecommended regimen up to months 1, 3, and 6 were 21 mg, 13 mg and 10 mg, respectively. \n \nTable 5 summarises results for belatacept LI compared with ciclosporin for the co-primary efficacy \nendpoints of death and graft loss, composite renal impairment, and acute rejection (defined as \nclinically suspected biopsy proven acute rejection). Patient and graft survival were similar between \nbelatacept and ciclosporin. Fewer patients met the composite renal impairment endpoint and mean \nGFR was higher with belatacept compared to ciclosporin.  \n \nAcute rejection (AR) occurred more frequently with belatacept versus ciclosporin in Study 1 and with \nsimilar frequency with belatacept versus ciclosporin in Study 2. Approximately 80% of AR episodes \noccurred by Month 3 and were infrequent after Month 6. In Study 1, 11/39 belatacept and \n3/21 ciclosporin acute rejections were Banff 97 grade ≥ IIb by Year 3. In Study 2, 9/33 belatacept and \n5/29 ciclosporin acute rejections were Banff 97 grade ≥ IIb by Year 3. AR was treated more often with \nlymphocyte depleting therapy (a risk factor for PTLD; see section 4.4) in the belatacept group than the \nciclosporin group. In both studies, in patients with AR by Year 2, donor-specific antibodies, one of the \ncriteria for diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection, were present in 6% (2/32, Study 2)-8% (3/39, \nStudy 1) and 20% (4/20, Study 1)-26% (7/27, Study 2) in the belatacept and ciclosporin groups by \nyear 3, respectively. By Year 3 recurrent AR was similar across groups (< 3%) and subclinical AR \nidentified on the 1 year protocol biopsy was 5% in both groups. In Study 1, 5/39 belatacept patients \nversus 1/21 ciclosporin patients with AR had experienced graft loss, and 5/39 belatacept patients and \nno ciclosporin patients with AR had died by Year 3. In Study 2, 5/33 belatacept patients versus \n6/29 ciclosporin patients with AR had experienced graft loss, and 5/33 belatacept patients versus \n5/29 ciclosporin patients with AR had died by Year 3. In both studies, mean GFR following AR was \nsimilar in belatacept and ciclosporin treated patients. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nTable 5:  Key efficacy outcomes at years 1 and 3 \n Study 1: living and \n\nstandard criteria deceased \ndonors \n\nStudy 2: extended criteria \ndonors \n\nParameter Belatacept \nLI\n\nCiclosporin Belatacept \nLI\n\nCiclosporin \n\n N = 226 N = 221 N = 175 N = 184 \n\nPatient and Graft Survival (%)  \n Year 1 \n [95% CI] \n  \n\n \n96.5 \n\n[94.1-98.9] \n\n \n93.2 \n\n[89.9-96.5] \n\n \n88.6 \n\n[83.9-93.3] \n\n \n85.3 \n\n[80.2-90.4] \n\n Year 3 \n [95% CI] \n\n92.0 \n[88.5-95.6] \n\n88.7 \n[84.5-92.9] \n\n82.3 \n[76.6-87.9] \n\n79.9 \n[74.1-85.7] \n\nDeath (%) \n  Year 1 \n\n \n1.8 \n\n \n3.2 \n\n \n2.9 \n\n \n4.3 \n\n Year 3 4.4 6.8 8.6 9.2 \nGraft Loss (%) \n Year 1 \n\n \n2.2 \n\n \n3.6 \n\n \n9.1 \n\n \n10.9 \n\n Year 3 4.0 4.5 12.0 12.5 \n% of Patients meeting Composite \nrenal impairment endpoint at \nYear 1a \n\n \n54.2 \n\n \n\n \n77.9 \n\n \n76.6 \n\n \n\n \n84.8 \n\n \n P-value < 0.0001 - < 0.07 - \nAR (%) \n Year 1 (%) \n [95% CI] \n\n \n17.3 \n\n[12.3-22.2] \n\n \n7.2 \n\n[3.8-10.7] \n\n \n17.7 \n\n[12.1-23.4] \n\n \n14.1 \n\n[9.1-19.2] \n Year 3 (%) \n [95% CI] \n\n17.3 \n[12.3-22.2] \n\n9.5 \n[5.6-13.4] \n\n18.9 \n[13.1-24.7] \n\n15.8 \n[10.5-21.0] \n\nMean Measured \nGFRb  ml/min/1.73 m2 \n Year 1 \n\n \n \n\n63.4 \n\n \n \n\n50.4 \n\n \n \n\n49.6 \n\n \n \n\n45.2 \n Year 2 67.9 50.5 49.7 45.0\nMean Calculated GFRc \nml/min/1.73 m2 \n Month 1  \n Year 1 \n\n \n \n\n61.5 \n65.4 \n\n \n \n\n48.1 \n50.1 \n\n \n \n\n39.6 \n44.5 \n\n \n \n\n31.8 \n36.5 \n\n Year 2 65.4 47.9 42.8 34.9\n Year 3 65.8 44.4 42.2 31.5 \n\naProportion of Patients with Measured GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or with a Decrease in Measured GFR ≥ 10 ml/min/1.73 m2 from Month 3 to \nMonth 12. \nb Measured GFR was assessed by iothalamate at Year 1 and 2 only \nc Calculated GFR was assessed by MDRD formula at Month 1, Years 1, 2, and 3 \n \nProgression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Staging \nIn Study 1 by Year 3, mean calculated GFR was 21 ml/min/1.73 m2 higher with belatacept, and 10% \nand 20% of patients reached CKD stage 4/5 (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) with belatacept versus \nciclosporin, respectively. In Study 2 by Year 3, mean calculated GFR was 11 ml/min/1.73 m2 higher \nwith belatacept, and 27% and 44% of patients reached CKD stage 4/5 (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) \nwith belatacept versus ciclosporin, respectively. \n \nChronic Allograft Nephropathy/Interstitial Fibrosis and Tubular Atrophy (IFTA) \nThe prevalence of CAN/IFTA at Year 1 in Studies 1 and 2, was numerically lower with belatacept \nthan ciclosporin (~ 9.4% and 5%, respectively). \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nNew Onset Diabetes Mellitus and Blood Pressure \nIn a prespecified pooled analysis of Studies 1 and 2 at Year 1, the incidence of new onset diabetes \nmellitus (NODM), defined as use of an antidiabetic agent for ≥ 30 days or ≥ 2 fasting plasma glucose \nvalues > 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) post-transplantation, was 5% with belatacept and 10% with \nciclosporin. At Year 3, the incidence of NODM was 8% with belatacept and 10% with ciclosporin. \n \nFor Studies 1 and 2 at Years 1 and 3, belatacept was associated with 6 to 9 mmHg lower mean systolic \nblood pressure, approximately 2 to 4 mmHg lower mean diastolic blood pressure, and less use of \nantihypertensive medicinal products than ciclosporin.  \n \nLong-term extension in Study 1 and Study 2 \nA total of 321 belatacept (MI: 155 and LI: 166) and 136 ciclosporin patients completed 3 years of \ntreatment in Study 1 and entered the 4-year long-term open label extension period (up to 7 years in \ntotal). More patients discontinued in the ciclosporin group (32.4%) versus each belatacept group \n(17.4% and 18.1% in MI and LI groups, respectively) during the long-term extension period. A total of \n217 belatacept (MI: 104 and LI: 113) and 87 ciclosporin patients completed 3 years of treatment in \nStudy 2 and entered the 4-year long-term open label extension period (up to 7 years in total). More \npatients discontinued in the ciclosporin group (34.5%) versus each belatacept group (28.8% and 25.7% \nfor MI and LI groups, respectively) during the long-term extension period. \n \nAs compared to ciclosporin and assessed by the hazard ratio (HR) estimates (for death or graft loss) \nfrom an ad hoc Cox regression analysis, overall patient and graft survival was higher for belatacept-\ntreated patients in Study 1, HR 0.588 (95% CI: 0.356-0.972) for the MI group and HR 0.585 (95% CI: \n0.356-0.961) for the LI group, and comparable across treatment groups in Study 2, HR 0.932 (95% CI: \n0.635-1.367) for the MI group and HR 0.944 (95% CI: 0.644-1.383) for the LI group. The overall \nproportion of patients with death or graft loss was lower in belatacept-treated patients (MI: 11.4%, LI: \n11.9%) as compared to ciclosporin-treated patients (17.6%) in Study 1. The overall proportion of \npatients with death or graft loss was comparable across treatment groups (29.3%, 30.9%, and 28.3% \nfor MI, LI and ciclosporin, respectively) in Study 2. In Study 1, in the MI, LI, and ciclosporin groups, \nrespectively, death occurred in 7.8%, 7.5%, and 11.3% of patients, and graft loss occurred in 4.6%, \n4.9%, and 7.7% of patients. In Study 2, in the MI, LI, and ciclosporin groups, respectively, death \noccurred in 20.1%, 21.1%, and 15.8% of patients, and graft loss occurred in 11.4%, 13.1%, and 15.8% \nof patients. The higher proportion of deaths in the LI group in Study 2 was mainly due to neoplasms \n(MI: 3.8%, LI: 7.1%, ciclosporin: 2.3%). \n \nThe higher calculated GFR observed in belatacept-treated patients relative to ciclosporin-treated \npatients during the first 3 years was maintained over the long-term extension period. In Study 1, mean \ncalculated GFR at 7 years was 74.0, 77.9 and 50.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the belatacept MI, belatacept LI \nand ciclosporin groups, respectively. In Study 2, mean calculated GFR at 7 years was 57.6, 59.1 and \n44.6 mL/min/1.73 m2, in the same groups, respectively. The time to death, graft loss, or GFR <30 \nmL/min/1.73 m2 was analyzed over the 7-year period: in Study 1, approximately 60% reduction in the \nrisk of death, graft loss, or GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 was observed among patients in the belatacept \ngroups as compared with those assigned to ciclosporin. In Study 2, approximately 40% reduction in \nthis risk was observed among patients in the belatacept groups as compared with those assigned to \nciclosporin. \n \nPhase 2 liver transplant study \nA single, randomised, multi-center, controlled Phase 2 trial of belatacept in de novo orthotopic liver \ntransplant recipients was conducted. A total of 250 subjects were randomised to 1 of 5 treatment \ngroups (3 belatacept and 2 tacrolimus groups). The belatacept dosing used in this liver study was \nhigher in all 3 belatacept arms than the belatacept dosing used in the Phase 2 and 3 renal transplant \nstudies. \n \nAn excess in mortality and graft loss was observed in the belatatacept LI + MMF group and an excess \nin mortality was observed in the belatacept MI + MMF group. No pattern was identified in the causes \nof death. There was an increase in viral and fungal infections in the belatacept groups versus the \n\n\n\n18 \n\ntacrolimus groups, however overall frequency of serious infections was not different among all \ntreatment groups (see section 4.4).  \n \nElderly \nTwo hundred seventeen (217) patients 65 years and older received belatacept across one Phase 2 and \ntwo Phase 3 renal studies. \nElderly patients demonstrated consistency with the overall study population for safety and efficacy as \nassessed by patient and graft survival, renal function, and acute rejection. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nbelatacept in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in renal transplantation (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThe pharmacokinetics of belatacept in renal transplant patients and healthy subjects appeared to be \ncomparable. The pharmacokinetics of belatacept was linear and the exposure to belatacept increased \nproportionally in healthy subjects after a single intravenous infusion dose of 1 to 20 mg/kg. The mean \n(range) pharmacokinetic parameters of belatacept after multiple intravenous infusions at doses of 5 \nand 10 mg/kg in renal transplant subjects were: terminal half-life, 8.2 (3.1-11.9) and 9.8 (6.1-15.1) \ndays, respectively; systemic clearance 0.51 (0.33-0.75) and 0.49 (0.23-0.70) ml/h/kg, respectively; and \ndistribution volume at steady state, 0.12 (0.09-0.17) and 0.11 (0.067-0.17) l/kg, respectively. At the \nrecommended dosing regimen, serum concentration generally reached steady-state by Week 8 in the \ninitial phase following transplantation and by Month 6 during the maintenance phase. At Month 1, 4, \nand 6 post-transplant, the mean (range) trough concentrations of belatacept were 22.7 (11.1-45.2), \n7.6 (2.1-18.0), and 4.0 (1.5-6.6) μg/ml, respectively.  \n \nDistribution \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis of 944 renal transplant patients up to 1 year post-\ntransplant, the pharmacokinetics of belatacept were similar at different time periods post-transplant. \nThe trough concentration of belatacept was consistently maintained up to 5 years post-transplant. \nMinimal systemic accumulation of belatacept occurred upon multiple infusions of 5 or 10 mg/kg doses \nin renal transplant patients every 4 weeks. The accumulation index for belatacept at steady state is 1.1. \n \nElimination \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses in renal transplant patients revealed that there was a trend toward \nhigher clearance of belatacept with increasing body weight. No clinically relevant effects of age, \ngender, race, renal function (calculated GFR), diabetes, or concomitant dialysis on clearance of \nbelatacept was identified. \n \nThere is no data available in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nBelatacept has less activity in rodents than abatacept, a fusion protein that differs from belatacept by \ntwo amino acids in the CD80/86 binding domains. Because of abatacept’s similarity to belatacept in \nstructure and mechanism of action and its higher activity in rodents, abatacept was used as a more \nactive homolog for belatacept in rodents. Therefore, preclinical studies conducted with abatacept have \nbeen used to support the safety of belatacept in addition to the studies conducted with belatacept. \n \nNo mutagenicity or clastogenicity was observed with abatacept in a battery of in vitro studies. In a \nmouse carcinogenicity study, increases in the incidence of malignant lymphomas and mammary \ntumours (in females) occurred. The increased incidence of lymphomas and mammary tumours \nobserved in mice treated with abatacept may have been associated with decreased control of murine \nleukaemia virus and mouse mammary tumour virus, respectively, in the presence of long-term \n\n\n\n19 \n\nimmunomodulation. In a six-month and one-year toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys with \nbelatacept and abatacept, respectively, no significant toxicity was observed. Reversible \npharmacological effects consisted of minimal decreases in serum IgG and minimal to severe lymphoid \ndepletion of germinal centers in the spleen and/or lymph nodes. No evidence of lymphomas or \npreneoplastic morphologic changes was observed in either study. This was despite the presence in the \nabatacept study of a virus, lymphocryptovirus, known to cause these lesions in immunosuppressed \nmonkeys within the time frame of these studies. The viral status was not determined in the belatacept \nstudy but, as this virus is prevalent in monkeys, it was likely present in these monkeys as well.  \nIn rats, belatacept had no undesirable effects on male or female fertility. Belatacept was not \nteratogenic when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to 200 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg \ndaily, respectively, representing approximately 16 and 19 times the exposure associated with the \nmaximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/kg based on AUC. Belatacept administered \nto female rats daily during gestation and throughout the lactation period was associated with infections \nin a small percentage of dams at all doses (≥ 20 mg/kg, ≥ 3 times the MRHD exposure based on \nAUC), and produced no adverse effects in offspring at doses up to 200 mg/kg representing 19 times \nthe MRHD exposure based on AUC. Belatacept was shown to cross the placenta in rats and rabbits. \nAbatacept administered to female rats every three days during gestation and throughout the lactation \nperiod, produced no adverse effects in offspring at doses up to 45 mg/kg, representing 3 times the \nexposure associated with the MRHD of 10 mg/kg based on AUC. However, at 200 mg/kg, 11 times \nthe MRHD exposure, alterations in immune function were observed consisting of a 9-fold increase \nin T-cell dependent antibody response in female pups and thyroid inflammation in one female pup. It \nis not known whether these findings indicate a risk for development of autoimmune diseases in \nhumans exposed in utero to abatacept or belatacept. \n \nStudies in rats exposed to abatacept have shown immune system abnormalities including a low \nincidence of infections leading to death (juvenile rats) as well as inflammation of the thyroid and \npancreas (both juvenile and adult rats). Studies in adult mice and monkeys have not demonstrated \nsimilar findings. It is likely that the increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections observed in \njuvenile rats is associated with the exposure to abatacept before development of memory responses. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nSucrose \nSodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate \nSodium chloride \nSodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) \nHydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6.  \n \nNULOJIX should not be used with siliconised syringes in order to avoid aggregate formation (see \nsection 6.6). \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vials \n3 years \n \nAfter reconstitution \nThe reconstituted solution should be transferred from the vial to the infusion bag or bottle \nimmediately. \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \nAfter dilution \nChemical and physical in-use stability of the solution for infusion has been demonstrated for 24 hours \nwhen stored in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). From a microbiological point of view, the product should be \nused immediately. If not used immediately, the solution for infusion may be stored in a refrigerator \n(2°C - 8°C) for up to 24 hours. Out of these 24 hours, the solution for infusion may be stored below \n25°C for a maximum of 4 hours. Do not freeze. \nThe NULOJIX infusion must be completed within 24 hours of reconstitution of the powder. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution or dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nNULOJIX is supplied in a 20 ml vial (Type I flint glass) with a stopper (20 mm grey butyl rubber) and \nflip off seal (aluminum). Each vial is co-packaged with a disposable polypropylene syringe. \n \nPack sizes: 1 vial and 1  syringe or 2 vials and 2  syringes. \n \nNot all pack-sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \n Use aseptic technique to reconstitute the vials and dilute the solution for administration. \n Use the silicone-free disposable syringe provided to make up the vials and to add the solution to \n\nthe infusion. This will avoid aggregate formation (see section 6.2). \n Do not shake the vials. This will avoid foam formation. \n The solution for infusion is to be used in conjunction with a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein \n\nbinding filter (pore size of 0.2 µm to 1.2 µm). \n \nDose selection and reconstitution of the vials \nCalculate the dose and number of NULOJIX vials required. Each NULOJIX vial provides 250 mg of \nbelatacept. \n Total dose of belatacept in mg equals the patient weight in kg times the belatacept dose in mg/kg \n\n(5 or 10 mg/kg, see section 4.2).  \n Dose modification of NULOJIX is not recommended for a change in body weight of less than \n\n10%. \n Number of vials required equals the belatacept dose in mg divided by 250 rounded up to the next \n\nfull number of vials.  \n Make up each vial with 10.5 ml reconstitution solution.  \n Volume of the reconstituted solution required (ml) equals total belatacept dose in mg divided \n\nby 25. \n \nPractical details on the reconstitution of vials \nUsing aseptic technique, make up each vial with 10.5 ml of one of the following solvents (sterile water \nfor injections, sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or 5% glucose solution for \ninjection), using the co-packed disposable syringe (necessary to avoid aggregate formation) and an 18-\n21 gauge needle. Syringes are marked in units of 0.5 ml; therefore, the calculated dose should be \nrounded to the nearest 0.5 ml. \n \nRemove the flip off seal from the vial and wipe the top with an alcohol swab. Insert the syringe needle \ninto the vial through the centre of the rubber stopper. Direct the stream of fluid to the glass wall of the \nvial and not into the powder. Remove the syringe and needle after 10.5 ml of reconstitution fluid has \nbeen added to the vial.  \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \nTo minimize foam formation, gently swirl and invert the vial for at least 30 seconds or until the \npowder is completely dissolved. Do not shake. Although some foam may remain on the surface of the \nreconstituted solution, a sufficient excess of belatacept is included in each vial to account for \nwithdrawal losses. Thus, 10 ml of a 25 mg/ml belatacept solution can be withdrawn from each vial.  \n \nThe reconstituted solution should be clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to pale yellow. Do not \nuse if opaque particles, discolouration or other foreign particles are present. It is recommended to \ntranfer the reconstituted solution from the vial to the infusion bag or bottle immediately. \n \nPractical details on the preparation of the solution for infusion \nAfter reconstitution, dilute the product to 100 ml with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \ninjection or 5% glucose solution for injection. From a 100 ml infusion bag or bottle (typically, an \ninfusion volume of 100 ml will be appropriate for most patients and doses, but total infusion volume \nranging from 50 ml to 250 ml may be used), withdraw a volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \nsolution for injection or 5% glucose solution for injection equal to the volume (ml equals total dose \nin mg divided by 25) of the reconstituted belatacept solution required to provide the dose and discard \nit. Slowly add the required amount of reconstituted belatacept solution from each vial to the infusion \nbag or bottle using the same disposable syringe used for reconstitution of the powder. Gently mix the \ninfusion container. The concentration of belatacept in the infusion should be between 2 mg and 10 mg \nbelatacept per ml solution.  \n \nAny unused portion in the vials must be discarded in accordance with local requirements. \n \nAdministration \nWhen reconstitution and dilution are performed under aseptic conditions, the NULOJIX infusion \nshould be started immediately or must be completed within 24 hours of reconstitution of the powder. \nIf not used immediately, the solution for infusion may be stored in the refrigerator (2°C - 8°C) for up \nto 24 hours. Do not freeze. The solution for infusion may be stored for a maximum of 4 hours of the \ntotal 24 hours below 25°C. Infusion must be completed within 24 hours of reconstitution of the \npowder. Prior to administration, the solution for infusion should be inspected visually for particulate \nmatter or discolouration. Discard the solution if any particulate matter or discolouration is observed. \nThe entire, fully diluted infusion should be administered over a period of 30 minutes and must be \nadministered with an infusion set and a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding filter (pore size of \n0.2 μm to 1.2 μm). Following administration, it is recommended that the intravenous line be flushed \nwith infusion fluid to ensure administration of the complete dose. \nDo not store any unused portion of the solution for infusion for reuse. \n \nNULOJIX should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. No \nphysical or biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the coadministration of \nNULOJIX with other agents. \n \nDisposal \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n \n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nNULOJIX 250 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nbelatacept \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What NULOJIX is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use NULOJIX \n3. How to use NULOJIX \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store NULOJIX \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What NULOJIX is and what it is used for \n \nNULOJIX contains the active substance belatacept which belongs to a group of medicines called \nimmunosuppressants. These are medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system, the body's \nnatural defences. \n \nNULOJIX is used in adults to prevent the immune system from attacking your transplanted kidney and \ncausing transplant rejection. It is used with other immunosuppressive medicines, including \nmycophenolic acid and corticosteroids. It is also recommended to administer an interleukin(IL)-2 \nreceptor antagonist during the first week after transplantation. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NULOJIX \n \nDo not use NULOJIX \n If you are allergic to belatacept or any of the other ingredients of the medicine (listed in section \n\n6). Allergic reactions related to belatacept use have been reported in the clinical studies.  \n If you have not been exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or are uncertain of previous \n\nexposure, you must not be treated with NULOJIX. EBV is the virus that causes glandular fever. If \nyou have not been exposed to it, you are at a higher risk of getting a type of cancer called post-\ntransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). If you are not sure if you have been infected with \nthe virus before, ask your doctor. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nPost-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder \nTreatment with NULOJIX increases the risk of getting a type of cancer called post-transplant \nlymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). With NULOJIX treatment, this more often develops in the brain \nand can lead to death. People are at a higher risk of developing PTLD in the following cases: \n If you have not been exposed to EBV prior to your transplant \n If you are infected with a virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV) \n If you have been given a therapy for treatment of acute rejection, such as antithymocyte globulin \n\nto reduce T-cells. T-cells are cells responsible for maintaining your body's ability to resist disease \nand infections. They may cause rejection of your transplanted kidney.  \n\n If you are not sure about any of these conditions, ask you doctor. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nSerious infections \nSerious infections can happen with NULOJIX treatment and can lead to death. \nNULOJIX weakens the body’s ability to fight infections. Serious infections can include  \n Tuberculosis  \n Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a virus that can cause serious tissue and blood infections  \n Shingles \n Other herpes virus infections. \n \nThere have been reports of a rare type of brain infection called progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy (PML) that have occurred in patients who have been given NULOJIX. PML \noften leads to severe disability or death.  \n \nTell your family or caregiver about your treatment. You might get symptoms that you might not be \naware of yourself. Your doctor may need to investigate your symptoms to rule out PML, PTLD or \nother infections. For a list of symptoms please see section 4, “Possible side effects”.  \n \nSkin cancer \nLimit your exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light whilst using NULOJIX. Wear protective \nclothing and use a sunscreen with a high protection factor. People who use NULOJIX have a higher \nrisk of getting certain other types of cancer, especially skin cancer. \n \nBlood clotting in your transplanted kidney \nDepending on the type of kidney transplant that you received, you may be at higher risk of blood \nclotting in your transplanted kidney. \n \nUse in liver transplants \nThe use of NULOJIX is not recommended if you have had a liver transplant.  \n \nUse with other immunosuppressive medicines \nNulojix is normally given with steroids. Too rapid reduction of steroid intake can increase the risk that \nyour body may reject the transplanted kidney. Please take the exact steroid dose as determined by your \ndoctor. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nNULOJIX has not been studied in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, therefore it is not \nrecommended in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and NULOJIX \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any other medicine while using NULOJIX. \n \nThe use of live vaccines should be avoided with the use of NULOJIX. Tell your doctor if you need to \nhave vaccinations. Your doctor will advise you what to do.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \nIf you become pregnant while using NULOJIX, tell your doctor.  \nDo not use NULOJIX if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. The effects \nof NULOJIX in pregnant women are not known. You must not get pregnant while using NULOJIX. If \nyou are of child bearing potential, you should use effective contraception during treatment with \nNULOJIX and up to 8 weeks after the last dose of treatment since the potential risk to \nembryonic/foetal development is unknown. Your doctor will advise you about using a reliable \ncontraceptive.  \n \nYou must stop breast-feeding if you are being treated with NULOJIX. It is not known whether \nbelatacept, the active substance, passes into human milk.  \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nBelatacept has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However you should not \ndrive or operate any machines if you are feeling tired or unwell after receiving NULOJIX. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of NULOJIX \nTell your doctor if you are on a low-sodium (low-salt) diet before you are treated with NULOJIX.  \nThis medicine contains 0.65 mmol (or 15 mg) sodium per vial which corresponds to 1.95 mmol (or \n45 mg) sodium per maximum dose of three vials. \n \n \n3. How to use NULOJIX \n \nTreatment with NULOJIX will be prescribed and supervised by a specialist in kidney transplantation. \nNULOJIX will be given to you by a healthcare professional.  \nIt will be given to you by infusion (as a \"drip\") into one of your veins over a period of about \n30 minutes.  \n \nThe recommended dose is based on your body weight (in kg) and will be calculated by a healthcare \nprofessional. The dose and treatment frequency is given below. \n \nInitial Phase Dose \nDay of transplantation, prior to implantation (Day 1)\n\n10 mg/kg Day 5, Day 14 and Day 28 \nEnd of Week 8 and Week 12 after transplantation\nMaintenance Phase Dose \nEvery 4 weeks (± 3 days) starting at end of week 16 after transplantation 5 mg/kg\n\n \nInformation for medical and healthcare professionals on dose calculation, preparation and \nadministration of NULOJIX is provided at the end of the leaflet.  \n \nIf you are given more NULOJIX than you should  \nIf this happens, your doctor will monitor you for any signs or symptoms of side effects, and treat these \nsymptoms if necessary.  \n \nIf you forget to use NULOJIX \nIt is very important for you to keep all appointments to receive NULOJIX. If you miss receiving \nNULOJIX when you are supposed to, ask your doctor when to schedule your next dose.  \n \nIf you stop using NULOJIX \nYour body may reject the transplanted kidney if you stop using NULOJIX. The decision to stop using \nNULOJIX should be discussed with your doctor and another therapy will generally be started.  \nIf you stop treatment with NULOJIX for a long period of time, without taking any other medicines to \nprevent rejection, and then restart, it is not known if belatacept will have the same effect as before.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. However, \nNULOJIX can cause serious side effects that may need treatment. \nTell your family or caregiver about your treatment as you might get symptoms that you might not be \naware of yourself. \n

This will avoid aggregate formation. \n Do not shake the vials. This will avoid foam formation. \n The solution for infusion is to be used in conjunction with a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein \n\nbinding filter (pore size of 0.2 µm to 1.2 µm). \n \nDose selection and reconstitution of the vials \nCalculate the dose and number of NULOJIX vials required. Each NULOJIX vial provides 250 mg of \nbelatacept. \n Total dose of belatacept in mg equals the patient weight in kg times the belatacept dose in mg/kg \n\n(5 or 10 mg/kg, see section 3) \n Dose modification of NULOJIX is not recommended for a change in body weight of less than \n\n10%. \n Number of vials required equals the belatacept dose in mg divided by 250 rounded up to the next \n\nfull number of vials.  \n Make up each vial with 10.5 ml reconstitution solution.  \n Volume of the reconstituted solution required (ml) equals total belatacept dose in mg divided \n\nby 25. \n \nPractical details on the reconstitution of vials \nUsing aseptic technique, make up each vial with 10.5 ml of one of the following solvents (sterile water \nfor injections, sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or 5% glucose solution for \ninjection), using the co-packed disposable syringe (necessary to avoid aggregate formation) and an 18-\n21 gauge needle. Syringes are marked in units of 0.5 ml; therefore, the calculated dose should be \nrounded to the nearest 0.5 ml. \n \nRemove the flip off seal from the vial and wipe the top with an alcohol swab. Insert the syringe needle \ninto the vial through the centre of the rubber stopper. Direct the stream of fluid to the glass wall of the \nvial and not into the powder. Remove the syringe and needle after 10.5 ml of reconstitution fluid has \nbeen added to the vial.  \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \nTo minimise foam formation, gently swirl and invert the vial for at least 30 seconds or until the \npowder is completely dissolved. Do not shake. Although some foam may remain on the surface of the \nreconstituted solution, a sufficient excess of belatacept is included in each vial to account for \nwithdrawal losses. Thus, 10 ml of a 25 mg/ml belatacept solution can be withdrawn from each vial.  \n \nThe reconstituted solution should be clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to pale yellow. Do not \nuse if opaque particles, discolouration or other foreign particles are present. It is recommended to \ntransfer the reconstituted solution from the vial to the infusion bag or bottle immediately. \n \nPractical details on the preparation of the solution for infusion \nAfter reconstitution, dilute the product to 100 ml with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \ninjection or 5% glucose solution for injection. From a 100 ml infusion bag or bottle (typically, an \ninfusion volume of 100 ml will be appropriate for most patients and doses, but total infusion volume \nranging from 50 ml to 250 ml may be used), withdraw a volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \nsolution for injection or 5% glucose solution for injection equal to the volume (ml equals total dose \nin mg divided by 25) of the reconstituted NULOJIX solution required to provide the dose and discard \nit. Slowly add the required amount of reconstituted NULOJIX solution from each vial to the infusion \nbag or bottle using the same disposable syringe used for reconstitution of the powder. Gently mix the \ninfusion container. The concentration of belatacept in the infusion should be between 2 mg and 10 mg \nbelatacept per ml solution.  \n \nAny unused portion in the vials must be discarded in accordance with local requirements. \n \nAdministration \nWhen reconstitution and dilution are performed under aseptic conditions, the NULOJIX infusion \nshould be started immediately or must be completed within 24 hours of reconstitution of the powder. \nIf not used immediately, the solution for infusion may be stored in the refrigerator (2°C - 8°C) for up \nto 24 hours. Do not freeze. The solution for infusion may be stored for a maximum of 4 hours of the \ntotal 24 hours below 25°C. Infusion must be completed within 24 hours of reconstitution of the \npowder. Prior to administration, the solution for infusion should be inspected visually for particulate \nmatter or discolouration. Discard the solution if any particulate matter or discolouration is observed. \nThe entire, fully diluted infusion should be administered over a period of 30 minutes and must be \nadministered with an infusion set and a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding filter (pore size of \n0.2 μm to 1.2 μm). Following administration, it is recommended that the intravenous line be flushed \nwith infusion fluid to ensure administration of the complete dose. \n \nNULOJIX should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. No \nphysical or biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the coadministration of \nNULOJIX with other agents. \n \nDo not store any unused portion of the solution for infusion for reuse. \n \nDisposal \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.  \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
