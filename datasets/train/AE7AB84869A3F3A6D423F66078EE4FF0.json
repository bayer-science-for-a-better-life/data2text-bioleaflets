NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nMetalyse 8,000 units powder and solvent for solution for injection\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach vial contains 8,000 units (40 mg) tenecteplase.\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 8 ml solvent.\n\nThe reconstituted solution contains 1,000 units (5 mg) tenecteplase per ml.\n\nPotency of tenecteplase is expressed in units (U) by using a reference standard which is specific for \ntenecteplase and is not comparable with units used for other thrombolytic agents.\n\nTenecteplase is a fibrin-specific plasminogen activator produced in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line \nby recombinant DNA technology.\n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder and solvent for solution for injection.\n\nThe powder is white to off-white.\nThe solvent is clear and colourless.\nThe reconstituted preparation is a clear and colourless to slightly yellow solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nMetalyse is indicated in adults for the thrombolytic treatment of suspected myocardial infarction with \npersistent ST elevation or recent left Bundle Branch Block within 6 hours after the onset of acute \nmyocardial infarction (AMI) symptoms. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nMetalyse should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the use of thrombolytic treatment and \nwith the facilities to monitor that use.\n\nTreatment with Metalyse should be initiated as soon as possible after onset of symptoms.\n\nMetalyse should be administered on the basis of body weight, with a maximum dose of 10,000 units\n(50 mg tenecteplase). The volume required to administer the correct dose can be calculated from the \nfollowing scheme:\n\n\n\n3\n\nPatients\u2019 body weight \ncategory\n\n(kg)\n\nTenecteplase\n(U)\n\nTenecteplase \n(mg)\n\nCorresponding volume of \nreconstituted solution\n\n(ml)\n\n< 60 6,000 30 6\n\n\uf0b3 60 to < 70 7,000 35 7\n\n\uf0b3 70 to < 80 8,000 40 8\n\n\uf0b3 80 to < 90 9,000 45 9\n\n\uf0b3 90 10,000 50 10\n\nFor details see section 6.6: Special precautions for disposal and other handling\n\nElderly (\uf0b3 75 years)\nMetalyse should be administered with caution in the elderly (\uf0b3 75 years) due to a higher bleeding risk \n(see information on bleeding in section 4.4 and on the STREAM study in section 5.1).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Metalyse in children (below 18 years) have not been established. No data \nare available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe required dose should be administered as a single intravenous bolus over approximately 10 \nseconds.\n\nA pre-existing intravenous line may be used for administration of Metalyse in sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution only. Metalyse is incompatible with glucose solution.\n\nNo other medicinal product should be added to the injection solution.\n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\nAdjunctive therapy\n\nAntithrombotic adjunctive therapy with platelet inhibitors and anticoagulants should be administered \naccording to the current relevant treatment guidelines for the management of patients with \nST-elevation myocardial infarction.\nFor coronary intervention see section 4.4.\n\nUnfractionated heparin and enoxaparin have been used as antithrombotic adjunctive therapy in clinical \nstudies with Metalyse. \n\nAcetylsalicylic acid should be initiated as soon as possible after symptom onset and continued with \nlifelong treatment unless it is contraindicated.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nMetalyse must not be administered to patients with a history of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) \nreaction to any of the constituents (i.e. tenecteplase or any excipient) or gentamicin (a trace residue \nfrom the manufacturing process). If treatment with Metalyse is nevertheless considered to be \nnecessary, facilities for resuscitation should be immediately available in case of need.\n\nFurthermore, Metalyse is contraindicated in the following situations because thrombolytic therapy is \nassociated with a higher risk of bleeding:\n\n\n\n4\n\n- Significant bleeding disorder either at present or within the past 6 months\n- Patients receiving effective oral anticoagulant treatment, e.g. warfarin sodium (INR > 1.3) (see \n\nsection 4.4, subsection \u201cBleeding\u201d)\n- Any history of central nervous system damage (i.e. neoplasm, aneurysm, intracranial or spinal \n\nsurgery) \n- Known haemorrhagic diathesis \n- Severe uncontrolled hypertension \n- Major surgery, biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or significant trauma within the past 2 months\n\n(this includes any trauma associated with the current AMI)\n- Recent trauma to the head or cranium\n- Prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (> 2 minutes) within the past 2 weeks\n- Acute pericarditis and/or subacute bacterial endocarditis\n- Acute pancreatitis\n- Severe hepatic dysfunction, including hepatic failure, cirrhosis, portal hypertension \n\n(oesophageal varices) and active hepatitis\n- Active peptic ulceration\n- Arterial aneurysm and known arterial/venous malformation\n- Neoplasm with increased bleeding risk\n- Any known history of haemorrhagic stroke or stroke of unknown origin\n- Known history of ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack in the preceding 6 months\n- Dementia\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nCoronary intervention\n\nIf primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is scheduled according to the current relevant \ntreatment guidelines, tenecteplase (see section 5.1 ASSENT-4 study) should not be given.\n\nPatients who cannot undergo primary PCI within one hour as recommended by guidelines and receive\ntenecteplase as primary coronary recanalization treatment should be transferred without delay to a \ncoronary intervention capable facility for angiography and timely adjunctive coronary intervention \nwithin 6-24 hours or earlier if medically indicated (see section 5.1 STREAM study).\n\nBleeding\n\nThe most common complication encountered during tenecteplase therapy is bleeding. The concomitant \nuse of heparin anticoagulation may contribute to bleeding. As fibrin is lysed during tenecteplase \ntherapy, bleeding from recent puncture site may occur. Therefore, thrombolytic therapy requires \ncareful attention to all possible bleeding sites (including catheter insertion sites, arterial and venous \npuncture sites, cutdown sites and needle puncture sites). The use of rigid catheters as well as \nintramuscular injections and non-essential handling of the patient should be avoided during treatment \nwith tenecteplase.\n\nMost frequently haemorrhage at the injection site, and occasionally genitourinary and gingival \nbleeding were observed. \n\nShould serious bleeding occur, in particular cerebral haemorrhage, concomitant heparin administration \nshould be terminated immediately. Administration of protamine should be considered if heparin has \nbeen administered within 4 hours before the onset of bleeding. In the few patients who fail to respond \nto these conservative measures, judicious use of transfusion products may be indicated. Transfusion of \ncryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets should be considered with clinical and laboratory \nreassessment after each administration. A target fibrinogen level of 1 g/l is desirable with \ncryoprecipitate infusion. Antifibrinolytic agents are available as a last alternative. In the following \nconditions, the risk of tenecteplase therapy may be increased and should be weighed against the \nanticipated benefits:\n\n\n\n5\n\n- Systolic blood pressure > 160 mm Hg \n- Cerebrovascular disease\n- Recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding (within the past 10 days)\n- High likelihood of left heart thrombus, e.g., mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation\n- Any known recent (within the past 2 days) intramuscular injection\n- Advanced age, i.e. over 75 years\n- Low body weight < 60 kg\n- Patients receiving oral anticoagulants: The use of Metalyse may be considered when dosing or \n\ntime since the last intake of anticoagulant treatment makes residual efficacy unlikely and if \nappropriate test(s) of anticoagulant activity for the product(s) concerned show no clinically \nrelevant activity on the coagulation system (e.g. INR \u2264 1.3 for vitamin K antagonists or other \nrelevant test(s) for other oral anticoagulants are within the respective upper limit of normal).\n\nArrhythmias\n\nCoronary thrombolysis may result in arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. It is recommended that \nantiarrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias (pacemaker, defibrillator) \nis available when tenecteplase is administered.\n\nGPIIb/IIIa antagonists\n\nConcomitant use of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists increases bleeding risk.\n\nHypersensitivity/Re-administration\n\nNo sustained antibody formation to the tenecteplase molecule has been observed after treatment. \nHowever there is no systematic experience with re-administration of tenecteplase. Caution is needed \nwhen administering tenecteplase to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic \nreaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, or to gentamicin (a residue from the \nmanufacturing process). If an anaphylactoid reaction occurs, the injection should be discontinued \nimmediately and appropriate therapy should be initiated. In any case, tenecteplase should not be re-\nadministered before assessment of haemostatic factors like fibrinogen, plasminogen and alpha2-\nantiplasmin.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nMetalyse is not recommended for use in children (below 18 years) due to a lack of data on safety and \nefficacy.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo formal interaction studies with tenecteplase and medicinal products commonly administered in \npatients with AMI have been performed. However, the analysis of data from more than 12,000 patients \ntreated during phase I, II and III did not reveal any clinically relevant interactions with medicinal \nproducts commonly used in patients with AMI and concomitantly used with tenecteplase.\n\nMedicinal products that affect coagulation or those that alter platelet function (e.g. ticlopidine, \nclopidogrel, LMWH) may increase the risk of bleeding prior to, during or after tenecteplase therapy.\n\nConcomitant use of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists increases bleeding risk.\n\n\n\n6\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere is limited amount of data from the use of Metalyse in pregnant women.\nNonclinical data performed with tenecteplase have shown bleeding with secondary mortality of dams \ndue to the known pharmacological activity of the active substance and in a few cases abortion and \nresorption of the foetus occurred (effects only have been observed with repeated dose administration). \nTenecteplase is not considered to be teratogenic (please see section 5.3).\n\nThe benefit of treatment must be evaluated against the potential risks in case of myocardial infarction \nduring pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known if tenecteplase is excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding should be discarded within \nthe first 24 hours after thrombolytic therapy.\n\nFertility\n\nClinical data as well as nonclinical studies on fertility are not available for tenecteplase (Metalyse).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNot relevant.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nHaemorrhage is a very common undesirable effect associated with the use of tenecteplase. The type of \nhaemorrhage is predominantly superficial at the injection site. Ecchymoses are observed commonly \nbut usually do not require any specific action. Death and permanent disability are reported in patients \nwho have experienced stroke (including intracranial bleeding) and other serious bleeding episodes.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and system organ class. \nFrequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (\u22651/10), \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), Very \nrare (<1/10,000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n\n\n7\n\nTable 1 displays the frequency of adverse reactions.\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction\nImmune system disorders\n\nRare Anaphylactoid reaction (including rash, urticaria, \nbronchospasm, laryngeal oedema)\n\nNervous system disorders\nUncommon Intracranial haemorrhage (such as cerebral haemorrhage, \n\ncerebral haematoma, haemorrhagic stroke, haemorrhagic \ntransformation stroke, intracranial haematoma, subarachnoid \nhaemorrhage) including associated symptoms as somnolence, \naphasia, hemiparesis, convulsion\n\nEye disorders\nUncommon Eye haemorrhage\n\nCardiac disorders\nUncommon Reperfusion arrhythmias (such as asystole, accelerated \n\nidioventricular arrhythmia, arrhythmia, extrasystoles, atrial \nfibrillation, atrioventricular first degree to atrioventricular \nblock complete, bradycardia, tachycardia, ventricular \narrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia) \noccur in close temporal relationship to treatment with \ntenecteplase. Reperfusion arrhythmias may lead to cardiac \narrest, can be life threatening and may require the use of \nconventional antiarrhythmic therapies.\n\nRare Pericardial haemorrhage\nVascular disorders\n\nVery common Haemorrhage\nRare Embolism (thrombotic embolisation)\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nCommon Epistaxis\nRare Pulmonary haemorrhage\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon Gastrointestinal haemorrhage (such as gastric haemorrhage, \n\ngastric ulcer haemorrhage, rectal haemorrhage, \nhaematemesis, melaena, mouth haemorrhage) \n\nUncommon Retroperitoneal haemorrhage (such as retroperitoneal \nhaematoma)\n\nNot known Nausea, vomiting\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n\nCommon Ecchymosis\nRenal and urinary disorders\n\nCommon Urogenital haemorrhage (such as haematuria, haemorrhage \nurinary tract)\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon Injection site haemorrhage, puncture site haemorrhage\n\nInvestigations\nRare Blood pressure decreased\nNot known Body temperature increased\n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications\nNot known Fat embolism, which may lead to corresponding \n\nconsequences in the organs concerned\n\n\n\n8\n\nAs with other thrombolytic agents, the following events have been reported as sequelae of myocardial \ninfarction and/or thrombolytic administration:\n- very common: hypotension, heart rate and rhythm disorders, angina pectoris\n- common: recurrent ischaemia, cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, \n\npericarditis, pulmonary oedema\n- uncommon: cardiac arrest, mitral valve incompetence, pericardial effusion, venous thrombosis, \n\ncardiac tamponade, myocardial rupture\n- rare: pulmonary embolism\n\nThese cardiovascular events can be life-threatening and may lead to death.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn the event of overdose there may be an increased risk of bleeding. In case of severe prolonged \nbleeding substitution therapy may be considered (plasma, platelets), see also section 4.4.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, enzymes; ATC code: B01A D11\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-PA \nby modifications at three sites of the protein structure. It binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus \n(blood clot) and selectively converts thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the \nfibrin matrix of the thrombus. Tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to \ninactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) compared to native t-PA.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nAfter administration of tenecteplase dose dependent consumption of \uf0612-antiplasmin (the fluid-phase \ninhibitor of plasmin) with consequent increase in the level of systemic plasmin generation have been \nobserved. This observation is consistent with the intended effect of plasminogen activation. In \ncomparative studies a less than 15% reduction in fibrinogen and a less than 25% reduction in \nplasminogen were observed in subjects treated with the maximum dose of tenecteplase (10,000 U, \ncorresponding to 50 mg), whereas alteplase caused an approximately 50% decrease in fibrinogen and \nplasminogen levels. No clinically relevant antibody formation was detected at 30 days.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nPatency data from the phase I and II angiographic studies suggest that tenecteplase, administered as a \nsingle intravenous bolus, is effective in dissolving blood clots in the infarct-related artery of subjects \nexperiencing an AMI on a dose related basis.\n\nASSENT-2\nA large scale mortality trial (ASSENT-2) in approx. 17,000 patients showed that tenecteplase is \ntherapeutically equivalent to alteplase in reducing mortality (6.2% for both treatments, at 30 days, \nupper limit of the 95% CI for the relative risk ratio 1.124) and that the use of tenecteplase is associated \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\nwith a significantly lower incidence of non-intracranial bleedings (26.4% vs. 28.9%, p=0.0003). This \ntranslates into a significantly lower need of transfusions (4.3% vs. 5.5%, p=0.0002). Intracranial \nhaemorrhage occurred at a rate of 0.93% vs. 0.94% for tenecteplase and alteplase, respectively.\n\nCoronary patency and limited clinical outcome data showed that AMI patients have been successfully \ntreated later than 6 hours after symptom onset.\n\nASSENT-4\nThe ASSENT-4 PCI study was designed to show if in 4000 patients with large myocardial infarctions \npre-treatment with full dose tenecteplase and concomitant single bolus of up to 4,000 IU \nunfractionated heparin administered prior to primary PCI to be performed within 60 to 180 minutes \nleads to better outcomes than primary PCI alone. The trial was prematurely terminated with 1667 \nrandomised patients due to a numerically higher mortality in the facilitated PCI group receiving \ntenecteplase. The occurrence of the primary endpoint, a composite of death or cardiogenic shock or \ncongestive heart failure within 90 days, was significantly higher in the group receiving the exploratory \nregimen of tenecteplase followed by routine immediate PCI: 18.6% (151/810) compared to 13.4% \n(110/819) in the PCI only group, p=0.0045. This significant difference between the groups for the \nprimary endpoint at 90 days was already present in-hospital and at 30 days. \n\nNumerically all of the components of the clinical composite endpoint were in favour of the PCI only \nregimen: death: 6.7% vs. 4.9% p=0.14; cardiogenic shock: 6.3% vs. 4.8% p=0.19; congestive heart \nfailure: 12.0% vs. 9.2% p=0.06 respectively. The secondary endpoints re-infarction and repeat target \nvessel revascularisation were significantly increased in the group pre-treated with tenecteplase: re-\ninfarction: 6.1% vs. 3.7% p=0.0279; repeat target vessel revascularisation: 6.6% vs. 3.4% p=0.0041.\nThe following adverse events occurred more frequently with tenecteplase prior to PCI: intracranial \nhaemorrhage: 1% vs. 0% p=0.0037; stroke: 1.8% vs. 0% p<0.0001; major bleeds: 5.6% vs. 4.4% \np=0.3118; minor bleeds: 25.3% vs. 19.0% p= 0.0021; blood transfusions: 6.2% vs. 4.2% p=0.0873; \nabrupt vessel closure: 1.9% vs. 0.1% p=0.0001. \n\nSTREAM study\nThe STREAM study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a pharmaco-invasive strategy \nversus a strategy of standard primary PCI in patients presenting with ST elevation acute myocardial \ninfarction within 3 hours of onset of symptoms not able to undergo primary PCI within one hour of \nfirst medical contact. The pharmaco-invasive strategy consisted of early fibrinolytic treatment with \nbolus tenecteplase and additional antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy followed by angiography \nwithin 6-24 hours or rescue coronary intervention. \n\nThe study population consisted of 1,892 patients randomised by means of an interactive voice \nresponse system. The primary endpoint, a composite of death or cardiogenic shock or congestive heart \nfailure or re-infarction within 30 days, was observed in 12.4% (116/939) of the pharmaco-invasive \narm versus 14.3% (135/943) in the primary PCI arm (relative risk 0.86 (0.68-1.09)).\n\nSingle components of the primary composite endpoint for the pharmaco-invasive strategy versus \nprimary PCI respectively were observed with the following frequencies:\n\nPharmaco-invasive\n(n=944)\n\nPrimary PCI\n(n=948)\n\np\n\nComposite death, shock, congestive \nheart failure, re-infarction\n\nAll-cause mortality\nCardiogenic shock\nCongestive heart failure\nRe-infarction\n\n116/939 (12.4%)\n\n43/939 (4.6%)\n41/939 (4.4%)\n57/939 (6.1%)\n23/938 (2.5%)\n\n135/943 (14.3%)\n\n42/946 (4.4%)\n56/944 (5.9%)\n72/943 (7.6%)\n21/944 (2.2%)\n\n0.21\n\n0.88\n0.13\n0.18\n0.74\n\nCardiac mortality 31/939 (3.3%) 32/946 (3.4%) 0.92\n\n\n\n10\n\nThe observed incidence of major and of minor non-ICH bleeds were similar in both groups:\n\nPharmaco-invasive\n(n=944)\n\nPrimary PCI\n(n=948)\n\np\n\nMajor non-ICH bleed 61/939 (6.5%) 45/944 (4.8%) 0.11\nMinor non-ICH bleed 205/939 (21.8%) 191/944 (20.2%) 0.40\n\nIncidence of total strokes and intracranial haemorrhage\n\nPharmaco-invasive\n(n=944)\n\nPrimary PCI\n(n=948)\n\np\n\nTotal stroke (all types) 15/939 (1.6%) 5/946 (0.5%) 0.03*\nIntracranial haemorrhage\nIntracranial haemorrhage after protocol \namendment to half dose in patients \u2265 75 \nyears :\n\n9/939 (0.96%)\n\n4/747 (0.5%)\n\n2/946 (0.21%)\n\n2/758 (0.3%)\n\n0.04**\n\n0.45\n* the incidences in both groups are those expected in STEMI patients treated by fibrinolytics or \nprimary PCI (as observed in previous studies).\n** the incidence in the pharmaco-invasive group is as expected for fibrinolysis with tenecteplase (as \nobserved in previous studies).\n\nAfter the dose reduction of tenecteplase by half in patients \u2265 75 years there was no further intracranial \nhemorrhage (0 of 97 patients) (95% CI: 0.0-3.7) versus 8.1% (3 of 37 patients) (95% CI: 1.7-21.9) \nprior to dose reduction. The bounds of the confidence interval of the observed incidences prior and \nafter dose reduction are overlapping.\n\nIn patients \u2265 75 years the observed incidence of the primary efficacy composite end point for the \npharmaco-invasive strategy and primary PCI were as follows: before dose reduction 11/37 (29.7%) \n(95% CI: 15.9- 47.0) versus 10/32 (31.3%) (95% CI: 16.1-50.0), after dose reduction: 25/97 (25.8%) \n(95% CI: 17.4-35.7) versus 25/88 (24.8%) (95% CI: 19.3-39.0). In both groups the bounds of the \nconfidence interval of the observed incidences prior and post dose reduction are overlapping.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption and distribution\n\nTenecteplase is an intravenously administered, recombinant protein that activates plasminogen. \nFollowing intravenous bolus administration of 30 mg tenecteplase in patients with acute myocardial \ninfarction, the initially estimated tenecteplase plasma concentration was 6.45 \u00b1 3.60 \u00b5g/mL (mean \u00b1 \nSD). The distribution phase represents 31% \u00b1 22% to 69% \u00b1 15% (mean \u00b1 SD) of the total AUC \nfollowing the administration of doses ranges from 5 to 50 mg.\n\nData on tissue distribution were obtained in studies with radioactively labelled tenecteplase in rats. \nThe main organ to which tenecteplase distributed was the liver. It is not known whether and to which \nextent tenecteplase binds to plasma proteins in humans. The mean residence time (MRT) in the body \nis approximately 1 h and the mean (\u00b1 SD) volume of distribution at the steady-state (Vss) ranged from \n6.3 \u00b1 2 L to 15 \u00b1 7 L.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nTenecteplase is cleared from circulation by binding to specific receptors in the liver followed by \ncatabolism to small peptides. Binding to hepatic receptors is, however, reduced compared to native t-\nPA, resulting in a prolonged half-life. \n\n\n\n11\n\nElimination\n\nAfter single intravenous bolus injection of tenecteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction, \ntenecteplase antigen exhibits biphasic elimination from plasma. There is no dose dependence of \ntenecteplase clearance in the therapeutic dose range. The initial, dominant half-life is 24 \u00b1 5.5 (mean \n\u00b1SD) min, which is 5 times longer than native t-PA. The terminal half-life is 129 \u00b1 87 min, and \nplasma clearance is 119 \u00b1 49 ml/min. \n\nIncreasing body weight resulted in a moderate increase of tenecteplase clearance, and increasing age \nresulted in a slight decrease of clearance. Women exhibit in general lower clearance than men, but this \ncan be explained by the generally lower body weight of women.\n\nLinearity/Non-Linearity\n\nThe dose linearity analysis based on AUC suggested that tenecteplase exhibits non-linear \npharmacokinetics in the dose range studied, i.e. 5 to 50 mg.\n\nRenal and hepatic impairment\n\nBecause elimination of tenecteplase is through the liver, it is not expected that renal dysfunction will \naffect its the pharmacokinetics. This is also supported by animal data. However, the effect of renal and \nhepatic dysfunction on pharmacokinetics of tenecteplase in humans has not been specifically \ninvestigated. Accordingly, there is no guidance for the adjustment to tenecteplase dose in patients with \nhepatic and severe renal insufficiency.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIntravenous single dose administration in rats, rabbits and dogs resulted only in dose-dependent and \nreversible alterations of the coagulation parameters with local haemorrhage at the injection site, which \nwas regarded as a consequence of the pharmacodynamic effect of tenecteplase. Multiple-dose toxicity \nstudies in rats and dogs confirmed these above-mentioned observations, but the study duration was \nlimited to two weeks by antibody formation to the human protein tenecteplase, which resulted in \nanaphylaxis.\n\nSafety pharmacology data in cynomolgus monkeys revealed reduction of blood pressure followed by \nchanges of ECG, but these occurred at exposures that were considerably higher than the clinical \nexposure.\n\nWith regard to the indication and the single dose administration in humans, reproductive toxicity \ntesting was limited to an embryotoxicity study in rabbits, as a sensitive species. Tenecteplase induced \ntotal litter deaths during the mid-embryonal period. When tenecteplase was given during the mid- or \nlate-embryonal period maternal animals showed vaginal bleeding on the day after the first dose. \nSecondary mortality was observed 1-2 days later. Data on the foetal period are not available.\n\nMutagenicity and carcinogenicity are not expected for this class of recombinant proteins and \ngenotoxicity and carcinogenicity testing were not necessary.\n\nNo local irritation of the blood vessel was observed after intravenous, intra-arterial or paravenous \nadministration of the final formulation of tenecteplase.\n\n\n\n12\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nMetalyse is indicated in adults for the thrombolytic treatment of suspected myocardial infarction with \npersistent ST elevation or recent left Bundle Branch Block within 6 hours after the onset of acute \nmyocardial infarction (AMI) symptoms. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nMetalyse should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the use of thrombolytic treatment and \nwith the facilities to monitor that use.\n\nTreatment with Metalyse should be initiated as soon as possible after onset of symptoms.\n\nMetalyse should be administered on the basis of body weight, with a maximum dose of 10,000 units\n(50 mg tenecteplase). The volume required to administer the correct dose can be calculated from the \nfollowing scheme:\n\n\n\n16\n\nPatients\u2019 body weight \ncategory\n\n(kg)\n\nTenecteplase\n(U)\n\nTenecteplase \n(mg)\n\nCorresponding volume of \nreconstituted solution\n\n(ml)\n< 60 6,000 30 6\n\n\uf0b3 60 to < 70 7,000 35 7\n\n\uf0b3 70 to < 80 8,000 40 8\n\n\uf0b3 80 to < 90 9,000 45 9\n\n\uf0b3 90 10,000 50 10\n\nFor details see section 6.6: Special precautions for disposal and other handling\n\nElderly (\uf0b3 75 years)\nMetalyse should be administered with caution in the elderly (\uf0b3 75 years) due to a higher bleeding risk \n(see information on bleeding in section 4.4 and on the STREAM study in section 5.1).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Metalyse in children (below 18 years) have not been established. No data \nare available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe required dose should be administered as a single intravenous bolus over approximately 10 \nseconds.\n\nA pre-existing intravenous line may be used for administration of Metalyse in sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution only. Metalyse is incompatible with glucose solution.\n\nNo other medicinal product should be added to the injection solution.\n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\nAdjunctive therapy\n\nAntithrombotic adjunctive therapy with platelet inhibitors and anticoagulants should be administered \naccording to the current relevant treatment guidelines for the management of patients with \nST-elevation myocardial infarction.\nFor coronary intervention see section 4.4.\n\nUnfractionated heparin and enoxaparin have been used as antithrombotic adjunctive therapy in clinical \nstudies with Metalyse. \n\nAcetylsalicylic acid should be initiated as soon as possible after symptom onset and continued with \nlifelong treatment unless it is contraindicated.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nMetalyse must not be administered to patients with a history of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) \nreaction to any of the constituents (i.e. tenecteplase or any excipient) or gentamicin (a trace residue \nfrom the manufacturing process). If treatment with Metalyse is nevertheless considered to be \nnecessary, facilities for resuscitation should be immediately available in case of need.\n\nFurthermore, Metalyse is contraindicated in the following situations because thrombolytic therapy is \nassociated with a higher risk of bleeding:\n\n\n\n17\n\n- Significant bleeding disorder either at present or within the past 6 months\n- Patients receiving effective oral anticoagulant treatment, e.g. warfarin sodium (INR > 1.3) (see \n\nsection 4.4, subsection \u201cBleeding\u201d)\n- Any history of central nervous system damage (i.e. neoplasm, aneurysm, intracranial or spinal \n\nsurgery) \n- Known haemorrhagic diathesis \n- Severe uncontrolled hypertension \n- Major surgery, biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or significant trauma within the past 2 \n\nmonths(this includes any trauma associated with the current AMI)\n- Recent trauma to the head or cranium\n- Prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (> 2 minutes) within the past 2 weeks\n- Acute pericarditis and/or subacute bacterial endocarditis\n- Acute pancreatitis\n- Severe hepatic dysfunction, including hepatic failure, cirrhosis, portal hypertension \n\n(oesophageal varices) and active hepatitis\n- Active peptic ulceration\n- Arterial aneurysm and known arterial/venous malformation\n- Neoplasm with increased bleeding risk\n- Any known history of haemorrhagic stroke or stroke of unknown origin\n- Known history of ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack in the preceding 6 months\n- Dementia\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nCoronary intervention\n\nIf primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is scheduled according to the current relevant \ntreatment guidelines, tenecteplase (see section 5.1 ASSENT-4 study) should not be given.\n\nPatients who cannot undergo primary PCI within one hour as recommended by guidelines and receive\ntenecteplase as primary coronary recanalization treatment should be transferred without delay to a \ncoronary intervention capable facility for angiography and timely adjunctive coronary intervention \nwithin 6-24 hours or earlier if medically indicated (see section 5.1 STREAM study).\n\nBleeding\n\nThe most common complication encountered during tenecteplase therapy is bleeding. The concomitant \nuse of heparin anticoagulation may contribute to bleeding. As fibrin is lysed during tenecteplase \ntherapy, bleeding from recent puncture site may occur. Therefore, thrombolytic therapy requires \ncareful attention to all possible bleeding sites (including catheter insertion sites, arterial and venous \npuncture sites, cutdown sites and needle puncture sites). The use of rigid catheters as well as \nintramuscular injections and non-essential handling of the patient should be avoided during treatment \nwith tenecteplase.\n\nMost frequently haemorrhage at the injection site, and occasionally genitourinary and gingival \nbleeding were observed. \n\nShould serious bleeding occur, in particular cerebral haemorrhage, concomitant heparin administration \nshould be terminated immediately. Administration of protamine should be considered if heparin has \nbeen administered within 4 hours before the onset of bleeding. In the few patients who fail to respond \nto these conservative measures, judicious use of transfusion products may be indicated. Transfusion of \ncryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets should be considered with clinical and laboratory \nreassessment after each administration. A target fibrinogen level of 1 g/l is desirable with \ncryoprecipitate infusion. Antifibrinolytic agents are available as a last alternative. In the following \nconditions, the risk of tenecteplase therapy may be increased and should be weighed against the \nanticipated benefits:\n\n\n\n18\n\n- Systolic blood pressure > 160 mm Hg \n- Cerebrovascular disease\n- Recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding (within the past 10 days)\n- High likelihood of left heart thrombus, e.g., mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation\n- Any known recent (within the past 2 days) intramuscular injection\n- Advanced age, i.e. over 75 years\n- Low body weight < 60 kg\n- Patients receiving oral anticoagulants: The use of Metalyse may be considered when dosing or \n\ntime since the last intake of anticoagulant treatment makes residual efficacy unlikely and if\nappropriate test(s) of anticoagulant activity for the product(s) concerned show no clinically \nrelevant activity on the coagulation system (e.g. INR \u2264 1.3 for vitamin K antagonists or other \nrelevant test(s) for other oral anticoagulants are within the respective upper limit of normal).\n\nArrhythmias\n\nCoronary thrombolysis may result in arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. It is recommended that \nantiarrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias (pacemaker, defibrillator) \nis available when tenecteplase is administered.\n\nGPIIb/IIIa antagonists\n\nConcomitant use of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists increases bleeding risk.\n\nHypersensitivity/Re-administration\n\nNo sustained antibody formation to the tenecteplase molecule has been observed after treatment. \nHowever there is no systematic experience with re-administration of tenecteplase. Caution is needed \nwhen administering tenecteplase to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic \nreaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, or to gentamicin (a residue from the \nmanufacturing process). If an anaphylactoid reaction occurs, the injection should be discontinued \nimmediately and appropriate therapy should be initiated. In any case, tenecteplase should not be re-\nadministered before assessment of haemostatic factors like fibrinogen, plasminogen and alpha2-\nantiplasmin.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nMetalyse is not recommended for use in children (below 18 years) due to a lack of data on safety and \nefficacy.\n\n4.5. Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo formal interaction studies with tenecteplase and medicinal products commonly administered in \npatients with AMI have been performed. However, the analysis of data from more than 12,000 patients \ntreated during phase I, II and III did not reveal any clinically relevant interactions with medicinal \nproducts commonly used in patients with AMI and concomitantly used with tenecteplase.\n\nMedicinal products that affect coagulation or those that alter platelet function (e.g. ticlopidine, \nclopidogrel, LMWH) may increase the risk of bleeding prior to, during or after tenecteplase therapy.\n\nConcomitant use of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists increases bleeding risk.\n\n\n\n19\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of Metalyse in pregnant women.\nNonclinical data performed with tenecteplase have shown bleeding with secondary mortality of dams \ndue to the known pharmacological activity of the active substance and in a few cases abortion and \nresorption of the foetus occurred (effects only have been observed with repeated dose administration). \nTenecteplase is not considered to be teratogenic (please see section 5.3).\n\nThe benefit of treatment must be evaluated against the potential risks in case of myocardial infarction \nduring pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known if tenecteplase is excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding should be discarded within \nthe first 24 hours after thrombolytic therapy.\n\nFertility\n\nClinical data as well as nonclinical studies on fertility are not available for tenecteplase (Metalyse). \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNot relevant.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nHaemorrhage is a very common undesirable effect associated with the use of tenecteplase. The type of \nhaemorrhage is predominantly superficial at the injection site. Ecchymoses are observed commonly \nbut usually do not require any specific action. Death and permanent disability are reported in patients \nwho have experienced stroke (including intracranial bleeding) and other serious bleeding episodes.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and system organ class. \nFrequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (\u22651/10), \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), Very \nrare (<1/10,000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n\n\n20\n\nTable 1 displays the frequency of adverse reactions.\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction\nImmune system disorders\n\nRare Anaphylactoid reaction (including rash, urticaria, \nbronchospasm, laryngeal oedema)\n\nNervous system disorders\nUncommon Intracranial haemorrhage (such as cerebral haemorrhage, \n\ncerebral haematoma, haemorrhagic stroke, haemorrhagic \ntransformation stroke, intracranial haematoma, subarachnoid \nhaemorrhage) including associated symptoms as somnolence, \naphasia, hemiparesis, convulsion\n\nEye disorders\nUncommon Eye haemorrhage\n\nCardiac disorders\nUncommon Reperfusion arrhythmias (such as asystole, accelerated \n\nidioventricular arrhythmia, arrhythmia, extrasystoles, atrial \nfibrillation, atrioventricular first degree to atrioventricular \nblock complete, bradycardia, tachycardia, ventricular \narrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia) \noccur in close temporal relationship to treatment with \ntenecteplase. Reperfusion arrhythmias may lead to cardiac \narrest, can be life threatening and may require the use of \nconventional antiarrhythmic therapies.\n\nRare Pericardial haemorrhage\nVascular disorders\n\nVery common Haemorrhage\nRare Embolism (thrombotic embolisation)\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nCommon Epistaxis\nRare Pulmonary haemorrhage\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon Gastrointestinal haemorrhage (such as gastric haemorrhage, \n\ngastric ulcer haemorrhage, rectal haemorrhage, \nhaematemesis, melaena, mouth haemorrhage) \n\nUncommon Retroperitoneal haemorrhage (such as retroperitoneal \nhaematoma)\n\nNot known Nausea, vomiting\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n\nCommon Ecchymosis\nRenal and urinary disorders\n\nCommon Urogenital haemorrhage (such as haematuria, haemorrhage \nurinary tract)\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon Injection site haemorrhage, puncture site haemorrhage\n\nInvestigations\nRare Blood pressure decreased\nNot known Body temperature increased\n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications\nNot known Fat embolism, which may lead to corresponding \n\nconsequences in the organs concerned\n\n\n\n21\n\nAs with other thrombolytic agents, the following events have been reported as sequelae of myocardial \ninfarction and/or thrombolytic administration:\n- very common: hypotension, heart rate and rhythm disorders, angina pectoris\n- common: recurrent ischaemia, cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, \n\npericarditis, pulmonary oedema\n- uncommon: cardiac arrest, mitral valve incompetence, pericardial effusion, venous thrombosis, \n\ncardiac tamponade, myocardial rupture\n- rare: pulmonary embolism\n\nThese cardiovascular events can be life-threatening and may lead to death.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn the event of overdose there may be an increased risk of bleeding. In case of severe prolonged \nbleeding substitution therapy may be considered (plasma, platelets), see also section 4.4.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, enzymes; ATC code: B01A D11\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-PA \nby modifications at three sites of the protein structure. It binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus \n(blood clot) and selectively converts thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the \nfibrin matrix of the thrombus. Tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to \ninactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) compared to native t-PA.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nAfter administration of tenecteplase dose dependent consumption of \uf0612-antiplasmin (the fluid-phase \ninhibitor of plasmin) with consequent increase in the level of systemic plasmin generation have been \nobserved. This observation is consistent with the intended effect of plasminogen activation. In \ncomparative studies a less than 15% reduction in fibrinogen and a less than 25% reduction in \nplasminogen were observed in subjects treated with the maximum dose of tenecteplase (10,000 U, \ncorresponding to 50 mg), whereas alteplase caused an approximately 50% decrease in fibrinogen and \nplasminogen levels. No clinically relevant antibody formation was detected at 30 days.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nPatency data from the phase I and II angiographic studies suggest that tenecteplase, administered as a \nsingle intravenous bolus, is effective in dissolving blood clots in the infarct-related artery of subjects \nexperiencing an AMI on a dose related basis.\n\nASSENT-2\nA large scale mortality trial (ASSENT-2) in approx. 17,000 patients showed that tenecteplase is \ntherapeutically equivalent to alteplase in reducing mortality (6.2% for both treatments, at 30 days, \nupper limit of the 95% CI for the relative risk ratio 1.124) and that the use of tenecteplase is associated \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n22\n\nwith a significantly lower incidence of non-intracranial bleedings (26.4% vs. 28.9%, p=0.0003). This \ntranslates into a significantly lower need of transfusions (4.3% vs. 5.5%, p=0.0002). Intracranial \nhaemorrhage occurred at a rate of 0.93% vs. 0.94% for tenecteplase and alteplase, respectively.\n\nCoronary patency and limited clinical outcome data showed that AMI patients have been successfully \ntreated later than 6 hours after symptom onset.\n\nASSENT-4\nThe ASSENT-4 PCI study was designed to show if in 4000 patients with large myocardial infarctions \npre-treatment with full dose tenecteplase and concomitant single bolus of up to 4,000 IU \nunfractionated heparin administered prior to primary PCI to be performed within 60 to 180 minutes \nleads to better outcomes than primary PCI alone. The trial was prematurely terminated with 1667 \nrandomised patients due to a numerically higher mortality in the facilitated PCI group receiving \ntenecteplase. The occurrence of the primary endpoint, a composite of death or cardiogenic shock or \ncongestive heart failure within 90 days, was significantly higher in the group receiving the exploratory \nregimen of tenecteplase followed by routine immediate PCI: 18.6% (151/810) compared to 13.4% \n(110/819) in the PCI only group, p=0.0045. This significant difference between the groups for the \nprimary endpoint at 90 days was already present in-hospital and at 30 days. \n\nNumerically all of the components of the clinical composite endpoint were in favour of the PCI only \nregimen: death: 6.7% vs. 4.9% p=0.14; cardiogenic shock: 6.3% vs. 4.8% p=0.19; congestive heart \nfailure: 12.0% vs. 9.2% p=0.06 respectively. The secondary endpoints re-infarction and repeat target \nvessel revascularisation were significantly increased in the group pre-treated with tenecteplase: re-\ninfarction: 6.1% vs. 3.7% p=0.0279; repeat target vessel revascularisation: 6.6% vs. 3.4% p=0.0041.\nThe following adverse events occurred more frequently with tenecteplase prior to PCI: intracranial \nhaemorrhage: 1% vs. 0% p=0.0037; stroke: 1.8% vs. 0% p<0.0001; major bleeds: 5.6% vs. 4.4% \np=0.3118; minor bleeds: 25.3% vs. 19.0% p= 0.0021; blood transfusions: 6.2% vs. 4.2% p=0.0873; \nabrupt vessel closure: 1.9% vs. 0.1% p=0.0001. \n\nSTREAM study\nThe STREAM study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a pharmaco-invasive strategy \nversus a strategy of standard primary PCI in patients presenting with ST elevation acute myocardial \ninfarction within 3 hours of onset of symptoms not able to undergo primary PCI within one hour of \nfirst medical contact. The pharmaco-invasive strategy consisted of early fibrinolytic treatment with \nbolus tenecteplase and additional antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy followed by angiography \nwithin 6-24 hours or rescue coronary intervention. \n\nThe study population consisted of 1,892 patients randomised by means of an interactive voice \nresponse system. The primary endpoint, a composite of death or cardiogenic shock or congestive heart \nfailure or re-infarction within 30 days, was observed in 12.4% (116/939) of the pharmaco-invasive \narm versus 14.3% (135/943) in the primary PCI arm (relative risk 0.86 (0.68-1.09)).\n\nSingle components of the primary composite endpoint for the pharmaco-invasive strategy versus \nprimary PCI respectively were observed with the following frequencies:\n\nPharmaco-invasive\n(n=944)\n\nPrimary PCI\n(n=948)\n\np\n\nComposite death, shock, congestive \nheart failure, re-infarction\n\nAll-cause mortality\nCardiogenic shock\nCongestive heart failure\nRe-infarction\n\n116/939 (12.4%)\n\n43/939 (4.6%)\n41/939 (4.4%)\n57/939 (6.1%)\n23/938 (2.5%)\n\n135/943 (14.3%)\n\n42/946 (4.4%)\n56/944 (5.9%)\n72/943 (7.6%)\n21/944 (2.2%)\n\n0.21\n\n0.88\n0.13\n0.18\n0.74\n\nCardiac mortality 31/939 (3.3%) 32/946 (3.4%) 0.92\n\n\n\n23\n\nThe observed incidence of major and of minor non-ICH bleeds were similar in both groups:\n\nPharmaco-invasive\n(n=944)\n\nPrimary PCI\n(n=948)\n\np\n\nMajor non-ICH bleed 61/939 (6.5%) 45/944 (4.8%) 0.11\nMinor non-ICH bleed 205/939 (21.8%) 191/944 (20.2%) 0.40\n\nIncidence of total strokes and intracranial haemorrhage\n\nPharmaco-invasive\n(n=944)\n\nPrimary PCI\n(n=948)\n\np\n\nTotal stroke (all types) 15/939 (1.6%) 5/946 (0.5%) 0.03*\nIntracranial haemorrhage\nIntracranial haemorrhage after protocol \namendment to half dose in patients \u2265 75 \nyears :\n\n9/939 (0.96%)\n\n4/747 (0.5%)\n\n2/946 (0.21%)\n\n2/758 (0.3%)\n\n0.04**\n\n0.45\n* the incidences in both groups are those expected in STEMI patients treated by fibrinolytics or \nprimary PCI (as observed in previous studies).\n** the incidence in the pharmaco-invasive group is as expected for fibrinolysis with tenecteplase (as \nobserved in previous studies).\n\nAfter the dose reduction of tenecteplase by half in patients \u2265 75 years there was no further intracranial \nhemorrhage (0 of 97 patients) (95% CI: 0.0-3.7) versus 8.1% (3 of 37 patients) (95% CI: 1.7-21.9) \nprior to dose reduction. The bounds of the confidence interval of the observed incidences prior and \nafter dose reduction are overlapping.\n\nIn patients \u2265 75 years the observed incidence of the primary efficacy composite end point for the \npharmaco-invasive strategy and primary PCI were as follows: before dose reduction 11/37 (29.7%) \n(95% CI: 15.9- 47.0) versus 10/32 (31.3%) (95% CI: 16.1-50.0), after dose reduction: 25/97 (25.8%) \n(95% CI: 17.4-35.7) versus 25/88 (24.8%) (95% CI: 19.3-39.0). In both groups the bounds of the \nconfidence interval of the observed incidences prior and post dose reduction are overlapping.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption and distribution\n\nTenecteplase is an intravenously administered, recombinant protein that activates plasminogen. \nFollowing intravenous bolus administration of 30 mg tenecteplase in patients with acute myocardial \ninfarction, the initially estimated tenecteplase plasma concentration was 6.45 \u00b1 3.60 \u00b5g/mL (mean \u00b1 \nSD). The distribution phase represents 31% \u00b1 22% to 69% \u00b1 15% (mean \u00b1 SD) of the total AUC \nfollowing the administration of doses ranges from 5 to 50 mg.\n\nData on tissue distribution were obtained in studies with radioactively labelled tenecteplase in rats. \nThe main organ to which tenecteplase distributed was the liver. It is not known whether and to which\nextent tenecteplase binds to plasma proteins in humans. The mean residence time (MRT) in the body \nis approximately 1 h and the mean (\u00b1 SD) volume of distribution at the steady-state (Vss) ranged from \n6.3 \u00b1 2 L to 15 \u00b1 7 L.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nTenecteplase is cleared from circulation by binding to specific receptors in the liver followed by \ncatabolism to small peptides. Binding to hepatic receptors is, however, reduced compared to native t-\nPA, resulting in a prolonged half-life.\n\n\n\n24\n\nElimination\n\nAfter single intravenous bolus injection of tenecteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction, \ntenecteplase antigen exhibits biphasic elimination from plasma. There is no dose dependence of \ntenecteplase clearance in the therapeutic dose range. The initial, dominant half-life is 24 \u00b1 5.5 (mean \n\u00b1SD) min, which is 5 times longer than native t-PA. The terminal half-life is 129 \u00b1 87 min, and \nplasma clearance is 119 \u00b1 49 ml/min. \n\nIncreasing body weight resulted in a moderate increase of tenecteplase clearance, and increasing age \nresulted in a slight decrease of clearance. Women exhibit in general lower clearance than men, but this \ncan be explained by the generally lower body weight of women.\n\nLinearity/Non-Linearity\n\nThe dose linearity analysis based on AUC suggested that tenecteplase exhibits non-linear \npharmacokinetics in the dose range studied, i.e. 5 to 50 mg.\n\nRenal and hepatic impairment\n\nBecause elimination of tenecteplase is through the liver, it is not expected that renal dysfunction will \naffect its the pharmacokinetics. This is also supported by animal data. However, the effect of renal and \nhepatic dysfunction on pharmacokinetics of tenecteplase in humans has not been specifically \ninvestigated. Accordingly, there is no guidance for the adjustment to tenecteplase dose in patients with \nhepatic and severe renal insufficiency.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIntravenous single dose administration in rats, rabbits and dogs resulted only in dose-dependent and \nreversible alterations of the coagulation parameters with local haemorrhage at the injection site, which \nwas regarded as a consequence of the pharmacodynamic effect of tenecteplase. Multiple-dose toxicity \nstudies in rats and dogs confirmed these above-mentioned observations, but the study duration was \nlimited to two weeks by antibody formation to the human protein tenecteplase, which resulted in \nanaphylaxis.\n\nSafety pharmacology data in cynomolgus monkeys revealed reduction of blood pressure followed by \nchanges of ECG, but these occurred at exposures that were considerably higher than the clinical \nexposure.\n\nWith regard to the indication and the single dose administration in humans, reproductive toxicity \ntesting was limited to an embryotoxicity study in rabbits, as a sensitive species. Tenecteplase induced \ntotal litter deaths during the mid-embryonal period. When tenecteplase was given during the mid- or \nlate-embryonal period maternal animals showed vaginal bleeding on the day after the first dose. \nSecondary mortality was observed 1-2 days later. Data on the foetal period are not available.\n\nMutagenicity and carcinogenicity are not expected for this class of recombinant proteins and \ngenotoxicity and carcinogenicity testing were not necessary.\n\nNo local irritation of the blood vessel was observed after intravenous, intra-arterial or paravenous \nadministration of the final formulation of tenecteplase.\n\n\n\n25\n\n6.

If not \nused immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user \nand would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2-8\u00b0C.\n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage\n\nDo not store above 30\u00b0C. Keep the container in the outer carton in order to protect from light.\nFor storage conditions of the reconstituted medicinal product, see section 6.3.\n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container\n\n20 ml glass vial type I, with a coated (B2-42) grey rubber stopper and a flip-off cap filled with powder \nfor solution for injection. Each vial 50 mg tenecteplase.\n10 ml plastic pre-filled syringe with 10 ml of solvent.\nSterile vial adapter.\nSterile needle for single use.\n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling\n\nMetalyse should be reconstituted by adding the complete volume of water for injections from the pre-\nfilled syringe to the vial containing the powder for injection.\n\n\n\n26\n\n1.

Check that the cap of the vial is still intact.\n3. Remove the flip-off cap from the vial.\n4. Remove the tip-cap from the syringe. Then immediately screw the pre-filled syringe on the vial \n\nadapter and penetrate the vial stopper in the middle with the spike of the vial adapter.\n5. Add the water for injections into the vial by pushing the syringe plunger down slowly to avoid \n\nfoaming.\n6. Reconstitute by swirling gently.\n7. The reconstituted preparation results in a colourless to pale yellow, clear solution. Only clear \n\nsolution without particles should be used.\n8. Directly before the solution will be administered, invert the vial with the syringe still attached, \n\nso that the syringe is below the vial.\n9. Transfer the appropriate volume of reconstituted solution of Metalyse into the syringe, based on \n\nthe patient\u2019s weight.\n10. Disconnect the syringe from the vial adapter.\n11. Metalyse is to be administered to the patient, intravenously in about 10 seconds. It should not be \n\nadministered in a line containing glucose.\n12. Any unused solution should be discarded.\n\nAlternatively the reconstitution can be performed with the included needle.\n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.\n\n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n45\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nMetalyse 8,000 units powder and solvent for solution for injection\nTenecteplase\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Metalyse is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you receive Metalyse\n3. How is Metalyse administered\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Metalyse\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Metalyse is and what it is used for\n\nMetalyse is a powder and solvent for solution for injection. This means that each pack contains:\n\n\uf02d one vial of 8,000 units Metalyse powder and\n\uf02d one pre-filled syringe containing 8 ml water for injections\n\nBefore use, the solvent (water for injections) is added to the powder to form a solution that is given by \ninjection.\n\nMetalyse belongs to a group of medicines called thrombolytic agents. These medicines help to \ndissolve blood clots. Tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator.\n\nMetalyse is used to treat myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) within 6 hours after the onset of \nsymptoms and helps to dissolve the blood clots that have formed in the blood vessels of the heart. This \nhelps to prevent the damage caused by heart attacks and has been shown to save lives. \n\n2. What do you need to know before you receive Metalyse\n\nMetalyse will not be prescribed and given by your doctor:\n\n\uf02d if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction (severe hypersensitivity) \nto the active ingredient tenecteplase, to gentamicin (a trace residue from the manufacturing \nprocess) or any of the other ingredients of Metalyse. If treatment with Metalyse is nevertheless \nconsidered to be necessary, facilities for reanimation should be immediately available in case of \nneed;\n\n\uf02d if you have, or have recently had, an illness that increases your risk of bleeding (haemorrhage), \nincluding:\n\n\uf076 a bleeding disorder or tendency to bleed (haemorrhage)\n\uf076 stroke (cerebrovascular event)\n\uf076 very high, uncontrolled blood pressure\n\uf076 a head injury\n\n\n\n46\n\n\uf076 severe liver disease\n\uf076 a stomach ulcer (peptic ulcer)\n\uf076 varicose veins in the gullet (oesophageal varices)\n\uf076 abnormality of the blood vessels (e.g. an aneurysm)\n\uf076 certain tumours\n\uf076 inflammation of the lining around the heart (pericarditis); inflammation or infection of the \n\nheart valves (endocarditis)\n\uf076 dementia;\n\n\uf02d if you are taking tablets/capsules used to \u201dthin\u201d the blood, such as warfarin or coumarin (anti-\ncoagulants);\n\n\uf02d if you have an inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis);\n\uf02d if you have recently had major surgery including surgery to your brain or spine;\n\uf02d if you have been given cardiopulmonary resuscitation (chest compressions) for more than 2 \n\nminutes duration, in the last two weeks.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nYour doctor will take special care with Metalyse:\n\n\uf02d if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction \n(severe hypersensitive) to the active substance tenecteplase, to gentamicin (a trace residue from \nthe manufacturing process), or to any of the other ingredients of Metalyse (see section 6: \n\u201cContents of the pack and other information\u201d);\n\n\uf02d if you have high blood pressure;\n\uf02d if you have problems with circulation of blood in the brain (cerebrovascular disease);\n\uf02d if you have had gastrointestinal (gut) or genitourinary bleeding within the last ten days (this may \n\ncause blood in stools or urine);\n\uf02d if you have a heart valve abnormality (e.g. mitral stenosis) with an abnormal heart rhythm (e.g. \n\natrial fibrillation);\n\uf02d if you have had an intramuscular injection in the last two days;\n\uf02d if you are aged over 75 years;\n\uf02d if you weigh less than 60 kg;\n\uf02d if you have ever received Metalyse before.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThe use of Metalyse in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended. \n\nOther medicines and Metalyse\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before you are given this medicine.\n\n3. How is Metalyse administered\n\nThe doctor calculates your dose of Metalyse according to your bodyweight, based on the following \nscheme:\n\nBodyweight (kg) less than 60 60 to 70 70 to 80 80 to 90 above 90\n\nMetalyse (U) 6,000 7,000 8,000 9,000 10,000\n\n\n\n47\n\nYour doctor will give you the medicinal product to prevent blood clotting in addition to Metalyse, as \nsoon as possible after your chest pain starts.\n\nMetalyse is given by a single injection into a vein by a doctor who is experienced in the use of this \ntype of medicinal product.\n\nYour doctor will give Metalyse as soon as possible after your chest pain starts as a single dose.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nThe side effects described below have been experienced by people given Metalyse:\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\n\uf02d bleeding\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n\uf02d bleeding at the injection or puncture site \n\uf02d nosebleeds\n\uf02d genitourinary bleeding (you may notice blood in your urine)\n\uf02d bruising\n\uf02d gastro-intestinal bleeding (e.g. bleeding from the stomach or bowel)\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n\uf02d irregular heart beat (reperfusion arrhythmias), sometimes leading to cardiac arrest.
