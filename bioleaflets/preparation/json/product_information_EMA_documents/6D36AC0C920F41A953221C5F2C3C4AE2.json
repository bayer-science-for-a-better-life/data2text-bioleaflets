NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nFluenz Tetra nasal spray suspension\nInfluenza vaccine (live attenuated, nasal)\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nReassortant influenza virus* (live attenuated) of the following four strains**:\n\nA/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1)pdm09 - like strain\n(A/Hawaii/66/2019, MEDI 326775) 107.0±0.5 FFU***\n\nA/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (H3N2) - like strain \n(A/Hong Kong/2671/2019, MEDI 325078) 107.0±0.5 FFU***\n\nB/Washington/02/2019 - like strain\n(B/Washington/02/2019, MEDI 323797) 107.0±0.5 FFU***\n\nB/Phuket/3073/2013 - like strain\n(B/Phuket/3073/2013, MEDI 306444) 107.0±0.5 FFU***\n\n.................................................................................................................per 0.2 ml dose\n\n* propagated in fertilised hens’ eggs from healthy chicken flocks.\n** produced in VERO cells by reverse genetic technology. This product contains genetically \n\nmodified organisms (GMOs).\n*** fluorescent focus units.\n\nThis vaccine complies with the WHO recommendation (Northern Hemisphere) and EU decision for \nthe 2020/2021 season.\n\nThe vaccine may contain residues of the following substances: egg proteins (e.g. ovalbumin) and \ngentamicin. The maximum amount of ovalbumin is less than 0.024 micrograms per 0.2 ml dose (0.12 \nmicrograms per ml).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nNasal spray, suspension\n\nThe suspension is colourless to pale yellow, clear to opalescent with a pH of approximately 7.2. Small \nwhite particles may be present.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nProphylaxis of influenza in children and adolescents from 24 months to less than 18 years of age.\n\nThe use of Fluenz Tetra should be based on official recommendations.\n\n\n\n3\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nChildren and adolescents from 24 months:\n0.2 ml (administered as 0.1 ml per nostril).\n\nFor children who have not previously been vaccinated against seasonal influenza, a second dose\nshould be given after an interval of at least 4 weeks.\n\nFluenz Tetra should not be used in infants and toddlers below 24 months of age because of safety \nconcerns regarding increased rates of hospitalisation and wheezing in this population (see section 4.8).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nImmunisation must be carried out by nasal administration.\n\nDo not inject Fluenz Tetra.\n\nFluenz Tetra is administered as a divided dose in both nostrils. After administering half of the dose in \none nostril, administer the other half of the dose in the other nostril immediately or shortly thereafter. \nThe patient can breathe normally while the vaccine is being administered – there is no need to actively \ninhale or sniff.\n\nSee section 6.6 for administration instructions.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1 (e.g. gelatin), or to gentamicin (a possible trace residue). \n\n- Severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to eggs or to egg proteins (e.g. ovalbumin).\n\n- Children and adolescents with clinical immunodeficiency due to conditions or \nimmunosuppressive therapy such as: acute and chronic leukaemias; lymphoma; \nsymptomatic HIV infection; cellular immune deficiencies; and high-dose corticosteroids.\nFluenz Tetra is not contraindicated for use in individuals with asymptomatic HIV \ninfection; or individuals who are receiving topical/inhaled corticosteroids or low-dose \nsystemic corticosteroids or those receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.g. for \nadrenal insufficiency.\n\n- Children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age receiving salicylate therapy \nbecause of the association of Reye’s syndrome with salicylates and wild-type influenza \ninfection.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nAs with most vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily \navailable to manage an anaphylactic event or serious hypersensitivity event following the \nadministration of Fluenz Tetra.\n\n\n\n4\n\nFluenz Tetra should not be administered to children and adolescents with severe asthma or active \nwheezing because these individuals have not been adequately studied in clinical studies.\n\nVaccine recipients should be informed that Fluenz Tetra is an attenuated live virus vaccine and has the \npotential for transmission to immunocompromised contacts. Vaccine recipients should attempt to \navoid, whenever possible, close association with severely immunocompromised individuals (e.g. bone \nmarrow transplant recipients requiring isolation) for 1-2 weeks following vaccination. Peak incidence \nof vaccine virus recovery occurred 2-3 days post-vaccination in Fluenz clinical studies. In \ncircumstances where contact with severely immunocompromised individuals is unavoidable, the \npotential risk of transmission of the influenza vaccine virus should be weighed against the risk of \nacquiring and transmitting wild-type influenza virus.\n\nFluenz Tetra should under no circumstances be injected.\n\nNo data exist regarding the safety of intranasal administration of Fluenz Tetra in children with \nunrepaired craniofacial malformations.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nDo not administer Fluenz Tetra to children and adolescents receiving salicylate therapy\n(see section 4.3). Do not use salicylates in children and adolescents for 4 weeks after vaccination \nunless medically indicated as Reye’s syndrome has been reported following the use of salicylates \nduring wild-type influenza infection.\n\nThe co-administration of trivalent Fluenz with the live attenuated vaccines: measles, mumps, rubella, \nvaricella and orally-administered poliovirus has been studied. No clinically meaningful changes in \nimmune responses to measles, mumps, varicella, orally-administered poliovirus or Fluenz have been \nobserved. The immune response to rubella vaccine was significantly altered. However, this alteration \nmight not be of clinical relevance with the two dose immunisation schedule of the rubella vaccine. \nThis observation with trivalent Fluenz is relevant to the use of Fluenz Tetra because Fluenz Tetra \n(influenza vaccine-liveattenuated, nasal) is identical to Fluenz with the only difference being the \naddition of a fourth strain (a second B strain) to Fluenz Tetra.\n\nThe co-administration of Fluenz Tetra with inactivated vaccines has not been studied.\n\nThe concurrent use of Fluenz Tetra with antiviral agents that are active against influenza A and/or B \nviruses has not been evaluated. However, based upon the potential for influenza antiviral agents to \nreduce the effectiveness of Fluenz Tetra, it is recommended not to administer the vaccine\nuntil 48 hours after the cessation of influenza antiviral therapy. Administration of influenza antiviral \nagents within two weeks of vaccination may affect the response of the vaccine.\n\nIf influenza antiviral agents and Fluenz Tetra are administered concomitantly, revaccination should be \nconsidered based on clinical judgement.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere is a moderate amount of data from the use of Fluenz Tetra in pregnant women. There was no \nevidence of significant maternal adverse outcomes in 138 pregnant women who had a record of \nreceiving trivalent Fluenz in a US-based health insurance claims database. \n\nIn more than 300 case reports in the AstraZeneca safety database of vaccine administration to pregnant \nwomen, no unusual patterns of pregnancy complications or foetal outcomes were observed.\n\n\n\n5\n\nWhile animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive \ntoxicity, and post-marketing data offer some reassurance in the event of inadvertent administration\nof the vaccine, Fluenz Tetra is not recommended during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether Fluenz Tetra is excreted in human milk. Therefore, as some viruses are \nexcreted in human milk, Fluenz Tetra should not be used during breast-feeding.\n\nLimited available evidence suggests that the trivalent Fluenz is not excreted in breastmilk. \n\nFertility\n\nNo data exist regarding the possible effects of Fluenz Tetra on male and female fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nFluenz Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe safety experience with trivalent Fluenz is relevant to the use of Fluenz Tetra because Fluenz Tetra \n(influenza vaccine-live attenuated, nasal) is identical to Fluenz with the only difference being the \naddition of a fourth strain (a second B strain) to Fluenz Tetra.\n\nSafety data regarding use of Fluenz Tetra are based on data from Fluenz Tetra clinical studies \nin 2,231 children and adolescents 2 to 17 years of age, Fluenz clinical studies in over 29,000 children \nand adolescents 2 to 17 years of age and Fluenz post-authorisation safety studies in \nover 84,000 children and adolescents 2 to 17 years of age. Additional experience has occurred with \nmarketed use of Fluenz.\n\nIn clinical studies, the safety profile of Fluenz Tetra was similar to the safety profile of Fluenz.\nThe most common adverse reaction observed in clinical studies was nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea.\n\nList of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reaction frequencies are reported as:\nVery common (≥1/10)\nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10)\nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100)\nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000)\nVery rare (<1/10,000)\n\nImmune system disorders\nUncommon: Hypersensitivity reactions (including facial oedema, urticaria and very rare \nanaphylactic reactions)\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nVery common: Decreased appetite\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon: Headache\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nVery common: Nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea\n\n\n\n6\n\nUncommon: Epistaxis\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nUncommon: Rash\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nCommon: Myalgia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nVery common: Malaise\nCommon: Pyrexia\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn an active-controlled clinical study (MI-CP111), an increased rate of hospitalisations (for any cause) \nthrough 180 days after final vaccination dose was observed in infants and toddlers 6-11 months of age \n(6.1% Fluenz versus 2.6% injectable influenza vaccine). Most hospitalisations were due to \ngastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections and occurred more than 6 weeks post vaccination. The \nrate of hospitalisations was not increased in Fluenz recipients 12 months and older. In the same study, \nan increased rate of wheezing through 42 days was observed in infants and toddlers 6-23 months of \nage (5.9% Fluenz versus 3.8% injectable influenza vaccine). The rate of wheezing was not increased \nin Fluenz recipients 24 months and older. Fluenz Tetra is not indicated for use in infants and toddlers \nyounger than 24 months (see section 4.2).\n\nVery rare reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome and exacerbation of symptoms of Leigh syndrome \n(mitochondrial encephalomyopathy) have also been observed in the post-marketing setting \nwith Fluenz.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nOverdose with Fluenz Tetra is unlikely due to its presentation as a pre-filled sprayer. Administration \nof a higher than recommended dose of Fluenz Tetra was reported rarely and the adverse reaction \nprofile was comparable to that observed with the recommended dose of Fluenz Tetra.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, influenza live attenuated; ATC Code: J07BB03\n\nSince 1985, two distinct lineages of influenza B viruses (Victoria and Yamagata) have circulated \nworldwide. Fluenz Tetra is a tetravalent vaccine that contains antigens for four influenza virus strains, \nan A/(H1N1) strain, an A/(H3N2) strain, and two B strains (one from each lineage). Fluenz Tetra is \nmanufactured according to the same process as Fluenz. The influenza virus strains in Fluenz Tetra are \n(a) cold-adapted (ca); (b) temperature-sensitive (ts); and (c) attenuated (att).

Four \nplacebo-controlled studies included second season revaccination. Fluenz has demonstrated superiority \nin 3 active-controlled studies with injectable influenza vaccine.

The incidence of wheezing within 15 days after \nvaccination was lower in Fluenz recipients relative to inactivated vaccine recipients \n(19.5% vs. 23.8%, P=0.02).\n\nIn a study of children and adolescents 9 to 17 years of age with moderate to severe asthma \n(trivalent Fluenz: n=24, placebo: n=24), the primary safety criterion, change in percent predicted \nforced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) measured before and after vaccination, did not differ \nbetween treatment arms.\n\nIn studies of adults in which a high percentage of individuals had underlying chronic medical \nconditions, the safety profile of trivalent Fluenz was comparable to the safety profile observed \nin individuals without these conditions.\n\nImmunocompromised\nIn 24 HIV-infected children and 25 HIV-negative children 1 through 7 years of age, and \nin 243 HIV-infected children and adolescents 5 through 17 years of age receiving stable anti-retroviral \ntherapy, the frequency and duration of vaccine virus shedding were comparable to that seen in healthy \nindividuals. No adverse effects on HIV viral load or CD4 counts were identified following trivalent \nFluenz administration. Twenty mild to moderately immunocompromised children and \nadolescents 5 through 17 years of age (receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy or who had \nrecently received chemotherapy) were randomised 1:1 to trivalent Fluenz or placebo. Frequency and \n\n\n\n9\n\nduration of vaccine virus shedding in these immunocompromised children and adolescents were \ncomparable to that seen in healthy children and adolescents. The effectiveness of Fluenz and Fluenz \nTetra in preventing influenza illness in immunocompromised individuals has not been evaluated.\n\nFluenz Tetra immunogenicity\nA multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority study was conducted to \nassess the immunogenicity of Fluenz Tetra compared to Fluenz (active control) in children and \nadolescents 2-17 years of age. A total of 2,312 children and adolescents were randomised by site at \na 3:1:1 ratio to receive either Fluenz Tetra or one of two formulations of comparator vaccine Fluenz, \neach containing a B strain that corresponded to one of the two B strains in Fluenz Tetra (a B strain of \nthe Yamagata lineage and a B strain of the Victoria lineage).\n\nImmunogenicity was evaluated by comparing geometric mean titres (GMTs) of strain-specific serum \nhaemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies post dosing. Fluenz Tetra demonstrated immunologic \nnon-inferiority to the two formulations of Fluenz as the upper bound for each of the four 95% CIs for \nthe post-dose strain-specific GMT HAI antibody ratios was ≤ 1.5.\n\nAdult studies\nSeveral studies against placebo have shown that Fluenz may have some efficacy in adults. However, \na conclusion on clinical benefit of this vaccine in adults could not be made given that results observed \nin some studies versus injectable influenza vaccines were suggestive of a lower efficacy of Fluenz.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional non-clinical studies of \nrepeated dose toxicity, reproduction and developmental toxicity, local tolerance and neurovirulence.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you or your child only. Do not pass it on to others.\n- If any of the side effects gets serious, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n\n1. What Fluenz Tetra is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you are given Fluenz Tetra\n3. How Fluenz Tetra is given\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Fluenz Tetra\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Fluenz Tetra is and what it is used for\n\nFluenz Tetra is a vaccine to prevent influenza (flu). It is used in children and adolescents 24 months to \nless than 18 years of age. Fluenz Tetra will help to protect against the four virus strains contained in \nthe vaccine, and other strains closely related to them.\n\nHow Fluenz Tetra works\n\nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will \nproduce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can \ncause the flu.\n\nFluenz Tetra vaccine viruses are grown in chicken eggs. Each year the vaccine targets four strains of \ninfluenza, following the annual recommendations by the World Health Organisation.\n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Fluenz Tetra\n\nYou will not be given Fluenz Tetra:\n\n if you are allergic to gentamicin, gelatin or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in \nsection 6 “Contents of the pack and other information”). \n\n if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to eggs or egg proteins. For signs of allergic \nreactions, see section 4 “Possible side effects”.\n\n if you have a blood disorder or a cancer that affects the immune system.\n if you have been told by your doctor that you have a weakened immune system as a result \n\nof a disease, medicine or other treatment.\n if you are already taking acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used \n\nto relieve pain and lower fever). This is because of the risk of a very rare but serious disease\n(Reye’s syndrome).\n\nIf any of these apply, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\n\n\n\n23\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination:\n if the child is less than 24 months of age. Children less than 24 months of age should not \n\nreceive this vaccine because of the risk of side effects.\n if you have severe asthma or are currently wheezing.\n if you are in close contact with someone with a severely weakened immune system\n\n(for example, a bone marrow transplant patient needing isolation).\n\nIf any of these apply, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination. He or she will \ndecide if Fluenz Tetra is suitable for you.\n\nOther medicines, other vaccines and Fluenz Tetra\n\nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if the person being vaccinated is taking, has recently taken or \nmight take any other medicines, including medicines that do not require a prescription.\n Do not give acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and \n\nlower fever) to children for 4 weeks after vaccination with Fluenz Tetra unless your doctor, \nnurse or pharmacist tells you otherwise. This is because of the risk of Reye’s syndrome, a very \nrare but serious disease that can affect the brain and liver.\n\n It is recommended that Fluenz Tetra is not given at the same time as influenza-specific \nantiviral medicines, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir. This is because the vaccine may work \nless effectively.\n\nYour doctor, nurse or pharmacist will decide if Fluenz Tetra can be given at the same time as other \nvaccines.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant soon or are \n\nbreast-feeding, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before receiving this vaccine. Fluenz \nTetra is not recommended for women who are pregnant or are breast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\n Fluenz Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n3. How Fluenz Tetra is given\n\nFluenz Tetra will be administered under the supervision of a doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\n\nFluenz Tetra must only be used as a nasal spray.\n\nFluenz Tetra must not be injected.\n\nFluenz Tetra will be given as a spray in each nostril. You can breathe normally while you are given \nFluenz Tetra. You do not need to actively inhale or sniff.\n\nDosage\nThe recommended dose for children and adolescents is 0.2 ml Fluenz Tetra, administered as 0.1 ml \nin each nostril. Children who have not previously had an influenza vaccine will receive a second, \nfollow-up dose after an interval of at least 4 weeks. Follow your doctor, nurse or pharmacist’s\ninstructions about if and when your child should return for the second dose.\n\nIf you have any further questions on this vaccine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\n\n\n\n24\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. In clinical \nstudies with the vaccine, most side effects were mild in nature and short term.\n\nAsk your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you want more information about possible side effects from \nFluenz Tetra.\n\nSome side effects may be serious\n\nVery rare\n(may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people):\n severe allergic reaction: signs of a severe allergic reaction may include shortness of breath and \n\nswelling of the face or tongue.\n\nTell your doctor straight away or seek urgent medical care if you experience any of the effects \nabove.\n\nOther possible side effects of Fluenz Tetra\n\nVery common\n(may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\n runny or stuffy nose\n reduced appetite\n weakness\n\nCommon\n(may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n fever\n muscle aches\n headache\n\nUncommon\n(may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n rash\n nose bleed\n allergic reactions\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.\n\n5. How to store Fluenz Tetra\n\nKeep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the applicator label after the \nletters EXP.\n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). Do not freeze.\n\nKeep the nasal applicator in the outer carton in order to protect from light.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n25\n\nBefore use, the vaccine may be taken out of the refrigerator once for a maximum period of 12 hours at \na temperature not above 25°C.
