This will allow quick \nidentification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report \nany suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEpisalvan gel  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1g gel contains: 100 mg extract (as dry extract, refined) from birch bark from Betula \npendula Roth, Betula pubescens Ehrh. as well as hybrids of both species (equivalent to \n0.5-1.0 g birch bark), corresponding to 72-88 mg betulin. \n \nExtraction solvent: n-Heptane \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGel. \nColourless to slightly yellowish, opalescent. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of partial thickness wounds in adults. See section 4.4 and 5.1 with respect to \ntype of wounds studied. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe gel should be applied to the wound surface at a thickness of approximately 1 mm \nand covered by sterile wound dressing. The gel should be re-applied at each wound \ndressing change, until the wound is healed, for up to 4 weeks. See section 4.4 with \nrespect to wound size and duration of treatment. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \n \nNo formal studies have been conducted with Episalvan in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment. No dose adjustment or special considerations are anticipated for patients \nwith renal or hepatic impairment, see section 5.2. \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment is required. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Episalvan in children and adolescents under 18 years have \nnot yet been established. No data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration \nFor cutaneous application.  \nFresh wounds should achieve haemostasis prior to application of Episalvan. If \nnecessary, wounds (accidental wounds) should be cleaned according to standard \nprocedure, using e.g. wound antiseptic solution, prior to application of Episalvan. \n \nEpisalvan is for single use only. Once opened, the product should be used immediately \nand be discarded after use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to the excipient listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWound infection \nEpisalvan gel is sterile. However, wound infection is an important and serious \ncomplication that can occur during wound healing. In the case of infection, it is \nrecommended to discontinue treatment with Episalvan. Additional standard treatment \nmay be required (see section 4.5).  \n \nWound size \nThe mean wound size treated with Episalvan in clinical studies in split-thickness skin \ngraft donor site wounds was 40.7 cm² (range 8-300 cm²). In the Grade 2a burn wound \nstudy, the mean wound size treated with Episalvan was 108 cm² (range 23-395 cm²).  \n \nDuration of use \nThere is no information available on clinical use of Episalvan for more than 4 weeks. \n \nPartial thickness burn wounds \nRepeated critical assessment of burn depth and healing progression is needed. Wounds \nthat are assessed as unable to heal within an acceptable time frame may need surgical \nmeasures (e.g., split-thickness skin grafting) to reduce the risk of hypertrophic scarring. \n \nOther wound types \nThere is no clinical experience from use of Episalvan for the treatment of chronic \nwounds, e.g. diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers or wounds in patients with \nepidermolysis bullosa. \n \nBirch pollen allergy \nEpisalvan is safe to use for people who are allergic to birch pollen, as these allergens are \nnot present in Episalvan. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. Since the systemic exposure of Episalvan \nfollowing cutaneous application is negligible no interaction with systemic treatments is \nexpected. Interactions with topical products have not been investigated in clinical trials. \nOther topical products should not be concomitantly used together with Episalvan but \nrather sequentially or alternatively depending on the clinical need. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nNo studies in pregnant women have been conducted.  \n \nNo effects during pregnancy are anticipated, since systemic exposure to Episalvan is \nnegligible. Episalvan can be used during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNo data are available to evaluate whether Episalvan is excreted into human milk.  \n \nNo effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure \nof the breast-feeding woman to Episalvan is negligible. Episalvan can be used during \nbreast-feeding, unless the chest area is subject to treatment. \n \nFertility \nFertility studies have not been conducted. No effects on human fertility are anticipated, \nsince the systemic exposure is negligible.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEpisalvan has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently observed adverse reactions were wound complication (in 2.9% of \npatients), pain of skin (2.5%) and pruritus (1.3%). Adverse reactions were \nadministration site reactions only. Wound complication adverse reactions such as \nwound infection and wound necrosis are complications of healing of partial thickness \nskin wounds and can be serious. See also section 4.4.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \nIn the following table, adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class and \npreferred term. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness.  \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials \n\nSystem organ class Common \n \n\nUncommon \n \n\nInfections and infestations  Wound infection \nImmune system disorders  Hypersensitivity \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nPain of skin Dermatitis \n\n Pruritus Rash pruritic \n  Purpura \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n Pain \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications \n\nWound \ncomplication* \n\n \n\n* Wound complication comprises different kinds of local complications such as post-procedural \ncomplications, wound necrosis, wound secretion, impaired healing, or inflammation of wound. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nIn addition, there is one case report of contact dermatitis reported from a literature in a \npatient after prolonged use of a topical birch bark extract containing cosmetic product. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is \nimportant. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal \nproduct. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions \nvia the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdosing with Episalvan is unlikely: in patients in which wound sizes >300 cm2 were \nrepeatedly treated with Episalvan, no betulin plasma levels could be detected.  \n \nNo data have been generated to study the effect of accidental ingestion of Episalvan.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Preparation for treatment of wounds and ulcers; ATC code: \nD03AX13 . \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nThe active substance accelerated re-epithelialization in an in vitro wound scratch assay \nusing human primary keratinocytes at the dosage of 1 μg/ml, and in a porcine ex vivo \nwound healing model at the dosage of 10 µg/ml. The precise mechanism of action of the \nactive substance in wound healing in humans is not known. \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThree Phase III studies were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of Episalvan in \nthe treatment of partial thickness wounds of the skin: two studies which investigated \nsplit-thickness skin graft donor site wounds, which included a total of 219 patients (ITT: \nN=217), and one further study in 61 patients with Grade 2a burn wounds (ITT: N=57). \nPatients with deeper burn wounds (Grade 2b) were not included. \n \nThe 219 patients with split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds had a mean age of \n53 years; their donor site mean wound size was 81.5 cm2. In the burn wound study with \n61 patients, the mean study wound area was 216 cm2; the total burn injury of these \npatients was larger and affected 5.8% of the total body surface area. \n \nThe Phase III studies were blindly evaluated, prospective, intra-individually controlled, \nrandomised, multicentre trials. The target wound area of each patient was divided into \ntwo treatment areas of approximately the same size; the treatment allocation to the two \nhalves of the wound (distal vs. proximal) was determined by randomization (in the burn \ntrial, two similar wounds could be used). Episalvan plus wound dressing was applied to \nhalf of the wound area, and the same kind of non-adhesive wound dressing alone was \napplied to the other half as the control in the split-thickness skin graft donor site studies. \nIn the Grade 2a burn wound study an octenidine containing antiseptic wound gel and \nfatty gauze dressing were used as control. Application was at each wound dressing \nchange every third to fourth day until full wound closure up to 28 days for the split-\nthickness skin graft trials, and every other day up to 21 days for the Grade 2a burn trial. \nPhotographs of the wound were taken at each visit for the blinded evaluation. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\nThe primary endpoint for the two split-thickness skin graft trials was the intra-individual \ndifference in time to wound closure (at least 95% epithelialisation) based on blinded photo \nevaluations. Median time to wound healing was 14 days. Wound halves treated with \nEpisalvan healed faster than the wound halves treated with standard of care (mean 1.1 \ndays according to primary endpoints, p<0.0001, two-sided paired t-test). \n \nTable 2: Overview of Efficacy Results: Intra-patient difference in time to wound \nclosure \n\nMean intra-patient difference in  \ntime to wound closure  \n(95% epithelialisation) \n\nSplit-thickness skin graft \ndonor site wound studies \n\n(pooled) \n\nGrade 2a burn wound \nstudy \n\nN = 217 N=57 \nObserver-blinded photo \nassessment (blinded read), mean \nexpert evaluation \n\n  \n\nprimary blinded read /  \nvery conservative calculation \n(primary endpoint for STSG \nstudies) \n\n-1.1 days (CI: -1.5, -0.7) \nfaster wound closure with \nEpisalvan, p<0.0001a \n\n-1.0 days (CI: -1.4, -0.6) \nfaster wound closure \nwith Episalvan, \np<0.0001a \n\nIntention-to-treat (ITT) data set. \n‘Primary’ vs. ‘secondary’ blinded read: In the primary blinded read evaluation a rigorous quality check was \nimplemented to assure blinding of the observers. In consequence a substantial number of photographs were \nexcluded and not presented in the primary blinded read because of apparent gel residues. The secondary \nblinded read was conducted with all photographs presented to the blinded observers. \n’Very conservative calculation’ means that the first observation of wound closure was taken as time of \nwound closure. Difference in time to wound closure was set to 0 for photo series rated as ‘not evaluable’. If \nwound closure was not observed in a wound half photo series, it was calculated to have occurred one day \nafter the last photograph in the series.  \n‘Less conservative calculation’ differs from the ‘very conservative calculation’ in one aspect: If wound \nclosure was not observed in a wound half photo series, it was calculated to have occurred not one day, but \napproximately 3 days later (the mean time interval between wound dressing changes in the studies). \nCI: 95% confidence interval; MTWDC: mean time to wound dressing change; N: number of patients in the \nanalysis set; STSG Split-thickness skin graft \n \nThe primary endpoint for the Grade 2a burn wound trial was the percentage of patients \nwith earlier healing (at least 95% epithelialisation) based on blinded photo evaluations. \nMedian time to wound healing was 7.3 days. Of the patients with a between-treatment \ndifference in wound healing (N=35), the percentage of patients who showed earlier \nhealing (primary endpoint) of their Episalvan treated wound half (85.7% [95% CI: \n69.7%, 95.2%]) was higher than those who showed earlier healing of their standard of \ncare control treated wound half (14.3% [95% CI: 4.8%, 30.3%]) (p < 0.0001, binomial \ntest).  \n \nIn follow-up visits at 3 months and 12 months after the day of surgery or of burn injury \nthe treated wound halves were found to be equal in the majority of patients with regard \nto pigmentation, redness, texture and hair growth of the regenerated epidermis. For a \nsubset of patients blinded photo-evaluation indicated better results for Episalvan treated \nwound halves compared to standard of care in pigmentation, redness and texture of the \nformer wound areas. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of \nstudies with Episalvan in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the \ntreatment of skin injuries. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nEpisalvan gel is administered topically to skin wounds and shows poor absorbtion. \nBased on data from three clinical studies with a total of 280 patients, application of \nEpisalvan gel to open wounds did not lead to betulin plasma levels higher than natural \nbackground-levels originating e.g. from nutritional sources. \n \nSince no biologically relevant levels of betulin were found in patients, no further studies \nrelated to distribution, biotransformation and elimination were performed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, and phototoxicity. \nRepeated dose toxicity and local tolerance have been studied for up to 4 weeks. Toxicity \nstudies of longer duration than 4 weeks have not been performed. The active substance \nwas not genotoxic in in vitro assays.  \n \nCarcinogenicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been \nperformed. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n16 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nEpisalvan gel \nBirch bark extract \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick \n\nidentification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you \nmay get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it \ncontains important information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It \n\nmay harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Episalvan is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Episalvan  \n3. How to use Episalvan  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Episalvan  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Episalvan is and what it is used for \n \nEpisalvan gel is a herbal medicinal product which contains dry extract from birch bark.  \n \nIt is used in adults for the treatment of skin wounds, resulting for example from grade \n2a burn wounds or from surgical skin graft transplantation. There is no experience of \nthe use of Episalvan for the treatment of chronic wounds, e.g. diabetic foot ulcers or \nvenous leg ulcers. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Episalvan \n \nDo not use Episalvan \n- if you are allergic to birch bark or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). Episalvan does not contain birch pollen, so it may be used by \npeople with birch pollen allergy. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before using Episalvan. \n \nIf you have an infection in the wound additional treatment may be required. Wound \ninfection is a serious complication that can occur during the healing process.  \nPossible signs of a wound infection are that the wound begins to drain yellow or \ngreenish fluid (pus), or that the skin around the wound becomes red, warm, swollen, or \nincreasingly painful.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere is insufficient experience of the use of Episalvan in children and adolescents \nunder 18 years of age, therefore it should not be used in these patients. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nOther medicines and Episalvan \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other \nmedicines. \n \nNo studies have been performed to establish whether Episalvan will interact with other \nmedicines. However, since the amount of Episalvan absorbed into the body is extremely \nlow it is not expected that Episalvan will interact with other medicines.  \n \nNo data are available on possible interaction between Episalvan and other medicines \napplied to the skin. Do not apply other products to the skin wound area at the same time \nof applying Episalvan.  \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nNo studies have been done on the effects of Episalvan on pregnant women, but since the \nabsorption of this medicine into the body is extremely low, the risk to the unborn baby \nis negligible. Episalvan can be used during pregnancy. \n \nIt is not known whether Episalvan passes into human breast milk, but since the \nabsorption of this medicine into the body is minimal, the risk to the baby is negligible. \nEpisalvan can be used during breast-feeding, unless the chest area is being treated. \n \nThe effect of Episalvan on fertility has not been studied, but since the absorption of this \nmedicine into the body is extremely low, it is not expected to have an effect on your \nfertility. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to drive and use machines will not be affected by this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to use Episalvan \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you. Check with your \ndoctor or nurse if you are not sure.  \n \nMethod of administration \n\n• If necessary, wounds should be cleansed using a suitable antiseptic solution \nprior to application of Episalvan \n\n• Episalvan should be applied to the wound surface at a thickness of \napproximately 1 mm and covered by a sterile wound dressing.  \n\n• Re-apply the gel each time the dressing is changed, until the wound is healed. \n• Once the single-use tube has been opened, use the gel immediately and discard \n\nthe tube, even if there’s some left. \n \nDuration of use \nEpisalvan should be used until the wound is healed or up to 4 weeks. Your doctor or \nnurse will tell you for how long you should use the gel.  \nThere is no experience from long-term use of Episalvan for more than 4 weeks. \n \nIf you use more Episalvan than you should \nEpisalvan is applied to the skin and the absorption into the body is minimal. This makes \noverdose very unlikely, even if applied to large skin areas and for a long period of time. \n \nIf you forget to use Episalvan \nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Apply Episalvan at the next \nplanned change of the wound dressing, continuing with your normal routine. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nIf you stop using Episalvan \nEpisalvan should be used as advised by your doctor or nurse. Do not stop using it \nwithout consulting your doctor or nurse. If your wound shows no signs of improvement \nover time, talk to your doctor or nurse.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets \nthem.  \n \nThe most frequently reported side effects are: \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- painful skin \n- itching  \n- complications in the wound healing process \n \nOther side effects include: \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n- wound infection \n- allergic reaction (hypersensitivity)  \n- skin irritation (dermatitis) \n- itchy rash \n- purple coloured rash \n- pain \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national \nreporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide \nmore information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Episalvan \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \nStore below 30°C. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and tube \nafter ‘EXP’. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nThis product is for single use only and once opened, the product should be used \nimmediately.
