NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nJETREA 0.375 mg/0.3 mL solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 0.375 mg of ocriplasmin* in 0.3 mL solution (1.25 mg/mL). This provides a usable \namount to deliver a single dose of 0.1 mL containing 0.125 mg ocriplasmin. \n \n*Ocriplasmin is a truncated form of human plasmin produced by recombinant DNA technology in a \nPichia pastoris expression system. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection). \nClear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nJETREA is indicated in adults for the treatment of vitreomacular traction (VMT), including when \nassociated with macular hole of diameter less than or equal to 400 microns (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nJETREA must be administered by a qualified ophthalmologist experienced in intravitreal injections. \nThe diagnosis of vitreomacular traction (VMT) should comprise of a complete clinical picture \nincluding patient history, clinical examination and investigation using currently accepted diagnostic \ntools, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT). \n \nPosology \nJETREA 0.375 mg/0.3 mL solution for injection is a ‘ready-diluted’ formulation, no further dilution is \nrequired. The recommended dose is 0.125 mg in 0.1 mL of the solution administered by intravitreal \ninjection to the affected eye once as a single dose. Each vial should only be used once and for the \ntreatment of a single eye. Treatment with JETREA in the other eye is not recommended concurrently \nor within 7 days of the initial injection in order to monitor the post-injection course including the \npotential for decreased vision in the injected eye. Repeated administration in the same eye is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4).  \n \nSee section 4.4 for instructions on post-injection monitoring. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nNo formal studies have been conducted with JETREA in patients with renal impairment. No dose \nadjustment or special considerations are anticipated for patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo formal studies have been conducted with JETREA in patients with hepatic impairment. No dose \nadjustment or special considerations are anticipated for patients with hepatic impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n \nElderly \nThe elderly population has been studied in clinical studies. No dose adjustment is required.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of JETREA in children aged under 18 years for the indication of \nvitreomacular traction (VMT), including when associated with macular hole of diameter less than or \nequal to 400 microns. Currently available data on paediatric use are described in section 5.1. \n \nMethod of administration \nSingle use vial for intravitreal use only.  \n \nPreoperative antibiotic drops may be administered at the discretion of the treating ophthalmologist. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nThe intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which \ninclude the use of surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape, a sterile eyelid speculum \n(or equivalent) and the availability of sterile paracentesis (if required). The periocular skin, eyelid and \nocular surface should be disinfected and adequate anaesthesia and a broad spectrum topical \nmicrobiocide should be administered prior to the injection according to standard medical practice. \n \nOnly 0.1 mL of the total 0.3 mL solution in the vial should be administered. Any excess volume \nshould be expelled prior to injection in order to deliver a single dose of 0.1 mL containing 0.125 mg \nocriplasmin. For handling of the medicinal product, see section 6.6.  \n \nThe injection needle should be inserted 3.5-4.0 mm posterior to the limbus aiming towards the centre \nof the vitreous cavity avoiding the horizontal meridian. The injection volume of 0.1 mL is then \ndelivered into the mid-vitreous. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nActive or suspected ocular or periocular infections.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPost-injection monitoring \nJETREA is administered by intravitreal injection only. Intravitreal injections have been associated \nwith intraocular inflammation/infection, intraocular haemorrhage and increased intraocular pressure \n(IOP). Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used. Following the intravitreal injection, \npatients should be monitored for any side effects such as (but not limited to) intraocular \ninflammation/infection and elevation in IOP. Transient increases in IOP including transient blindness \nand non-perfusion of the optic nerve have been seen within 60 minutes of injection of JETREA. \nMonitoring for increases in IOP may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head \nimmediately after the injection and tonometry within 30 minutes following the injection. Intraocular \ninflammation/infection may be assessed using biomicroscopy between 2 and 7 days following the \ninjection. Patients should be instructed to report symptoms suggestive of intraocular \ninflammation/infection or any other visual or ocular symptoms without delay. If any of the above \nevents occur the patient should be treated according to standard medical practice. \n \nBilateral treatment \nThe safety and efficacy of JETREA administered to both eyes concurrently has not been studied. \nTherefore administration to both eyes concurrently is not recommended. \n \nRepeated administration \nRepeated administration of JETREA in the same eye has not been adequately studied and is therefore \nnot recommended. \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n \nPopulation with no or limited data \nJETREA has not been studied in patients with large diameter macular holes (> 400 microns), high \nmyopia (> 8 dioptre spherical correction or axial length > 28 mm), aphakia, history of rhegmatogenous \nretinal detachment, lens zonule instability, recent ocular surgery or intraocular injection (including \nlaser therapy), proliferative diabetic retinopathy, ischaemic retinopathies, retinal vein occlusions, \nexudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and vitreous haemorrhage. Treatment is not \nrecommended in such patients. \n \nThere is limited experience in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or history of uveitis \n(including active severe inflammation) or significant eye trauma. Caution should be exercised when \ntreating such patients.  \n \nOther \nThe potential for lens subluxation or phacodonesis cannot be ruled out. If this event occurs, it should \nbe treated according to standard medical practice. Patients should be monitored appropriately (see \nsection 4.8 and 5.3). \n \nThe effect of ocriplasmin (particularly in inducing resolution of vitreomacular adhesion or causing \ntotal posterior vitreous detachment [PVD]) is reduced in subjects with an epiretinal membrane (ERM) \nor a diameter of VMA > 1500 microns (see section 5.1).  \n \nThere is a risk for a significant decrease in visual acuity during the first week after the injection. \nPatients should be monitored appropriately (see section 4.8). \n \nOphthalmological examinations may be abnormal following the administration of JETREA. These \ninclude optical coherence tomography (OCT), ophthalmoscopy (foveal reflex), colour vision test \n(Roth 28-hue) and full-field ERG. This should be taken into consideration when using these tests for \nthe diagnosis or monitoring of other conditions (see section 4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal interaction studies have been performed. \n \nOcriplasmin is a proteolytic enzyme with serine protease activity which could be present in the eye for \nseveral days after intravitreal injection (see section 5.2). Administration in close temporal association \nwith other medicinal products in the same eye may affect the activity of both medicinal products and \nis therefore not recommended. \n \nThere are no clinical data on concomitant use of ocriplasmin with VEGF-inhibitors (vascular \nendothelial growth factor) and therefore it is not recommended.  \n \nNo systemic interactions are anticipated. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data for the use of JETREA in pregnant women. No reproductive toxicology studies have \nbeen performed. The systemic exposure of JETREA is expected to be very low after intravitreal \ninjection. JETREA should be used during pregnancy only if the clinical benefit outweighs the \npotential risks. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether JETREA is excreted in human milk. JETREA should be used during \nbreast-feeding only if the clinical benefit outweighs the potential risks. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nFertility \nThere are no data on the effect of JETREA on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe intravitreal injection of JETREA may have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use \nmachines due to possible temporary visual disturbances (see section 4.8). In these cases, patients \nshould not drive or use machines until the visual disturbances have resolved.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nOver 1400 patients have been treated with the recommended dose of 0.125 mg of JETREA in \ninterventional clinical studies.  \n \nAll adverse reactions were ocular. In 3 clinical studies with follow-up from 6 months (TG-MV-006 \nand TG-MV-007) to 24 months (TG-MV-014), the most commonly reported adverse reactions were \nvitreous floaters, eye pain, photopsia and chromatopsia as well as conjunctival haemorrhage resulting \nfrom the injection procedure. Most of the adverse reactions occurred within the first week after the \ninjection. The majority of these reactions were non-serious, mild to moderate in intensity and resolved \nwithin 2 to 3 weeks. Information on resolution of specific events such as chromatopsia and ERG \nchanges can be found in the relevant paragraph of the ‘description of selected adverse reactions’ \nsection. \n \nThe most clinically relevant adverse reactions included blindness transient, retinal tear, retinal \ndetachment, lens subluxation and macular hole progression. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following table summarises the adverse reactions reported in the treated eye in clinical studies \nand/or from post-marketing experience.  \n \nVisual symptoms perceived in the contralateral eye or bilaterally have also been reported. \n \nThe adverse reactions with a reasonable possibility of causal relationship to the injection procedure or \nJETREA are listed by MedDRA system organ class and frequency using the following convention: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nEye disorders Very common  \nVitreous floaters, eye pain, conjunctival haemorrhage, chromatopsia* \n \nCommon  \nVisual acuity reduced*, visual impairment1), visual field defect2), vision blurred, \nretinal haemorrhage, vitreous haemorrhage, macular hole*, macular degeneration, \nretinal degeneration, macular oedema3), retinal oedema4), retinal pigment \nepitheliopathy, metamorphopsia, conjunctival oedema, eyelid oedema, vitritis, \nanterior chamber cell, anterior chamber flare, iritis, photopsia, conjunctival \nhyperaemia, ocular hyperaemia, vitreous detachment, eye irritation, dry eye, \nforeign body sensation in eyes, eye pruritus, ocular discomfort, photophobia, \nlacrimation increased \n \nUncommon  \nBlindness transient, lens subluxation*, retinal tear*5), retinal detachment*5), night \nblindness, pupillary reflex impaired, diplopia, hyphaema, miosis, pupils unequal, \ncorneal abrasion, anterior chamber inflammation, eye inflammation, conjunctival \nirritation \n\nInvestigations Very common \nRetinogram abnormal*, colour vision test abnormal†  \n \nCommon \nIntraocular pressure increased, macular reflex abnormal, optical coherence \ntomography (OCT) abnormal* \n\n* see section ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ \n1) including dim vision \n2) including scotoma  \n3) including cystoid macular oedema \n4) including subretinal fluid \n5) events occurring pre-vitrectomy \n† using the Roth 28-hue colour vision test. See also section 4.4. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nVisual acuity reduced \nIn the placebo-controlled pivotal phase III studies (TG-MV-006 and TG-MV-007), 7.7% of JETREA \npatients and 1.6% of placebo patients had acute ≥ 2-line (≥ 10 ETDRS letters) loss in best-corrected \nvisual acuity (BCVA) during the first week after injection with no alternative explanation for the \nchange. The visual acuity decrease had resolved by the end of the studies for the majority of JETREA \npatients (80.6%) but there were some patients who had not recovered despite vitrectomy. The median \ntime to resolution was 22 days. \nIn study TG-MV-014, 2.8% of JETREA patients and 1.4% of sham patients had acute ≥ 2-line loss in \nBCVA during the first week after injection. Out of the 4 JETREA patients with acute visual acuity \ndecrease, 3 recovered following vitrectomy. See section 4.4 for monitoring recommendations. \n \nChromatopsia (including dyschromatopsia and colour vision test abnormal) \nColour vision alterations (including yellowish vision and abnormal Roth 28-hue colour vision test) \nhave been reported as a very common adverse reaction in patients injected with JETREA. The \nmajority of events were non-serious, mild and generally resolved spontaneously. The median time to \nresolution was 3 months. \n \nRetinogram abnormal \nElectroretinographic (ERG) changes (a- and b-wave amplitude decrease) have been reported as a very \ncommon adverse reaction in patients injected with JETREA; in the majority of cases visual \nimpairment and chromatopsia were also reported.  \nIn study TG-MV-014, a sub-set of 40 patients receiving JETREA systematically underwent ERG \ntesting; the ERG changes which had developed in 16 out of 40 patients resolved in the majority of \npatients (13 out of 16). The median time to resolution was 6 months. ERG changes were not predictive \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nof negative outcomes in terms of visual acuity; visual acuity improved or was maintained in 15 out \nof 16 patients compared to baseline. \n \nRetinal breaks (tears and detachment) \nIn the placebo-controlled pivotal phase III studies (TG-MV-006 and TG-MV-007), retinal breaks \n(tears and detachment) were reported in 1.9% of patients injected with JETREA vs. 4.3% injected with \nplacebo. Most of these events occurred during or after vitrectomy in both groups. The incidence of \nretinal detachment that occurred pre-vitrectomy was 0.4% in the JETREA group and none in the \nplacebo group, while the incidence of retinal tears (without detachment) that occurred pre-vitrectomy \nwas 0.2% in the JETREA group and 0.5% in the placebo group.  \nIn study TG-MV-014, retinal tear was reported in 1.4% of patients injected with JETREA and 6.8% of \nsham recipients; the incidence of retinal detachment was 1.4% in both arms. In the sham group, no \nevents occurred prior to vitrectomy. In the JETREA group, 1 patient (0.7%) developed retinal tear and \nretinal detachment between Day 0 and Day 7 post-injection. \n \nMacular hole \nIn the placebo-controlled pivotal phase III studies (TG-MV-006 and TG-MV-007), events of macular \nhole (including both progression and new onset) were reported for 6.7% of all patients injected with \nJETREA vs. 9.6% injected with placebo at Month 6.  \nIn study TG-MV-014, events of macular hole (including both progression and new onset) were \nreported in 15.8% JETREA vs. 13.5% sham recipients at Month 24. \nEarly progression rates of full-thickness macular hole (until Day 7 post-injection) at RPE (retinal \npigment epithelium) level were higher in the JETREA treated patients compared to sham or placebo. \nProgression rates after Month 6, however, were higher in sham or placebo than in those treated with \nJETREA. Any persistence or progression of macular hole should be treated according to usual \npractice. \n \nLens subluxation/phacodonesis \nOne case of lens subluxation/phacodonesis was reported in clinical studies in adults and appears to \nhave been possibly related to treatment with JETREA. In a paediatric study evaluating JETREA as an \nadjunct to vitrectomy, one case of subluxation was reported in a premature infant who received a \nsingle intravitreal injection of JETREA 0.175 mg. Lens subluxation was observed in 3 animal species \nat ocriplasmin concentrations above the intended clinical concentration (see section 5.3). \n \nBased on the proteolytic activity of ocriplasmin, preclinical and clinical findings, the potential for lens \nsubluxation or phacodonesis cannot be ruled out. If this event occurs, it should be treated according to \nstandard medical practice. \n \nOptical coherence tomography abnormal  \nIn study TG-MV-014, incomplete Inner Segment/Outer Segment (IS/OS) band, also referred to as \nEllipsoid Zone, in the central area was very common at baseline (65.8% in the JETREA group and \n62.2% in the sham group). However, after treatment, a higher proportion of patients in the JETREA \ngroup had a change from an intact IS/OS band at baseline to an incomplete IS/OS band in the central \narea at a later time point compared with the sham group (7.7% and 2.8%, respectively at Day 28). \nBeyond the central area, abnormal aspects of the IS/OS band attributed to JETREA have been \nobserved in up to 10% of patients.  \nEllipsoid Zone disruption within and outside the central area has been reported in non-interventional \nstudies and post-marketing reports. In the majority of cases recovery occurred within 6 months. \nSubretinal fluid and signs and symptoms of impaired photoreceptor function including decreased \nvisual acuity (in some cases severe) were reported in association with these events. \n \nSee section 4.4 for monitoring recommendations. Routine observation is recommended in all above \nsituations. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe clinical data on the effects of JETREA overdose are limited. One case of accidental overdose of \n0.250 mg ocriplasmin (twice the recommended dose) has been reported. The patient had a decrease in \nBCVA of 21 ETDRS letters from baseline that returned to within 9 letters of baseline at the end of the \nstudy. The patient also developed mild conjunctival hyperaemia, eye inflammation and miosis which \nresolved with corticosteroid eye drops. \n \nIf an overdose occurs, close monitoring is recommended. If an adverse reaction occurs, it should be \ntreated according to standard medical practice. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, Other ophthalmologicals, ATC code: S01XA22  \n \nMechanism of action \nOcriplasmin has a proteolytic activity against protein components of the vitreous body and the \nvitreoretinal interface (VRI) (e.g. laminin, fibronectin and collagen) and aims to dissolve the protein \nmatrix responsible for the abnormal vitreomacular adhesion (VMA). The tight binding of the protein \ncomponents within the macular area of the VRI contribute to vitreomacular traction (VMT), leading to \nvisual impairment and/or macular holes. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe clinical efficacy and safety of JETREA for the treatment of vitreomacular traction (VMT) was \nassessed in 3 double-masked studies. \n \nStudies TG-MV-006 and TG MV-007 \nThe efficacy of JETREA was demonstrated in 2 pivotal multicentre, randomised, double-masked, \nplacebo-controlled, 6-month studies in patients with VMT. A total of 652 patients (JETREA 464, \nplacebo 188) were randomised in these 2 studies.  \n \nIn both pivotal studies, the proportion of patients who achieved VMA resolution at Day 28 (primary \nendpoint) was significantly (p≤0.003) higher in the JETREA group compared with the placebo group. \nThe difference continued to be statistically significant through Month 6 in each study (p≤0.024). In the \nintegrated data, 26.5% in the JETREA group compared with 10.1% in the placebo group achieved \nVMA resolution at Day 28 (p<0.001). The difference was maintained from Day 7 through Month 6 \n(Figure 1). \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n \n\nFigure 1: Proportion of patients with VMA resolution up to Day 180 (Month 6) (TG-MV-006, \nTG-MV-007 and integrated data) \n\n \nPatients with no ERM at baseline were more likely to achieve VMA resolution at Day 28 compared \nwith those who had ERM at baseline. In the integrated data, the VMA resolution rate at Day 28 was \nhigher in patients treated with JETREA compared to placebo in both the subgroup without ERM \n(37.4% vs. 14.3%, p<0.001) and with ERM (8.7% vs. 1.5%, p=0.046). \n \nPatients with a smaller VMA diameter at baseline (≤ 1500 microns) were more likely to achieve VMA \nresolution at Day 28 compared with those who had a diameter > 1500 microns. In the integrated data, \nthe VMA resolution rate at Day 28 was higher in patients treated with JETREA compared to placebo \nin both the subgroup with VMA ≤ 1500 microns at baseline (34.7% vs. 14.6%, p<0.001) and with \nVMA > 1500 microns at baseline (5.9% vs. 0%, p=0.113). \n \nIn the integrated data, full-thickness macular hole (FTMH) was present at baseline in 106/464 (22.8%) \npatients and 47/188 (25%) patients in the JETREA and placebo groups, respectively. Of these, the \nproportion of patients who achieved FTMH closure without vitrectomy at Day 28 was higher in the \nJETREA group than the placebo group (40.6% vs. 10.6%, respectively; p<0.001). A difference was \nmaintained through the end of the studies (Month 6).  \n \nA significantly higher percentage of JETREA treated patients experienced total PVD at Day 28 \ncompared to placebo treated patients (integrated data: 13.4% vs. 3.7%, respectively; p<0.001).  \n \nDuring the studies, vitrectomy could be performed at the discretion of the Investigator. JETREA \ntreated patients were less likely to have had a vitrectomy by the end of the study (Month 6) compared \nwith placebo treated patients (integrated data: 17.7% vs. 26.6%, respectively; p=0.016). \n \nA higher proportion of JETREA treated patients gained ≥ 2 or ≥ 3 lines in BCVA (irrespective of \nvitrectomy) at Month 6 (28.0% and 12.3%, respectively) compared with patients treated with placebo \n(17.1% and 6.4%) (p=0.003 and p=0.024, respectively). Also the proportion of patients gaining ≥ 2 or \n≥ 3 lines in BCVA without vitrectomy favoured JETREA at Month 6 (23.7% vs. 11.2%, p<0.001 for a \ngain ≥ 2 lines and 9.7% vs. 3.7%, p=0.008 for a gain ≥ 3 lines). \n \nIn the integrated analysis of the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (VFQ-25), a \nnumerical difference in favour of JETREA over placebo was shown in each sub-scale score, as well as \nthe composite score. The difference for improvement in the general vision sub-scale score was \nstatistically significant (6.1 JETREA vs. 2.1 placebo, p=0.024). \n \n\n0%\n\n5%\n\n10%\n\n15%\n\n20%\n\n25%\n\n30%\n\n35%\n\n%\n V\n\nM\nA \n\nR\nes\n\nol\nut\n\nio\nn\n\nDays Post-Injection\n\nTG-MV-006\nJETREA\n\nTG-MV-007\nJETREA\n\nCombined\nJETREA\n\nTG-MV-006\nPlacebo\n\nTG-MV-007\nPlacebo\n\nCombined\nPlacebo\n\n7 14 28 90 180\n\nAt all post-injection days, p≤0.024 in TG-MV-006, p≤0.009 in TG-MV-007, p<0.001 \nin integrated data\n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nStudy TG-MV-014 \nThe efficacy of JETREA has been further confirmed in a randomised, double-masked, sham-\ncontrolled, 24-month study in patients with VMT finalised since the initial marketing authorisation \napproval. A total of 220 patients (JETREA 146, sham 74) were randomised in this study. \n \nThe proportion of patients who achieved VMA resolution at Day 28 (primary endpoint) was 41.7% in \nthe JETREA group compared with 6.2% in the sham group (p<0.001). This effect was maintained over \ntime and VMA resolution was consistently greater in the JETREA group at each post-injection study \nvisit compared with the sham group.  \n \nIn this study, FTMH was present at baseline in 50/145 (34.5%) and 26/73 (35.6%) patients in the \nJETREA and sham groups, respectively. Of these, 30% of JETREA treated patients and 15.4% of \npatients in the sham group experienced non-surgical FTMH closure at Month 24. All had done so by \nMonth 3. \n \nThe proportion of patients who underwent vitrectomy was smaller in the JETREA group than in the \nsham group at all visits. At Month 24, the proportions were 48/145 (33.3%) and 32/73 (43%), \nrespectively. The most common reason for performing vitrectomy was FTMH (in 24.8% JETREA \ntreated patients and 23.3 % sham patients). The proportion of patients who underwent vitrectomy for \nan event of VMA/VMT was 8.3% in the JETREA group compared to 19.2% in the sham group. \n \nThe proportion of patients who gained ≥ 2 or ≥ 3 lines in BCVA at Month 6, irrespective of \nvitrectomy, was slightly higher in the JETREA group (36.2%, 18.6%) than in the sham group (28.6%, \n13.1%). At Month 24, the proportion of patients with ≥ 2 lines improvement from baseline in BCVA \nwas greater in the JETREA group than in the sham group (50.5% vs. 39.1%). The proportion of \npatients with ≥3 lines improvement from baseline was only greater in the JETREA group (23.4% vs. \n12.8%, respectively) in the subgroup who had no FTMH at baseline. The ≥ 2 or ≥ 3 lines gain in \nBCVA without vitrectomy favoured JETREA over sham both at Month 6 (26.8%, 14.0%, vs. 15.62%, \n6.2%, respectively) and Month 24 (31.9%, 16.8%, vs. 11,7%, 4.1%, respectively).   \n \nA greater proportion of patients in the JETREA group had a ≥ 5 points improvement in VFQ-25 \ncomposite and sub-scale scores, irrespective of vitrectomy, at all visits. At Month 24, 51.4% of \nJETREA patients had a ≥ 5 points improvement in VFQ-25 composite score compared to 30.1% in the \nsham group. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nJETREA in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of vitreomacular traction (VMT), \nincluding when associated with macular hole of diameter less than or equal to 400 microns (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nThe safety and efficacy of ocriplasmin in paediatric subjects scheduled for vitrectomy was \ninvestigated in study TG-MV-009. A single intravitreal injection of 0.175 mg (above the \nrecommended dose), or placebo, was injected in the mid-vitreous of 24 eyes of children aged 0 to \n16 years, 30 to 60 minutes prior to the planned start of vitrectomy. The main reasons for vitrectomy \nwere retinal detachment and retinopathy of prematurity. Treatment with ocriplasmin did not \ndemonstrate an effect on posterior vitreous detachment rate, vitreous liquefaction grade, immediate \npostoperative retinal reattachment rate, development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy, or stage of \nretinopathy of prematurity. The safety findings observed in study TG-MV-009 were consistent with \nthe known safety profile for JETREA. Based on the results of this study, the use of JETREA as an \nadjunct to vitrectomy in children, to facilitate vitreous separation and removal, is not recommended. \n \nEthnicity \nExperience is limited in groups other than Caucasians. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nOcriplasmin levels in the vitreous decrease rapidly after intravitreal administration. In a clinical study \nin patients scheduled for vitrectomy receiving 0.125 mg JETREA (corresponding to a theoretical start \nconcentration of 29 µg/mL vitreous), mean ocriplasmin activity was 9% of theoretical start \nconcentration 2-4 hours after injection and below the lower level of quantification at 7 days.  \n \nBecause of the small dose administered (0.125 mg), detectable levels of ocriplasmin in systemic \ncirculation are not expected after intravitreal injection. \n \nWhen administered intravenously, ocriplasmin enters the endogenous protein catabolism pathway \nthrough which it is rapidly inactivated via its interactions with protease inhibitor α2-antiplasmin or \nα2-macroglobulin. The inactive ocriplasmin/α2-antiplasmin complex is cleared from the circulation \nwith a half-life (t1/2) of several hours.  \n \nRenal impairment \nNo studies have been conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of ocriplasmin in patients with renal \nimpairment since the systemic exposure is expected to be very low after intravitreal administration. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo studies have been conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of ocriplasmin in patients with \nhepatic impairment since the systemic exposure is expected to be very low after intravitreal \nadministration. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe intravitreal toxicity of ocriplasmin has been evaluated in rabbits, monkeys and minipigs. \nOcriplasmin induced an inflammatory response and transient ERG changes in rabbits and monkeys, \nwhile no inflammation or ERG changes were observed in minipigs. In rabbits and monkeys, the \nincidence of vitreous cell infiltrates tended to resolve over time. In monkeys, after administration of \n125 µg/eye (68 µg/mL vitreous) the ERG was fully recovered by Day 55. Lens subluxation was \nobserved in the 3 species at ocriplasmin concentrations at or above 41 µg/mL vitreous, a concentration \nabove the intended clinical concentration of 29 µg/mL. This effect appeared to be dose-related and \nwas observed in all animals administered intravitreal ocriplasmin more than once. Pathological \nchanges related to intraocular haemorrhage were observed in rabbits and monkeys. It remains unclear \nif this haemorrhage is related to the injection procedure itself or administration of ocriplasmin. No \nsystemic toxicity was observed after intravitreal administration of ocriplasmin. \n \nThe systemic toxicity of ocriplasmin has been evaluated in both rat and dog. Intravenous \nadministration of 10 mg/kg was generally well tolerated in both rat and dog whether administered as \nsingle dose or as repeated dose. \n \nNo carcinogenicity, mutagenicity or reproductive and developmental toxicity data are available.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n Package leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nJETREA 0.375 mg/0.3 mL solution for injection \nOcriplasmin \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Jetrea is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are given Jetrea \n3. How Jetrea is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How Jetrea is stored \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Jetrea is and what it is used for \n \nJetrea contains the active substance ocriplasmin.  \n \nJetrea is used to treat adults with an eye disease called vitreomacular traction (VMT), including when \nit is associated with a small hole in the macula (central part of the light-sensitive layer at the back of \nthe eye). \n \nVMT is caused by traction resulting from a persistent attachment of the vitreous humour (jelly-like \nmaterial in the back of the eye) to the macula. The macula provides central vision that is needed for \neveryday tasks such as driving, reading and recognising faces. VMT can cause symptoms such as \ndistorted or decreased vision. When the disease progresses the traction may eventually result in the \nformation of a hole in the macula (called a macular hole). \n \nJetrea works by separating the vitreous humour from the macula, and helping to close the macular hole \nif one is present, which may decrease the symptoms caused by VMT. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Jetrea \n \nYou must not be given Jetrea \n- if you are allergic to ocriplasmin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6);  \n- if you have (or suspect you may have) an infection in or around your eye. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor/ophthalmologist before you are given Jetrea. \n \nJetrea is given as an injection into the eye. Your doctor/ophthalmologist will monitor you in case you \ndevelop an infection or any complications after the injection. You should contact your \ndoctor/ophthalmologist immediately if you develop any of the eye symptoms described in section 4, \nafter an injection of Jetrea. \n \nYou will not be given Jetrea into both eyes at the same time.  \n \nYou will not be given Jetrea more than once into the same eye. \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n \nTell your doctor/ophthalmologist if you have or have had any eye conditions or eye treatments. Your \ndoctor/ophthalmologist will decide if treatment with Jetrea is right for you. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere is no relevant use of Jetrea in children and adolescents below 18 years old. The use of Jetrea is \ntherefore not recommended in this patient group.  \n \nOther medicines and Jetrea \nTell your doctor/ophthalmologist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Inform your doctor/ophthalmologist if you have had an injection of a medicine into the eye \nrecently. This information will be taken into account to evaluate if and when Jetrea can be injected \ninto the same eye.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nThere is no experience of using Jetrea in pregnant women or during breast-feeding. Jetrea should not \nbe used during pregnancy or breast-feeding unless your doctor/ophthalmologist thinks it is clearly \nnecessary. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a \nbaby, ask your doctor/ophthalmologist for advice before being given this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nAfter Jetrea treatment you may experience some decrease in vision for a limited amount of time. If this \nhappens, do not drive or use any tools or machines until your vision improves. \n \n \n3. How Jetrea is given \n \nJetrea must be given by a qualified ophthalmologist (eye specialist) who has experience in giving \ninjections into the eye. \n \nJetrea is given as a single injection into the affected eye. The recommended dose is 0.125 mg.  \n \nYour doctor/ophthalmologist may ask you to use antibiotic eye drops before and after the injection in \norder to prevent any possible eye infection. \n \nOn the day of the injection, your doctor/ophthalmologist will use antimicrobial eye drops and clean \nyour eye and eyelid carefully to prevent infection. Your doctor/ophthalmologist will also give you a \nlocal anaesthetic to prevent any pain from the injection.  \n \nAfter the injection, your doctor/ophthalmologist will monitor your vision.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor/ophthalmologist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nContact your doctor/ophthalmologist immediately if you develop any of the following symptoms \nafter injection of Jetrea. Your doctor/ophthalmologist will monitor you and take corrective measures if \nneeded. \n- A severe decrease in vision has been reported in up to 1 in 10 patients within one week after Jetrea \n\ntreatment.

The \ndiagnosis of vitreomacular traction (VMT) should comprise of a complete clinical picture including \npatient history, clinical examination and investigation using currently accepted diagnostic tools, such \nas optical coherence tomography (OCT). \n \nJETREA 0.375 mg/0.3 mL solution for injection is a ‘ready-diluted’ formulation, no further dilution is \nrequired. The recommended dose is 0.125 mg in 0.1 mL of the solution administered by intravitreal \ninjection to the affected eye once as a single dose. Each vial should only be used once and for the \ntreatment of a single eye. Treatment with Jetrea in the other eye is not recommended concurrently or \nwithin 7 days of the initial injection in order to monitor the post-injection course including the \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n28 \n \n\npotential for decreased vision in the injected eye. Repeated administration in the same eye is not \nrecommended. \n \nSee section 4.4 of the Summary of Product Characteristics for instructions on post-injection \nmonitoring. \n \nSingle use vial for intravitreal use only. \n \nPreoperative antibiotic drops may be administered at the discretion of the treating ophthalmologist.  \n \nThe intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which \ninclude the use of surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape, a sterile eyelid speculum \n(or equivalent) and the availability of sterile paracentesis (if required). The periocular skin, eyelid and \nocular surface should be disinfected and adequate anaesthesia and a broad spectrum topical \nmicrobiocide should be administered prior to the injection according to standard medical practice. \n \nOnly 0.1 mL of the total 0.3 mL solution in the vial should be administered. Any excess volume \nshould be expelled prior to injection in order to deliver a single dose of 0.1 mL containing 0.125 mg \nocriplasmin.  \n \nThe injection needle should be inserted 3.5-4.0 mm posterior to the limbus aiming towards the centre \nof the vitreous cavity avoiding the horizontal meridian. The injection volume of 0.1 mL is then \ndelivered into the mid-vitreous. \n \nInstructions for use \n \n1. Remove the vial from the freezer and allow to thaw at room temperature (takes about 2 minutes). \n2. Once completely thawed, remove the protective blue polypropylene flip-off cap from the vial \n\n(Figure 1). \n3. Disinfect the top of the vial with an alcohol wipe (Figure 2). \n4. Visually inspect the vial for particulate matter. Only a clear, colourless solution without visible \n\nparticles should be used. \n5. Using aseptic technique, withdraw all of the solution using an appropriate sterile needle (slightly \n\nincline the vial to ease withdrawal) (Figure 3) and discard the needle after withdrawal of the vial \ncontents. Do not use this needle for the intravitreal injection. \n\n6. Replace the needle with an appropriate sterile needle, carefully expel the excess volume from the \nsyringe by slowly depressing the plunger so that the plunger tip aligns with the 0.1 mL line on the \nsyringe (corresponding to 0.125 mg ocriplasmin) (Figure 4). \n\n7. Inject 0.1 mL of the solution immediately into the mid-vitreous.  \n8. Discard the vial and any unused portion of the solution after single use.  \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nJETREA  \n0.375 mg/0.3 mL \n\nsolution for injection \n \n\nJETREA  \n0.375 mg/0.3 mL \n\nsolution for injection \n \n\nJETREA \n0.375 mg/0.3 mL \n\nsolution for injection \n \n\nJETREA \n0.375 mg/0.3 mL \n\nsolution for injection \n \n\n  \n  \n\nFigure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 \n \nInformation about storage \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and on the carton after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a freezer (-20 °C ± 5 °C). \n \nAfter thawing \nThe unopened vial in the original carton protected from light may be stored in a refrigerator \n(2 °C to 8 °C) for up to 1 week.
