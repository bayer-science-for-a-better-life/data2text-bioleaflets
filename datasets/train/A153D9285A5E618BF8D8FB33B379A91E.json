PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nParsabiv is indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in adult patients with \nchronic kidney disease (CKD) on haemodialysis therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended initial dose of etelcalcetide is 5 mg administered by bolus injection 3 times per \nweek. Corrected serum calcium should be at or above the lower limit of the normal range prior to \nadministration of first dose of Parsabiv, a dose increase, or reinitiation after a dose stop (see also dose \nadjustments based on serum calcium levels). Parsabiv should not be administered more frequently than \n3 times per week. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDose titration \n \nParsabiv should be titrated so that doses are individualised between 2.5 mg and 15 mg. The dose may \nbe increased in 2.5 mg or 5 mg increments no more frequently than every 4 weeks to a maximum dose \nof 15 mg 3 times per week to achieve the desired parathyroid hormone (PTH) target. \n \nDose adjustments based on PTH levels \n \nPTH should be measured after 4 weeks from initiation or dose adjustment of Parsabiv, and \napproximately every 1-3 months during maintenance. Dose adjustment may be necessary at any time \nduring treatment including the maintenance phase. \n \nIf PTH is below 100 pg/mL (10.6 pmol/L), the dose should be reduced or temporarily stopped. If PTH \ndoes not return to > 100 pg/mL following dose reduction, the dose should be stopped. For patients in \nwhom the dose is stopped, Parsabiv should be reinitiated at a lower dose once PTH returns to \n> 150 pg/mL (15.9 pmol/L) and pre-dialysis serum corrected calcium (cCa) \u2265 8.3 mg/dL \n(2.08 mmol/L). If the patient\u2019s last administered dose was 2.5 mg, Parsabiv may be reinitiated at the \n2.5 mg dose level if PTH is > 300 pg/mL (31.8 pmol/L), and the most recent pre-dialysis serum cCa \n\u2265 8.3 mg/dL (2.08 mmol/L). \n \nAdditional recommendations related to the management of low calcium are provided in the table \nbelow. \n \nParsabiv may be used as part of a therapeutic regimen including phosphate binders and/or vitamin D \nsterols, as appropriate (see section 5.1). \n \nMissed doses \n \nIf a regularly scheduled haemodialysis treatment is missed, do not administer any missed doses. \nParsabiv should be administered at the next haemodialysis treatment at the same dose. If doses are \nmissed for more than 2 weeks, then Parsabiv should be administered at 5 mg, (or 2.5 mg if that was \nthe patient\u2019s last administered dose), and titrated to achieve the desired PTH. \n \nDose adjustments based on serum calcium levels \n \nSerum calcium should be measured within 1 week of initiation or dose adjustment of Parsabiv. Once \nthe maintenance phase has been established for a patient, corrected serum calcium should be measured \napproximately every 4 weeks. In the studies total serum calcium was measured using Roche modular \nanalysers. The lower limit of the normal range for corrected serum calcium was 8.3 mg/dL \n(2.08 mmol/L). Other laboratory assays may have different cut-offs for the lower limit of the normal \nrange. \n \nIn the event that clinically meaningful decreases in corrected serum calcium levels below the lower \nlimit of the normal range occur and/or symptoms of hypocalcaemia occur, the following management \nis recommended: \n \n\nCorrected serum calcium \nvalue or clinical symptoms of \nhypocalcaemia*:  \n\nRecommendations \n\n< 8.3 mg/dL (2.08 mmol/L) and \n\u2265 7.5 mg/dL (1.88 mmol/L)  \n\n\uf0b7 If clinically indicated: \n- start or increase calcium supplements, calcium-\n\ncontaining phosphate binders, and/or vitamin D \nsterols. \n\n- increase dialysate calcium concentration. \n- consider reducing Parsabiv dose. \n\n\n\n4 \n\nCorrected serum calcium \nvalue or clinical symptoms of \nhypocalcaemia*:  \n\nRecommendations \n\n< 7.5 mg/dL (1.88 mmol/L) or \nsymptoms of hypocalcaemia  \n\n\uf0b7 Stop Parsabiv until corrected serum calcium levels are \n\u2265 8.3 mg/dL (2.08mmol/L) and symptoms of \nhypocalcaemia (if present) have resolved. \n\n\uf0b7 If clinically indicated: \n- start or increase calcium supplements, calcium-\n\ncontaining phosphate binders, and/or vitamin D \nsterols. \n\n- increase dialysate calcium concentration. \n\uf0b7 Reinitiate Parsabiv at a dose 5 mg lower than the last \n\nadministered dose. If patient\u2019s last administered dose was \n2.5 mg or 5 mg, reinitiate at 2.5 mg once corrected serum \ncalcium levels are \u2265 8.3 mg/dL (2.08 mmol/L) and \nsymptoms of hypocalcaemia (if present) have resolved.\n\n* Total calcium was measured using Roche modular analyser. For albumin levels < 4.0 g/dL cCa (mg/dL) = \nTotal Ca (mg/dL) + (4 - albumin[g/dL])*0.8. \n \nSwitch from cinacalcet to Parsabiv \n \nParsabiv should not be initiated in patients until 7 days after the last dose of cinacalcet and the \ncorrected serum calcium is at or above the lower limit of the normal range (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of etelcalcetide in children and adolescents less than 18 years has not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nElderly \n \nDosing recommendations for elderly patients are the same as for adult patients. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nParsabiv should not be diluted. \n \nParenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and change in colour \nprior to administration. \n \nParsabiv is administered into the venous line of the dialysis circuit at the end of the haemodialysis \ntreatment during rinse-back or intravenously after rinse-back. When given during rinse-back at least \n150 mL of rinse-back volume should be administered after injection. If rinse-back is completed and \nParsabiv was not administered, then it may be administered intravenously followed by at least 10 mL \nsaline flush volume. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nParsabiv should not be initiated if corrected serum calcium is less than the lower limit of the normal \nrange (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypocalcaemia \n \nParsabiv treatment should not be initiated in patients if the corrected serum calcium is less than the \nlower limit of the normal range (see section 4.3). \n \nPotential manifestations of hypocalcaemia include paraesthesias, myalgias, muscle spasm and \nseizures. \n \nSince etelcalcetide lowers serum calcium, patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they \nexperience symptoms of hypocalcaemia and should be monitored for the occurrence of hypocalcaemia \n(see section 4.2). Serum calcium levels should be measured prior to initiating treatment, within 1 week \nof initiation or dose adjustment of Parsabiv and every 4 weeks during treatment. If clinically \nmeaningful decreases in corrected serum calcium levels occur, steps should be taken to increase serum \ncalcium levels (see section 4.2). \n \nVentricular arrhythmia and QT prolongation secondary to hypocalcaemia \n \nDecreases in serum calcium can prolong the QT interval, potentially resulting in ventricular \narrhythmia (see section 4.8). Serum calcium levels should be closely monitored in patients with \ncongenital long QT syndrome, previous history of QT prolongation, family history of long QT \nsyndrome or sudden cardiac death and other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and \nventricular arrhythmia while being treated with Parsabiv. \n \nConvulsions \n \nCases of seizures have been reported in patients treated with Parsabiv (see section 4.8). The threshold \nfor seizures may be lowered by significant reductions in serum calcium levels. Serum calcium levels \nshould be closely monitored in patients with a history of a convulsion disorder while being treated \nwith Parsabiv. \n \nWorsening heart failure \n \nDecreased myocardial performance, hypotension, and congestive heart failure (CHF) may be \nassociated with significant reductions in serum calcium levels. Serum calcium levels should be \nmonitored in patients with a history of congestive heart failure while being treated with Parsabiv (see \nsection 4.2), which may be associated with reductions in serum calcium levels. \n \nCo-administration with other medicinal products \n \nAdminister Parsabiv with caution in patients receiving any other medicinal products known to lower \nserum calcium. Closely monitor serum calcium (see section 4.5). \n \nPatients receiving Parsabiv should not be given cinacalcet. Concurrent administration may result in \nsevere hypocalcaemia. \n \nAdynamic bone \n \nAdynamic bone may develop if PTH levels are chronically suppressed below 100 pg/mL. If PTH \nlevels decrease below the recommended target range, the dose of vitamin D sterols and/or Parsabiv \nshould be reduced or therapy discontinued. After discontinuation, therapy can be resumed at a lower \ndose to maintain PTH in the target range (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nImmunogenicity \n \nIn clinical studies, 7.1% of patients with SHPT treated with Parsabiv for up to 6 months tested positive \nfor binding antibodies. 80.3% of these had pre-existing antibodies. No evidence of altered \npharmacokinetic profile, clinical response or safety profile was associated with pre-existing or \ndeveloping anti-etelcalcetide antibodies. If formation of anti-etelcalcetide antibodies with a clinically \nsignificant effect is suspected, contact the Marketing Authorisation Holder to discuss antibody testing. \nContact details are provided in section 6 of the package leaflet. \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nParsabiv contains less than 1 mmol sodium per vial, that is to say essentially sodium-free. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. There is no known risk of pharmacokinetic interaction \nwith etelcalcetide. \n \nIn vitro, etelcalcetide did not inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes and was itself not a substrate for \nmetabolism by CYP450 enzymes. In vitro, etelcalcetide was not a substrate of efflux and uptake \ntransporter proteins; and etelcalcetide was not an inhibitor of common transporter proteins. \n \nConcurrent administration of other medicinal products known to reduce serum calcium and Parsabiv \nmay result in an increased risk of hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4). Patients receiving Parsabiv should \nnot be given cinacalcet (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of etelcalcetide in pregnant women. Animal \nstudies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see \nsection 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Parsabiv during \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether etelcalcetide is present in human milk. Available data in rats have shown that \netelcalcetide is excreted in milk (see section 5.3). \n \nA risk to breastfed newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to \ndiscontinue breast-feeding or discontinue/abstain from Parsabiv therapy taking into account the benefit \nof breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nNo data are available on the effect of etelcalcetide on human fertility. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nParsabiv has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, certain \npotential manifestations of hypocalcaemia may affect the ability to drive and use machines (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nVery common side effects with Parsabiv are blood calcium decreased, muscle spasms, diarrhoea, \nnausea, and vomiting. They were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature in the majority of \npatients. Discontinuation of therapy as a result of undesirable effects was mainly due to low blood \ncalcium, nausea, and vomiting. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below using the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10); common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare \n(< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 1.

In the combined placebo-controlled studies, a higher proportion of patients in the \nParsabiv group compared with patients in the placebo group developed at least one serum cCa value \n< 7.0 mg/dL (1.75 mmol/L) (7.6% Parsabiv; 3.1% placebo), < 7.5 mg/dL (1.88 mmol/L) (27.1% \nParsabiv; 5.5% placebo), and < 8.3 mg/dL (2.08 mmol/L) (78.6% Parsabiv; 19.4% placebo). In these \nstudies 1% of patients in the Parsabiv group and 0% of patients in the placebo group discontinued \ntreatment due to the adverse event of low serum calcium. For further information regarding potential \n\n\n\n8 \n\nmanifestations of hypocalcaemia and serum calcium monitoring please see sections 4.4 and 4.2 \nrespectively. \n \nQTc prolongation secondary to hypocalcaemia \n \nIn the combined placebo-controlled studies, a higher percentage of patients in the Parsabiv group \ncompared with the placebo group had a maximum increase from baseline of > 60 msec in the QTcF \ninterval (1.2% Parsabiv; 0% placebo). The patient incidence of maximum post-baseline pre-dialysis \nQTcF > 500 msec in the Parsabiv and placebo groups was 4.8% and 1.9%, respectively. \n \nWorsening heart failure \n \nIn the combined placebo-controlled studies, the subject incidence of adjudicated CHF events requiring \nhospitalisation was 2.2% in the Parsabiv treatment group compared to 1.2% in the placebo group. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose of etelcalcetide may lead to hypocalcaemia with or without clinical symptoms and may \nrequire treatment. In the event of overdose, serum calcium should be checked and patients should be \nmonitored for symptoms of hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4) and appropriate measures should be taken \n(see section 4.2). Although Parsabiv is cleared by dialysis, haemodialysis has not been studied as a \ntreatment for overdose. Single doses up to 60 mg and multiple doses up to 22.5 mg 3 times a week at \nthe end of dialysis in patients receiving haemodialysis were safely administered in clinical trials. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Calcium homeostasis, anti-parathyroid agents. ATC code: H05BX04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe calcium-sensing receptor on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal \nregulator of PTH secretion. Etelcalcetide is a synthetic peptide calcimimetic agent which reduces PTH \nsecretion through binding and activation of the calcium-sensing receptor. The reduction in PTH is \nassociated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium and phosphate levels. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nFollowing a single intravenous bolus administration of 5 mg etelcalcetide, PTH levels decreased \nrapidly within 30 minutes post-dose and were maximally decreased for 1 hour, before returning to \nbaseline. The extent and duration of the reduction in PTH increased with increasing dose. Reduction in \nPTH levels correlated with plasma etelcalcetide concentrations in haemodialysis patients. The effect of \nreducing PTH levels was maintained throughout the 6-month dosing period when etelcalcetide was \nadministered by intravenous bolus 3 times a week. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nPlacebo-controlled studies \n \nTwo 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted in SHPT patients with \nCKD receiving haemodialysis 3 times per week (n = 1,023). Patients were administered Parsabiv or \nplacebo at a starting dose of 5 mg 3 times per week at the end of haemodialysis and titrated every \n4 weeks through week 17 to a maximum dose of 15 mg 3 times per week to achieve target PTH level \n\u2264 300 pg/mL. The median average weekly dose of Parsabiv during the efficacy assessment period \n(EAP) was 20.4 mg (6.8 mg per administration). Patients with lower screening PTH levels typically \nrequired lower doses (median average weekly doses of 15.0 mg, 21.4 mg, 27.1 mg, respectively, for \npatients with screening PTH levels < 600 pg/mL, 600 to \u2264 1,000 pg/mL, and > 1,000 pg/mL). Patients \nwere maintained on dialysate calcium concentration \u2265 2.25 meq/L. \n \nThe primary endpoint in each study was the proportion of patients with > 30% reduction from baseline \nin PTH during the EAP (EAP, defined as weeks 20 to 27 inclusive). The secondary endpoints were the \nproportion of patients with a mean PTH \u2264 300 pg/mL during the EAP, and percent change from \nbaseline during the EAP for PTH, serum cCa, phosphate and calcium phosphate product (Ca x P). \n \nDemographic and baseline characteristics between the two groups in each study were similar. The \nmean age of patients across the 2 studies was 58.2 (range 21 to 93) years. Mean (SE) baseline PTH \nconcentrations across the 2 studies were 846.9 (21.8) pg/mL, and 835.9 (21.0) pg/mL for the Parsabiv \nand placebo groups, respectively with approximately 21% of subjects enrolling across both studies \nhaving baseline PTH > 1,000 pg/mL. The average duration of haemodialysis prior to study entry was \n5.4 years and 68% of patients were receiving vitamin D sterols at study entry, with 83% receiving \nphosphate binders. \n \nBoth studies demonstrated that Parsabiv reduced PTH, while lowering calcium, phosphate and Ca x P. \nResults of all primary and secondary endpoints were statistically significant and the results were \nconsistent across both studies as shown in table 2. \n \nTable 2.

Patients with lower screening PTH levels were more likely to reach \nPTH \u2264 300 pg/mL during EAP. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nParsabiv was associated with reductions in bone metabolism markers (bone specific alkaline \nphosphatase and type I collagen c-telopeptide) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (exploratory endpoints) \nat the end of the study (week 27), compared with placebo. \n \nActive-controlled study \n \nA 6-month, double-blind, active-controlled study compared the efficacy and safety of Parsabiv with \ncinacalcet in 683 SHPT patients with CKD on haemodialysis. The dosing regimen for Parsabiv was \nsimilar to that in the placebo-controlled studies (starting dose of 5 mg titrated every 4 weeks with \n2.5 mg to 5 mg increments to a maximum of 15 mg 3 times a week). The starting dose of cinacalcet \nwas 30 mg daily, titrated every 4 weeks in 30 mg increments or 60 mg for the last uptitration to a \nmaximum dose of 180 mg daily following the cinacalcet prescribing information. The median average \nweekly dose of Parsabiv during the EAP was 15.0 mg (5.0 mg per administration) and of cinacalcet \nwas 360.0 mg (51.4 mg per administration). The primary endpoint was non-inferiority for the \nproportion of patients who achieved > 30% reduction from baseline in mean PTH during the EAP \n(weeks 20 to 27). Key secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved > 50% and \n> 30% reductions from baseline in mean PTH during the EAP and the mean number of days of \nvomiting or nausea per week in the first 8 weeks, sequentially tested for superiority. Mean (SE) \nbaseline PTH concentrations were 1,092.12 (33.8) and 1,138.71 (38.2) pg/mL for the Parsabiv and \ncinacalcet groups respectively. Demographics and other baseline characteristics were similar to the \nplacebo-controlled studies. \n \nParsabiv was non-inferior to cinacalcet for the primary endpoint, and was superior to cinacalcet for the \nsecondary endpoints of proportion of patients achieving > 30% reduction from baseline in mean PTH \nduring the EAP (68.2% Parsabiv versus 57.7% cinacalcet; p = 0.004); and proportion of patients \nachieving > 50% reduction from baseline in mean PTH during the EAP (52.4% Parsabiv versus 40.2% \ncinacalcet; p = 0.001). No statistically significant difference between the two groups was observed for \nthe secondary endpoint evaluating the mean number of days of vomiting or nausea per week in the \nfirst 8 weeks. \n \n\u201cSwitch study\u201d \n \nResults from a study which evaluated changes in corrected serum calcium levels when switching \npatients from cinacalcet to Parsabiv showed that treatment with Parsabiv, at a starting dose of 5 mg, \ncould be safely initiated after a 7-day discontinuation of cinacalcet, provided that the corrected serum \ncalcium was \u2265 8.3 mg/dL (2.08 mmol/L). \n \nOpen-label extension study \n \nA 52-week, single arm extension study to the placebo-controlled and \u201cswitch\u201d studies described above \nwas conducted to characterise the long term safety and efficacy of Parsabiv in 891 SHPT patients with \nCKD on haemodialysis. All subjects received Parsabiv at a starting dose of 5 mg 3 times a week. The \ndose of Parsabiv could be titrated at weeks 5, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, and 49 to a maximum dose of 15 mg to \nachieve target PTH levels \u2264 300 pg/mL while maintaining serum cCa concentrations. \n \nAt the end of 52 weeks, Parsabiv was not associated with any new safety findings and demonstrated \nmaintenance of treatment effect as evidenced by a decrease in pre-dialysis PTH by > 30% from \nbaseline in 2/3rd of patients. In addition, Parsabiv decreased pre-dialysis PTH to \u2264 300 pg/mL in more \nthan 50% of patients and decreased mean PTH, cCa, cCa x P, and phosphate from baseline. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nParsabiv in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of hyperparathyroidism \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \n \nIn the population pharmacokinetics model, volume of distribution at steady-state was approximately \n796 L. Etelcalcetide is predominately bound to plasma albumin by reversible covalent binding. Non-\ncovalent binding of etelcalcetide to plasma proteins is low with a fraction unbound ratio of 0.53. The \nratio of blood-to-plasma [14C]-etelcalcetide concentrations is approximately 0.6. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nEtelcalcetide is not metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. Etelcalcetide is biotransformed in blood by \nreversible disulphide exchange with endogenous thiols to predominantly form conjugate with serum \nalbumin. The plasma exposure of biotransformation products was approximately 5-fold higher than \nthat of etelcalcetide and their concentration-time course parallels that of etelcalcetide. The \npredominant biotransformation product (albumin bound) was minimally active in vitro. \n \nElimination \n \nIntravenous administration 3 times per week at the end of a haemodialysis session resulted in an \neffective half-life of 3 to 5 days. Etelcalcetide is rapidly cleared in subjects with normal renal function, \nwhilst in CKD patients requiring haemodialysis, etelcalcetide was predominantly eliminated by \nhaemodialysis. Etelcalcetide was efficiently removed with a haemodialysis clearance value of \n7.66 L/hour. Following a single radiolabelled dose of etelcalcetide in CKD patients with secondary \nHPT receiving haemodialysis, approximately 60% of dosed [14C]-etelcalcetide was recovered in \ndialysate and approximately 7% recovered in urine and faeces combined over 175 days of collection \nperiod. The inter-subject variability of the system clearance in the patient population is approximately \n70%. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of etelcalcetide is linear and does not change over time following single (5 to \n60 mg) and multiple intravenous doses (2.5 to 20 mg) in CKD patients with secondary HPT receiving \nhaemodialysis. Following 3 times a week intravenous dosing at the end of each 3 to 4 hour \nhaemodialysis session in CKD patients, etelcalcetide plasma levels reached near steady-state 4 weeks \nafter dosing with an observed accumulation ratio of 2- to 3-fold. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo specific pharmacokinetic studies of etelcalcetide have been conducted in patients with mild to \nsevere kidney impairment. The pharmacokinetics of etelcalcetide was characterised in CKD patients \nreceiving haemodialysis. Etelcalcetide is intended for CKD patients receiving haemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo specific study in patients with hepatic impairment was performed. \n \nBody weight, gender, age, race \n \nNo body weight, gender, age, or race-related pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in adult \npatients studied. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe expected pharmacological effect of decreased PTH and calcium in blood were observed in animal \nstudies at clinical exposure levels. Reductions in serum calcium associated with tremoring, \n\n\n\n12 \n\nconvulsions and stress-related findings were observed at clinical exposure levels. All effects were \nreversible upon cessation of treatment. \n \nEtelcalcetide was mutagenic in some strains of bacteria (Ames), however was not genotoxic in in vitro \nand in vivo mammalian genotoxicity assays and therefore is considered non-genotoxic in humans. In \nmouse and rat carcinogenicity studies, there were no etelcalcetide-related tumours up to exposure of \n0.4-fold clinical exposure levels. \n \nThere was no effect on male or female fertility when etelcalcetide was administered to rats at exposure \nlevels up to 1.8-fold higher than clinical exposures levels achieved in patients receiving etelcalcetide \nat 15 mg three times per week. \n \nThere were no effects on embryo-foetal development in rats and rabbits when exposed to up to 1.8 to \n4.3 times clinical exposure levels during organogenesis. In a pre- and post-natal development study in \nrats there was a minimal increase in perinatal pup mortality, delay in parturition and transient \nreductions in post-natal growth associated with maternal toxicities of hypocalcaemia, tremoring, and \nreductions in body weight and food consumption at 1.8 times clinical exposure levels. \n \nStudies in rats showed [14C]-etelcalcetide was excreted in the milk at concentrations similar to plasma. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n28 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nParsabiv 2.5 mg solution for injection \nParsabiv 5 mg solution for injection \n\nParsabiv 10 mg solution for injection \netelcalcetide \n\n \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Parsabiv is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Parsabiv \n3. How to use Parsabiv \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Parsabiv \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Parsabiv is and what it is used for \n \nParsabiv contains the active substance etelcalcetide, which reduces parathyroid hormone known as \nPTH. \n \nParsabiv is used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with serious kidney disease who \nneed haemodialysis to clear their blood of waste products. \n \nIn secondary hyperparathyroidism too much PTH is produced by the parathyroid glands (four small \nglands in the neck). \u201cSecondary\u201d means that the hyperparathyroidism is caused by another condition, \ne.g. kidney disease. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can cause the loss of calcium from the bones, \nwhich can lead to bone pain and fractures and problems with blood and heart vessels. By controlling \nthe levels of PTH, Parsabiv helps to control calcium and phosphate in your body. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Parsabiv \n \nDo not use Parsabiv if you are allergic to etelcalcetide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n(listed in section 6). \n \nDo not use Parsabiv if you have very low levels of calcium in your blood. Your doctor will monitor \nyour blood calcium levels. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nBefore you are given Parsabiv, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had: \n\uf0b7 heart problems, such as heart failure or arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythm); \n\uf0b7 seizures (fits or convulsions). \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nParsabiv reduces calcium levels. Please tell your doctor if you have spasms, twitches, or cramps in \nyour muscles, or numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth or seizures, \nconfusion or loss of consciousness while being treated with Parsabiv. For additional information see \nsection 4. \n \nLow calcium levels can cause abnormal heart rhythm. Tell your doctor if you experience an unusually \nfast or pounding heartbeat, if you have heart rhythm problems or heart failure or if you take medicines \nthat can cause heart rhythm problems, while receiving Parsabiv. For additional information see \nsection 4. \n \nVery low levels of PTH over long periods can result in a type of abnormal bone structure known as \nadynamic bone which can only be diagnosed by biopsy. Your PTH levels will be monitored during \ntreatment with Parsabiv and your dose of Parsabiv may be reduced if your PTH levels become very \nlow. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nIt is not known whether Parsabiv is safe and effective in children less than 18 years of age as it has not \nbeen studied in these patients. \n \nOther medicines and Parsabiv \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including \nthose medicines obtained without a prescription, or any other medicines that lower serum calcium. \n \nYou should not receive Parsabiv together with cinacalcet. Tell your doctor if you are taking cinacalcet \nor have recently taken cinacalcet. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nParsabiv has not been tested in pregnant women. It is not known whether Parsabiv can harm your \nunborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or plan to get pregnant \nwhen taking Parsabiv. You and your doctor should decide if you should use Parsabiv. \n \nIt is not known whether Parsabiv can pass into breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding \nor plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to \nstop taking Parsabiv, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Parsabiv \nto the mother. \n \nDriving and using machines \nParsabiv has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However certain \nsymptoms of low calcium levels (such as fits or convulsions) can affect your ability to drive or operate \nmachinery. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Parsabiv \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Parsabiv \n \nThe recommended starting dose for Parsabiv is 5 mg. It will be given by a doctor or nurse at the end of \nyour haemodialysis treatment through the tube (bloodline) that connects you to the haemodialysis \nmachine. Parsabiv will be given 3 times per week. The dose may be increased up to 15 mg or lowered \ndown to 2.5 mg depending on your response. \n \nYou may need to take calcium and vitamin D supplements while being treated with Parsabiv. Your \ndoctor will discuss this with you. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf you start to get numbness or tingling around your mouth or in your extremities, muscle aches or \ncramps and seizures (fits), you should tell your doctor immediately. These may be signs that your \ncalcium levels are too low (hypocalcaemia). \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 Nausea \n\uf0b7 Vomiting \n\uf0b7 Diarrhoea \n\uf0b7 Muscle spasms \n\uf0b7 Low calcium levels in blood with no symptoms \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 Low calcium levels in blood with symptoms such as tingling around the mouth or in the \n\nextremities, muscle aches or cramps and seizures (fits) \n\uf0b7 High potassium levels in blood \n\uf0b7 Low phosphate levels in blood \n\uf0b7 Headache \n\uf0b7 Numbness or tingling sensation \n\uf0b7 Worsening heart failure \n\uf0b7 Disturbances in the heart\u2019s electrical activity seen as QT prolongation on electrocardiogram \n\uf0b7 Low blood pressure \n\uf0b7 Muscle pain \n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\uf0b7 Seizures (fits or convulsions); for additional information see section 2 \n \nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data \n\uf0b7 Allergic reactions (including anaphylactic reactions) \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n \n5.

known as pth. parsabiv is used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with serious kidney disease who need haemodialysis to clear their blood of waste products. in secondary hyperparathyroidism too much pth is produced by the parathyroid glands (four small glands in the neck). \"secondary\" means that the hyperparathyroidism is caused by another condition, e.g. kidney disease. secondary hyperparathyroidism can cause the loss of calcium from the bones, which can lead to bone pain and fractures and problems with blood and heart vessels. by controlling the levels of pth, parsabiv helps to control calcium and phosphate in your body.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "parsabiv", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "the active

monitor your blood calcium levels. warnings and precautions before you are given parsabiv, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had: heart problems, such as heart failure or arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythm); seizures (fits or convulsions). parsabiv reduces calcium levels. please tell your doctor if you have spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles, or numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth or seizures, confusion or loss of consciousness while being treated with parsabiv. for additional information see section 4. low calcium levels can cause abnormal heart rhythm. tell your doctor if you experience an unusually fast or pounding heartbeat, if you have heart rhythm problems or heart failure or if you take medicines that can cause heart rhythm problems, while receiving parsabiv. for additional information see section 4. very low levels of pth over long periods can result in a type of abnormal bone structure known as adynamic bone which can only be diagnosed by biopsy. your pth levels will be monitored during treatment with parsabiv and your dose of parsabiv may be reduced if your pth levels become very low. children and adolescents it is not known whether parsabiv is safe and effective in children less than 18 years of age as it has not been studied in these patients. other medicines and parsabiv tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including those medicines obtained without a prescription, or any other medicines that lower serum calcium. you should not receive parsabiv together with cinacalcet. tell your doctor if you are taking cinacalcet or have recently taken cinacalcet. pregnancy and breast-feeding parsabiv has not been tested in pregnant women. it is not known whether parsabiv can harm your unborn baby. tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or plan to get pregnant when taking parsabiv. you and your doctor should decide if you should use parsabiv. it is not known whether parsabiv can pass into breast milk. tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking parsabiv, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of parsabiv to the mother. driving and using machines parsabiv has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. however certain symptoms of low calcium levels (such as fits or convulsions) can affect your ability to drive or operate machinery.
