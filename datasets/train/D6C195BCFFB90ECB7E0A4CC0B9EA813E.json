NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRivastigmine Teva 1.5 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains rivastigmine hydrogen tartrate corresponding to rivastigmine 1.5 mg \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule \n \nWhite cap imprinted with \u201cR\u201d & white body imprinted with \u201c1.5\u201d \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. \nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia or dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Diagnosis should \nbe made according to current guidelines. Therapy with rivastigmine should only be started if a \ncaregiver is available who will regularly monitor intake of the medicinal product by the patient. \n \nRivastigmine should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals. The capsules \nshould be swallowed whole.  \n \nInitial dose:  \n1.5 mg twice a day. \n \nDose titration  \nThe starting dose is 1.5 mg twice a day. If the dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of \ntreatment, the dose may be increased to 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then \n6 mg twice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered \nafter a minimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level.   \n \nIf adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or loss of appetite), weight decrease or \nworsening of extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. tremor) in patients with dementia associated with \nParkinson\u2019s disease are observed during treatment, these may respond to omitting one or more doses. \nIf adverse reactions persist, the daily dose should be temporarily reduced to the previous well-tolerated \ndose or the treatment may be discontinued. \n\n 2\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nMaintenance dose  \nThe effective dose is 3 to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should \nbe maintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg \ntwice a day. \nMaintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists. \nTherefore, the clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis, especially for \npatients treated at doses less than 3 mg twice a day. If after 3 months of maintenance dose treatment \nthe patient\u2019s rate of decline in dementia symptoms is not altered favourably, the treatment should be \ndiscontinued.  Discontinuation should also be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect is no \nlonger present. \n \nIndividual response to rivastigmine cannot be predicted. However a greater treatment effect was seen \nin Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with moderate dementia. Similarly a larger effect was observed in \nParkinson\u2019s disease patients with visual hallucinations (see section 5.1).  \n \nTreatment effect has not been studied in placebo-controlled trials beyond 6 months. \n \nRe-initiation of therapy:  \nIf treatment is interrupted for more than several days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. \nDose titration should then be carried out as described above. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment:  \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment, \nHowever, due to increased exposure in these populations dosing recommendations to titrate according \nto individual tolerability should be closely followed as patients with clinically significant renal or \nhepatic impairment might experience more adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied (see section 4.4).  \n \nChildren:  \nRivastigmine is not recommended for use in children. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nThe use of this medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with \n- hypersensitivity to the active substance, other carbamate derivatives or to any of the excipients \n\nused in the formulation, \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with higher doses. If treatment is \ninterrupted for more than several days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily to reduce the \npossibility of adverse reactions (e.g. vomiting).  \n \nDose titration: Adverse reactions (e.g. hypertension and hallucinations in patients with Alzheimer's \ndementia and worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms, in particular tremor, in patients with dementia \nassociated with Parkinson's disease) have been observed shortly after dose increase. They may respond \nto a dose reduction. In other cases, rivastigmine has been discontinued (see section 4.8).  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur \nparticularly when initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse \nreactions occur more commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration \nresulting from prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose \nreduction or discontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with \nserious outcomes. \n \n\n 3\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nPatients with Alzheimer's disease may lose weight. Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, \nhave been associated with weight loss in these patients. During therapy patient's weight should be \nmonitored.  \n \nIn case of severe vomiting associated with rivastigmine treatment, appropriate dose adjustments as \nrecommended in section 4.2 must be made. Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with \noesophageal rupture (see section 4.8). Such events appeared to occur particularly after dose increments \nor high doses of rivastigmine.  \n \nCare must be taken when using rivastigmine in patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction \ndefects (sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular block) (see section 4.8).  \n \nRivastigmine may cause increased gastric acid secretions. Care should be exercised in treating patients \nwith active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions.  \n \nCholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or \nobstructive pulmonary disease.  \n \nCholinomimetics may induce or exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Caution is recommended \nin treating patients predisposed to such diseases.  \n \nThe use of rivastigmine in patients with severe dementia of Alzheimer's disease or associated with \nParkinson's disease, other types of dementia or other types of memory impairment (e.g. age-related \ncognitive decline) has not been investigated and therefore use in these patient populations is not \nrecommended. \n \nLike other cholinomimetics, rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. \nWorsening (including bradykinesia, dyskinesia, gait abnormality) and an increased incidence or \nseverity of tremor have been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease \n(see section 4.8). These events led to the discontinuation of rivastigmine in some cases (e.g. \ndiscontinuations due to tremor 1.7 % on rivastigmine vs 0 % on placebo). Clinical monitoring is \nrecommended for these adverse reactions. \n \nSpecial Populations \nPatients with clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment might experience more adverse \nreactions (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. \nHowever, Rivastigmine Teva may be used in this patient population and close monitoring is necessary. \n \nPatients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be more \nlikely to discontinue due to adverse reactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAs a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle \nrelaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible \ndose adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed. \n \nIn view of its pharmacodynamic effects, rivastigmine should not be given concomitantly with other \ncholinomimetic substances and might interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medicinal products.  \n \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam \nor fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is \nnot affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were \nobserved following concomitant administration of digoxin and rivastigmine.  \n \nAccording to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, \nalthough rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances.  \n\n 4\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor rivastigmine no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. No effects on fertility or \nembryofoetal development were observed in rats and rabbits, except at doses related to maternal \ntoxicity. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an increased gestation time was observed. Rivastigmine \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.  \n \nIn animals, rivastigmine is excreted into milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human \nmilk. Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAlzheimer's disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability \nto use machinery. Furthermore, rivastigmine can induce dizziness and somnolence, mainly when \ninitiating treatment or increasing the dose. As a consequence, rivastigmine has minor or moderate \ninfluence on the ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, the ability of patients with dementia on \nrivastigmine to continue driving or operating complex machines should be routinely evaluated by the \ntreating physician. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38 %) and \nvomiting (23 %), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be more \nsusceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss.  \n \nThe following adverse reactions, listed below in Table 1, have been accumulated in patients with \nAlzheimer's dementia treated with rivastigmine.  \n \nAdverse reactions in Table 1 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency \ncategory. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 1  \n \nInfections and infestations  \n\nVery rare Urinary infection \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \n\nVery common Anorexia \n\nNot known Dehydration \n\nPsychiatric disorders  \n\nCommon Agitation \n\nCommon Confusion \n\nCommon Anxiety \n\nUncommon Insomnia \n\nUncommon Depression \n\nVery rare Hallucinations \n\nNot known Aggression, restlessness \n\n 5\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nNervous system disorders  \n\nVery common Dizziness \n\nCommon Headache \n\nCommon Somnolence \n\nCommon Tremor \n\nUncommon Syncope \n\nRare Seizures \n\nVery rare Extrapyramidal symptoms (including worsening of \nParkinson's disease) \n\nCardiac disorders  \n\nRare Angina pectoris \n\nVery rare Cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. bradycardia, atrio-ventricular block, \natrial fibrillation and tachycardia) \n\nNot known Sick sinus syndrome \n\nVascular Disorders  \n\nVery rare Hypertension \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\nVery common Nausea \n\nVery common Vomiting \n\nVery common Diarrhoea \n\nCommon Abdominal pain and dyspepsia \n\nRare Gastric and duodenal ulcers \n\nVery rare Gastrointestinal haemorrhage \n\nVery rare Pancreatitis \n\nNot known Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with \noesophageal rupture (see section 4.4). \n\nHepatobiliary disorders  \n\nUncommon Elevated liver function tests \n\nNot known Hepatitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n \n\nCommon Hyperhydrosis \n\nRare Rash \n\nNot known Pruritus \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n \n\nCommon Fatigue and asthenia \n\nCommon Malaise \n\nUncommon Fall \n\n 6\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nInvestigations  \n\nCommon Weight loss \n\n \nTable 2 shows the adverse reactions reported in patients with dementia associated with Parkison\u2019s \ndisease treated with rivastigmine.   \n \nTable 2 \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \n\nCommon Anorexia \n\nCommon Dehydration \n\nPsychiatric disorders  \n\nCommon Insomnia \n\nCommon Anxiety \n\nCommon Restlessness \n\nNot known Aggression \n\nNervous system disorders  \n\nVery common Tremor \n\nCommon Dizziness \n\nCommon Somnolence \n\nCommon Headache \n\nCommon Worsening of Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\nCommon Bradykinesia \n\nCommon Dyskinesia \n\nUncommon Dystonia \n\nCardiac disorders  \n\nCommon Bradycardia \n\nUncommon Atrial fibrillation \n\nUncommon Atrioventricular block \n\nNot known Sick sinus syndrome \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\nVery common Nausea \n\nVery common Vomiting \n\nCommon Diarrhoea \n\nCommon Abdominal pain and dyspepsia \n\nCommon Salivary hypersecretion \n\nHepatobiliary disorders  \n\nNot known  Hepatitis \n\n 7\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n \n\nCommon Hyperhydrosis \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\n \n\nCommon Muscle rigidity \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n \n\nCommon Fatigue and asthenia \n\nCommon Gait abnormality \n\n \nTable 3 lists the number and percentage of patients from the specific 24-week clinical study conducted \nwith rivastigmine in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease with pre-defined \nadverse events that may reflect worsening of parkinsonian symptoms.  \n \nTable 3 \n \nPre-defined adverse events that may reflect \nworsening of parkinsonian symptoms in \npatients with dementia associated with \nParkinson's disease \n\nRivastigmine \n \nn (%) \n\nPlacebo \n \nn (%) \n\nTotal patients studied 362 (100) 179 (100) \n\nTotal patients with pre-defined AE(s) 99 (27.3) 28 (15.6) \n\nTremor 37 (10.2) 7 (3.9) \n\nFall 21 (5.8) 11 (6.1) \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease (worsening) 12 (3.3) 2 (1.1) \n\nSalivary hypersecretion 5 (1.4) 0 \n\nDyskinesia 5 (1.4) 1 (0.6) \n\nParkinsonism 8 (2.2) 1 (0.6) \n\nHypokinesia 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nMovement disorder 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nBradykinesia 9 (2.5) 3 (1.7) \n\nDystonia 3 (0.8) 1 (0.6) \n\nGait abnormality 5 (1.4) 0 \n\nMuscle rigidity 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nBalance disorder 3 (0.8) 2 (1.1) \n\nMusculoskeletal stiffness 3 (0.8) 0 \n\nRigors 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nMotor dysfunction 1 (0.3) 0 \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n\n 8\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nMost cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and \nalmost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment. Where symptoms have \noccurred, they have included nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, hypertension or hallucinations. Due to \nthe known vagotonic effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on heart rate, bradycardia and/or syncope may \nalso occur. Ingestion of 46 mg occurred in one case; following conservative management the patient \nfully recovered within 24 hours. \n \nTreatment \nAs rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition \nof about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose of \nrivastigmine should be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea \nand vomiting, the use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse \nreactions should be given as necessary. \n \nIn massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate \nis recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote \nis not recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03 \n \nRivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to \nfacilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by \nfunctionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on \ncholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease and \nParkinson's disease. \n  \nRivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that \ntemporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases \nacetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40 % within the first 1.5 hours after \nadministration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum \ninhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF \nby rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6  mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. Inhibition \nof butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by rivastigmine was similar \nto that of AChE. \n \nClinical studies in Alzheimer's dementia \nThe efficacy of rivastigmine has been established through the use of three independent, domain \nspecific, assessment tools which were assessed at periodic intervals during 6 month treatment periods. \nThese include the ADAS-Cog (a performance based measure of cognition), the CIBIC-Plus (a \ncomprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician incorporating caregiver input), and \nthe PDS (a caregiver-rated assessment of the activities of daily living including personal hygiene, \nfeeding, dressing, household chores such as shopping, retention of ability to orient oneself to \nsurroundings as well as involvement in activities relating to finances, etc.). \n \nThe patients studied had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score of 10 \u2013 24. \n \nThe results for clinically relevant responders pooled from two flexible dose studies out of the three \npivotal 26-week multicentre studies in patients with mild-to-moderately severe Alzheimer's Dementia, \nare provided in Table 4 below. Clinically relevant improvement in these studies was defined a priori as \nat least 4-point improvement on the ADAS-Cog, improvement on the CIBIC-Plus, or at least a 10 % \nimprovement on the PDS. \n\n 9\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nIn addition, a post-hoc definition of response is provided in the same table. The secondary definition \nof response required a 4-point or greater improvement on the ADAS-Cog, no worsening on the \nCIBIC-Plus, and no worsening on the PDS. The mean actual daily dose for responders in the 6\u201312 mg \ngroup, corresponding to this definition, was 9.3 mg. It is important to note that the scales used in this \nindication vary and direct comparisons of results for different therapeutic agents are not valid. \n \nTable 4 \n \n Patients with Clinically Significant Response (%) \n\n Intent to Treat Last Observation Carried \nForward \n\nResponse Measure Rivastigmine \n6\u201312 mg \nN=473 \n\nPlacebo \nN=472 \n\nRivastigmine \n6\u201312 mg \nN=379 \n\nPlacebo \nN=444 \n\nADAS-Cog: improvement of at \nleast 4 points \n\n21*** 12 25*** 12 \n\nCIBIC-Plus: improvement 29*** 18 32*** 19 \n\nPDS: improvement of at least \n10% \n\n26*** 17 30*** 18 \n\nAt least 4 points improvement \non ADAS-Cog with no \nworsening on CIBIC-Plus and \nPDS \n\n10* 6 12** 6 \n\n*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 \n \nClinical studies in dementia associated with Parkinson's disease \nThe efficacy of rivastigmine in dementia associated with Parkinson's disease has been demonstrated in \na 24-week multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled core study and its 24-week open-label \nextension phase. Patients involved in this study had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score \nof 10 \u2013 24. Efficacy has been established by the use of two independent scales which were assessed at \nregular intervals during a 6-month treatment period as shown in Table 5 below: the ADAS-Cog, a \nmeasure of cognition, and the global measure ADCS-CGIC (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-\nClinician's Global Impression of Change). \n \nTable 5 \n \nDementia associated \nwith Parkinson's Disease \n\nADAS-Cog \nRivastigmine \n\nADAS-Cog \nPlacebo \n\nADCS-CGIC \nRivastigmine \n\nADCS-CGIC \nPlacebo \n\nITT + RDO population (n=329) (n=161) (n=329) (n=165) \n\nMean baseline \u00b1 SD 23.8\u00b110.2 24.3\u00b110.5 n/a n/a \n\nMean change at 24 weeks \n\u00b1 SD \n\n2.1\u00b18.2 -0.7\u00b17.5 3.8\u00b11.4 4.3\u00b11.5 \n\nAdjusted treatment \ndifference \n\n2.881 n/a \n\np-value versus placebo <0.0011 0.0072 \n\nITT - LOCF population (n=287) (n=154) (n=289) (n=158) \n\nMean baseline \u00b1 SD 24.0\u00b110.3 24.5\u00b110.6 n/a n/a \n\nMean change at 24 weeks \n\u00b1 SD \n\n2.5\u00b18.4 -0.8\u00b17.5 3.7\u00b11.4 4.3\u00b11.5 \n\nAdjusted treatment 3.541 n/a \n\n 10\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\ndifference \n\np-value versus placebo <0.0011 <0.0012 \n1 Based on ANCOVA with treatment and country as factors and baseline ADAS-Cog as a covariate.

Peak plasma concentrations are reached in \napproximately 1 hour. As a consequence of rivastigmine\u2019s interaction with its target enzyme, the \nincrease in bioavailability is about 1.5-fold greater than that expected from the increase in dose. \nAbsolute bioavailability after a 3 mg dose is about 36 % \u00b1 13 %. Administration of rivastigmine with \nfood delays absorption (tmax) by 90 min and lowers Cmax and increases AUC by approximately 30 %.  \n \nDistribution  \nProtein binding of rivastigmine is approximately 40 %. It readily crosses the blood brain barrier and \nhas an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8 \u2013 2.7 l/kg. \n \n\n 11\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nMetabolism \nRivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised (half-life in plasma approximately 1 hour), \nprimarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite. In vitro, this \nmetabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (<10 %). Based on evidence from in vitro \nand animal studies the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine \nmetabolism. Total plasma clearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 l/h after a 0.2 mg \nintravenous dose and decreased to 70 l/h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose. \n \nExcretion \nUnchanged rivastigmine is not found in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route \nof elimination. Following administration of 14C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and \nessentially complete (>90 %) within 24 hours. Less than 1 % of the administered dose is excreted in \nthe faeces. There is no accumulation of rivastigmine or the decarbamylated metabolite in patients with \nAlzheimer's disease. \n \nElderly subjects  \nWhile bioavailability of rivastigmine is greater in elderly than in young healthy volunteers, studies in \nAlzheimer patients aged between 50 and 92 years showed no change in bioavailability with age. \n \nSubjects with hepatic impairment  \nThe Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60 % higher and the AUC of rivastigmine was more than \ntwice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects. \n \nSubjects with renal impairment  \nCmax and AUC of rivastigmine were more than twice as high in subjects with moderate renal \nimpairment compared with healthy subjects; however there were no changes in Cmax and AUC of \nrivastigmine in subjects with severe renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, mice and dogs revealed only effects associated with an \nexaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. No safety margins to \nhuman exposure were achieved in the animal studies due to the sensitivity of the animal models used.  \n \nRivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a \nchromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose 104 times the maximum \nclinical exposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. \n \nNo evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in mice and rats at the maximum tolerated dose, \nalthough the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was lower than the human exposure. When \nnormalised to body surface area, the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was approximately \nequivalent to the maximum recommended human dose of 12 mg/day; however, when compared to the \nmaximum human dose, a multiple of approximately 6-fold was achieved in animals. \n \nIn animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats \nand rabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRivastigmine Teva 3 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains rivastigmine hydrogen tartrate corresponding to rivastigmine 3 mg \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule \n \nFlesh colour cap imprinted with \u201cR\u201d & flesh color body imprinted with \u201c3\u201d \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. \nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia or dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Diagnosis should \nbe made according to current guidelines. Therapy with rivastigmine should only be started if a \ncaregiver is available who will regularly monitor intake of the medicinal product by the patient. \n \nRivastigmine should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals. The capsules \nshould be swallowed whole.  \n \nInitial dose \n1.5 mg twice a day. \n \nDose titration \nThe starting dose is 1.5 mg twice a day. If the dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of \ntreatment, the dose may be increased to 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then \n6 mg twice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered \nafter a minimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level. \n \nIf adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or loss of appetite), weight decrease or \nworsening of extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. tremor) in patients with dementia associated with \nParkinson\u2019s disease are observed during treatment, these may respond to omitting one or more doses. \nIf adverse reactions persist, the daily dose should be temporarily reduced to the previous well-tolerated \ndose or the treatment may be discontinued. \n \nMaintenance dose \nThe effective dose is 3 to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should \nbe maintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg \ntwice a day. \nMaintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists. \nTherefore, the clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis, especially for \n\n 15\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\npatients treated at doses less than 3 mg twice a day. If after 3 months of maintenance dose treatment \nthe patient\u2019s rate of decline in dementia symptoms is not altered favourably, the treatment should be \ndiscontinued.  Discontinuation should also be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect is no \nlonger present. \n \nIndividual response to rivastigmine cannot be predicted. However a greater treatment effect was seen \nin Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with moderate dementia. Similarly a larger effect was observed in \nParkinson\u2019s disease patients with visual hallucinations (see section 5.1).  \n \nTreatment effect has not been studied in placebo-controlled trials beyond 6 months. \n \nRe-initiation of therapy  \nIf treatment is interrupted for more than several days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. \nDose titration should then be carried out as described above. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment  \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment. \nHowever, due to increased exposure in these populations dosing recommendations to titrate according \nto individual tolerability should be closely followed as patients with clinically significant renal or \nhepatic impairment might experience more adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied (see section 4.4)  \n \nChildren  \nRivastigmine is not recommended for use in children. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nThe use of this medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with \n\n- hypersensitivity to the active substance, other carbamate derivatives or to any of the excipients \nused in the formulation, \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with higher doses. If treatment is \ninterrupted for more than several days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily to reduce the \npossibility of adverse reactions (e.g. vomiting).  \n \nDose titration: Adverse reactions (e.g. hypertension and hallucinations in patients with Alzheimer's \ndementia and worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms, in particular tremor, in patients with dementia \nassociated with Parkinson's disease) have been observed shortly after dose increase. They may respond \nto a dose reduction. In other cases, rivastigmine has been discontinued (see section 4.8).  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur \nparticularly when initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse \nreactions occur more commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration \nresulting from prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose \nreduction or discontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with \nserious outcomes. \n \nPatients with Alzheimer's disease may lose weight. Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, \nhave been associated with weight loss in these patients. During therapy patient's weight should be \nmonitored.  \n \nIn case of severe vomiting associated with rivastigmine treatment, appropriate dose adjustments as \nrecommended in section 4.2 must be made. Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with \n\n 16\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\noesophageal rupture (see section 4.8). Such events appeared to occur particularly after dose increments \nor high doses of rivastigmine.  \n \nCare must be taken when using rivastigmine in patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction \ndefects (sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular block) (see section 4.8).  \n \nRivastigmine may cause increased gastric acid secretions. Care should be exercised in treating patients \nwith active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions.  \nCholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or \nobstructive pulmonary disease.  \n \nCholinomimetics may induce or exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Caution is recommended \nin treating patients predisposed to such diseases.  \n \nThe use of rivastigmine in patients with severe dementia of Alzheimer's disease or associated with \nParkinson's disease, other types of dementia or other types of memory impairment (e.g. age-related \ncognitive decline) has not been investigated and therefore use in these patient populations is not \nrecommended.  \n  \nLike other cholinomimetics, rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. \nWorsening (including bradykinesia, dyskinesia, gait abnormality) and an increased incidence or \nseverity of tremor have been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease \n(see section 4.8). These events led to the discontinuation of rivastigmine in some cases (e.g. \ndiscontinuations due to tremor 1.7 % on rivastigmine vs 0 % on placebo). Clinical monitoring is \nrecommended for these adverse reactions. \n \nSpecial Populations \nPatients with clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment might experience more adverse \nreactions (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. \nHowever, Rivastigmine Teva may be used in this patient population and close monitoring is necessary. \n \nPatients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be more \nlikely to discontinue due to adverse reactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAs a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle \nrelaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recomemended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible \ndose adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed.  \n \nIn view of its pharmacodynamic effects, rivastigmine should not be given concomitantly with other \ncholinomimetic substances and might interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medicinal products.  \n \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam \nor fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is \nnot affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were \nobserved following concomitant administration of digoxin and rivastigmine.  \n \nAccording to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, \nalthough rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor rivastigmine no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. No effects on fertility or \nembryofoetal development were observed in rats and rabbits, except at doses related to maternal \ntoxicity. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an increased gestation time was observed. Rivastigmine \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.  \n\n 17\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nIn animals, rivastigmine is excreted into milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human \nmilk. Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAlzheimer's disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability \nto use machinery. Furthermore, rivastigmine can induce dizziness and somnolence, mainly when \ninitiating treatment or increasing the dose. As a consequence, rivastigmine has minor or moderate \ninfluence on the ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, the ability of patients with dementia on \nrivastigmine to continue driving or operating complex machines should be routinely evaluated by the \ntreating physician. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38 %) and \nvomiting (23 %), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be more \nsusceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss.  \n \nThe following adverse reactions, listed below in Table 1, have been accumulated in patients with \nAlzheimer's dementia treated with rivastigmine.  \n \nAdverse reactions in Table 1 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency \ncategory. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 1 * \n \nInfections and infestations  \n\nVery rare Urinary infection \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \n\nVery common Anorexia \n\nNot known Dehydration \n\nPsychiatric disorders  \n\nCommon Agitation \n\nCommon Confusion \n\nCommon Anxiety \n\nUncommon Insomnia \n\nUncommon Depression \n\nVery rare Hallucinations \n\nNot known Aggression, restlessness \n\nNervous system disorders  \n\nVery common Dizziness \n\nCommon Headache \n\nCommon Somnolence \n\n 18\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nCommon Tremor \n\nUncommon Syncope \n\nRare Seizures \n\nVery rare Extrapyramidal symptoms (including worsening of \nParkinson's disease) \n\nCardiac disorders  \n\nRare Angina pectoris \n\nVery rare Cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. bradycardia, atrio-ventricular block, \natrial fibrillation and tachycardia) \n\nNot known  Sick sinus syndrome \n\nVascular Disorders  \n\nVery rare Hypertension \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\nVery common Nausea \n\nVery common Vomiting \n\nVery common Diarrhoea \n\nCommon Abdominal pain and dyspepsia \n\nRare Gastric and duodenal ulcers \n\nVery rare Gastrointestinal haemorrhage \n\nVery rare Pancreatitis \n\nNot known Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with \noesophageal rupture (see section 4.4). \n\nHepatobiliary disorders  \n\nUncommon Elevated liver function tests \n\nNot known Hepatitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n \n\nCommon Hyperhydrosis \n\nRare Rash \n\nNot known Pruritus \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n \n\nCommon Fatigue and asthenia \n\nCommon Malaise \n\nUncommon Fall \n\nInvestigations  \n\nCommon Weight loss \n\n \nTable 2 shows the adverse reactions reported in patients with dementia associated with Parkison\u2019s \ndisease treated with rivastigmine.   \n\n 19\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nTable 2 \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \n\nCommon Anorexia \n\nCommon Dehydration \n\nPsychiatric disorders  \n\nCommon Insomnia \n\nCommon Anxiety \n\nCommon Restlessness \n\nNot known Aggression \n\nNervous system disorders  \n\nVery common Tremor \n\nCommon Dizziness \n\nCommon Somnolence \n\nCommon Headache \n\nCommon Worsening of Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\nCommon Bradykinesia \n\nCommon Dyskinesia \n\nUncommon Dystonia \n\nCardiac disorders  \n\nCommon Bradycardia \n\nUncommon Atrial fibrillation \n\nUncommon Atrioventricular block \n\nNot known Sick sinus syndrome \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\nVery common Nausea \n\nVery common Vomiting \n\nCommon Diarrhoea \n\nCommon Abdominal pain and dyspepsia \n\nCommon Salivary hypersecretion \n\nHepatobililary disorders  \n\nNot known Heptatitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n \n\nCommon Hyperhydrosis \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\n \n\n 20\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nCommon Muscle rigidity \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n \n\nCommon Fatigue and asthenia \n\nCommon Gait abnormality \n\n \nTable 3 lists the number and percentage of patients from the specific 24-week clinical study conducted \nwith rivastigmine in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease with pre-defined \nadverse events that may reflect worsening of parkinsonian symptoms.  \n \nTable 3 \n \nPre-defined adverse events that may reflect \nworsening of parkinsonian symptoms in \npatients with dementia associated with \nParkinson's disease \n\nRivastigmine \n \nn (%) \n\nPlacebo \n \nn (%) \n\nTotal patients studied 362 (100) 179 (100) \n\nTotal patients with pre-defined AE(s) 99 (27.3) 28 (15.6) \n\nTremor 37 (10.2) 7 (3.9) \n\nFall 21 (5.8) 11 (6.1) \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease (worsening) 12 (3.3) 2 (1.1) \n\nSalivary hypersecretion 5 (1.4) 0 \n\nDyskinesia 5 (1.4) 1 (0.6) \n\nParkinsonism 8 (2.2) 1 (0.6) \n\nHypokinesia 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nMovement disorder 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nBradykinesia 9 (2.5) 3 (1.7) \n\nDystonia 3 (0.8) 1 (0.6) \n\nGait abnormality 5 (1.4) 0 \n\nMuscle rigidity 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nBalance disorder 3 (0.8) 2 (1.1) \n\nMusculoskeletal stiffness 3 (0.8) 0 \n\nRigors 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nMotor dysfunction 1 (0.3) 0 \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms  \nMost cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and \nalmost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment.

Ingestion of 46 mg occurred in one case; following conservative management the patient \nfully recovered within 24 hours. \n\n 21\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nTreatment  \nAs rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition \nof about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose of \nrivastigmine should be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea \nand vomiting, the use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse \nreactions should be given as necessary. \n \nIn massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate \nis recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote \nis not recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03 \n \nRivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to \nfacilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by \nfunctionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on \ncholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease and \nParkinson's disease. \n  \nRivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that \ntemporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases \nacetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40 % within the first 1.5 hours after \nadministration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum \ninhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF \nby rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. Inhibition \nof butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by rivastigmine was similar \nto that of AChE. \n \nClinical studies in Alzheimer's dementia \nThe efficacy of rivastigmine has been established through the use of three independent, domain \nspecific, assessment tools which were assessed at periodic intervals during 6 month treatment periods. \nThese include the ADAS-Cog (a performance based measure of cognition), the CIBIC-Plus (a \ncomprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician incorporating caregiver input), and \nthe PDS (a caregiver-rated assessment of the activities of daily living including personal hygiene, \nfeeding, dressing, household chores such as shopping, retention of ability to orient oneself to \nsurroundings as well as involvement in activities relating to finances, etc.). \n \nThe patients studied had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score of 10 \u2013 24. \n \nThe results for clinically relevant responders pooled from two flexible dose studies out of the three \npivotal 26-week multicentre studies in patients with mild-to-moderately severe Alzheimer's Dementia, \nare provided in Table 4 below. Clinically relevant improvement in these studies was defined a priori as \nat least 4-point improvement on the ADAS-Cog, improvement on the CIBIC-Plus, or at least a 10 % \nimprovement on the PDS. \n \nIn addition, a post-hoc definition of response is provided in the same table. The secondary definition \nof response required a 4-point or greater improvement on the ADAS-Cog, no worsening on the \nCIBIC-Plus, and no worsening on the PDS. The mean actual daily dose for responders in the 6\u201312 mg \ngroup, corresponding to this definition, was 9.3 mg. It is important to note that the scales used in this \nindication vary and direct comparisons of results for different therapeutic agents are not valid. \n\n 22\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nTable 4 \n \n Patients with Clinically Significant Response (%) \n\n Intent to Treat Last Observation Carried \nForward \n\nResponse Measure Rivastigmine \n6\u201312 mg \nN=473 \n\nPlacebo \nN=472 \n\nRivastigmine \n6\u201312 mg \nN=379 \n\nPlacebo \nN=444 \n\nADAS-Cog: improvement of at \nleast 4 points \n\n21*** 12 25*** 12 \n\nCIBIC-Plus: improvement 29*** 18 32*** 19 \n\nPDS: improvement of at least \n10% \n\n26*** 17 30*** 18 \n\nAt least 4 points improvement \non ADAS-Cog with no \nworsening on CIBIC-Plus and \nPDS \n\n10* 6 12** 6 \n\n*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 \n \nClinical studies in dementia associated with Parkinson's disease \nThe efficacy of rivastigmine in dementia associated with Parkinson's disease has been demonstrated in \na 24-week multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled core study and its 24-week open-label \nextension phase.

Peak plasma concentrations are reached in \napproximately 1 hour. As a consequence of rivastigmine\u2019s interaction with its target enzyme, the \nincrease in bioavailability is about 1.5-fold greater than that expected from the increase in dose. \nAbsolute bioavailability after a 3 mg dose is about 36 %\u00b113 %. Administration of rivastigmine with \nfood delays absorption (tmax) by 90 min and lowers Cmax and increases AUC by approximately 30 %.  \n \nDistribution:  \nProtein binding of rivastigmine is approximately 40 %. It readily crosses the blood brain barrier and \nhas an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8 \u2013 2.7 l/kg. \n \nMetabolism: \nRivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised (half-life in plasma approximately 1 hour), \nprimarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite. In vitro, this \nmetabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (<10 %). Based on evidence from in vitro \nand animal studies the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine \nmetabolism. Total plasma clearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 l/h after a 0.2 mg \nintravenous dose and decreased to 70 l/h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose. \n\n 24\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nExcretion:  \nUnchanged rivastigmine is not found in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route \nof elimination. Following administration of 14C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and \nessentially complete (>90 %) within 24 hours. Less than 1 % of the administered dose is excreted in \nthe faeces. There is no accumulation of rivastigmine or the decarbamylated metabolite in patients with \nAlzheimer's disease. \n \nElderly subjects:  \nWhile bioavailability of rivastigmine is greater in elderly than in young healthy volunteers, studies in \nAlzheimer patients aged between 50 and 92 years showed no change in bioavailability with age. \n \nSubjects with hepatic impairment:  \nThe Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60 % higher and the AUC of rivastigmine was more than \ntwice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects. \n \nSubjects with renal impairment:  \nCmax and AUC of rivastigmine were more than twice as high in subjects with moderate renal \nimpairment compared with healthy subjects; however there were no changes in Cmax and AUC of \nrivastigmine in subjects with severe renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, mice and dogs revealed only effects associated with an \nexaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. No safety margins to \nhuman exposure were achieved in the animal studies due to the sensitivity of the animal models used.  \n \nRivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a \nchromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose 104 times the maximum \nclinical exposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. \n \nNo evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in mice and rats at the maximum tolerated dose, \nalthough the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was lower than the human exposure. When \nnormalised to body surface area, the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was approximately \nequivalent to the maximum recommended human dose of 12 mg/day; however, when compared to the \nmaximum human dose, a multiple of approximately 6-fold was achieved in animals. \n \nIn animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats \nand rabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. \nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia or dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Diagnosis should \nbe made according to current guidelines. Therapy with rivastigmine should only be started if a \ncaregiver is available who will regularly monitor intake of the medicinal product by the patient. \n \nRivastigmine should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals. The capsules \nshould be swallowed whole.  \n \nInitial dose:  \n1.5 mg twice a day. \n \nDose titration:  \nThe starting dose is 1.5 mg twice a day. If the dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of \ntreatment, the dose may be increased to 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then \n6 mg twice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered \nafter a minimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level. \n \nIf adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or loss of appetite), weight decrease or \nworsening of extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. tremor) in patients with dementia associated with \nParkinson\u2019s disease are observed during treatment, these may respond to omitting one or more doses. \nIf adverse reactions persist, the daily dose should be temporarily reduced to the previous well-tolerated \ndose or the treatment may be discontinued. \n \nMaintenance dose:  \nThe effective dose is 3 to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should \nbe maintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg \ntwice a day. \n\n 28\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nMaintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists. \nTherefore, the clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis, especially for \npatients treated at doses less than 3 mg twice a day. If after 3 months of maintenance dose treatment \nthe patient\u2019s rate of decline in dementia symptoms is not altered favourably, the treatment should be \ndiscontinued.  Discontinuation should also be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect is no \nlonger present. \n \nIndividual response to rivastigmine cannot be predicted. However a greater treatment effect was seen \nin Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with moderate dementia. Similarly a larger effect was observed in \nParkinson\u2019s disease patients with visual hallucinations (see section 5.1). \n \nTreatment effect has not been studied in placebo-controlled trials beyond 6 months. \n \nRe-initiation of therapy:  \nIf treatment is interrupted for more than several days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. \nDose titration should then be carried out as described above. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment:  \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment. \nHowever, due to increased exposure in these populations dosing recommendations to titrate according \nto individual tolerability should be closely followed as patients with clinically significant renal or \nhepatic impairment might experience more adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied (see section 4.4).  \n \nChildren:  \nRivastigmine is not recommended for use in children. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nThe use of this medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with \n\n- hypersensitivity to the active substance, other carbamate derivatives or to any of the excipients \nused in the formulation, \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with higher doses. If treatment is \ninterrupted for more than several days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily to reduce the \npossibility of adverse reactions (e.g. vomiting).  \n \nDose titration: Adverse reactions (e.g. hypertension and hallucinations in patients with Alzheimer's \ndementia and worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms, in particular tremor, in patients with dementia \nassociated with Parkinson's disease) have been observed shortly after dose increase. They may respond \nto a dose reduction. In other cases, rivastigmine has been discontinued (see section 4.8).  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and  may occur \nparticularly when initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse \nreactions occur more commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration \nresulting from prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose \nreduction or discontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with \nserious outcomes. \n \nPatients with Alzheimer's disease may lose weight.  Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, \nhave been associated with weight loss in these patients. During therapy patient's weight should be \nmonitored.  \n \n\n 29\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nIn case of severe vomiting associated with rivastigmine treatment, appropriate dose adjustments as \nrecommended in section 4.2 must be made. Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with \noesophageal rupture (see section 4.8). Such events appeared to occur particularly after dose increments \nor high doses of rivastigmine.  \n \nCare must be taken when using rivastigmine in patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction \ndefects (sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular block) (see section 4.8).  \n \nRivastigmine may cause increased gastric acid secretions. Care should be exercised in treating patients \nwith active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions.  \n \nCholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or \nobstructive pulmonary disease.  \n \nCholinomimetics may induce or exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Caution is recommended \nin treating patients predisposed to such diseases.  \n \n The use of rivastigmine in patients with severe dementia of Alzheimer's disease or associated with \nParkinson's disease, other types of dementia or other types of memory impairment (e.g. age-related \ncognitive decline) has not been investigated and therefore the use in these patient populations is not \nrecommended.  \n \nLike other cholinomimetics, rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. \nWorsening (including bradykinesia, dyskinesia, gait abnormality) and an increased incidence or \nseverity of tremor have been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease \n(see section 4.8). These events led to the discontinuation of rivastigmine in some cases (e.g. \ndiscontinuations due to tremor 1.7 % on rivastigmine vs 0 % on placebo). Clinical monitoring is \nrecommended for these adverse reactions. \n \nSpecial Populations \nPatients with clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment might experience more adverse \nreactions (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. \nHowever, Rivastigmine Teva may be used in this patient population and close monitoring is necessary. \n \nPatients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be more \nlikely to discontinue due to adverse reactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAs a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle \nrelaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible \ndose adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed.  \n \nIn view of its pharmacodynamic effects, rivastigmine should not be given concomitantly with other \ncholinomimetic substances and might interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medicinal products.  \n \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam \nor fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is \nnot affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were \nobserved following concomitant administration of digoxin and rivastigmine.  \n \nAccording to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, \nalthough rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\n 30\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nFor rivastigmine no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. No effects on fertility or \nembryofoetal development were observed in rats and rabbits, except at doses related to maternal \ntoxicity. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an increased gestation time was observed. Rivastigmine \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.  \n \nIn animals, rivastigmine is excreted into milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human \nmilk. Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAlzheimer's disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability \nto use machinery. Furthermore, rivastigmine can induce dizziness and somnolence, mainly when \ninitiating treatment or increasing the dose. As a consequence, rivastigmine has minor or moderate \ninfluence on the ability to drive and use machinges. Therefore, the ability of patients with dementia on \nrivastigmine to continue driving or operating complex machines should be routinely evaluated by the \ntreating physician. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38 %) and \nvomiting (23 %), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be more \nsusceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss.  \n \nThe following adverse reactions, listed below in Table 1, have been accumulated in patients with \nAlzheimer's dementia treated with rivastigmine.  \n \nAdverse reactions in Table 1 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency \ncategory. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)  \n \nTable 1  \n \nInfections and infestations  \n\nVery rare Urinary infection \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \n\nVery common Anorexia \n\nNot known Dehydration \n\nPsychiatric disorders  \n\nCommon Agitation \n\nCommon Confusion \n\nCommon Anxiety \n\nUncommon Insomnia \n\nUncommon Depression \n\nVery rare Hallucinations \n\nNot known Aggression, restlessness \n\nNervous system disorders  \n\nVery common Dizziness \n\n 31\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nCommon Headache \n\nCommon Somnolence \n\nCommon Tremor \n\nUncommon Syncope \n\nRare Seizures \n\nVery rare Extrapyramidal symptoms (including worsening of \nParkinson's disease) \n\nCardiac disorders  \n\nRare Angina pectoris \n\nVery rare Cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. bradycardia, atrio-ventricular block, \natrial fibrillation and tachycardia) \n\nNot known Sick-sinus syndrome \n\nVascular Disorders  \n\nVery rare Hypertension \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\nVery common Nausea \n\nVery common Vomiting \n\nVery common Diarrhoea \n\nCommon Abdominal pain and dyspepsia \n\nRare Gastric and duodenal ulcers \n\nVery rare Gastrointestinal haemorrhage \n\nVery rare Pancreatitis \n\nNot known Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with \noesophageal rupture (see section 4.4). \n\nHepato-biliary disorders  \n\nUncommon Elevated liver function tests \n\nNot known Hepatitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n \n\nCommon Hyperhydrosis \n\nRare Rash \n\nNot known Pruritus \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n \n\nCommon Fatigue and asthenia \n\nCommon Malaise \n\nUncommon Fall \n\nInvestigations  \n\nCommon Weight loss \n\n 32\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nTable 2 shows the adverse reactions reported in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease treated with rivastigmine.  \n \nTable 2 \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \n\nCommon Anorexia \n\nCommon Dehydration \n\nPsychiatric disorders  \n\nCommon Insomnia \n\nCommon Anxiety \n\nCommon Restlessness \n\nNot known Aggression \n\nNervous system disorders  \n\nVery common Tremor \n\nCommon Dizziness \n\nCommon Somnolence \n\nCommon Headache \n\nCommon Worsening of Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\nCommon Bradykinesia \n\nCommon Dyskinesia \n\nUncommon Dystonia \n\nCardiac disorders  \n\nCommon Bradycardia \n\nUncommon Atrial fibrillation \n\nUncommon Atrioventricular block \n\nNot known Sick sinus syndrome \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\nVery common Nausea \n\nVery common Vomiting \n\nCommon Diarrhoea \n\nCommon Abdominal pain and dyspepsia \n\nCommon Salivary hypersecretion \n\nHepatobiliary disorders  \n\nNot known Hepatitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n \n\n 33\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nCommon Hyperhydrosis \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\n \n\nCommon Muscle rigidity \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n \n\nCommon Fatigue and asthenia \n\nCommon Gait abnormality \n\n \nTable 3 lists the number and percentage of patients from the specific 24-week clinical study conducted \nwith rivastigmine in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease with pre-defined \nadverse events that may reflect worsening of parkinsonian symptoms.  \n \nTable 3 \n \nPre-defined adverse events that may reflect \nworsening of parkinsonian symptoms in \npatients with dementia associated with \nParkinson's disease \n\nRivastigmine \n \nn (%) \n\nPlacebo \n \nn (%) \n\nTotal patients studied 362 (100) 179 (100) \n\nTotal patients with pre-defined AE(s) 99 (27.3) 28 (15.6) \n\nTremor 37 (10.2) 7 (3.9) \n\nFall 21 (5.8) 11 (6.1) \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease (worsening) 12 (3.3) 2 (1.1) \n\nSalivary hypersecretion 5 (1.4) 0 \n\nDyskinesia 5 (1.4) 1 (0.6) \n\nParkinsonism 8 (2.2) 1 (0.6) \n\nHypokinesia 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nMovement disorder 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nBradykinesia 9 (2.5) 3 (1.7) \n\nDystonia 3 (0.8) 1 (0.6) \n\nGait abnormality 5 (1.4) 0 \n\nMuscle rigidity 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nBalance disorder 3 (0.8) 2 (1.1) \n\nMusculoskeletal stiffness 3 (0.8) 0 \n\nRigors 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nMotor dysfunction 1 (0.3) 0 \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms  \nMost cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and \nalmost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment.

In overdose accompanied by severe nausea \nand vomiting, the use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse \nreactions should be given as necessary. \n \nIn massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate \nis recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote \nis not recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03 \n \nRivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to \nfacilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by \nfunctionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on \ncholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease and \nParkinson's disease. \n  \nRivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that \ntemporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases \nacetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40 % within the first 1.5 hours after \nadministration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum \ninhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF \nby rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. Inhibition \nof butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by rivastigmine was similar \nto that of AChE. \n \nClinical studies in Alzheimer's dementia \nThe efficacy of rivastigmine has been established through the use of three independent, domain \nspecific, assessment tools which were assessed at periodic intervals during 6 month treatment periods. \nThese include the ADAS-Cog (a performance based measure of cognition), the CIBIC-Plus (a \ncomprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician incorporating caregiver input), and \nthe PDS (a caregiver-rated assessment of the activities of daily living including personal hygiene, \nfeeding, dressing, household chores such as shopping, retention of ability to orient oneself to \nsurroundings as well as involvement in activities relating to finances, etc.). \n \nThe patients studied had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score of 10 \u2013 24. \n \nThe results for clinically relevant responders pooled from two flexible dose studies out of the three \npivotal 26-week multicentre studies in patients with mild-to-moderately severe Alzheimer's Dementia, \nare provided in Table 4 below. Clinically relevant improvement in these studies was defined a priori as \nat least 4-point improvement on the ADAS-Cog, improvement on the CIBIC-Plus, or at least a 10 % \nimprovement on the PDS. \n \n\n 35\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nIn addition, a post-hoc definition of response is provided in the same table. The secondary definition \nof response required a 4-point or greater improvement on the ADAS-Cog, no worsening on the \nCIBIC-Plus, and no worsening on the PDS. The mean actual daily dose for responders in the 6 \u2013\n 12 mg group, corresponding to this definition, was 9.3 mg. It is important to note that the scales used \nin this indication vary and direct comparisons of results for different therapeutic agents are not valid. \n \nTable 4 \n \n Patients with Clinically Significant Response (%) \n\n Intent to Treat Last Observation Carried \nForward \n\nResponse Measure Rivastigmine \n6\u201312 mg \nN=473 \n\nPlacebo \nN=472 \n\nRivastigmine \n6\u201312 mg \nN=379 \n\nPlacebo \nN=444 \n\nADAS-Cog: improvement of at \nleast 4 points \n\n21*** 12 25*** 12 \n\nCIBIC-Plus: improvement 29*** 18 32*** 19 \n\nPDS: improvement of at least \n10% \n\n26*** 17 30*** 18 \n\nAt least 4 points improvement \non ADAS-Cog with no \nworsening on CIBIC-Plus and \nPDS \n\n10* 6 12** 6 \n\n*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 \n \nClinical studies in dementia associated with Parkinson's disease \nThe efficacy of rivastigmine in dementia associated with Parkinson's disease has been demonstrated in \na 24-week multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled core study and its 24-week open-label \nextension phase. Patients involved in this study had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score \nof 10 \u2013 24.

Peak plasma concentrations are reached in \napproximately 1 hour. As a consequence of rivastigmine's interaction with its target enzyme, the \nincrease in bioavailability is about 1.5-fold greater than that expected from the increase in dose. \nAbsolute bioavailability after a 3 mg dose is about 36 %\u00b113 %. Administration of rivastigmine with \nfood delays absorption (tmax) by 90 min and lowers Cmax and increases AUC by approximately 30 %.  \n \nDistribution  \nProtein binding of rivastigmine is approximately 40 %. It readily crosses the blood brain barrier and \nhas an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8 \u2013 2.7 l/kg. \n \nMetabolism \n\n 37\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nRivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised (half-life in plasma approximately 1 hour), \nprimarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite. In vitro, this \nmetabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (<10 %). Based on evidence from in vitro \nand animal studies the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine \nmetabolism. Total plasma clearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 l/h after a 0.2 mg \nintravenous dose and decreased to 70 l/h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose. \n \nExcretion  \nUnchanged rivastigmine is not found in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route \nof elimination. Following administration of 14C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and \nessentially complete (>90 %) within 24  hours. Less than 1 % of the administered dose is excreted in \nthe faeces. There is no accumulation of rivastigmine or the decarbamylated metabolite in patients with \nAlzheimer's disease. \n \nElderly subjects  \nWhile bioavailability of rivastigmine is greater in elderly than in young healthy volunteers, studies in \nAlzheimer patients aged between 50 and 92 years showed no change in bioavailability with age. \n \nSubjects with hepatic impairment  \nThe Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60 % higher and the AUC of rivastigmine was more than \ntwice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects. \n \nSubjects with renal impairment  \nCmax and AUC of rivastigmine were more than twice as high in subjects with moderate renal \nimpairment compared with healthy subjects; however there were no changes in Cmax and AUC of \nrivastigmine in subjects with severe renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, mice and dogs revealed only effects associated with an \nexaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. No safety margins to \nhuman exposure were achieved in the animal studies due to the sensitivity of the animal models used.  \n \nRivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a \nchromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose 104 times the maximum \nclinical exposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. \n \nNo evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in mice and rats at the maximum tolerated dose, \nalthough the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was lower than the human exposure. When \nnormalised to body surface area, the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was approximately \nequivalent to the maximum recommended human dose of 12 mg/day; however, when compared to the \nmaximum human dose, a multiple of approximately 6-fold was achieved in animals. \n \nIn animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats \nand rabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. \nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia or dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Diagnosis should \nbe made according to current guidelines. Therapy with rivastigmine should only be started if a \ncaregiver is available who will regularly monitor intake of the medicinal product by the patient. \n \nRivastigmine should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals. The capsules \nshould be swallowed whole.  \n \nInitial dose:  \n1.5 mg twice a day. \n \nDose titration:  \nThe starting dose is 1.5 mg twice a day. If the dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of \ntreatment, the dose may be increased to 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then \n6mg twice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered \nafter a minimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level  \n \nIf adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or loss of appetite), weight decrease or \nworsening of extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. tremor) in patients with dementia associated with \nParkinson\u2019s disease are observed during treatment, these may respond to omitting one or more doses. \nIf adverse reactions persist, the daily dose should be temporarily reduced to the previous well-tolerated \ndose or the treatment may be discontinued. \n \nMaintenance dose:  \nThe effective dose is 3 to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should \nbe maintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg \ntwice a day. \n\n 41\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nMaintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists. \nTherefore, the clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis, especially for \npatients treated at doses less than 3 mg twice a day. If after 3 months of maintenance dose treatment \nthe patient\u2019s rate of decline in dementia symptoms is not altered favourably, the treatment should be \ndiscontinued.  Discontinuation should also be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect is no \nlonger present. \n \nIndividual response to rivastigmine cannot be predicted. However a greater treatment effect was seen \nin Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with moderate dementia. Similarly a larger effect was observed in \nParkison\u2019s disease patients with visual hallucinations (see section 5.1).  \n \nTreatment effect has not been studied in placebo-controlled trials beyond 6 months. \n \nRe-initiation of therapy:  \nIf treatment is interrupted for more than several days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. \nDose titration should then be carried out as described above. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment:  \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patientS with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment. \nHowever, due to increased exposure in these populations dosing recommendations to titrate according \nto individual tolerability should be closely followed as patients with clinically significant renal or \nhepatic impairment might experience more adverse reactions (see sections  4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied (see section 4.4).  \n \nChildren:  \nRivastigmine is not recommended for use in children. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nThe use of this medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with \n\n- hypersensitivity to the active substance, other carbamate derivatives or to any of the excipients \nused in the formulation. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with higher doses. If treatment is \ninterrupted for more than several days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily to reduce the \npossibility of adverse reactions (e.g. vomiting).  \n \nDose titration: Adverse reactions (e.g. hypertension and hallucinations in patients with Alzheimer's \ndementia and worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms, in particular tremor, in patients with dementia \nassociated with Parkinson's disease) have been observed shortly after dose increase. They may respond \nto a dose reduction. In other cases, rivastigmine has been discontinued (see section 4.8).  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur \nparticularly when initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse \nreactions occur more commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration \nresulting from prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose \nreduction or discontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with \nserious outcomes. \n \nPatients with Alzheimer's disease may lose weight.  Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, \nhave been associated with weight loss in these patients. During therapy patient's weight should be \nmonitored.  \n \n\n 42\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nIn case of severe vomiting associated with rivastigmine treatment, appropriate dose adjustments as \nrecommended in section 4.2 must be made. Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with \noesophageal rupture (see section 4.8). Such events appeared to occur particularly after dose increments \nor high doses of rivastigmine.  \n \nCare must be taken when using rivastigmine in patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction \ndefects (sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular block) (see section 4.8).  \n \nRivastigmine may cause increased gastric acid secretions. Care should be exercised in treating patients \nwith active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions.  \n \nCholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or \nobstructive pulmonary disease.  \n \nCholinomimetics may induce or exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Caution is recommended \nin treating patients predisposed to such diseases.  \n \nThe use of rivastigmine in patients with severe dementia of Alzheimer's disease or associated with \nParkinson's disease, other types of dementia or other types of memory impairment (e.g. age-related \ncognitive decline) has not been investigated and therefore use in these patient populations is not \nrecommended.  \n \nLike other cholinomimetics, rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. \nWorsening (including bradykinesia, dyskinesia, gait abnormality) and an increased incidence or \nseverity of tremor have been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease \n(see section 4.8). These events led to the discontinuation of rivastigmine in some cases (e.g. \ndiscontinuations due to tremor 1.7 % on rivastigmine vs 0 % on placebo). Clinical monitoring is \nrecommended for these adverse reactions. \n \nSpecial Populations \nPatients with clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment might experience more adverse \nreactions (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. \nHowever, Rivastigmine Teva may be used in this patient population and close monitoring is necessary. \n \nPatients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be more \nlikely to discontinue due to adverse reactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAs a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle \nrelaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible \ndose adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed.  \n \nIn view of its pharmacodynamic effects, rivastigmine should not be given concomitantly with other \ncholinomimetic substances and might interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medicinal products.  \n \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam \nor fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is \nnot affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were \nobserved following concomitant administration of digoxin and rivastigmine.  \n \nAccording to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, \nalthough rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\n 43\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nFor rivastigmine no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. No effects on fertility or \nembryofoetal development were observed in rats and rabbits, except at doses related to maternal \ntoxicity. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an increased gestation time was observed. Rivastigmine \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.  \n \nIn animals, rivastigmine is excreted into milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human \nmilk. Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAlzheimer's disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability \nto use machinery. Furthermore, rivastigmine can induce dizziness and somnolence, mainly when \ninitiating treatment or increasing the dose. As a consequence, rivastigmine has minor or moderate \ninfluence on the ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, the ability of patients with dementia on \nrivastigmine to continue driving or operating complex machines should be routinely evaluated by the \ntreating physician. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38 %) and \nvomiting (23 %), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be more \nsusceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss.  \n \nThe following adverse reactions, listed below in Table 1, have been accumulated in patients with \nAlzheimer's dementia treated with rivastigmine.  \n \nAdverse reactions in Table 1 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency \ncategory. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).  \n \nTable 1  \n \nInfections and infestations  \n\nVery rare Urinary infection \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \n\nVery common Anorexia \n\nNot known Dehydration \n\nPsychiatric disorders  \n\nCommon Agitation \n\nCommon Confusion \n\nCommon Anxiety \n\nUncommon Insomnia \n\nUncommon Depression \n\nVery rare Hallucinations \n\nNot known Aggression, restlessness \n\nNervous system disorders  \n\nVery common Dizziness \n\n 44\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nCommon Headache \n\nCommon Somnolence \n\nCommon Tremor \n\nUncommon Syncope \n\nRare Seizures \n\nVery rare Extrapyramidal symptoms (including worsening of Parkinson's \ndisease) \n\nCardiac disorders  \n\nRare Angina pectoris \n\nVery rare Cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. bradycardia, atrio-ventricular block, \natrial fibrillation and tachycardia) \n\nNot known Sick sinus syndrome \n\nVascular Disorders  \n\nVery rare Hypertension \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\nVery common Nausea \n\nVery common Vomiting \n\nVery common Diarrhoea \n\nCommon Abdominal pain and dyspepsia \n\nRare Gastric and duodenal ulcers \n\nVery rare Gastrointestinal haemorrhage \n\nVery rare Pancreatitis \n\nNot known Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with oesophageal \nrupture (see section 4.4). \n\nHepatobiliary disorders  \n\nUncommon Elevated liver function tests \n\nNot known Hepatitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \n\nCommon Hyperhydrosis \n\nRare Rash \n\nNot known Pruritus \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\n \n\nCommon Fatigue and asthenia \n\nCommon Malaise \n\nUncommon Fall \n\nInvestigations  \n\nCommon Weight loss \n\n \n\n 45\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nTable 2 shows the adverse reactions reported in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease treated with rivastigmine.  \n \nTable 2 \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \n\nCommon Anorexia \n\nCommon Dehydration \n\nPsychiatric disorders  \n\nCommon Insomnia \n\nCommon Anxiety \n\nCommon Restlessness \n\nNot known Aggression \n\nNervous system disorders  \n\nVery common Tremor \n\nCommon Dizziness \n\nCommon Somnolence \n\nCommon Headache \n\nCommon Worsening of Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\nCommon Bradykinesia \n\nCommon Dyskinesia \n\nUncommon Dystonia \n\nCardiac disorders  \n\nCommon Bradycardia \n\nUncommon Atrial fibrillation \n\nUncommon Atrioventricular block \n\nNot known Sick sinus syndrome \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\nVery common Nausea \n\nVery common Vomiting \n\nCommon Diarrhoea \n\nCommon Abdominal pain and dyspesia \n\nCommon Salivary hypersecretion \n\nHepatobiliary disorders  \n\nNot known Hepatitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n \n\nCommon Hyperhydrosis \n\n 46\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\n \n\nCommon Muscle rigidity \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n \n\nCommon Fatigue and asthenia \n\nCommon Gait abnormality \n\n \nTable 3 lists the number and percentage of patients from the specific 24-week clinical study conducted \nwith rivastigmine in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease with pre-defined \nadverse events that may reflect worsening of parkinsonian symptoms.  \n \nTable 3 \n \nPre-defined adverse events that may reflect \nworsening of parkinsonian symptoms in \npatients with dementia associated with \nParkinson's disease \n\nRivastigmine \n \nn (%) \n\nPlacebo \n \nn (%) \n\nTotal patients studied 362 (100) 179 (100) \n\nTotal patients with pre-defined AE(s) 99 (27.3) 28 (15.6) \n\nTremor 37 (10.2) 7 (3.9) \n\nFall 21 (5.8) 11 (6.1) \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease (worsening) 12 (3.3) 2 (1.1) \n\nSalivary hypersecretion 5 (1.4) 0 \n\nDyskinesia 5 (1.4) 1 (0.6) \n\nParkinsonism 8 (2.2) 1 (0.6) \n\nHypokinesia 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nMovement disorder 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nBradykinesia 9 (2.5) 3 (1.7) \n\nDystonia 3 (0.8) 1 (0.6) \n\nGait abnormality 5 (1.4) 0 \n\nMuscle rigidity 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nBalance disorder 3 (0.8) 2 (1.1) \n\nMusculoskeletal stiffness 3 (0.8) 0 \n\nRigors 1 (0.3) 0 \n\nMotor dysfunction 1 (0.3) 0 \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nMost cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and \nalmost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment.

Ingestion of 46 mg occurred in one case; following conservative management the patient \nfully recovered within 24 hours. \n \nTreatment  \nAs rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition \nof about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose of \nrivastigmine should be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea \nand vomiting, the use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse \nreactions should be given as necessary. \n \nIn massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate \nis recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote \nis not recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06D A03 \n \nRivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to \nfacilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by \nfunctionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on \ncholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease and \nParkinson's disease. \n  \nRivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that \ntemporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases \nacetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40 % within the first 1.5 hours after \nadministration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum \ninhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF \nby rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. Inhibition \nof butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by rivastigmine was similar \nto that of AChE. \n \nClinical studies in Alzheimer's dementia \nThe efficacy of rivastigmine has been established through the use of three independent, domain \nspecific, assessment tools which were assessed at periodic intervals during 6 month treatment periods. \nThese include the ADAS-Cog (a performance based measure of cognition), the CIBIC-Plus (a \ncomprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician incorporating caregiver input), and \nthe PDS (a caregiver-rated assessment of the activities of daily living including personal hygiene, \nfeeding, dressing, household chores such as shopping, retention of ability to orient oneself to \nsurroundings as well as involvement in activities relating to finances, etc.). \n \nThe patients studied had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score of 10 \u2013 24. \n \nThe results for clinically relevant responders pooled from two flexible dose studies out of the three \npivotal 26-week multicentre studies in patients with mild-to-moderately severe Alzheimer's Dementia, \nare provided in Table 4 below. Clinically relevant improvement in these studies was defined a priori as \nat least 4-point improvement on the ADAS-Cog, improvement on the CIBIC-Plus, or at least a 10 % \nimprovement on the PDS. \n \nIn addition, a post-hoc definition of response is provided in the same table. The secondary definition \nof response required a 4-point or greater improvement on the ADAS-Cog, no worsening on the \nCIBIC-Plus, and no worsening on the PDS.

Patients involved in this study had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score \nof 10 \u2013 24. Efficacy has been established by the use of two independent scales which were assessed at \nregular intervals during a 6-month treatment period as shown in Table 5 below: the ADAS-Cog, a \nmeasure of cognition, and the global measure ADCS-CGIC (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-\nClinician's Global Impression of Change). \n \nTable 5 \n \nDementia associated \nwith Parkinson's Disease \n\nADAS-Cog \nRivastigmine \n\nADAS-Cog \nPlacebo \n\nADCS-CGIC \nRivastigmine \n\nADCS-CGIC \nPlacebo \n\nITT + RDO population (n=329) (n=161) (n=329) (n=165) \n\nMean baseline \u00b1 SD 23.8\u00b110.2 24.3\u00b110.5 n/a n/a \n\nMean change at 24 weeks \n\u00b1 SD \n\n2.1\u00b18.2 -0.7\u00b17.5 3.8\u00b11.4 4.3\u00b11.5 \n\nAdjusted treatment \ndifference \n\n2.881 n/a \n\np-value versus placebo <0.0011 0.0072 \n\nITT - LOCF population (n=287) (n=154) (n=289) (n=158) \n\nMean baseline \u00b1 SD 24.0\u00b110.3 24.5\u00b110.6 n/a n/a \n\nMean change at 24 weeks \n\u00b1 SD \n\n2.5\u00b18.4 -0.8\u00b17.5 3.7\u00b11.4 4.3\u00b11.5 \n\nAdjusted treatment \ndifference \n\n3.541 n/a \n\np-value versus placebo <0.0011 <0.0012 \n1 Based on ANCOVA with treatment and country as factors and baseline ADAS-Cog as a covariate.

Peak plasma concentrations are reached in \napproximately 1 hour. As a consequence of rivastigmine\u2019s interaction with its target enzyme, the \nincrease in bioavailability is about 1.5-fold greater than that expected from the increase in dose. \nAbsolute bioavailability after a 3 mg dose is about 36 % \u00b1 13 %. Administration of rivastigmine with \nfood delays absorption (tmax) by 90 min and lowers Cmax and increases AUC by approximately 30 %.  \n \nDistribution:  \nProtein binding of rivastigmine is approximately 40 %. It readily crosses the blood brain barrier and \nhas an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8 \u2013 2.7 l/kg. \n \nMetabolism: \nRivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised (half-life in plasma approximately 1 hour), \nprimarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite. In vitro, this \nmetabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (<10 %). Based on evidence from in vitro \nand animal studies the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine \n\n 50\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nmetabolism. Total plasma clearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 l/h after a 0.2 mg \nintravenous dose and decreased to 70 l/h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose. \n \nExcretion:  \nUnchanged rivastigmine is not found in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route \nof elimination. Following administration of 14C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and \nessentially complete (>90 %) within 24 hours. Less than 1 % of the administered dose is excreted in \nthe faeces. There is no accumulation of rivastigmine or the decarbamylated metabolite in patients with \nAlzheimer's disease. \n \nElderly subjects:  \nWhile bioavailability of rivastigmine is greater in elderly than in young healthy volunteers, studies in \nAlzheimer patients aged between 50 and 92 years showed no change in bioavailability with age. \n \nSubjects with hepatic impairment:  \nThe Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60 % higher and the AUC of rivastigmine was more than \ntwice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects. \n \nSubjects with renal impairment:  \nCmax and AUC of rivastigmine were more than twice as high in subjects with moderate renal \nimpairment compared with healthy subjects; however there were no changes in Cmax and AUC of \nrivastigmine in subjects with severe renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, mice and dogs revealed only effects associated with an \nexaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. No safety margins to \nhuman exposure were achieved in the animal studies due to the sensitivity of the animal models used.  \n \nRivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a \nchromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose 104 times the maximum \nclinical exposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. \n \nNo evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in mice and rats at the maximum tolerated dose, \nalthough the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was lower than the human exposure. When \nnormalised to body surface area, the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was approximately \nequivalent to the maximum recommended human dose of 12 mg/day; however, when compared to the \nmaximum human dose, a multiple of approximately 6-fold was achieved in animals. \n \nIn animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats \nand rabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. \n \n \n6.
