CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. \n \nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease.  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia or dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Diagnosis should \nbe made according to current guidelines. Therapy with rivastigmine should only be started if a \ncaregiver is available who will regularly monitor intake of the medicinal product by the patient.  \n \nPosology \nRivastigmine should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals. The capsules \nshould be swallowed whole. \n \nInitial dose  \n1.5 mg twice a day.  \n \nDose titration  \nThe starting dose is 1.5 mg twice a day. If this dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of \ntreatment, the dose may be increased to 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then \n6 mg twice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered \nafter a minimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level. \n \nIf adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or loss of appetite), weight decrease or \nworsening of extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. tremor) in patients with dementia associated with \nParkinson\u2019s disease are observed during treatment, these may respond to omitting one or more doses. \nIf adverse reactions persist, the daily dose should be temporarily reduced to the previous well-\ntolerated dose or the treatment may be discontinued. \n \nMaintenance dose  \nThe effective dose is 3 to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should \nbe maintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg \ntwice a day.  \n \nMaintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists. \nTherefore, the clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis, especially for \npatients treated at doses less than 3 mg twice a day. If after 3 months of maintenance dose treatment \nthe patient\u2019s rate of decline in dementia symptoms is not altered favourably, the treatment should be \ndiscontinued. Discontinuation should also be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect is no \nlonger present. \n \nIndividual response to rivastigmine cannot be predicted. However, a greater treatment effect was seen \nin Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with moderate dementia. Similarly a larger effect was observed in \nParkinson\u2019s disease patients with visual hallucinations (see section 5.1). \n \nTreatment effect has not been studied in placebo-controlled trials beyond 6 months. \n \nRe-initiation of therapy  \nIf treatment is interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. \nDose titration should then be carried out as described above. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment  \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment. \nHowever, due to increased exposure in these populations dosing recommendations to titrate according \nto individual tolerability should be closely followed as patients with clinically significant renal or \nhepatic impairment might experience more dose-dependent adverse reactions. Patients with severe \nhepatic impairment have not been studied, however, Rivastigmine Actavis capsules may be used in this \npatient population provided close monitoring is exercised (see section 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of rivastigmine in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other carbamate derivatives or to any of the excipients \nlisted in section 6.1. \n \nPrevious history of application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis with rivastigmine \npatch (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with higher doses. If treatment is \ninterrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily to reduce the \npossibility of adverse reactions (e.g. vomiting). \n \nSkin application site reactions may occur with rivastigmine patch and are usually mild or moderate in \nintensity. These reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitisation. However, use of \nrivastigmine patch may lead to allergic contact dermatitis. \n \nAllergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch \nsize, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g. increasing erythema, oedema, papules, \nvesicles) and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. In these \ncases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n \nPatients who develop application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to \nrivastigmine patch and who still require rivastigmine treatment should only be switched to oral \nrivastigmine after negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that \nsome patients sensitised to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take \nrivastigmine in any form. \n \nThere have been rare post-marketing reports of patients experiencing allergic dermatitis \n(disseminated) when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral, \ntransdermal). In these cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n \nPatients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly. \n \nDose titration: Adverse reactions (e.g. hypertension and hallucinations in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s \ndementia and worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms, in particular tremor, in patients with dementia \nassociated with Parkinson\u2019s disease) have been observed shortly after dose increase. They may \nrespond to a dose reduction. In other cases, rivastigmine has been discontinued (see section 4.8). \n \nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur \nparticularly when initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse \nreactions occur more commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration \nresulting from prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose \nreduction or discontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with \nserious outcomes. \n \nPatients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease may lose weight. Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, \nhave been associated with weight loss in these patients. During therapy patient\u2019s weight should be \nmonitored. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn case of severe vomiting associated with rivastigmine treatment, appropriate dose adjustments as \nrecommended in section 4.2 must be made. Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with \noesophageal rupture (see section 4.8). Such events appeared to occur particularly after dose \nincrements or high doses of rivastigmine. \n \nRivastigmine may cause bradycardia which constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsade de \npointes, predominantly in patients with risk factors. Caution is advised in patients at higher risk of \ndeveloping torsade de pointes; for example, those with uncompensated heart failure, recent \nmyocardial infarction, bradyarrhythmias, a predisposition to hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, or \nconcomitant use with medicinal products known to induce QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes \n(see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nCare must be taken when using rivastigmine in patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction \ndefects (sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular block) (see section 4.8). \n \nRivastigmine may cause increased gastric acid secretions. Care should be exercised in treating \npatients with active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions. \n \nCholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or \nobstructive pulmonary disease. \n \nCholinomimetics may induce or exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Caution is recommended \nin treating patients predisposed to such diseases. \n \nThe use of rivastigmine in patients with severe dementia of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or associated with \nParkinson\u2019s disease, other types of dementia or other types of memory impairment (e.g. age-related \ncognitive decline) has not been investigated and therefore use in these patient populations is not \nrecommended. \n \nLike other cholinomimetics, rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. \nWorsening (including bradykinesia, dyskinesia, gait abnormality) and an increased incidence or \nseverity of tremor have been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease \n(see section 4.8). These events led to the discontinuation of rivastigmine in some cases (e.g. \ndiscontinuations due to tremor 1.7 % on rivastigmine vs. 0 % on placebo). Clinical monitoring is \nrecommended for these adverse reactions. \n \nSpecial populations \nPatients with clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment might experience more adverse \nreactions (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual \ntolerability must be closely followed. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. \nHowever, rivastigmine may be used in this patient population and close monitoring is necessary. \n \nPatients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be more \nlikely to discontinue due to adverse reactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAs a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle \nrelaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible \ndose adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed. \n \nIn view of its pharmacodynamic effects and possible additive effects, rivastigmine should not be given \nconcomitantly with other cholinomimetic substances. Rivastigmine might interfere with the activity of \nanticholinergic medicinal products (e.g oxybutynin, tolterodine). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nAdditive effects leading to bradycardia (which may result in syncope) have been reported with the \ncombined use of various beta-blockers (including atenolol) and rivastigmine. Cardiovascular beta- \nblockers are expected to be associated with the greatest risk, but reports have also been received in \npatients using other beta-blockers. Therefore, caution should be exercised when rivastigmine is \ncombined with beta-blockers and also other bradycardia agents (e.g.class III antiarrhythmic agents, \ncalcium channel antagonists, digitalis glycoside, pilocarpin). \n \nSince bradycardia constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsades de pointes, the combination of \nrivastigmine with torsades de pointes-inducing medicinal products such as antipsychotics i.e. some \nphenothiazines (chlorpromazine, levomepromazine), benzamides (sulpiride, sultopride, amisulpride, \ntiapride, veralipride), pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol, cisapride, citalopram, diphemanil, \nerythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, methadone, pentamidine and moxifloxacine should be \nobserved with caution and clinical monitoring (ECG) may also be required. \n \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam \nor fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is \nnot affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were \nobserved following concomitant administration of digoxin and rivastigmine. \n \nAccording to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, \nalthough rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nIn pregnant animals, rivastigmine and/or metabolites crossed the placenta. It is not known if this occurs \nin humans. No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an \nincreased gestation time was observed. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless \nclearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIn animals, rivastigmine is excreted in milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human \nmilk. Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed. \n \nFertility \n \nNo adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive performance in rats (see \nsection 5.3). Effects of rivastigmine on human fertility are not known. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability \nto use machinery. Furthermore, rivastigmine can induce dizziness and somnolence, mainly when \ninitiating treatment or increasing the dose. As a consequence, rivastigmine has minor or moderate \ninfluence on the ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, the ability of patients with dementia on \nrivastigmine to continue driving or operating complex machines should be routinely evaluated by the \ntreating physician. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions (ADRs) are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38 %) \nand vomiting (23 %), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be \nmore susceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions in Table 1 and Table 2 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and \nfrequency category. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common \n(\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000);

suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nMost cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and \nalmost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment 24 hours after the overdose. \n \nCholinergic toxicity has been reported with muscarinic symptoms that are observed with moderate \npoisonings such as miosis, flushing, digestive disorders including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and \ndiarrhoea, bradycardia, bronchospasm and increased bronchial secretions, hyperhidrosis, involuntary \nurination and/or defecation, lacrimation, hypotension and salivary hypersecretion. \n \nIn more severe cases nicotinic effects might develop such as muscular weakness, fasciculations, seizures \nand respiratory arrest with possible fatal outcome. \n \nAdditionally there have been post-marketing cases of dizziness, tremor, headache, somnolence, \nconfusional state, hypertension, hallucinations and malaise. \n \nManagement \n \nAs rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase \ninhibition of about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose \nof rivastigmine should be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe \nnausea and vomiting, the use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other \nadverse reactions should be given as necessary. \n \nIn massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulfate \nis recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote \nis not recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: psychoanaleptics, anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03  \n \nRivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to \nfacilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by \nfunctionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on \ncholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and \nParkinson\u2019s disease.  \n \nRivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that \ntemporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases \n\n\n\n11 \n\nacetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40 % within the first 1.5 hours after \nadministration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum \ninhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF \nby rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. Inhibition \nof butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by rivastigmine was similar \nto that of AChE.  \n \nClinical studies in Alzheimer\u2019s dementia \nThe efficacy of rivastigmine has been established through the use of three independent, domain \nspecific, assessment tools which were assessed at periodic intervals during 6 month treatment periods. \nThese include the ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Assessment Scale \u2013 Cognitive subscale, a \nperformance based measure of cognition), the CIBIC-Plus (Clinician\u2019s Interview Based Impression of \nChange-Plus, a comprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician incorporating \ncaregiver input), and the PDS (Progressive Deterioration Scale, a caregiver-rated assessment of the \nactivities of daily living including personal hygiene, feeding, dressing, household chores such as \nshopping, retention of ability to orient oneself to surroundings as well as involvement in activities \nrelating to finances, etc.). \n \nThe patients studied had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score of 10-24. \n \nThe results for clinically relevant responders pooled from two flexible dose studies out of the three \npivotal 26-week multicentre studies in patients with mild-to-moderately severe Alzheimer\u2019s \nDementia, are provided in Table 4 below. Clinically relevant improvement in these studies was \ndefined a priori as at least 4-point improvement on the ADAS-Cog, improvement on the CIBIC-Plus, \nor at least a 10 % improvement on the PDS. \n \nIn addition, a post-hoc definition of response is provided in the same table. The secondary definition \nof response required a 4-point or greater improvement on the ADAS-Cog, no worsening on the \nCIBIC-Plus, and no worsening on the PDS. The mean actual daily dose for responders in the 6-12 mg \ngroup, corresponding to this definition, was 9.3 mg.

A \npositive change indicates improvement. \nITT: Intent-To-Treat; RDO: Retrieved Drop Outs \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nrivastigmine in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia and \nin the treatment of dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nRivastigmine is rapidly and completely absorbed. Peak plasma concentrations are reached in \napproximately 1 hour. As a consequence of rivastigmine\u2019s interaction with its target enzyme, the \nincrease in bioavailability is about 1.5-fold greater than that expected from the increase in dose. \nAbsolute bioavailability after a 3 mg dose is about 36 %\u00b113 %. Administration of rivastigmine with \nfood delays absorption (tmax) by 90 min and lowers Cmax and increases AUC by approximately 30 %.  \n \nDistribution \nProtein binding of rivastigmine is approximately 40 %. It readily crosses the blood brain barrier and \nhas an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8-2.7 l/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \nRivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised (half-life in plasma approximately 1 hour), \nprimarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite. In vitro, this \nmetabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (<10 %).  \n \nBased on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with medicinal products \nmetabolised by the following cytochromes isoemzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, \nCYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6. Based on evidence from animal studies the major \ncytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism. Total plasma \nclearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 l/h after a 0.2 mg intravenous dose and decreased to \n70 l/h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose. \n \nElimination \nUnchanged rivastigmine is not found in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route \nof elimination. Following administration of 14C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and \nessentially complete (>90 %) within 24 hours. Less than 1 % of the administered dose is excreted in \nthe faeces. There is no accumulation of rivastigmine or the decarbamylated metabolite in patients with \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease. \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that nicotine use increases the oral clearance of \nrivastigmine by 23% in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (n=75 smokers and 549 non-smokers) \nfollowing rivastigmine oral capsule doses of up to 12 mg/day. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nElderly population \nWhile bioavailability of rivastigmine is greater in elderly than in young healthy volunteers, studies in \nAlzheimer patients aged between 50 and 92 years showed no change in bioavailability with age. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60 % higher and the AUC of rivastigmine was more than \ntwice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects. \n \nRenal impairment \nCmax and AUC of rivastigmine were more than twice as high in subjects with moderate renal \nimpairment compared with healthy subjects; however there were no changes in Cmax and AUC of \nrivastigmine in subjects with severe renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, mice and dogs revealed only effects associated with an \nexaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. No safety margins to \nhuman exposure were achieved in the animal studies due to the sensitivity of the animal models used. \n \nRivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a \nchromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose 104 times the maximum \nclinical exposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. The major metabolite NAP226-90 also \ndid not show a genotoxic potential. \n \nNo evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in mice and rats at the maximum tolerated dose, \nalthough the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was lower than the human exposure. When \nnormalised to body surface area, the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was approximately \nequivalent to the maximum recommended human dose of 12 mg/day; however, when compared to the \nmaximum human dose, a multiple of approximately 6-fold was achieved in animals. \n \nIn animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats \nand rabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. In oral studies with \nmale and female rats, no adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive \nperformance of either the parent generation or the offspring of the parents. \n \nA mild eye/mucosal irritation potential of rivastigmine was identified in a rabbit study. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rivastigmine Actavis is and what it is used for \n \nThe active substance of Rivastigmine Actavis is rivastigmine. \n \nRivastigmine belongs to a class of substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. In patients with \nAlzheimer\u2019s dementia or dementia due to Parkinson\u2019s disease, certain nerve cells die in the brain, \nresulting in low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to \ncommunicate with each other). Rivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down \nacetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. By blocking these enzymes, \nRivastigmine Actavis allows levels of acetylcholine to be increased in the brain, helping to reduce the \nsymptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n \nRivastigmine Actavis is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately severe \nAlzheimer\u2019s dementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual ability \nand behaviour. The capsules and oral solution can also be used for the treatment of dementia in adult \npatients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Rivastigmine Actavis \n \nDo not take Rivastigmine Actavis \n\u2022 if you are allergic to rivastigmine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\u2022 if you have a skin reaction spreading beyond the patch size, if there is a more intense local \n\nreaction (such as blisters, increasing skin inflammation, swelling) and if it does not improve \nwithin 48 hours after removal of the transdermal patch. \n\n \nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor and do not take Rivastigmine Actavis. \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Rivastigmine Actavis: \n\u2022 if you have, or have ever had, irregular or slow heartbeat. \n\u2022 if you have, or have ever had, an active stomach ulcer. \n\u2022 if you have, or have ever had, difficulties in passing urine. \n\u2022 if you have, or have ever had, seizures. \n\u2022 if you have, or have ever had, asthma or severe respiratory disease. \n\u2022 if you have, or have ever had impaired kidney function. \n\u2022 if you have, or have ever had, impaired liver function. \n\u2022 if you suffer from trembling. \n\u2022 if you have a low body weight. \n\u2022 if you have gastrointestinal reactions such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and \n\ndiarrhoea. You may become dehydrated (losing too much fluid) if vomiting or diarrhoea are \nprolonged. \n\n \nIf any of these apply to you, your doctor may need to monitor you more closely while you are on this \nmedicine. \n \nIf you have not taken Rivastigmine Actavis for more than three days, do not take the next dose until \nyou have talked to your doctor. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere is no relevant use of Rivastigmine Actavis in the paediatric population in the treatment of \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease. \n \nOther medicines and Rivastigmine Actavis \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nRivastigmine Actavis should not be given at the same time as other medicines with similar effects to \nRivastigmine Actavis. Rivastigmine Actavis might interfere with anticholinergic medicines \n(medicines used to relieve stomach cramps or spasms, to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease or to prevent travel \nsickness). \n \nRivastigmine Actavis should not be given at the same time as metoclopramide (a medicine used to \nrelieve or prevent nausea and vomiting). Taking the two medicines together could cause problems \nsuch as stiff limbs and trembling hands. \n \nIf you have to undergo surgery whilst taking Rivastigmine Actavis, tell your doctor before you are \ngiven any anaesthetics, because Rivastigmine Actavis may exaggerate the effects of some muscle \nrelaxants during anaesthesia. \n \nCaution when Rivastigmine Actavis is taken together with beta-blockers (medicines such as atenolol \nused to treat hypertension, angina and other heart conditions). Taking the two medicines together \ncould cause problems such as slowing of the heartbeat (bradycardia) leading to fainting or loss of \nconsciousness. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nIf you are pregnant, the benefits of using Rivastigmine Actavis must be assessed against the possible \neffects on your unborn child. Rivastigmine Actavis should not be used during pregnancy, unless \nclearly necessary. \n \nYou should not breast-feed during treatment with Rivastigmine Actavis. \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nYour doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. \nRivastigmine Actavis may cause dizziness and somnolence, mainly at the start of treatment or when \nincreasing the dose. If you feel dizzy or sleepy, do not drive, use machines or perform any tasks that \nrequire your attention. \n \n \n3. How to take Rivastigmine Actavis \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse if you are not sure. \n \nHow to start treatment \nYour doctor will tell you what dose of Rivastigmine Actavis to take. \n\u2022 Treatment usually starts with a low dose. \n\u2022 Your doctor will slowly increase your dose depending on how you respond to treatment. \n\u2022 The highest dose that should be taken is 6 mg twice a day. \n \nYour doctor will regularly check if the medicine is working for you. Your doctor will also monitor \nyour weight whilst you are taking this medicine. \n \nIf you have not taken Rivastigmine Actavis for more than three days, do not take the next dose until \nyou have talked to your doctor. \n \nTaking this medicine \n\u2022 Tell your caregiver that you are taking Rivastigmine Actavis. \n\u2022 To benefit from your medicine, take it every day. \n\u2022 Take Rivastigmine Actavis twice a day, in the morning and evening, with food. \n\u2022 Swallow the capsules whole with a drink. \n\u2022 Do not open or crush the capsules. \n \nIf you take more Rivastigmine Actavis than you should \nIf you accidentally take more Rivastigmine Actavis than you should, inform your doctor. You may \nrequire medical attention. Some people who have accidentally taken too much Rivastigmine Actavis \nhave experienced feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, high blood pressure and \nhallucinations. Slow heartbeat and fainting may also occur. \n \nIf you forget to take Rivastigmine Actavis \nIf you find you have forgotten to take your dose of Rivastigmine Actavis, wait and take the next dose \nat the usual time.

belongs to a class of substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. in patients with alzheimer's dementia or dementia due to parkinson's disease, certain nerve cells die in the brain, resulting in low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to communicate with each other). rivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down acetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. by blocking these enzymes, rivastigmine actavis allows levels of acetylcholine to be increased in the brain, helping to reduce the symptoms of alzheimer's disease and dementia associated with parkinson's disease. rivastigmine actavis is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately severe alzheimer's dementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual ability and behaviour. the capsules and oral solution can also be used for the treatment of dementia in adult patients with parkinson's disease.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "rivastigmine actavis", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 3, "BeginOffset": 24, "EndOffset": 44, "Score":

there is a more intense local reaction (such as blisters, increasing skin inflammation, swelling) and if it does not improve within 48 hours after removal of the transdermal patch. if this applies to you, tell your doctor and do not take rivastigmine actavis. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before taking rivastigmine actavis: if you have, or have ever had, irregular or slow heartbeat. if you have, or have ever had, an active stomach ulcer. if you have, or have ever had, difficulties in passing urine. if you have, or have ever had, seizures. if you have, or have ever had, asthma or severe respiratory disease. if you have, or have ever had impaired kidney function. if you have, or have ever had, impaired liver function. if you suffer from trembling. if you have a low body weight. if you have gastrointestinal reactions such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and diarrhoea. you may become dehydrated (losing too much fluid) if vomiting or diarrhoea are prolonged. if any of these apply to you, your doctor may need to monitor you more closely while you are on this medicine. if you have not taken rivastigmine actavis for more than three days, do not take the next dose until you have talked to your doctor. children and adolescents there is no relevant use of rivastigmine actavis in the paediatric population in the treatment of alzheimer's disease. other medicines and rivastigmine actavis tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. rivastigmine actavis should not be given at the same time as other medicines with similar effects to rivastigmine actavis. rivastigmine actavis might interfere with anticholinergic medicines (medicines used to relieve stomach cramps or spasms, to treat parkinson's disease or to prevent travel sickness). rivastigmine actavis should not be given at the same time as metoclopramide (a medicine used to relieve or prevent nausea and vomiting). taking the two medicines together could cause problems such as stiff limbs and trembling hands. if you have to undergo surgery whilst taking rivastigmine actavis, tell your doctor before you are given any anaesthetics, because rivastigmine actavis may exaggerate the effects of some muscle relaxants during anaesthesia. caution when rivastigmine actavis is taken together with beta-blockers (medicines such as atenolol used to treat hypertension, angina and other heart conditions). taking the two medicines together could cause problems such as slowing of the heartbeat (bradycardia) leading to fainting or loss of consciousness. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. if you are pregnant, the benefits of using rivastigmine actavis must be assessed against the possible effects on your unborn child. rivastigmine
