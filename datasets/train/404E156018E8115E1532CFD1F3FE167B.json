NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEsbriet 267 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains 267 mg pirfenidone. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL form \n \nHard capsule (capsule). \n \nTwo piece capsules with a white to off-white opaque body and white to off-white opaque cap \nimprinted with \u201cPFD 267 mg\u201d in brown ink and containing a white to pale yellow powder. \n \n \n4. Clinical particulars \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEsbriet is indicated in adults for the treatment of mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Esbriet should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of IPF. \n \nPosology  \n \nAdults \nUpon initiating treatment, the dose should be titrated to the recommended daily dose of nine capsules \nper day over a 14-day period as follows: \n \n\u25cf Days 1 to 7: one capsule, three times a day (801 mg/day)  \n\u25cf Days 8 to 14: two capsules, three times a day (1602 mg/day)  \n\u25cf Day 15 onward: three capsules, three times a day (2403 mg/day)  \n \nThe recommended maintenance daily dose of Esbriet is three 267 mg capsules three times a day with \nfood for a total of 2403 mg/day. \n \nDoses above 2403 mg/day are not recommended for any patient (see section 4.9).   \n \nPatients who miss 14 consecutive days or more of Esbriet treatment should re-initiate therapy by \nundergoing the initial 2-week titration regimen up to the recommended daily dose. \n \nFor treatment interruption of less than 14 consecutive days, the dose can be resumed at the previous \nrecommended daily dose without titration. \n \nDose adjustments and other considerations for safe use \nGastrointestinal events:  In patients who experience intolerance to therapy due to gastrointestinal \nundesirable effects, patients should be reminded to take the medicinal product with food. If symptoms \npersist, the dose of pirfenidone may be reduced to 1-2 capsules (267 mg \u2013 534 mg) two to three \ntimes/day with food with re-escalation to the recommended daily dose as tolerated. If symptoms \ncontinue, patients may be instructed to interrupt treatment for one to two weeks to allow symptoms to \nresolve.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nPhotosensitivity reaction or rash:  Patients who experience a mild to moderate photosensitivity \nreaction or rash should be reminded to use a sunblock daily and to avoid exposure to the sun (see \nsection 4.4). The dose of pirfenidone may be reduced to 3 capsules/day (1 capsule three times a day). \nIf the rash persists after 7 days, Esbriet should be discontinued for 15 days, with re-escalation to the \nrecommended daily dose in the same manner as the dose escalation period.  \n \nPatients who experience severe photosensitivity reaction or rash should be instructed to interrupt the \ndose and to seek medical advice (see section 4.4). Once the rash has resolved, Esbriet may be \nre-introduced and re-escalated up to the recommended daily dose at the discretion of the physician. \n \nHepatic function:  In the event of significant elevation of alanine and/or aspartate aminotransferases \n(ALT/AST) with or without bilirubin elevation, the dose of pirfenidone should be adjusted or \ntreatment discontinued according to the guidelines listed in section 4.4. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly   \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients 65 years and older (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment   \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (i.e. Child-Pugh \nClass A and B). However, since plasma levels of pirfenidone may be increased in some individuals \nwith mild to moderate hepatic impairment, caution should be used with Esbriet treatment in this \npopulation. Esbriet therapy should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment or end stage \nliver disease (see section 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment   \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment. Esbriet should be used with \ncaution in patients with moderate (CrCl 30-50 ml/min) renal impairment.  Esbriet therapy should not \nbe used in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 ml/min) or end stage renal disease \nrequiring dialysis (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).   \n \nPaediatric population  \nThere is no relevant use of Esbriet in the paediatric population for the indication of IPF.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nEsbriet is for oral use. The capsules are to be swallowed whole with water and taken with food to \nreduce the possibility of nausea and dizziness (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u25cf Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\u25cf History of angioedema with pirfenidone (see section 4.4). \n\u25cf Concomitant use of fluvoxamine (see section 4.5). \n\u25cf Severe hepatic impairment or end stage liver disease (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\u25cf Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 ml/min) or end stage renal disease requiring dialysis (see \n sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHepatic function \n \nElevations in ALT and AST >3 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) have been reported in patients \nreceiving therapy with Esbriet. Rarely these have been associated with concomitant elevations in total \nserum bilirubin. Liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) should be conducted prior to the \ninitiation of treatment with Esbriet, and subsequently at monthly intervals for the first 6 months and \nthen every 3 months thereafter (see section 4.8). In the event of significant elevation of liver \naminotransferases the dose of Esbriet should be adjusted or treatment discontinued according to the \n\n\n\n4 \n\nguidelines listed below. For patients with confirmed elevations in ALT, AST or bilirubin during \ntreatment, the following dose adjustments may be necessary.  \n \nRecommendations in case of ALT/AST elevations \nIf a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation to >3 to \u22645 x ULN after starting Esbriet therapy, \nconfounding medicinal products should be discontinued, other causes excluded, and the patient \nmonitored closely. If clinically appropriate the dose of Esbriet should be reduced or interrupted. Once \nliver function tests are within normal limits Esbriet may be re-escalated to the recommended daily \ndose if tolerated.  \n \nIf a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation to \u22645 x ULN accompanied by symptoms or \nhyperbilirubinaemia, Esbriet should be discontinued and the patient should not be rechallenged. \n \nIf a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation to >5 x ULN, Esbriet should be discontinued and \nthe patient should not be rechallenged. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (i.e. Child-Pugh Class B), pirfenidone exposure was \nincreased by 60%. Esbriet should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing mild to moderate \nhepatic impairment (i.e. Child-Pugh Class A and B) given the potential for increased pirfenidone \nexposure. Patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity especially if they are \nconcomitantly taking a known CYP1A2 inhibitor (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). Esbriet has not been \nstudied in individuals with severe hepatic impairment and Esbriet must not be used in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nPhotosensitivity reaction and rash \n \nExposure to direct sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided or minimised during treatment \nwith Esbriet. Patients should be instructed to use a sunblock daily, to wear clothing that protects \nagainst sun exposure, and to avoid other medicinal products known to cause photosensitivity. Patients \nshould be instructed to report symptoms of photosensitivity reaction or rash to their physician. Severe \nphotosensitivity reactions are uncommon. Dose adjustments or temporary treatment discontinuation \nmay be necessary in mild to severe cases of photosensitivity reaction or rash (see section 4.2). \n \nAngioedema/Anaphylaxis \n \nReports of angioedema (some serious) such as swelling of the face, lips and/or tongue which may be \nassociated with difficulty breathing or wheezing have been received in association with use of Esbriet \nin the post-marketing setting. Reports of anaphylactic reactions have also been received. Therefore, \npatients who develop signs or symptoms of angioedema or severe allergic reactions following \nadministration of Esbriet should immediately discontinue treatment. Patients with angioedema or \nsevere allergic reactions should be managed according to standard of care. Esbriet must not be used in \npatients with a history of angioedema or hypersensitivity due to Esbriet (see section 4.3). \n \nDizziness \n \nDizziness has been reported in patients taking Esbriet. Therefore, patients should know how they react \nto this medicinal product before they engage in activities requiring mental alertness or coordination \n(see section 4.7). In clinical studies, most patients who experienced dizziness had a single event, and \nmost events resolved, with a median duration of 22 days. If dizziness does not improve or if it worsens \nin severity, dose adjustment or even discontinuation of Esbriet may be warranted. \n \nFatigue \n \nFatigue has been reported in patients taking Esbriet. Therefore, patients should know how they react to \nthis medicinal product before they engage in activities requiring mental alertness or coordination (see \nsection 4.7). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nWeight loss \n \nWeight loss has been reported in patients treated with Esbriet (see section 4.8). Physicians should \nmonitor patient\u2019s weight, and when appropriate encourage increased caloric intake if weight loss is \nconsidered to be of clinical significance. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nApproximately 70\u201380% of pirfenidone is metabolised via CYP1A2 with minor contributions from \nother CYP isoenzymes including CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1.  \n \nConsumption of grapefruit juice is associated with inhibition of CYP1A2 and should be avoided \nduring treatment with pirfenidone.  \n \nFluvoxamine and inhibitors of CYP1A2 \n \nIn a Phase 1 study, the co-administration of Esbriet and fluvoxamine (a strong inhibitor of CYP1A2 \nwith inhibitory effects on other CYP isoenzymes [CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2D6]) resulted in a 4-fold \nincrease in exposure to pirfenidone in non-smokers.  \n \nEsbriet is contraindicated in patients with concomitant use of fluvoxamine (see section 4.3).  \nFluvoxamine should be discontinued prior to the initiation of Esbriet therapy and avoided during \nEsbriet therapy due to the reduced clearance of pirfenidone. Other therapies that are inhibitors of both \nCYP1A2 and one or more other CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of pirfenidone \n(e.g. CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2D6) should be avoided during pirfenidone treatment. \n \nIn vitro and in vivo extrapolations indicate that strong and selective inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g. \nenoxacin) have the potential to increase the exposure to pirfenidone by approximately 2 to 4-fold.  If \nconcomitant use of Esbriet with a strong and selective inhibitor of CYP1A2 cannot be avoided, the \ndose of pirfenidone should be reduced to 801 mg daily (one capsule, three times a day). Patients \nshould be closely monitored for emergence of adverse reactions associated with Esbriet therapy. \nDiscontinue Esbriet if necessary (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCo-administration of Esbriet and 750 mg of ciprofloxacin (a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2) increased \nthe exposure to pirfenidone by 81%. If ciprofloxacin at the dose of 750 mg two times a day cannot be \navoided, the dose of pirfenidone should be reduced to 1602 mg daily (two capsules, three times a day). \nEsbriet should be used with caution when ciprofloxacin is used at a dose of 250 mg or 500 mg once or \ntwo times a day.  \n \nEsbriet should be used with caution in patients treated with other moderate inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g. \namiodarone, propafenone).  \n \nSpecial care should also be exercised if CYP1A2 inhibitors are being used concomitantly with potent \ninhibitors of one or more other CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of pirfenidone such as \nCYP2C9 (e.g. amiodarone, fluconazole), 2C19 (e.g. chloramphenicol) and 2D6 (e.g. fluoxetine, \nparoxetine). \n \nCigarette smoking and inducers of CYP1A2 \n \nA Phase 1 interaction study evaluated the effect of cigarette smoking (CYP1A2 inducer) on the \npharmacokinetics of pirfenidone. The exposure to pirfenidone in smokers was 50% of that observed in \nnon-smokers. Smoking has the potential to induce hepatic enzyme production and thus increase \nmedicinal product clearance and decrease exposure. Concomitant use of strong inducers of CYP1A2 \nincluding smoking should be avoided during Esbriet therapy based on the observed relationship \nbetween cigarette smoking and its potential to induce CYP1A2. Patients should be encouraged to \ndiscontinue use of strong inducers of CYP1A2 and to stop smoking before and during treatment with \npirfenidone.  \n \nIn the case of moderate inducers of CYP1A2 (e.g. omeprazole), concomitant use may theoretically \nresult in a lowering of pirfenidone plasma levels. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nCo-administration of medicinal products that act as potent inducers of both CYP1A2 and the other \nCYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of pirfenidone (e.g. rifampicin) may result in significant \nlowering of pirfenidone plasma levels. These medicinal products should be avoided whenever \npossible. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of Esbriet in pregnant women.  \nIn animals placental transfer of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites occurs with the potential for \naccumulation of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in amniotic fluid. \n \nAt high doses (\u22651,000 mg/kg/day) rats exhibited prolongation of gestation and reduction in foetal \nviability.  \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Esbriet during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether pirfenidone or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in milk \nwith the potential for accumulation of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). A \nrisk to the breastfed infant cannot be excluded.   \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue from Esbriet therapy, \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of Esbriet therapy for the \nmother. \n \nFertility \n \nNo adverse effects on fertility were observed in preclinical studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEsbriet may cause dizziness and fatigue, which could have a moderate influence on the ability to drive \nor use machines, therefore patients should exercise caution when driving or operating machinery if \nthey experience these symptoms. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during clinical study experience with Esbriet at a dose \nof 2,403 mg/day compared to placebo, respectively, were nausea (32.4% versus 12.2%), rash (26.2% \nversus 7.7%), diarrhoea (18.8% versus 14.4%), fatigue (18.5% versus 10.4%), dyspepsia (16.1% \nversus 5.0%), anorexia (11.4% versus 3.5%), headache (10.1% versus 7.7%), and photosensitivity \nreaction (9.3% versus 1.1%).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe safety of Esbriet has been evaluated in clinical studies including 1,650 volunteers and patients. \nMore than 170 patients have been investigated in open studies for more than five years and some for \nup to 10 years. \n \nTable 1 shows the adverse reactions reported at a frequency of \u22652% in 623 patients receiving Esbriet \nat the recommended dose of 2,403 mg/day in three pooled pivotal Phase 3 studies. Adverse reactions \nfrom post-marketing experience are also listed in Table 1. Adverse reactions are listed by System \nOrgan Class (SOC) and within each frequency grouping [Very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to \n<1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data)] the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nTable 1 Adverse reactions by SOC and MedDRA frequency \nInfections and infestations \nCommon Upper respiratory tract infection; urinary tract infection \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nRare Agranulocytosis1 \nImmune system disorders \nUncommon Angioedema1 \nNot known Anaphylaxis1 \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery Common Anorexia \nCommon Weight decreased; decreased appetite \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon Insomnia \nNervous system disorders \nVery Common Headache \nCommon Dizziness; somnolence; dysgeusia; lethargy \nVascular disorders \nCommon Hot flush \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon Dyspnoea; cough; productive cough \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery Common Dyspepsia; nausea; diarrhoea \nCommon Gastroesophageal reflux disease; vomiting; abdominal distension; abdominal \n\ndiscomfort; abdominal pain; abdominal pain upper; stomach discomfort; \ngastritis; constipation; flatulence \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \nCommon ALT increased; AST increased; gamma glutamyl transferase increased \nRare Total serum bilirubin increased in combination with increases of ALT and \n\nAST1 \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery Common Photosensitivity reaction; rash  \nCommon Pruritus; erythema; dry skin; rash erythematous; rash macular; rash pruritic \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon Myalgia; arthralgia  \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery Common Fatigue \nCommon Asthenia; non-cardiac chest pain \nInjury poisoning and procedural complications \nCommon Sunburn \n\n1. Identified through post-marketing surveillance \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited clinical experience with overdose. Multiple doses of pirfenidone up to a total dose of \n4,806 mg/day were administered as six 267 mg capsules three times daily to healthy adult volunteers \nover a 12-day dose escalation period. Adverse reactions were mild, transient, and consistent with the \nmost frequently reported adverse reactions for pirfenidone. \n \nIn the event of a suspected overdose, supportive medical care should be provided including monitoring \nof vital signs and close observation of the clinical status of the patient. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, other immunosuppressants, ATC code:  L04AX05 \n \nThe mechanism of action of pirfenidone has not been fully established. However, existing data suggest \nthat pirfenidone exerts both antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in a variety of in vitro \nsystems and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis (bleomycin- and transplant-induced fibrosis). \n \nIPF is a chronic fibrotic and inflammatory pulmonary disease affected by the synthesis and release of \npro-inflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1-beta \n(IL-1\u03b2) and pirfenidone has been shown to reduce the accumulation of inflammatory cells in response \nto various stimuli.  \n \nPirfenidone attenuates fibroblast proliferation, production of fibrosis-associated proteins and \ncytokines, and the increased biosynthesis and accumulation of extracellular matrix in response to \ncytokine growth factors such as, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) and platelet-derived growth \nfactor (PDGF). \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nThe clinical efficacy of Esbriet has been studied in four Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with IPF. Three of the Phase 3 studies (PIPF-004, \nPIPF-006, and PIPF-016) were multinational, and one (SP3) was conducted in Japan.  \n \nPIPF-004 and PIPF-006 compared treatment with Esbriet 2403 mg/day to placebo. The studies were \nnearly identical in design, with few exceptions including an intermediate dose group (1,197 mg/day) in \nPIPF-004. In both studies, treatment was administered three times daily for a minimum of 72 weeks. \nThe primary endpoint in both studies was the change from Baseline to Week 72 in percent predicted \nForced Vital Capacity (FVC). \n \nIn study PIPF-004, the decline of percent predicted FVC from Baseline at Week 72 of treatment was \nsignificantly reduced in patients receiving Esbriet (N=174) compared with patients receiving placebo \n(N=174; p=0.001, rank ANCOVA). Treatment with Esbriet also significantly reduced the decline of \npercent predicted FVC from Baseline at Weeks 24 (p=0.014), 36 (p<0.001), 48 (p<0.001), and \n60 (p<0.001). At Week 72, a decline from baseline in percent predicted FVC of \u226510% (a threshold \nindicative of the risk of mortality in IPF) was seen in 20% of patients receiving Esbriet compared to \n35% receiving placebo (Table 2).  \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 2 Categorical assessment of change from Baseline to Week 72 \nin percent predicted FVC in study PIPF-004 \n\n \n\nPirfenidone  \n2,403 mg/day \n\n(N = 174) \nPlacebo \n\n(N = 174) \nDecline of \u226510% or death or lung transplant 35 (20%) 60 (34%) \nDecline of less than 10% 97 (56%) 90 (52%) \nNo decline (FVC change >0%) 42 (24%) 24 (14%) \n\n \nAlthough there was no difference between patients receiving Esbriet compared to placebo in change \nfrom Baseline to Week 72 of distance walked during a six minute walk test (6MWT) by the \nprespecified rank ANCOVA, in an ad hoc analysis, 37% of patients receiving Esbriet showed a \ndecline of \u226550 m in 6MWT distance, compared to 47% of patients receiving placebo in PIPF-004. \n \nIn study PIPF-006, treatment with Esbriet (N=171) did not reduce the decline of percent predicted \nFVC from Baseline at Week 72 compared with placebo (N=173; p=0.501). However, treatment with \nEsbriet reduced the decline of percent predicted FVC from Baseline at Weeks 24 (p<0.001), \n36 (p=0.011), and 48 (p=0.005). At Week 72, a decline in FVC of \u226510% was seen in 23% of patients \nreceiving Esbriet and 27% receiving placebo (Table 3).  \n \n\nTable 3 Categorical assessment of change from Baseline to Week 72 \nin percent predicted FVC in study PIPF-006 \n\n \n\nPirfenidone  \n2,403 mg/day \n\n(N = 171) \nPlacebo \n\n(N = 173) \nDecline of \u226510% or death or lung transplant 39 (23%) 46 (27%) \nDecline of less than 10% 88 (52%) 89 (51%) \nNo decline (FVC change >0%) 44 (26%) 38 (22%) \n\n \nThe decline in 6MWT distance from Baseline to Week 72 was significantly reduced compared with \nplacebo in study PIPF-006 (p<0.001, rank ANCOVA). Additionally, in an ad hoc analysis, 33% of \npatients receiving Esbriet showed a decline of \u226550 m in 6MWT distance, compared to 47% of patients \nreceiving placebo in PIPF-006. \n \nIn a pooled analysis of survival in PIPF-004 and PIPF-006 the mortality rate with Esbriet 2403 mg/day \ngroup was 7.8% compared with 9.8% with placebo (HR 0.77 [95% CI, 0.47\u20131.28]).  \n \nPIPF-016 compared treatment with Esbriet 2,403 mg/day to placebo. Treatment was administered \nthree times daily for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change from Baseline to Week 52 in \npercent predicted FVC. In a total of 555 patients, the median baseline percent predicted FVC and \n%DLCO were 68% (range: 48\u201391%) and 42% (range: 27\u2013170%), respectively. Two percent of patients \nhad percent predicted FVC below 50% and 21% of patients had a percent predicted DLCO below 35% \nat Baseline. \n \nIn study PIPF-016, the decline of percent predicted FVC from Baseline at Week 52 of treatment was \nsignificantly reduced in patients receiving Esbriet (N=278) compared with patients receiving placebo \n(N=277; p<0.000001, rank ANCOVA). Treatment with Esbriet also significantly reduced the decline \nof percent predicted FVC from Baseline at Weeks 13 (p<0.000001), 26 (p<0.000001), and 39 \n(p=0.000002). At Week 52, a decline from Baseline in percent predicted FVC of \u226510% or death was \nseen in 17% of patients receiving Esbriet compared to 32% receiving placebo (Table 4). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 4 Categorical assessment of change from Baseline to Week 52 \nin percent predicted FVC in study PIPF-016 \n\n \n\nPirfenidone  \n2,403 mg/day \n\n(N = 278) \nPlacebo \n\n(N = 277) \nDecline of \u226510% or death 46 (17%) 88 (32%) \nDecline of less than 10% 169 (61%) 162 (58%) \nNo decline (FVC change >0%) 63 (23%) 27 (10%) \n\n \nThe decline in distance walked during a 6MWT from Baseline to Week 52 was significantly reduced \nin patients receiving Esbriet compared with patients receiving placebo in PIPF-016 (p=0.036, rank \nANCOVA); 26% of patients receiving Esbriet showed a decline of \u226550 m in 6MWT distance \ncompared to 36% of patients receiving placebo. \n \nIn a pre-specified pooled analysis of studies PIPF-016, PIPF-004, and PIPF-006 at Month 12, all-cause \nmortality was significantly lower in Esbriet 2403 mg/day group (3.5%, 22 of 623 patients) compared \nwith placebo (6.7%, 42 of 624 patients), resulting in a 48% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality \nwithin the first 12 months (HR 0.52 [95% CI, 0.31\u20130.87], p=0.0107, log-rank test).  \n \nThe study (SP3) in Japanese patients compared pirfenidone 1800 mg/day (comparable to 2403 mg/day \nin the US and European populations of PIPF-004/006 on a weight-normalised basis) with placebo \n(N=110, N=109, respectively). Treatment with pirfenidone significantly reduced mean decline in vital \ncapacity (VC) at Week 52 (the primary endpoint) compared with placebo (-0.09\u00b10.02 l versus \n-0.16\u00b10.02 l respectively, p=0.042). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nEsbriet in all subsets of the paediatric population in IPF (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAdministration of Esbriet capsules with food results in a large reduction in Cmax (by 50%) and a \nsmaller effect on AUC, compared to the fasted state. Following oral administration of a single dose of \n801 mg to healthy older adult volunteers (50-66 years of age) in the fed state, the rate of pirfenidone \nabsorption slowed, while the AUC in the fed state was approximately 80-85% of the AUC observed in \nthe fasted state. Bioequivalence was demonstrated in the fasted state when comparing the 801 mg \ntablet to three 267 mg capsules. In the fed state, the 801 mg tablet met bioequivalence criteria based on \nthe AUC measurements compared to the capsules, while the 90% confidence intervals for Cmax \n(108.26% - 125.60%) slightly exceeded the upper bound of standard bioequivalence limit (90% CI:  \n80.00% - 125.00%). The effect of food on pirfenidone oral AUC was consistent between the tablet and \ncapsule formulations. Compared to the fasted state, administration of either formulation with food \nreduced pirfenidone Cmax, with Esbriet tablet reducing the Cmax slightly less (by 40%) than Esbriet \ncapsules (by 50%). A reduced incidence of adverse events (nausea and dizziness) was observed in fed \nsubjects when compared to the fasted group. Therefore, it is recommended that Esbriet be \nadministered with food to reduce the incidence of nausea and dizziness.  \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of pirfenidone has not been determined in humans. \n \nDistribution \n \nPirfenidone binds to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin. The overall mean binding \nranged from 50% to 58% at concentrations observed in clinical studies (1 to 100 \u03bcg/ml). Mean \napparent oral steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 70 l, indicating that pirfenidone \ndistribution to tissues is modest. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nBiotransformation \n \nApproximately 70\u201380% of pirfenidone is metabolised via CYP1A2 with minor contributions from \nother CYP isoenzymes including CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. In vitro data indicate some \npharmacologically relevant activity of the major metabolite (5-carboxy-pirfenidone) at concentrations \nin excess of peak plasma concentrations in IPF patients. This may become clinically relevant in \npatients with moderate renal impairment where plasma exposure to 5-carboxy-pirfenidone is \nincreased. \n \nElimination \n \nThe oral clearance of pirfenidone appears modestly saturable. In a multiple-dose, dose-ranging study \nin healthy older adults administered doses ranging from 267 mg to 1,335 mg three times a day, the \nmean clearance decreased by approximately 25% above a dose of 801 mg three times a day. Following \nsingle dose administration of pirfenidone in healthy older adults, the mean apparent terminal \nelimination half-life was approximately 2.4 hours. Approximately 80% of an orally administered dose \nof pirfenidone is cleared in the urine within 24 hours of dosing. The majority of pirfenidone is \nexcreted as the 5-carboxy-pirfenidone metabolite (>95% of that recovered), with less than 1% of \npirfenidone excreted unchanged in urine. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone and the 5-carboxy-pirfenidone metabolite were compared in \nsubjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and in subjects with normal hepatic \nfunction. Results showed that there was a mean increase of 60% in pirfenidone exposure after a single \ndose of 801 mg pirfenidone (3 x 267 mg capsule) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. \nPirfenidone should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and \npatients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity especially if they are concomitantly taking a \nknown CYP1A2 inhibitor (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Esbriet is contraindicated in severe hepatic \nimpairment and end stage liver disease (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone were observed in subjects \nwith mild to severe renal impairment compared with subjects with normal renal function. The parent \nsubstance is predominantly metabolised to 5-carboxy-pirfenidone.  The mean (SD) AUC0-\u221e of 5-\ncarboxy-pirfenidone was significantly higher in the moderate (p = 0.009) and severe (p < 0.0001) renal \nimpairment groups than in the group with normal renal function. ; 100 (26.3) mg\u2022h/L and 168 (67.4) \nmg\u2022h/L compared to 28.7 (4.99) mg\u2022h/L respectively. \n \n\nRenal \nImpairment \n\nGroup \n\n \nStatistics \n\nAUC0-\u221e (mg\u2022hr/L) \n\nPirfenidone 5-Carboxy-Pirfenidone \n\nNormal Mean (SD) 42.6 (17.9) 28.7 (4.99) \nn = 6 Median (25th\u201375th) 42.0 (33.1\u201355.6) 30.8 (24.1\u201332.1) \nMild Mean (SD) 59.1 (21.5) 49.3\n\na \n(14.6) \n\nn = 6 Median (25th\u201375th) 51.6 (43.7\u201380.3) 43.0 (38.8\u201356.8) \nModerate Mean (SD) 63.5 (19.5) 100\n\nb \n(26.3) \n\nn = 6 Median (25th\u201375th) 66.7 (47.7\u201376.7) 96.3 (75.2\u2013123) \nSevere Mean (SD) 46.7 (10.9) 168\n\nc \n(67.4) \n\nn = 6 Median (25th\u201375th) 49.4 (40.7\u201355.8) 150 (123\u2013248) \n \nAUC0-\u221e  = area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity. \na p-value versus Normal = 1.00 (pair-wise comparison with Bonferroni) \nb p-value versus Normal = 0.009 (pair-wise comparison with Bonferroni) \nc p-value versus Normal < 0.0001 (pair-wise comparison with Bonferroni)  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nExposure to 5-carboxy-pirfenidone increases 3.5 fold or more in patients with moderate renal \nimpairment. Clinically relevant pharmacodynamic activity of the metabolite in patients with moderate \nrenal impairment cannot be excluded. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal \nimpairment who are receiving pirfenidone.  Pirfenidone should be used with caution in patients with \nmoderate renal impairment.  The use of pirfenidone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal \nimpairment (CrCl <30ml/min) or end stage renal disease requiring dialysis (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses from 4 studies in healthy subjects or subjects with renal \nimpairment and one study in patients with IPF showed no clinically relevant effect of age, gender or \nbody size on the pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. \n \nIn repeated dose toxicity studies increases in liver weight were observed in mice, rats and dogs; this \nwas often accompanied by hepatic centrilobular hypertrophy. Reversibility was observed after \ncessation of treatment. An increased incidence of liver tumours was observed in carcinogenicity \nstudies conducted in rats and mice. These hepatic findings are consistent with an induction of hepatic \nmicrosomal enzymes, an effect which has not been observed in patients receiving Esbriet. These \nfindings are not considered relevant to humans.  \n \nA statistically significant increase in uterine tumours was observed in female rats administered \n1,500 mg/kg/day, 37 times the human dose of 2,403 mg/day. The results of mechanistic studies \nindicate that the occurrence of uterine tumours is probably related to a chronic dopamine-mediated sex \nhormone imbalance involving a species specific endocrine mechanism in the rat which is not present \nin humans. \n \nReproductive toxicology studies demonstrated no adverse effects on male and female fertility or \npostnatal development of offspring in rats and there was no evidence of teratogenicity in rats \n(1,000 mg/kg/day) or rabbits (300 mg/kg/day). In animals placental transfer of pirfenidone and/or its \nmetabolites occurs with the potential for accumulation of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in \namniotic fluid. At high doses (\u2265450 mg/kg/day) rats exhibited a prolongation of oestrous cycle and a \nhigh incidence of irregular cycles. At high doses (\u22651,000 mg/kg/day) rats exhibited a prolongation of \ngestation and reduction in fetal viability. Studies in lactating rats indicate that pirfenidone and/or its \nmetabolites are excreted in milk with the potential for accumulation of pirfenidone and/or its \nmetabolites in milk. \n \nPirfenidone showed no indication of mutagenic or genotoxic activity in a standard battery of tests and \nwhen tested under UV exposure was not mutagenic. When tested under UV exposure pirfenidone was \npositive in a photoclastogenic assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. \n \nPhototoxicity and irritation were noted in guinea pigs after oral administration of pirfenidone and with \nexposure to UVA/UVB light. The severity of phototoxic lesions was minimised by application of \nsunscreen.   \n \n \n6.

Clinical particulars \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEsbriet is indicated in adults for the treatment of mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Esbriet should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of IPF. \n \nPosology  \n \nAdults \nUpon initiating treatment, the dose should be titrated to the recommended daily dose of 2403 mg/day \nover a 14-day period as follows: \n \n\u25cf Days 1 to 7: a dose of 267 mg administered three times a day (801 mg/day)  \n\u25cf Days 8 to 14: a dose of 534 mg administered three times a day (1602 mg/day)  \n\u25cf Day 15 onward: a dose of 801 mg administered three times a day (2403 mg/day)  \n \nThe recommended maintenance daily dose of Esbriet is 801 mg three times a day with food for a total \nof 2403 mg/day. \n \nDoses above 2403 mg/day are not recommended for any patient (see section 4.9).   \n \nPatients who miss 14 consecutive days or more of Esbriet treatment should re-initiate therapy by \nundergoing the initial 2-week titration regimen up to the recommended daily dose. \n \nFor treatment interruption of less than 14 consecutive days, the dose can be resumed at the previous \nrecommended daily dose without titration. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nDose adjustments and other considerations for safe use \nGastrointestinal events:  In patients who experience intolerance to therapy due to gastrointestinal \nundesirable effects, patients should be reminded to take the medicinal product with food. If symptoms \npersist, the dose of pirfenidone may be reduced to 267 mg \u2013 534 mg, two to three times a day with \nfood with re-escalation to the recommended daily dose as tolerated. If symptoms continue, patients \nmay be instructed to interrupt treatment for one to two weeks to allow symptoms to resolve.  \n \nPhotosensitivity reaction or rash:  Patients who experience a mild to moderate photosensitivity \nreaction or rash should be reminded to use a sunblock daily and avoid exposure to the sun (see section \n4.4). The dose of pirfenidone may be reduced to 801 mg each day (267 mg three times a day). If the \nrash persists after 7 days, Esbriet should be discontinued for 15 days, with re-escalation to the \nrecommended daily dose in the same manner as the dose escalation period.  \n \nPatients who experience severe photosensitivity reaction or rash should be instructed to interrupt the \ndose and to seek medical advice (see section 4.4). Once the rash has resolved, Esbriet may be \nre-introduced and re-escalated up to the recommended daily dose at the discretion of the physician. \n \nHepatic function:  In the event of significant elevation of alanine and/or aspartate aminotransferases \n(ALT/AST) with or without bilirubin elevation, the dose of pirfenidone should be adjusted or \ntreatment discontinued according to the guidelines listed in section 4.4. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly   \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients 65 years and older (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment   \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (i.e. Child-Pugh \nClass A and B). However, since plasma levels of pirfenidone may be increased in some individuals \nwith mild to moderate hepatic impairment, caution should be used with Esbriet treatment in this \npopulation. Esbriet therapy should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment or end stage \nliver disease (see section 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).  \n \nRenal impairment   \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment. Esbriet should be used with \ncaution in patients with moderate (CrCl 30-50 ml/min) renal impairment. Esbriet therapy should not \nbe used in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 ml/min) or end stage renal disease \nrequiring dialysis (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).   \n \nPaediatric population  \nThere is no relevant use of Esbriet in the paediatric population for the indication of IPF.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nEsbriet is for oral use. The tablets are to be swallowed whole with water and taken with food to reduce \nthe possibility of nausea and dizziness (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u25cf Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\u25cf History of angioedema with pirfenidone (see section 4.4). \n\u25cf Concomitant use of fluvoxamine (see section 4.5). \n\u25cf Severe hepatic impairment or end stage liver disease (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\u25cf Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 ml/min) or end stage renal disease requiring dialysis (see \n sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHepatic function \n \nElevations in ALT and AST >3 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) have been reported in patients \nreceiving therapy with Esbriet. Rarely these have been associated with concomitant elevations in total \nserum bilirubin. Liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) should be conducted prior to the \ninitiation of treatment with Esbriet, and subsequently at monthly intervals for the first 6 months and \nthen every 3 months thereafter (see section 4.8). In the event of significant elevation of liver \naminotransferases the dose of Esbriet should be adjusted or treatment discontinued according to the \nguidelines listed below. For patients with confirmed elevations in ALT, AST or bilirubin during \ntreatment, the following dose adjustments may be necessary.  \n \nRecommendations in case of ALT/AST elevations \nIf a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation to >3 to \u22645 x ULN after starting Esbriet therapy, \nconfounding medicinal products should be discontinued, other causes excluded, and the patient \nmonitored closely. If clinically appropriate the dose of Esbriet should be reduced or interrupted. Once \nliver function tests are within normal limits Esbriet may be re-escalated to the recommended daily \ndose if tolerated.  \n \nIf a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation to \u22645 x ULN accompanied by symptoms or \nhyperbilirubinaemia, Esbriet should be discontinued and the patient should not be rechallenged. \n \nIf a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation to >5 x ULN, Esbriet should be discontinued and \nthe patient should not be rechallenged. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (i.e. Child-Pugh Class B), pirfenidone exposure was \nincreased by 60%. Esbriet should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing mild to moderate \nhepatic impairment (i.e. Child-Pugh Class A and B) given the potential for increased pirfenidone \nexposure. Patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity especially if they are \nconcomitantly taking a known CYP1A2 inhibitor (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). Esbriet has not been \nstudied in individuals with severe hepatic impairment and Esbriet must not be used in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nPhotosensitivity reaction and rash \n \nExposure to direct sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided or minimised during treatment \nwith Esbriet. Patients should be instructed to use a sunblock daily, to wear clothing that protects \nagainst sun exposure, and to avoid other medicinal products known to cause photosensitivity. Patients \nshould be instructed to report symptoms of photosensitivity reaction or rash to their physician. Severe \nphotosensitivity reactions are uncommon. Dose adjustments or temporary treatment discontinuation \nmay be necessary in mild to severe cases of photosensitivity reaction or rash (see section 4.2). \n \nAngioedema/Anaphylaxis \n \nReports of angioedema (some serious) such as swelling of the face, lips and/or tongue which may be \nassociated with difficulty breathing or wheezing have been received in association with use of Esbriet \nin the post-marketing setting. Reports of anaphylactic reactions have also been received. Therefore, \npatients who develop signs or symptoms of angioedema or severe allergic reactions following \nadministration of Esbriet should immediately discontinue treatment. Patients with angioedema or \nsevere allergic reactions should be managed according to standard of care. Esbriet must not be used in \npatients with a history of angioedema or hypersensitivity due to Esbriet (see section 4.3). \n \nDizziness \n \nDizziness has been reported in patients taking Esbriet. Therefore, patients should know how they react \nto this medicinal product before they engage in activities requiring mental alertness or coordination \n(see section 4.7). In clinical studies, most patients who experienced dizziness had a single event, and \n\n\n\n18 \n\nmost events resolved, with a median duration of 22 days. If dizziness does not improve or if it worsens \nin severity, dose adjustment or even discontinuation of Esbriet may be warranted. \n \nFatigue \n \nFatigue has been reported in patients taking Esbriet. Therefore, patients should know how they react to \nthis medicinal product before they engage in activities requiring mental alertness or coordination (see \nsection 4.7). \n \nWeight loss \n \nWeight loss has been reported in patients treated with Esbriet (see section 4.8). Physicians should \nmonitor patient\u2019s weight, and when appropriate encourage increased caloric intake if weight loss is \nconsidered to be of clinical significance. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nApproximately 70\u201380% of pirfenidone is metabolised via CYP1A2 with minor contributions from \nother CYP isoenzymes including CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1.  \n \nConsumption of grapefruit juice is associated with inhibition of CYP1A2 and should be avoided \nduring treatment with pirfenidone.  \n \nFluvoxamine and inhibitors of CYP1A2 \n \nIn a Phase 1 study, the co-administration of Esbriet and fluvoxamine (a strong inhibitor of CYP1A2 \nwith inhibitory effects on other CYP isoenzymes [CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2D6]) resulted in a 4-fold \nincrease in exposure to pirfenidone in non-smokers.  \n \nEsbriet is contraindicated in patients with concomitant use of fluvoxamine (see section 4.3).  \nFluvoxamine should be discontinued prior to the initiation of Esbriet therapy and avoided during \nEsbriet therapy due to the reduced clearance of pirfenidone. Other therapies that are inhibitors of both \nCYP1A2 and one or more other CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of pirfenidone \n(e.g. CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2D6) should be avoided during pirfenidone treatment. \n \nIn vitro and in vivo extrapolations indicate that strong and selective inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g. \nenoxacin) have the potential to increase the exposure to pirfenidone by approximately 2 to 4-fold.  If \nconcomitant use of Esbriet with a strong and selective inhibitor of CYP1A2 cannot be avoided, the \ndose of pirfenidone should be reduced to 801 mg daily (267 mg, three times a day). Patients should be \nclosely monitored for emergence of adverse reactions associated with Esbriet therapy. Discontinue \nEsbriet if necessary (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCo-administration of Esbriet and 750 mg of ciprofloxacin (a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2) increased \nthe exposure to pirfenidone by 81%. If ciprofloxacin at the dose of 750 mg two times a day cannot be \navoided, the dose of pirfenidone should be reduced to 1602 mg daily (534 mg, three times a day). \nEsbriet should be used with caution when ciprofloxacin is used at a dose of 250 mg or 500 mg once or \ntwo times a day.  \n \nEsbriet should be used with caution in patients treated with other moderate inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g. \namiodarone, propafenone).  \n \nSpecial care should also be exercised if CYP1A2 inhibitors are being used concomitantly with potent \ninhibitors of one or more other CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of pirfenidone such as \nCYP2C9 (e.g. amiodarone, fluconazole), 2C19 (e.g. chloramphenicol) and 2D6 (e.g. fluoxetine, \nparoxetine). \n \nCigarette smoking and inducers of CYP1A2 \n \nA Phase 1 interaction study evaluated the effect of cigarette smoking (CYP1A2 inducer) on the \npharmacokinetics of pirfenidone. The exposure to pirfenidone in smokers was 50% of that observed in \n\n\n\n19 \n\nnon-smokers. Smoking has the potential to induce hepatic enzyme production and thus increase \nmedicinal product clearance and decrease exposure. Concomitant use of strong inducers of CYP1A2 \nincluding smoking should be avoided during Esbriet therapy based on the observed relationship \nbetween cigarette smoking and its potential to induce CYP1A2. Patients should be encouraged to \ndiscontinue use of strong inducers of CYP1A2 and to stop smoking before and during treatment with \npirfenidone.  \n \nIn the case of moderate inducers of CYP1A2 (e.g. omeprazole), concomitant use may theoretically \nresult in a lowering of pirfenidone plasma levels. \n \nCo-administration of medicinal products that act as potent inducers of both CYP1A2 and the other \nCYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of pirfenidone (e.g. rifampicin) may result in significant \nlowering of pirfenidone plasma levels. These medicinal products should be avoided whenever \npossible. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of Esbriet in pregnant women.  \nIn animals placental transfer of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites occurs with the potential for \naccumulation of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in amniotic fluid. \n \nAt high doses (\u22651,000 mg/kg/day) rats exhibited prolongation of gestation and reduction in foetal \nviability.  \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Esbriet during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether pirfenidone or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in milk \nwith the potential for accumulation of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). A \nrisk to the breastfed infant cannot be excluded.   \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue from Esbriet therapy, \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of Esbriet therapy for the \nmother. \n \nFertility \n \nNo adverse effects on fertility were observed in preclinical studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEsbriet may cause dizziness and fatigue, which could have a moderate influence on the ability to drive \nor use machines, therefore patients should exercise caution when driving or operating machinery if \nthey experience these symptoms.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during clinical study experience with Esbriet at a dose \nof 2,403 mg/day compared to placebo, respectively, were nausea (32.4% versus 12.2%), rash (26.2% \nversus 7.7%), diarrhoea (18.8% versus 14.4%), fatigue (18.5% versus 10.4%), dyspepsia (16.1% \nversus 5.0%), anorexia (11.4% versus 3.5%), headache (10.1% versus 7.7%), and photosensitivity \nreaction (9.3% versus 1.1%).  \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe safety of Esbriet has been evaluated in clinical studies including 1,650 volunteers and patients. \nMore than 170 patients have been investigated in open studies for more than five years and some for \nup to 10 years. \n \nTable 1 shows the adverse reactions reported at a frequency of \u22652% in 623 patients receiving Esbriet \nat the recommended dose of 2,403 mg/day in three pooled pivotal Phase 3 studies.

Identified through post-marketing surveillance \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited clinical experience with overdose. Multiple doses of pirfenidone up to a total dose of \n4,806 mg/day were administered as six 267 mg capsules three times daily to healthy adult volunteers \nover a 12-day dose escalation period. Adverse reactions were mild, transient, and consistent with the \nmost frequently reported adverse reactions for pirfenidone. \n \nIn the event of a suspected overdose, supportive medical care should be provided including monitoring \nof vital signs and close observation of the clinical status of the patient. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, other immunosuppressants, ATC code:  L04AX05 \n \nThe mechanism of action of pirfenidone has not been fully established. However, existing data suggest \nthat pirfenidone exerts both antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in a variety of in vitro \nsystems and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis (bleomycin- and transplant-induced fibrosis). \n \nIPF is a chronic fibrotic and inflammatory pulmonary disease affected by the synthesis and release of \npro-inflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1-beta \n(IL-1\u03b2) and pirfenidone has been shown to reduce the accumulation of inflammatory cells in response \nto various stimuli.  \n \nPirfenidone attenuates fibroblast proliferation, production of fibrosis-associated proteins and \ncytokines, and the increased biosynthesis and accumulation of extracellular matrix in response to \ncytokine growth factors such as, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) and platelet-derived growth \nfactor (PDGF). \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nThe clinical efficacy of Esbriet has been studied in four Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with IPF. Three of the Phase 3 studies (PIPF-004, \nPIPF-006, and PIPF-016) were multinational, and one (SP3) was conducted in Japan.  \n \nPIPF-004 and PIPF-006 compared treatment with Esbriet 2403 mg/day to placebo. The studies were \nnearly identical in design, with few exceptions including an intermediate dose group (1,197 mg/day) in \nPIPF-004. In both studies, treatment was administered three times daily for a minimum of 72 weeks. \nThe primary endpoint in both studies was the change from Baseline to Week 72 in percent predicted \nForced Vital Capacity (FVC). \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n22 \n\nIn study PIPF-004, the decline of percent predicted FVC from Baseline at Week 72 of treatment was \nsignificantly reduced in patients receiving Esbriet (N=174) compared with patients receiving placebo \n(N=174; p=0.001, rank ANCOVA). Treatment with Esbriet also significantly reduced the decline of \npercent predicted FVC from Baseline at Weeks 24 (p=0.014), 36 (p<0.001), 48 (p<0.001), and \n60 (p<0.001). At Week 72, a decline from baseline in percent predicted FVC of \u226510% (a threshold \nindicative of the risk of mortality in IPF) was seen in 20% of patients receiving Esbriet compared to \n35% receiving placebo (Table 2).  \n \n\nTable 2 Categorical assessment of change from Baseline to Week 72 \nin percent predicted FVC in study PIPF-004 \n\n \n\nPirfenidone  \n2,403 mg/day \n\n(N = 174) \nPlacebo \n\n(N = 174) \nDecline of \u226510% or death or lung transplant 35 (20%) 60 (34%) \nDecline of less than 10% 97 (56%) 90 (52%) \nNo decline (FVC change >0%) 42 (24%) 24 (14%) \n\n \nAlthough there was no difference between patients receiving Esbriet compared to placebo in change \nfrom Baseline to Week 72 of distance walked during a six minute walk test (6MWT) by the \nprespecified rank ANCOVA, in an ad hoc analysis, 37% of patients receiving Esbriet showed a \ndecline of \u226550 m in 6MWT distance, compared to 47% of patients receiving placebo in PIPF-004. \n \nIn study PIPF-006, treatment with Esbriet (N=171) did not reduce the decline of percent predicted \nFVC from Baseline at Week 72 compared with placebo (N=173; p=0.501). However, treatment with \nEsbriet reduced the decline of percent predicted FVC from Baseline at Weeks 24 (p<0.001), \n36 (p=0.011), and 48 (p=0.005). At Week 72, a decline in FVC of \u226510% was seen in 23% of patients \nreceiving Esbriet and 27% receiving placebo (Table 3).  \n \n\nTable 3 Categorical assessment of change from Baseline to Week 72 \nin percent predicted FVC in study PIPF-006 \n\n \n\nPirfenidone  \n2,403 mg/day \n\n(N = 171) \nPlacebo \n\n(N = 173) \nDecline of \u226510% or death or lung transplant 39 (23%) 46 (27%) \nDecline of less than 10% 88 (52%) 89 (51%) \nNo decline (FVC change >0%) 44 (26%) 38 (22%) \n\n \nThe decline in 6MWT distance from Baseline to Week 72 was significantly reduced compared with \nplacebo in study PIPF-006 (p<0.001, rank ANCOVA). Additionally, in an ad hoc analysis, 33% of \npatients receiving Esbriet showed a decline of \u226550 m in 6MWT distance, compared to 47% of patients \nreceiving placebo in PIPF-006. \n \nIn a pooled analysis of survival in PIPF-004 and PIPF-006 the mortality rate with Esbriet 2403 mg/day \ngroup was 7.8% compared with 9.8% with placebo (HR 0.77 [95% CI, 0.47\u20131.28]).  \n \nPIPF-016 compared treatment with Esbriet 2,403 mg/day to placebo. Treatment was administered \nthree times daily for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change from Baseline to Week 52 in \npercent predicted FVC. In a total of 555 patients, the median baseline percent predicted FVC and \n%DLCO were 68% (range: 48\u201391%) and 42% (range: 27\u2013170%), respectively. Two percent of patients \nhad percent predicted FVC below 50% and 21% of patients had a percent predicted DLCO below 35% \nat Baseline. \n \nIn study PIPF-016, the decline of percent predicted FVC from Baseline at Week 52 of treatment was \nsignificantly reduced in patients receiving Esbriet (N=278) compared with patients receiving placebo \n(N=277; p<0.000001, rank ANCOVA). Treatment with Esbriet also significantly reduced the decline \nof percent predicted FVC from Baseline at Weeks 13 (p<0.000001), 26 (p<0.000001), and 39 \n\n\n\n23 \n\n(p=0.000002). At Week 52, a decline from Baseline in percent predicted FVC of \u226510% or death was \nseen in 17% of patients receiving Esbriet compared to 32% receiving placebo (Table 4). \n \n\nTable 4 Categorical assessment of change from Baseline to Week 52 \nin percent predicted FVC in study PIPF-016 \n\n \n\nPirfenidone  \n2,403 mg/day \n\n(N = 278) \nPlacebo \n\n(N = 277) \nDecline of \u226510% or death 46 (17%) 88 (32%) \nDecline of less than 10% 169 (61%) 162 (58%) \nNo decline (FVC change >0%) 63 (23%) 27 (10%) \n\n \nThe decline in distance walked during a 6MWT from Baseline to Week 52 was significantly reduced \nin patients receiving Esbriet compared with patients receiving placebo in PIPF-016 (p=0.036, rank \nANCOVA); 26% of patients receiving Esbriet showed a decline of \u226550 m in 6MWT distance \ncompared to 36% of patients receiving placebo. \n \nIn a pre-specified pooled analysis of studies PIPF-016, PIPF-004, and PIPF-006 at Month 12, all-cause \nmortality was significantly lower in Esbriet 2403 mg/day group (3.5%, 22 of 623 patients) compared \nwith placebo (6.7%, 42 of 624 patients), resulting in a 48% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality \nwithin the first 12 months (HR 0.52 [95% CI, 0.31\u20130.87], p=0.0107, log-rank test).  \n \nThe study (SP3) in Japanese patients compared pirfenidone 1800 mg/day (comparable to 2403 mg/day \nin the US and European populations of PIPF-004/006 on a weight-normalised basis) with placebo \n(N=110, N=109, respectively). Treatment with pirfenidone significantly reduced mean decline in vital \ncapacity (VC) at Week 52 (the primary endpoint) compared with placebo (-0.09\u00b10.02 l versus \n-0.16\u00b10.02 l respectively, p=0.042). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nEsbriet in all subsets of the paediatric population in IPF (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAdministration of Esbriet capsules with food results in a large reduction in Cmax (by 50%) and a \nsmaller effect on AUC, compared to the fasted state. Following oral administration of a single dose of \n801 mg to healthy older adult volunteers (50-66 years of age) in the fed state, the rate of pirfenidone \nabsorption slowed, while the AUC in the fed state was approximately 80-85% of the AUC observed in \nthe fasted state. Bioequivalence was demonstrated in the fasted state when comparing the 801 mg \ntablet to three 267 mg capsules. In the fed state, the 801 mg tablet met bioequivalence criteria based on \nthe AUC measurements compared to the capsules, while the 90% confidence intervals for Cmax \n(108.26% - 125.60%) slightly exceeded the upper bound of standard bioequivalence limit (90% CI:  \n80.00% - 125.00%). The effect of food on pirfenidone oral AUC was consistent between the tablet and \ncapsule formulations. Compared to the fasted state, administration of either formulation with food \nreduced pirfenidone Cmax, with Esbriet tablet reducing the Cmax slightly less (by 40%) than Esbriet \ncapsules (by 50%). A reduced incidence of adverse events (nausea and dizziness) was observed in fed \nsubjects when compared to the fasted group. Therefore, it is recommended that Esbriet be \nadministered with food to reduce the incidence of nausea and dizziness.  \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of pirfenidone has not been determined in humans. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nDistribution \n \nPirfenidone binds to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin. The overall mean binding \nranged from 50% to 58% at concentrations observed in clinical studies (1 to 100 \u03bcg/ml). Mean \napparent oral steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 70 l, indicating that pirfenidone \ndistribution to tissues is modest. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nApproximately 70\u201380% of pirfenidone is metabolised via CYP1A2 with minor contributions from \nother CYP isoenzymes including CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. In vitro data  indicate some \npharmacologically relevant activity of the major metabolite (5-carboxy-pirfenidone) at concentrations  \nin excess of peak plasma concentrations in IPF patients. This may become clinically relevant in \npatients with moderate renal impairment where plasma exposure to 5-carboxy-pirfenidone is increased  \n \nElimination  \n \nThe oral clearance of pirfenidone appears modestly saturable. In a multiple-dose, dose-ranging study \nin healthy older adults administered doses ranging from 267 mg to 1,335 mg three times a day, the \nmean clearance decreased by approximately 25% above a dose of 801 mg three times a day. Following \nsingle dose administration of pirfenidone in healthy older adults, the mean apparent terminal \nelimination half-life was approximately 2.4 hours. Approximately 80% of an orally administered dose \nof pirfenidone is cleared in the urine within 24 hours of dosing. The majority of pirfenidone is \nexcreted as the 5-carboxy-pirfenidone metabolite (>95% of that recovered), with less than 1% of \npirfenidone excreted unchanged in urine. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone and the 5-carboxy-pirfenidone metabolite were compared in \nsubjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and in subjects with normal hepatic \nfunction. Results showed that there was a mean increase of 60% in pirfenidone exposure after a single \ndose of 801 mg pirfenidone (3 x 267 mg capsule) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. \nPirfenidone should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and \npatients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity especially if they are concomitantly taking a \nknown CYP1A2 inhibitor (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Esbriet is contraindicated in severe hepatic \nimpairment and end stage liver disease (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone were observed in subjects \nwith mild to severe renal impairment compared with subjects with normal renal function. The parent \nsubstance is predominantly metabolised to 5-carboxy-pirfenidone.  The mean (SD) AUC0-\u221e of 5-\ncarboxy-pirfenidone was significantly higher in the moderate (p = 0.009) and severe (p < 0.0001) renal \nimpairment groups than in the group with normal renal function; 100 (26.3) mg\u2022h/L and 168 (67.4) \nmg\u2022h/L compared to 28.7 (4.99) mg\u2022h/L respectively.  \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nRenal \nImpairment \n\nGroup \n\n \nStatistics \n\nAUC0-\u221e (mg\u2022hr/L) \n\nPirfenidone 5-Carboxy-Pirfenidone \n\nNormal Mean (SD) 42.6 (17.9) 28.7 (4.99) \nn = 6 Median (25th\u201375th) 42.0 (33.1\u201355.6) 30.8 (24.1\u201332.1) \nMild Mean (SD) 59.1 (21.5) 49.3\n\na \n(14.6) \n\nn = 6 Median (25th\u201375th) 51.6 (43.7\u201380.3) 43.0 (38.8\u201356.8) \nModerate Mean (SD) 63.5 (19.5) 100\n\nb \n(26.3) \n\nn = 6 Median (25th\u201375th) 66.7 (47.7\u201376.7) 96.3 (75.2\u2013123) \nSevere Mean (SD) 46.7 (10.9) 168\n\nc \n(67.4) \n\nn = 6 Median (25th\u201375th) 49.4 (40.7\u201355.8) 150 (123\u2013248) \n \nAUC0-\u221e  = area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity. \na p-value versus Normal = 1.00 (pair-wise comparison with Bonferroni) \nb p-value versus Normal = 0.009 (pair-wise comparison with Bonferroni) \nc p-value versus Normal < 0.0001 (pair-wise comparison with Bonferroni)  \n \nExposure to 5-carboxy-pirfenidone increases 3.5 fold or more in patients with moderate renal \nimpairment. Clinically relevant pharmacodynamic activity of the metabolite in patients with moderate \nrenal impairment cannot be excluded. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal \nimpairment who are receiving pirfenidone.  Pirfenidone should be used with caution in patients with \nmoderate renal impairment.  The use of pirfenidone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal \nimpairment (CrCl <30ml/min) or end stage renal disease requiring dialysis (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses from 4 studies in healthy subjects or subjects with renal \nimpairment and one study in patients with IPF showed no clinically relevant effect of age, gender or \nbody size on the pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. \n \nIn repeated dose toxicity studies increases in liver weight were observed in mice, rats and dogs; this \nwas often accompanied by hepatic centrilobular hypertrophy. Reversibility was observed after \ncessation of treatment. An increased incidence of liver tumours was observed in carcinogenicity \nstudies conducted in rats and mice. These hepatic findings are consistent with an induction of hepatic \nmicrosomal enzymes, an effect which has not been observed in patients receiving Esbriet. These \nfindings are not considered relevant to humans.  \n \nA statistically significant increase in uterine tumours was observed in female rats administered \n1,500 mg/kg/day, 37 times the human dose of 2,403 mg/day. The results of mechanistic studies \nindicate that the occurrence of uterine tumours is probably related to a chronic dopamine-mediated sex \nhormone imbalance involving a species specific endocrine mechanism in the rat which is not present \nin humans. \n \nReproductive toxicology studies demonstrated no adverse effects on male and female fertility or \npostnatal development of offspring in rats and there was no evidence of teratogenicity in rats \n(1,000 mg/kg/day) or rabbits (300 mg/kg/day). In animals placental transfer of pirfenidone and/or its \nmetabolites occurs with the potential for accumulation of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in \namniotic fluid. At high doses (\u2265450 mg/kg/day) rats exhibited a prolongation of oestrous cycle and a \nhigh incidence of irregular cycles. At high doses (\u22651,000 mg/kg/day) rats exhibited a prolongation of \ngestation and reduction in fetal viability. Studies in lactating rats indicate that pirfenidone and/or its \nmetabolites are excreted in milk with the potential for accumulation of pirfenidone and/or its \nmetabolites in milk. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nPirfenidone showed no indication of mutagenic or genotoxic activity in a standard battery of tests and \nwhen tested under UV exposure was not mutagenic. When tested under UV exposure pirfenidone was \npositive in a photoclastogenic assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. \n \nPhototoxicity and irritation were noted in guinea pigs after oral administration of pirfenidone and with \nexposure to UVA/UVB light. The severity of phototoxic lesions was minimised by application of \nsunscreen.   \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n \n\n\n\n85 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \nEsbriet 267 mg hard capsules \n\nPirfenidone \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \nKeep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u25cf If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u25cf This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u25cf If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Esbriet is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Esbriet  \n3. How to take Esbriet  \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store Esbriet \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1 What Esbriet is and what it is used for  \n \nEsbriet contains the active substance pirfenidone and it is used for the treatment of mild to moderate \nIdiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) in adults.  \n \nIPF is a condition in which the tissues in your lungs become swollen and scarred over time, and as a \nresult makes it difficult to breathe deeply. This makes it hard for your lungs to work properly.

you, do not take esbriet. if you are unsure ask your doctor or pharmacist. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking esbriet you may become more sensitive to sunlight (photosensitivity reaction) when taking esbriet. avoid the sun (including sunlamps) whilst taking esbriet. wear sunblock daily and cover your arms, legs and head to reduce exposure to sunlight (see section 4: possible side effects). you should not take other medicines, such as tetracycline antibiotics (such as doxycycline), which may make you more sensitive to sunlight. you should tell your doctor if you suffer from kidney problems. you should tell your doctor if you suffer from mild to moderate liver problems. you should stop smoking before and during treatment with esbriet. cigarette smoking can reduce the effect of esbriet. esbriet may cause dizziness and tiredness. be careful if you have to take part in activities where you have to be alert and co-ordinated. esbriet can cause weight loss. your doctor will monitor your weight whilst you are taking this medicine. you will need a blood test before you start taking esbriet and at monthly intervals for the first 6 months and then every 3 months thereafter whilst you are taking this medicine to check whether your liver is working properly. it is important that you have these regular blood tests for as long as you are taking esbriet. children and adolescents do not give esbriet to children and adolescents under the age of 18. other medicines and esbriet tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. this is especially important if you are taking the following medicines, as they may change the effect of esbriet. medicines that may increase side effects of esbriet: enoxacin (a type of antibiotic) ciprofloxacin (a type of antibiotic) amiodarone (used to treat some types of heart disease) propafenone (used to treat some types of heart disease) fluvoxamine (used to treat depression and obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd)). medicines that may reduce how well esbriet works: omeprazole (used in the treatment of conditions such as indigestion, gastroesophageal reflux disease) rifampicin (a type of antibiotic). esbriet with food and drink do not drink grapefruit juice whilst taking this medicine. grapefruit may prevent esbriet from working properly. pregnancy and breast-feeding as a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of esbriet if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or think you might be pregnant as the potential risks to the unborn child are unknown. if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed speak to your doctor or pharmacist before taking esbriet. as it is unknown whether esbriet passes into breast milk, your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits of taking this medicine while breast-feeding if you decide to do so. driving and using machines do not drive or use machines if you feel dizzy or tired after taking esbriet.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "esbriet", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 11, "BeginOffset": 12, "EndOffset": 19, "Score":
