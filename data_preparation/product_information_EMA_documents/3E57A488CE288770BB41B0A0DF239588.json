This will allow quick identification of\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nHyQvia 100 mg/ml solution for infusion for subcutaneous use\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nHyQvia is a dual vial unit consisting of one vial of human normal immunoglobulin \n(Immune Globulin 10% or IG 10%) and one vial of recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20).\n\nHuman normal immunoglobulin (SCIg)\n\nOne ml contains:\nHuman normal immunoglobulin. 100 mg\n(purity of at least 98% IgG)\n\nEach vial of 25 ml contains: 2.5 g of human normal immunoglobulin\nEach vial of 50 ml contains: 5 g of human normal immunoglobulin\nEach vial of 100 ml contains: 10 g of human normal immunoglobulin\nEach vial of 200 ml contains: 20 g of human normal immunoglobulin\nEach vial of 300 ml contains: 30 g of human normal immunoglobulin\n\nDistribution of the IgG subclasses (approx. values):\nIgG1 56.9%\nIgG2 26.6%\nIgG3 3.4%\nIgG4 1.7%\n\nThe maximum IgA content is 140 micrograms/ml.\n\nProduced from the plasma of human donors.\n\nExcipients with known effects:\n\n Recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20)\nRecombinant human hyaluronidase is a purified glycoprotein of 447 amino acids produced \nin Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.\n\n Sodium (as chloride and as phosphate)\nThe total sodium content of recombinant human hyaluronidase is 4.03 mg/ml.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for infusion (infusion).\n\nIG 10% is a clear or slightly opalescent and colourless or pale yellow solution.\nRecombinant human hyaluronidase is a clear, colourless solution.\n\n\n\n3\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nReplacement therapy in adults, children and adolescents (0-18 years) in:\n Primary immunodeficiency syndromes with impaired antibody production (see section 4.4).\n Hypogammaglobulinaemia and recurrent bacterial infections in patients with chronic \n\nlymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), in whom prophylactic antibiotics have failed or are \ncontra-indicated. \n\n Hypogammaglobulinaemia and recurrent bacterial infections in multiple myeloma (MM) \npatients.\n\n Hypogammaglobulinaemia in patients pre- and post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell \ntransplantation (HSCT).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nReplacement therapy should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician \nexperienced in the treatment of immunodeficiency.\n\nPosology\nThe dose and dose regimen are dependent on the indication.\n\nReplacement therapy \nThe medicinal product should be administered via the subcutaneous route.\n\nIn replacement therapy the dose may need to be individualized for each patient dependent on the \npharmacokinetic and clinical response. The following dosage regimens are given as a guideline.\n\nPatients naïve to immunoglobulin therapy\nThe dose required to achieve a trough level of 6 g/l is of the order of 0.4-0.8 g/kg body weight per \nmonth. The dosage interval to maintain steady state levels varies from 2-4 weeks.\n\nTrough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. \nTo reduce the rate of infection, it may be necessary to increase the dosage and aim for higher \ntrough levels (> 6 g/l).\n\nAt the initiation of therapy, it is recommended that the treatment intervals for the first infusions be \ngradually prolonged from a 1-week dose to up to a 3- or 4-week dose. The cumulative monthly dose of \nIG 10% should be divided into 1-week, 2-week etc. doses according to the planned treatment intervals \nwith HyQvia.\n\nPatients previously treated with immunoglobulin administered intravenously\nFor patients switching directly from intravenous administration of immunoglobulin, or who have \na previous intravenous dose of immunoglobulin that can be referenced, the medicinal product\nshould be administered at the same dose and at the same frequency as their previous intravenous \nimmunoglobulin treatment. If patients were previously on a 3-week dosing regimen, increasing \nthe interval to 4-weeks can be accomplished by administering the same weekly equivalents.\n\nPatients previously treated with immunoglobulin administered subcutaneously\nFor patients currently being administered immunoglobulin subcutaneously, the initial dose of HyQvia \nis the same as for subcutaneous treatment, but may be adjusted to 3- or 4-weeks interval. The first \ninfusion of HyQvia should be given one week after the last treatment with the previous \nimmunoglobulin.\n\n\n\n4\n\nPaediatric population\nThe posology in children and adolescents (0-18 years) is not different to that of adults as the posology \nfor each indication is given by body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome of the above \nmentioned condition. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2.\n\nMethod of administration\n\n The medicinal product is for subcutaneous use only, do not administer intravenously.\n Visually inspect both components of HyQvia for discoloration and particulate matter prior to \n\nadministration. \n Allow refrigerated product to come to room temperature before use. Do not use heating devices \n\nincluding microwaves. \n Do not shake. \n This medicinal product is comprised of two vials. Do not mix the components of this medicinal \n\nproduct.\n\nEach vial of IG 10% is supplied with the appropriate corresponding quantity of recombinant human \nhyaluronidase as stated in the table below. The full contents of the recombinant human hyaluronidase \nvial should be administered regardless of whether the full content of the IG 10% vial is administered.\nThe two components of the medicinal product must be administered sequentially through the same \nneedle beginning with the recombinant human hyaluronidase followed by IG 10%, as described \nbelow.\n\nHyQvia administration scheme\nRecombinant human hyaluronidase Human normal immunoglobulin 10%\n\nVolume (ml) Protein (grams) Volume (ml)\n1.25 2.5 25\n2.5 5 50\n5 10 100\n10 20 200\n15 30 300\n\nInfusion site leakage can occur during or after subcutaneous administration of immunoglobulin, \nincluding HyQvia. Consider using longer needles and/or more than one infusion site. Any change of \nneedle size would have to be supervised by the treating physician.\n\nIn case subcutaneous infusion of HyQvia is used for home treatment, therapy should be initiated and \nmonitored by a physician experienced in the guidance of patients for home treatment. The patient will \nbe instructed in infusion techniques, the use of an infusion pump or syringe driver, the keeping of a \ntreatment diary, recognition of possible severe adverse reactions and measures to be taken in case\nthese occur.\n\nHyQvia can be used to administer a full therapeutic dose in one to two sites up to every four weeks. \nAdjust the frequency and number of infusion sites taking into consideration volume, total infusion \ntime, and tolerability so that the patient receives the same weekly equivalent dose. If a patient misses a \ndose, administer the missed dose as soon as possible and then resume scheduled treatments as \napplicable.\n\nThe IG 10% component should be infused using a pump.  The rHuPH20 may be hand-pushed or \ninfused by a pump.  A 24 gauge needle may be required to allow patients to infuse at flow rates of 300 \nmL/hr/infusion site.  However, needles with smaller diameters may be used if slower flow rates are \nacceptable. For the 1.25 mL recombinant human hyaluronidase vial size use a 18-22 gauge needle to \nwithdraw the contents of the vial to prevent stopper push through or coring; for all other vial sizes a \nneedle or needle-less device may be used to withdraw the contents of the vial.\n\n\n\n5\n\nThe suggested site(s) for the infusion of the medicinal product are the middle to upper abdomen and \nthighs. If two sites are used, the two infusion sites should be on contra lateral sides of the body. Avoid \nbony prominences, or scarred areas. The product should not be infused at or around an infected or \nacutely inflamed area due to the potential risk of spreading a localized infection.\n\nIt is recommended that the recombinant human hyaluronidase component be administered at \na constant rate and that the rate of administration of the IG 10% should not be increased above \nthe recommended rates, particularly when the patient has just started with HyQvia therapy.\n\nFirst, the full dose of recombinant human hyaluronidase solution is infused at a rate \nof 1 to 2 ml/minute per infusion site or as tolerated. Infuse the full dose per site of IG 10% through the \nsame subcutaneous needle set within 10 minutes of the recombinant human hyaluronidase.\n\nThe following infusion rates of the IG 10% are recommended per infusion site:\n\nSubjects < 40 kg Subjects ≥ 40 kg\n\nInterval/Minutes\n\nFirst Two \nInfusions\n\n(ml/hour/infusion \nsite)\n\nSubsequent \n2-3 Infusions\n\n(ml/hour/infusion \nsite)\n\nFirst Two \nInfusions\n\n(ml/hour/infusion \nsite)\n\nSubsequent\n2 to 3 Infusions\n\n(ml/hour/infusion \nsite)\n\n10 minutes 5 10 10 10\n\n10 minutes 10 20 30 30\n\n10 minutes 20 40 60 120\n\n10 minutes 40 80 120 240\n\nRemainder of infusion 80 160 240 300\n\nIf the patient tolerates the initial infusions at the full dose per site and maximum rate, an increase in \nthe rate of successive infusions may be considered at the discretion of the physician and the patient.\n\nFor instructions on how to use the medicinal product, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHyQvia must not be given intravenously or intramuscularly.\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance (IgG) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nHypersensitivity to human immunoglobulins, especially in very rare cases of IgA deficiency when \nthe patient has antibodies against IgA.\n\nKnown systemic hypersensitivity to hyaluronidase or recombinant human hyaluronidase.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nIf HyQvia is accidentally administered into a blood vessel patients could develop shock.\n\nThe recommended infusion rate given in section 4.2 should be adhered to. Patients must be \nclosely monitored throughout the infusion period, particularly patients starting with therapy.\n\nCertain adverse reactions may occur more frequently in patients who receive human normal \nimmunoglobulin for the first time or, in rare cases, when the human normal immunoglobulin \nproduct is switched or when there has been a long interval since the previous infusion.\n\n\n\n6\n\nPotential complications can often be avoided by:\n initially infusing the product slowly (see section 4.2).\n ensuring that patients are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. \n\nIn particular, patients naive to human normal immunoglobulin, patients switched from an \nalternative immunoglobulin product or when there has been a long interval since the previous \ninfusion should be monitored during the first infusion and for the first hour after the first \ninfusion, in order to detect potential adverse signs. \n\nAll other patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes after the administration.\n When treatment is given at home, support from another responsible person should be available \n\nfor treating adverse reactions or to summon help should a serious adverse reaction occur. \nPatients on self-home treatment and/or their guardian should also be trained to detect early signs \nof hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nIn case of adverse reaction, either the rate of administration must be reduced or the infusion stopped. \nThe treatment required depends on the nature and severity of the adverse reaction. In case of shock, \nimmediately discontinue the infusion and treat the patient for shock.\n\nNo chronic changes in the skin were observed in the clinical studies. Patients should be reminded \nto report any chronic inflammation, nodules or inflammation that occurs at the infusion site and \nlasts more than a few days.\n\nHypersensitivity to IG 10%\n\nTrue hypersensitivity reactions are rare. They can particularly occur in patients with anti-IgA \nantibodies who should be treated with particular caution. Patients with anti-IgA antibodies, in whom \ntreatment with subcutaneous IgG products remains the only option, should be treated with HyQvia\nonly under close medical supervision. \nRarely, human normal immunoglobulin can induce a fall in blood pressure with anaphylactic reaction, \neven in patients who had tolerated previous treatment with human normal immunoglobulin.\n\n If patient is at high risk for any allergic reactions, the product should be administered only \nwhere supportive care is available for life threatening reactions.\n\n Patients should be informed of the early signs of anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity (hives, pruritus, \ngeneralized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, and hypotension).\n\n Depending on the severity of associated reaction, and medical practice, pre-medication may \nprevent this type of reaction.\n\n If known anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulin exists, it should \nbe noted in the patient records.\n\nHypersensitivity to recombinant human hyaluronidase\n\nAny suspicion of allergic or anaphylactic like reactions following recombinant human hyaluronidase\nadministration requires immediate discontinuation of the infusion and standard medical treatment \nshould be administered, if necessary.\n\nImmunogenicity of recombinant human hyaluronidase\n\nDevelopment of non-neutralizing antibodies to the recombinant human hyaluronidase component has \nbeen reported in patients receiving HyQvia in clinical studies. The potential exists for such antibodies \nto cross-react with endogenous PH20, which is known to be expressed in the adult male testes, \nepididymis, and sperm. It is unknown whether these antibodies may have any clinical significance in \nhumans.\n\n\n\n7\n\nThromboembolism\n\nArterial and venous thromboembolic events including myocardial infarction, stroke, deep venous \nthrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been associated with the use of immunoglobulins. Patients \nshould be sufficiently hydrated before use of immunoglobulins. Caution should be exercised in \npatients with pre-existing risk factors for thromboembolic events (such as advanced age, hypertension, \ndiabetes mellitus and a history of vascular disease or thrombotic episodes, patients with acquired or \ninherited thrombophilic disorders, patients with prolonged periods of immobilization, severely \nhypovolemic patients, patients with diseases which increase blood viscosity). Monitor for signs and \nsymptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity. Thrombosis \nmay also occur in the absence of known risk factors.\n\nPatients should be informed about first symptoms of thromboembolic events including shortness of \nbreath, pain and swelling of a limb, focal neurological deficits and chest pain and should be advised to \ncontact their physician immediately upon onset of symptoms.\n\nHaemolytic anaemia\n\nImmunoglobulin products contain antibodies to blood groups (e.g A, B, D) which may act as \nhaemolysins. These antibodies bind to red blood cells (RBC) epitops (which may be detected as a \npositive direct antiglobulin test [DAT, (Coombs’ test)] and, rarely, may cause haemolysis. \nImmunoglobulin product recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of \nhaemolysis.\n\nAcute renal failure\n\nSevere renal adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving immunoglobulin intravenous \ntreatment, particularly those products containing sucrose (HyQvia does not contain sucrose). \n\nAseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS)\n\nAseptic meningitis syndrome has been reported to occur in association with intravenous and \nsubcutaneous immunoglobulin treatment; the symptoms usually begin within several hours to 2 days \nfollowing immunoglobulin treatment. Patients should be informed about first symptoms which \nencompass severe headache, neck stiffness, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. \nDiscontinuation of immunoglobulin treatment may result in remission of AMS within several days \nwithout sequelae. Cerebrospinal fluid studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several \nthousand cells per mm3, predominantly from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to \nseveral hundred mg/dL.\n\nAMS may occur more frequently in association with high-dose (2 g/kg) intravenous immunoglobulin\ntreatment. From post-marketing data no clear correlation of AMS to higher doses was observed. \nHigher incidences of AMS were seen in women.\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of HyQvia\n\nThis medicinal product does not contain sugars. \nThe IG 10% component contains trace amounts of sodium. Recombinant human hyaluronidase \ncontains 4.03 mg sodium per ml, with a maximum daily dose of approximately 120 mg. This should\nbe taken into consideration in patients on a controlled sodium diet.\n\nInterference with serological testing\n\nAfter infusion of immunoglobulins, the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies \nin the patient’s blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing.\n\n\n\n8\n\nPassive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte´s surface antigens, (e.g., A, B, D) may interfere with\nsome serological tests for red cell antibodies for example the direct antiglobulin test (DAT, direct\nCoombs’ test).\n\nInfusions of immunoglobulin products may lead to false positive readings in assays that depend on \ndetection of -D-glucans for diagnosis of fungal infections; this may persist during the weeks \nfollowing infusion of the product.\n\nTransmissible agents\n\nHuman normal immunoglobulin and human serum albumin (stabilizer of the recombinant human \nhyaluronidase) are produced from human plasma. Standard measures to prevent infections resulting \nfrom the use of medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma include selection of donors, \nscreening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion\nof effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal \nproducts prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting \ninfectious agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses \nand other pathogens.\n\nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and for the non-enveloped hepatitis \nA (HAV) and parvovirus B19 viruses.\n\nThere is reassuring clinical evidence regarding the lack of hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 transmission \nwith immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes an important \ncontribution to the viral safety.\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nLive attenuated virus vaccines\n\nImmunoglobulin administration may impair for a period of at least 6 weeks and up to 3 months \nthe efficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella. After \nadministration of this medicinal product, an interval of 3 months should elapse before vaccination with\nlive attenuated virus vaccines. In the case of measles, this impairment may persist for up to 1 year. \nTherefore, patients receiving measles vaccine should have their antibody status checked.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe listed interactions apply both to adults and children.\n\n\n\n9\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThe safety of this medicinal product for use in human pregnancy has not been established in controlled \nclinical trials and therefore should only be given with caution to pregnant women and breast-feeding \nmothers.\nImmunoglobulin products have been shown to cross the placenta, increasingly during the third \ntrimester. Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the course of \npregnancy, or on the foetus and the neonate are to be expected.\n\nDevelopment and reproductive toxicology studies have been conducted with recombinant human \nhyaluronidase in mice and rabbits. No adverse effects on pregnancy and foetal development were \nassociated with anti-rHuPH20 antibodies. In these studies, maternal antibodies to recombinant human \nhyaluronidase were transferred to offspring in utero. The effects of antibodies to the recombinant \nhuman hyaluronidase component of HyQvia on the human embryo or on human foetal development \nare currently unknown (see section 5.3).\n\nIf a woman becomes pregnant, the treating physician should encourage her to participate in the \npregnancy registry.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nImmunoglobulins are excreted into the milk and may contribute to protecting the neonate from \npathogens which have a mucosal portal of entry.\n\nFertility\n\nThere are currently no clinical safety data for HyQvia on fertility available.\n\nClinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects of IG 10% on fertility \nare to be expected.\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects of recombinant human hyaluronidase\nwith respect to reproductive potential at the doses used for facilitating administration of IG 10% (see \nsection 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nThe ability to drive and operate machines may be impaired by some adverse reactions associated with \nHyQvia. Patients who experience adverse reactions during treatment should wait for these to resolve \nbefore driving or operating machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions (ARs) of HyQvia were local reactions. The most \nfrequently reported systemic ARs were headache, fatigue and pyrexia. The majority of these ARs were\nmild to moderate.\n\nHuman normal immunoglobulin\nAdverse reactions such as chills, headache, dizziness, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, \narthralgia, low blood pressure and moderate low back pain may occur occasionally.\n\nRarely human normal immunoglobulins may cause a sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated \ncases, anaphylactic shock, even when the patient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous \nadministration.\n\n\n\n10\n\nLocal reactions at infusion sites: swelling, soreness, redness, induration, local heat, itching, bruising \nand rash, may frequently occur.\n\nCases of transient aseptic meningitis, transient hemolytic reactions, increase in serum creatinine level \nand/or acute renal failure have been observed with human normal immunoglobulin, see section 4.4.\n\nThromboembolic reactions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein \nthrombosis have been rarely observed with IV and SC administration of immunoglobulin products.\n\nRecombinant human hyaluronidase\nThe most frequent adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use of recombinant human \nhyaluronidase in similar formulations administered subcutaneously for the dispersion and absorption \nof subcutaneously administered fluids or medicinal products have been mild local infusion site \nreactions such as erythema and pain. Oedema has been reported most frequently in association with \nlarge volume subcutaneous fluid administration.\n\nAntibodies against recombinant human hyaluronidase\nA total of 13 out of 83 subjects who participated in pivotal study developed an antibody capable \nof binding to recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) at least once during the clinical study. \nThese antibodies were not capable of neutralizing recombinant human hyaluronidase. No temporal \nassociation between adverse reactions and the presence of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies could be \ndemonstrated. There was no increase in incidence or severity of adverse reactions in patients \nwho developed antibodies to recombinant human hyaluronidase.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe safety of HyQvia was evaluated in 4 clinical studies (160602, 160603, 160902, and 161101) \nin 124 unique patients with PID receiving 3,202 infusions.\n\nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA System Organ Classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level).\n\nFrequencies per infusion have been evaluated using the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), \nvery rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data).\n\nFrequency of Adverse Reactions (ADRs) with HyQvia\nMedDRA \n\nSystem Organ \nClass (SOC)\n\nVery common\n(≥1/10)\n\nCommon\n(≥1/100 to <1/10)\n\nUncommon\n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100)\n\nRare\n(≥1/10,000 to \n\n<1/1,000)\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nVomiting, nausea, \nabdominal pain \n(including abdominal \nupper and lower pain \nand tenderness), \ndiarrhoea\n\nAbdominal distension\n\n\n\n11\n\nFrequency of Adverse Reactions (ADRs) with HyQvia\nMedDRA \n\nSystem Organ \nClass (SOC)\n\nVery common\n(≥1/10)\n\nCommon\n(≥1/100 to <1/10)\n\nUncommon\n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100)\n\nRare\n(≥1/10,000 to \n\n<1/1,000)\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions\n\nLocal reactions\n(total) a:\nInfusion site pain \n(including \ndiscomfort, \ntenderness, groin \npain)\n\nLocal reactions (total):\nInfusion site erythema, \ninfusion site swelling \n(including local swelling \nand oedema), infusion \nsite pruritus (including \nvulvovaginal pruritus)\n\nPyrexia, asthenic \nconditions (including \nasthenia, fatigue, \nlethargy, malaise)\n\nLocal reactions\n(total):\nInfusion site \ndiscoloration, infusion \nsite bruising \n(including hematoma, \nhaemorrhage), \ninfusion site mass \n(including nodule), \ninfusion site warmth, \ninfusion site \ninduration, \ngravitational \noedema/genital \n\nswellingb (including \ngenital oedema, \nscrotal and, \nvulvovaginal \nswelling)\n\nOedema (including \nperipheral, swelling), \nchills, hyperhidrosis\n\nBurning \nsensation\n\nInvestigations Direct Coombs’\ntest positive\n\nMusculoskeletal\nand connective \ntissue disorders\n\nMyalgia, \nmusculoskeletal chest \npain\n\nArthralgia, back pain, \npain in extremity\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nHeadache Migraine\ndizziness\n\nParesthesia\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nErythema, rash\n(including \nerythematous, \npapular, \nmaculo-papular), \npruritus, urticaria\n\nVascular \ndisorders\n\nHypertension, blood \npressure increase \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders\n\nHemosiderinuria\n\na The following ADRs are not listed but also calculated in the frequency for Local reactions: feeling hot, infusion \nsite paresthesia.\nb Gravitational oedema/genital swelling was observed subsequent to lower abdominal quadrants administration.\n\nIn addition to the adverse reactions noted in clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been \nreported in the post-marketing experience (frequency of these reactions is not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data)):\n\nInfections and infestations: Meningitis aseptic\n\nImmune system disorders: Hypersensitivity\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Influenza-like illness, infusion site leakage\n\n\n\n12\n\nIn addition to the adverse reactions listed above, the following additional adverse reactions have been \nreported for subcutaneously administered immunoglobulin products: \nAnaphylactic shock, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction, tremor, tachycardia, hypotension, flushing, \npallor, peripheral coldness, dyspnea, paraesthesia oral, swelling face, dermatitis allergic, \nmusculoskeletal stiffness, injection site urticaria, injection site rash, alanine aminotransferase \nincreased.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nLocal reactions observed during the pivotal clinical study include mild swelling of the site (present in \nmost infusions) due to the large volumes infused, but in general were not considered an adverse \nreaction unless they caused discomfort. Only two instances of local adverse reactions were severe, \ninfusion site pain and infusion site swelling. There were two instances of transient genital oedema, one \nconsidered severe, that resulted from diffusion of the medicinal product from the infusion site in the \nabdomen. No skin changes were observed that did not resolve during the clinical study.\n\nPaediatric population\nResults of clinical studies indicate similar safety profiles in adults and paediatric population, including \nthe nature, frequency, seriousness and reversibility of adverse reactions.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nConsequences of an overdose are not known. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group (human normal immunoglobulin): immune sera and immunoglobulins: \nimmunoglobulins, normal human, ATC code: J06BA01\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe IG 10% component provides the therapeutic effect of this medicinal product. The recombinant \nhuman hyaluronidase facilitates the dispersion and absorption of IG 10%.\n\nHuman normal immunoglobulin contains mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a broad spectrum of \nopsonising and neutralizing antibodies against infectious agents.\nHuman normal immunoglobulin contains the IgG antibodies present in the normal population. It is \nusually prepared from pooled human plasma from not fewer than 1,000 donations. It has a distribution \nof IgG subclasses closely proportional to that in native human plasma. Adequate doses of human \nnormal immunoglobulin may restore abnormally low IgG levels to the normal range.\n\nRecombinant human hyaluronidase is a soluble recombinant form of human hyaluronidase that \nincreases the permeability of the subcutaneous tissue by temporarily depolymerizing\nhyaluronan. Hyaluronan is a polysaccharide found in the intercellular matrix of the connective tissue. \nIt is depolymerized by the naturally occurring enzyme hyaluronidase. Unlike the stable structural \ncomponents of the interstitial matrix, hyaluronan has a very fast turnover with half-life of \napproximately 0.5 days. The recombinant human hyaluronidase of HyQvia acts locally. The effects of \n\n\n\n13\n\nthe hyaluronidase are reversible and permeability of the subcutaneous tissue is restored\nwithin 24 to 48 hours.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nEfficacy and safety of HyQvia was assessed in a phase 3 study (160603) in 83 patients with PID. \nPatients were treated with HyQvia at either 3- or 4-week treatment intervals for a total of 12 months \n(following a brief titration period). The dose of HyQvia was based on the previous treatment with \nintravenous IG 10% (320 to 1,000 mg/kg body weight /4 weeks) and was individually adapted, \nensuring adequate IgG levels throughout the study.\n\nThe results of the study showed a rate of validated, acute, serious bacterial infections per year during \nHyQvia treatment of 0.025 (upper limit of the one-sided 99% confidence interval 0.046). The overall \nrate of infections was less during HyQvia administration than during the three months intravenous \nadministration of IG 10%: the point estimate of the annualized rate of all infections was 2.97 (95% \nCI: 2.51 to 3.47) for HyQvia and 4.51 (95% CI: 3.50 to 5.69) for intravenous IG 10% infusions.\n\nNearly all of the subjects were able to attain the same dose interval with HyQvia as they had for \nintravenous administration. Seventy eight (78) of 83 (94%) subjects attained the same 3- or 4-week \ndosing whereas one decreased from 4 to 3 weeks, one from 4 to 2 weeks and one from 3 to 2 weeks \n(2 subjects withdrew during the titration period).\n\nThe median number of infusion sites per month for HyQvia was 1.09, which is slightly lower than \nthe median number of intravenous IG 10% infusion sites used in this study (1.34), and considerably \nlower than the median number of infusion sites in the study of subcutaneous administration of \nIG 10% (21.43).\n\n66 patients who completed the pivotal phase 3 study participated in an extension study (160902) for \nthe evaluation of long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of HyQvia in PID. The overall combined \nexposure of PID patients in both studies was 187.69 patient-years; the longest exposure for adults \nwas 3.8 years and 3.3 years for paediatric patients.\n\nPaediatric population\nHyQvia was evaluated in 24 paediatric patients, including 13 patients between 4 and < 12 years \nand 11 between 12 and < 18 years, who were treated for up to 3.3 years with an overall safety \nexperience equivalent to 48.66 patient-years (as described in section Clinical efficacy and safety). No \nappreciable differences in the pharmacodynamic effects or efficacy and safety of HyQvia were \nobserved between paediatric patients and adults. See sections 4.2 and 4.8.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nHyQvia in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of primary immunodeficiency \nas model for replacement therapy. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration of HyQvia, peak serum IgG levels are achieved in the \nrecipient’s circulation after approximately 3 to 5 days.\n\nData from the clinical trials of HyQvia show that serum IgG trough levels can be maintained by \ndosing regimens of 320 to 1,000 mg/kg body weight/4 weeks given at intervals of 3- or 4-weeks.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of HyQvia were evaluated in a clinical study in patients with PID aged 12 years \nand older. The pharmacokinetic results are presented in the table below, as compared to data for \nintravenous administration of IG 10% obtained in the same study.\n\n\n\n14\n\nIgG and IgG-complexes are broken down in cells of the reticuloendothelial system.\n\nPharmacokinetic Parameters of HyQvia Compared to Intravenous Administration of IG 10%\nParameter HyQvia\n\nMedian (95% Cl)\nN=60\n\nIVIG 10%\nMedian (95% Cl)\n\nN=68\nCmax [g/l] 15.5 (14.5; 17.) 21.9 (20.7; 23.9)\nCmin [g/l] 10.4 (9.4 to 11.2) 10.1 (9.5 to 10.9)\nAUC per week [g*days/l] 90.52 (83.8 to 9) 93.9 (89.1 to 102.1)\nTmax [days] 5.0 (3.3 to 5.1) 0.1 (0.1 to 0.1)\nApparent clearance or clearance [ml/kg/day] 1.6 (1.4 to 1.79) 1.4 (1.2 to 1.4)\nTerminal half life [days] 45.3 (41.0 to 60.2) 35.7 (32.4 to 40.4)\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn the clinical study with HyQvia, no differences in the plasma IgG trough levels were observed \nbetween adult and paediatric patients.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nImmunoglobulins are normal constituents of the human body.\n\nThe safety of IG 10% has been demonstrated in several non-clinical studies. Non-clinical data reveal \nno special risk for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology and toxicity. Studies \nof repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction in animals are impracticable due \nto induction of and interference by developing antibodies to heterologous proteins.\n\nLong-term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of recombinant \nhuman hyaluronidase have not been conducted. No adverse effects on fertility were observed in mice, \nrabbits and cynomolgus monkeys exposed to antibodies that bind to recombinant human hyaluronidase \nand species-specific hyaluronidase. Reversible infertility has been observed in male and female guinea \npigs immunized to produce antibodies to hyaluronidase. However, antibodies to hyaluronidase did not \ninfluence reproduction following immunization of mice, rabbits, sheep, or cynomolgus monkeys. The \neffects of antibodies that bind to recombinant human hyaluronidase on human fertility are unknown.\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n30\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nHyQvia 100 mg/ml solution for infusion for subcutaneous use\nhuman normal immunoglobulin\n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of \nsection 4 for how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What HyQvia is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use HyQvia\n3. How to use HyQvia\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store HyQvia\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What HyQvia is and what it is used for\n\nWhat HyQvia is\n\nHyQvia contains two solutions for infusion (drip) under the skin (subcutaneous or SC infusion). \nIt is supplied as a package containing one vial of human normal immunoglobulin 10% (the active \nsubstance) and one vial of recombinant human hyaluronidase (a substance which helps the human \nnormal immunoglobulin 10% reach your blood).\n\nHuman normal immunoglobulin 10% belongs to a class of medicines called “human normal \nimmunoglobulins”. Immunoglobulins are also known as antibodies and are found in healthy people’s\nblood. Antibodies are part of the immune system (the body’s natural defences) and help your body to \nfight infections.\n\nHow HyQvia works\n\nThe vial of immunoglobulins has been prepared from the blood of healthy people. The medicine works \nin exactly the same way as the immunoglobulins naturally present in the blood. The recombinant \nhuman hyaluronidase is a protein that makes it easier for the immunoglobulins to be infused (dripped) \nunder the skin and to reach your blood system.\n\nWhat HyQvia is used for\n\nHyQvia is used in patients with a weak immune system, who do not have enough antibodies in their \nblood and tend to get frequent infections. Regular and sufficient doses of HyQvia can raise abnormally \nlow immunoglobulin levels in your blood to normal levels (replacement therapy).\n\n\n\n31\n\nHyQvia is prescribed as replacement therapy to patients who do not have sufficient antibodies, \nincluding the following groups:\n patients with an inborn inability or reduced ability to produce antibodies (primary \n\nimmunodeficiencies). \n patients with a certain kind of blood cancer (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) which leads to a \n\nlack of antibody production and recurrent infections when preventative antibiotics have failed.\n patients with a specific cancer of the bone marrow (multiple myeloma) and lack of antibody \n\nproduction with recurrent infections who have failed to respond to a vaccine against certain \nbacteria (pneumococci).\n\n patients with low antibody production prior and after transplantation of bone marrow cells from \nanother person.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use HyQvia\n\nDo not inject or infuse HyQvia\n\n- if you are allergic to immunoglobulins, hyaluronidase, recombinant hyaluronidase or any \nof the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6, “Contents of the pack and other \ninformation”).\n\n- if you have antibodies against immunoglobulin A (IgA) in your blood. This may occur if you \nhave IgA deficiency. Since HyQvia contains trace amounts of IgA, you might have an allergic \nreaction.\n\n- into a blood vessel (intravenously).\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nThe following warnings and precautions should be taken into consideration before you receive or \nuse HyQvia. If you have any questions, talk to your doctor or nurse.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\n\nThe effects of long-term use of recombinant human hyaluronidase on pregnancy, breast-feeding and \nfertility are currently not known. HyQvia should only be used by pregnant and breast-feeding women\nafter discussion with your physician. If you become pregnant when using HyQvia, you should discuss\nwith your doctor the possibility of participating in a pregnancy registry in order to collect data on your \npregnancy and the development of the baby. The purpose of such registry is to collect and share \ndata only with the public health authorities responsible for monitoring the safety of this product. \nParticipation in the registry is voluntary.\n\nAllergic reactions\nYou may be allergic to immunoglobulins without knowing it. Allergic reactions such as sudden fall \nin blood pressure or anaphylactic shock (a sharp fall in blood pressure with other symptoms such as \nswelling of the throat, breathing difficulties and skin rash) are rare but they can occasionally occur \neven if you have not previously had problems with similar treatments. You are at increased risk of \nallergic reactions if you have IgA deficiency with anti-IgA antibodies. Signs or symptoms of these rare \nallergic reactions include:\n\n- feeling light-headed, dizzy or faint,\n- skin rash and itchiness, swelling in the mouth or throat, difficulty breathing, wheezing,\n- abnormal heart rate, chest pain, blueness of lips or fingers and toes,\n- blurred vision.\n\n\n\n32\n\nYour doctor or nurse will first infuse HyQvia slowly, and carefully monitor you throughout the first \ninfusions so that any allergic reaction can be detected and treated immediately.\n\n► If you notice any of these signs during the infusion, tell your doctor or nurse immediately. \nHe or she will decide whether to slow down the infusion rate or stop the infusion \ncompletely.\n\nInfusion speed\nIt is very important to infuse the medicine at the correct speed. Your doctor or nurse will advise \nyou on the appropriate infusion speed to use when you are infusing HyQvia at home (see section 3, \n“How to use HyQvia”).\n\nMonitoring during infusion\nCertain side effects may occur more frequently if:\n- you are receiving HyQvia for the first time.\n- you have received another immunoglobulin and have been switched to HyQvia.\n- there has been a long interval (e.g., more than 2 or 3 infusion intervals) since you last received \n\nHyQvia.\n► In such cases, you will be closely monitored during your first infusion and for the first \n\nhour after your infusion has stopped.\n\nIn all other cases you should be monitored during the infusion and for at least 20 minutes after you \nreceive HyQvia for the first few infusions.\n\nHome treatment\nBefore you start home treatment you should assign a person as guardian. You and your guardian will \nbe trained to detect early signs of side effects, especially allergic reactions. This guardian should help \nyou keep an eye on potential side effects. During the infusion you must look out for first signs of side \neffects (for further details see section 4, “Possible side effects”).\n\n► If you experience any side effects, you or your guardian must stop the infusion \nimmediately and contact a doctor.\n\n► If you experience a severe side effect, you or your guardian must seek emergency \ntreatment immediately.\n\nSpread of localised infections\nDo not infuse HyQvia into or around an infected or red swollen area on your skin because it may \ncause the infection to spread.\n\nNo long-term (chronic) changes in the skin were observed in the clinical studies. Any long-term \ninflammation, lumps (nodules) or inflammation that occur at the infusion site and last more than \na few days should be reported to your physician.\n\nEffects on blood tests\nHyQvia contains many different antibodies, some of which can affect blood tests (serological tests).\n\n► Tell your doctor about your treatment with HyQvia before any blood test.\n\nInformation on the source material of HyQvia\nThe human normal immunoglobulin 10% of HyQvia and human serum albumin (an ingredient of the \nrecombinant human hyaluronidase) are made from human plasma (the liquid part of blood). When \nmedicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent \ninfections being passed on to patients. These include:\n\n- careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections \nare excluded, and\n\n- the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of viruses/infections.\n\n\n\n33\n\nManufacturers of these products also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can \ninactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or \nplasma are used, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to \nany unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.\n\nThe measures taken for the manufacture of HyQvia are considered effective for enveloped viruses\nsuch as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus and for the \nnon-enveloped hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19.\n\nImmunoglobulins have not been associated with hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 infections possibly \nbecause the antibodies against these infections, which are contained in HyQvia, are protective.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time you use HyQvia, the following data are recorded in your \ntreatment diary:\n- the date of administration,\n- the batch number of the medicine, and\n- the injected volume, flow rate, the number and location of infusion sites.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n\nThe same indications, dose and frequency of infusion as for adults apply for children and adolescents \n(0-18 years).\n\nOther medicines and HyQvia\n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nVaccinations\nHyQvia may reduce the effect of some virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and chicken \npox (live virus vaccines). Therefore, after receiving HyQvia, you may have to wait for up to 3 months \nbefore receiving certain vaccines. You may have to wait for up to 1 year after receiving HyQvia before \nyou can receive your measles vaccine.\n\n► Please tell your vaccinating doctor or nurse about your treatment with HyQvia.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nPatients may experience side effects (for example dizziness or nausea) during treatment with HyQvia \nthat might affect the ability to drive and use machines. If this happens, you should wait until the \nreactions have disappeared.\n\nHyQvia contains sodium\n\nThe recombinant human hyaluronidase of HyQvia contains small amounts (4.03 mg per ml) \nof sodium. This may have to be considered for patients who are on a controlled sodium diet.\n\n3. How to use HyQvia\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are \nnot sure.\n\nHyQvia has to be infused under the skin (subcutaneous or SC administration).\n\n\n\n34\n\nTreatment with HyQvia will be started by your doctor or nurse, but you may be allowed to use the \nmedicine at home once you have received the first few infusions under medical supervision and you \n(and/or your guardian) have been adequately trained. You and your doctor will decide if you can use \nHyQvia at home. Do not begin treatment with HyQvia at home until you have received complete \ninstructions.\n\nDosing\nYour doctor will calculate the correct dose for you based on your body weight, any previous treatment \nyou may have received and your response to treatment. The recommended starting dose is one that \nsupplies 400 to 800 mg of active substance per kg of bodyweight per month. In the beginning you will \nreceive one quarter of this dose at 1 week intervals. This will be increased step-wise to larger doses \nat 3- to 4-week intervals with the next infusions. Sometimes your doctor may recommend that larger \ndoses are split and given at two sites at once. Your doctor may also adjust your dose depending on \nyour response to treatment.\n\nStarting treatment\nYour treatment will be started by a doctor or nurse experienced in treating patients with a weak \nimmune system and in guiding patients for home treatment. You will be watched carefully throughout\nthe infusion and for at least 1 hour after stopping the infusion to see how well you tolerate the \nmedicine. In the beginning your doctor or nurse will use a slow infusion speed and gradually increase \nit during the first infusion and in the following infusions. Once the doctor or nurse has found the right \ndose and speed of infusion for you, you may be allowed to give the treatment to yourself at home.\n\nHome treatment\nYou will be instructed in:\n- Germ-free (aseptic) infusion techniques,\n- The use of an infusion pump or syringe driver (if needed),\n- Keeping a treatment diary, and\n- Measures to be taken in case of severe side effects.\n\nYou must carefully follow your doctor’s instructions regarding the dose, infusion speed and schedule \nfor infusing HyQvia so that your treatment works for you.\n\nSubjects < 40 kg Subjects ≥ 40 kg\n\nInterval/Minutes\n\nFirst Two \nInfusions\n\n(ml/hour/infusion \nsite)\n\nSubsequent \n2-3 Infusions\n\n(ml/hour/infusion \nsite)\n\nFirst Two \nInfusions\n\n(ml/hour/infusion \nsite)\n\nSubsequent\n2 to 3 Infusions\n\n(ml/hour/infusion \nsite)\n\n10 minutes 5 10 10 10\n\n10 minutes 10 20 30 30\n\n10 minutes 20 40 60 120\n\n10 minutes 40 80 120 240\n\nRemainder of infusion 80 160 240 300\n\nIf you have an infusion site leakage \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist or nurse if another needle size would be more appropriate for you.\nAny change of needle size would have to be supervised by the treating physician.\n\nIf you use more HyQvia than you should\n\nIf you think that you used more HyQvia than you should, speak to your doctor as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n35\n\nIf you forget to use HyQvia\n\nDo not infuse a double dose of HyQvia to make up for a missed dose. If you think that you have \nmissed a dose speak to your doctor as soon as possible.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, or pharmacist or nurse.\n\nDetailed Instructions for Use are provided in the section below.\n\n1.

Record the infusion:\n Remove the peel-off label from HyQvia vial, which has the \n\nproduct lot number and expiration date, and place the label in \nyour treatment record/log book.\n\n Write down the date, time, dose, site(s) of infusion (to assist \nin rotating sites) and any reactions after each infusion.\n\n Throw away any unused product in the vial and the \ndisposable supplies as recommended by your healthcare \nprofessional.\n\n Follow up with physician as directed.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can have side effects, although not everybody gets them.\nCertain side effects, such as headache, chills, or body aches, may be reduced by slowing the \ninfusion rate.\n\nSerious side effects\nInfusions of medicines like HyQvia can occasionally result in serious, but rare, allergic reactions. You \nmay experience a sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated cases, anaphylactic shock. Doctors are \naware of these possible side effects and will monitor you during and after the initial infusions.\n\n\n\n39\n\nTypical signs or symptoms include: feeling light-headed, dizzy or faint, skin rash and itchiness, \nswelling in the mouth or throat, difficulty breathing, wheezing, abnormal heart rate, chest pain,\nblueness of lips or fingers and toes, blurred vision.\n\n Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you notice any of these signs during the infusion.\n When using HyQvia at home, you must perform the infusion in the presence of an \n\nassigned guardian person who will help you watch out for allergic reactions, stop the\ninfusion, and get help if necessary.\n\n Please also see section 2 of this leaflet about the risk of allergic reactions and using \nHyQvia at home.\n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 infusions):\nInfusion site pain, including mild to moderate discomfort and tenderness. These reactions usually go \naway within a few days.\n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 infusions):\nReactions at the infusion site: These include redness, swelling, itching, hardening, and rash at the site \nof infusion. These reactions usually go away within a few days. Headache, tiredness, nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, muscle or joint pain, chest pain, fever, feeling weak or unwell.\n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 infusions):\nChills,migraine, increasedblood pressure, dizziness, abdominal bloating, skin rash/allergic \nrash/redness, itching, pain in chest, arms and/or legs, genital swelling (resulting from spread of \nswelling from the infusion site), swelling of the legs, feet and ankles, positive blood tests for \nantibodies.\n\nFrequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data):\nHypersensitivity, influenza-like illness, and infusion site leakage, inflammation of the layers lining the \nbrain (aseptic meningitis).\n\nSide effects seen with similar medicines\nThe following side effects have been observed with infusion of medicines like human normal \nimmunoglobulin 10% given under the skin (subcutaneously). Although these side effects have \nso far not been seen with HyQvia, it is possible that someone using HyQvia may get them:\n\nTrembling, oral tingling, fast heart beat, allergic reactions, flushing or pallor, coldness of hand or feet, \nshortness of breath, swelling of face, excessive sweating, muscle stiffness, change in liver function \nblood tests (alanine aminotransferase increased).\n\nThe following rare side effects have been observed in patients using medicines like human normal \nimmunoglobulin 10% given into a vein (intravenously). These reactions have not been seen with \nHyQvia, but there is a small possibility that someone using HyQvia may get them:\n\nBlood clots in blood vessels (thromboembolic reactions) leading to heart attack, stroke, blockage of \ndeep veins, or of blood vessels supplying the lung (pulmonary embolism), kidney disorder or failure,\ndestruction of red blood cells (haemolysis).\n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet.\n\nReporting of side effects\n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
