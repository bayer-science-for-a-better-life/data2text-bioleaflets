This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n\n \n\nNyvepria 6 mg solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n\n \n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 6 mg of pegfilgrastim* in 0.6 mL solution for injection. The \n\nconcentration is 10 mg/mL based on protein only**.  \n\n \n\n*Produced in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA technology followed by conjugation with \n\npolyethylene glycol (PEG).  \n\n**The concentration is 20 mg/mL if the PEG moiety is included.  \n\n \n\nThe potency of this medicinal product should not be compared to the potency of another pegylated or \n\nnon-pegylated protein of the same therapeutic class. For more information, see section 5.1.  \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect  \n\n \n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 30 mg sorbitol (E420) (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n\n \n\nSolution for injection (injection).  \n\n \n\nClear, colourless, free from visible particles, solution for injection.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n\n \n\nReduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients \n\ntreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia \n\nand myelodysplastic syndromes).  \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n\n \n\nNyvepria therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology and/or \n\nhaematology. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nOne 6 mg dose (a single pre-filled syringe) of Nyvepria is recommended for each chemotherapy cycle, \n\ngiven at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose change is recommended in patients with renal impairment, including those with end-stage \n\nrenal disease.  \n\n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim in children and adolescents have not yet been established. \n\nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \n\nposology can be made.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nNyvepria is injected subcutaneously.  \n\n \n\nThe injections should be given into the thigh, abdomen or upper arm.  \n\n \n\nFor instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n\n \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.  \n\n \n\nLimited clinical data suggest a comparable effect on time to recovery of severe neutropenia for \n\npegfilgrastim to filgrastim in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (see section 5.1). \n\nHowever, the long-term effects of pegfilgrastim have not been established in AML; therefore, it should \n\nbe used with caution in this patient population.  \n\n \n\nGranulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and \n\nsimilar effects may be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro.  \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been investigated in patients with myelodysplastic \n\nsyndrome, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, and in patients with secondary AML; therefore, it should \n\nnot be used in such patients. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast \n\ntransformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from AML. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim administration in de novo AML patients aged < 55 years with \n\ncytogenetics t(15;17) have not been established.  \n\n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been investigated in patients receiving high dose \n\nchemotherapy. This medicinal product should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic \n\nchemotherapy beyond established dose regimens.  \n\n \n\nPulmonary adverse events \n\n \n\nPulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after G-CSF \n\nadministration. Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher \n\nrisk (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nThe onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever, and dyspnoea in association with radiological \n\nsigns of pulmonary infiltrates, and deterioration in pulmonary function along with increased neutrophil \n\ncount may be preliminary signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In such circumstances \n\npegfilgrastim should be discontinued at the discretion of the physician and the appropriate treatment \n\ngiven (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nGlomerulonephritis  \n\n \n\nGlomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, \n\nevents of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and \n\npegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended.  \n\n \n\nCapillary leak syndrome \n\n \n\nCapillary leak syndrome has been reported after G-CSF administration and is characterised by \n\nhypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and haemoconcentration. Patients who develop symptoms of \n\ncapillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, \n\nwhich may include a need for intensive care (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nSplenomegaly and splenic rupture \n\n \n\nGenerally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and cases of splenic rupture, including some fatal \n\ncases, have been reported following administration of pegfilgrastim (see section 4.8). Therefore, \n\nspleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound). A diagnosis of \n\nsplenic rupture should be considered in patients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip \n\npain.  \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia and anaemia \n\n \n\nTreatment with pegfilgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia because full \n\ndose myelosuppressive chemotherapy is maintained on the prescribed schedule. Regular monitoring of \n\nplatelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should be taken when administering \n\nsingle or combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to cause severe thrombocytopenia.  \n\n \n\nSickle cell anaemia \n\n \n\nSickle cell crises have been associated with the use of pegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or \n\nsickle cell disease (see section 4.8). Therefore, physicians should use caution when prescribing \n\npegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease, should monitor appropriate clinical \n\nparameters and laboratory status and be attentive to the possible association of this medicinal product \n\nwith splenic enlargement and vaso-occlusive crisis.  \n\n \n\nLeukocytosis \n\n \n\nWhite blood cell (WBC) counts of 100x109/L or greater have been observed in less than 1% of patients \n\nreceiving pegfilgrastim. No adverse events directly attributable to this degree of leukocytosis have \n\nbeen reported. Such elevation in white blood cells is transient, typically seen 24 to 48 hours after \n\nadministration and is consistent with the pharmacodynamic effects of this medicinal product. \n\nConsistent with the clinical effects and the potential for leukocytosis, a WBC count should be \n\nperformed at regular intervals during therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50x109/L after the expected \n\nnadir, this medicinal product should be discontinued immediately.  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, occurring on initial or subsequent treatment, have \n\nbeen reported in patients treated with pegfilgrastim. Permanently discontinue pegfilgrastim in patients \n\nwith clinically significant hypersensitivity. Do not administer pegfilgrastim to patients with a history \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nof hypersensitivity to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate \n\ntherapy should be administered, with close patient follow-up over several days.  \n\n \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome \n\n \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, has been reported rarely in \n\nassociation with pegfilgrastim treatment. If the patient has developed SJS with the use of \n\npegfilgrastim, treatment with pegfilgrastim must not be restarted in this patient at any time (see also \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\n \n\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rates of generation of \n\nantibodies against pegfilgrastim are generally low. Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all \n\nbiologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present.  \n\n \n\nAortitis \n\n \n\nAortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The \n\nsymptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain, and increased \n\ninflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein and WBC count). In most cases aortitis was diagnosed \n\nby computed tomography (CT) scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of G-CSF (see also \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \nOther warnings \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim for the mobilisation of blood progenitor cells in patients or \n\nhealthy donors have not been adequately evaluated.  \n\n \n\nIncreased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been \n\nassociated with transient positive bone-imaging findings. This should be considered when interpreting \n\nbone-imaging results.  \n\n \n\nNyvepria contains 30 mg sorbitol in each pre-filled syringe which is equivalent to 50 mg/mL. The \n\nadditive effect of concomitantly administered medicinal products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and \n\ndietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account.  \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 6 mg dose, that is to say \n\nessentially âsodium-freeâ.  \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n\n \n\nDue to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapyâ \n\npegfilgrastim should be administered at least 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n\nIn clinical studies, pegfilgrastim has been safely administered 14 days before chemotherapy. \n\nConcomitant use of pegfilgrastim with any chemotherapy agent has not been evaluated in patients. In \n\nanimal models concomitant administration of pegfilgrastim and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or other \n\nantimetabolites has been shown to potentiate myelosuppression.  \n\n \n\nPossible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not been \n\nspecifically investigated in clinical studies.  \n\n \n\nThe potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been \n\nspecifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful.  \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy \n\nassociated with delayed myelosuppression e.g. nitrosoureas.  \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\nSpecific interaction or metabolism studies have not been performed, however, clinical studies have not \n\nindicated an interaction of pegfilgrastim with any other medicinal products.  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of pegfilgrastim in pregnant women. Studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Pegfilgrastim is not recommended during \n\npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nThere is insufficient information on the excretion of pegfilgrastim/metabolites in human milk. A risk \n\nto the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \n\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from pegfilgrastim therapy taking into account the benefit of \n\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nPegfilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats at cumulative \n\nweekly doses approximately 6 to 9 times higher than the recommended human dose (based on body \n\nsurface area) (see section 5.3).  \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n\n \n\nNyvepria has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were bone pain (very common [â¥1/10]) and \n\nmusculoskeletal pain (common [â¥1/100 to Ë1/10]). Bone pain was generally of mild to moderate \nseverity, transient, and could be controlled in most patients with standard analgesics.  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity-type reactions, including skin rash, urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea, erythema, \n\nflushing, and hypotension occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with pegfilgrastim (uncommon \n\n[â¥1/1,000 to <1/100]). Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis can occur in patients receiving \n\npegfilgrastim (uncommon) (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nCapillary leak syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported as \n\nuncommon (â¥1/1,000 to <1/100) in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy following administration \n\nof G-CSFs; see section 4.4 and section âDescription of selected adverse reactionsâ below.  \n\n \n\nSplenomegaly, generally asymptomatic, is uncommon.  \n\n \n\nSplenic rupture including some fatal cases is uncommonly reported following administration of \n\npegfilgrastim (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nUncommon pulmonary adverse reactions including interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, \n\npulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported. Uncommonly, cases have resulted in \n\nrespiratory failure or ARDS, which may be fatal (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIsolated cases of sickle cell crises have been reported in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell \n\ndisease (uncommon in sickle cell patients) (see section 4.4).  \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe data in the table below describe adverse reactions reported from clinical studies and spontaneous \n\nreporting.

The frequency category was estimated from a \n\nstatistical calculation based upon 1,576 patients receiving pegfilgrastim in nine randomised clinical \n\nstudies.  \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nUncommon cases of Sweetâs syndrome have been reported, although in some cases underlying \n\nhaematological malignancies may play a role.  \n\n \n\nUncommon events of cutaneous vasculitis have been reported in patients treated with pegfilgrastim. \n\nThe mechanism of vasculitis in patients receiving pegfilgrastim is unknown.  \n\n \n\nInjection site reactions, including injection site erythema (uncommon) as well as injection site pain \n\n(common) have occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with pegfilgrastim.  \n\n \n\nCommon cases of leukocytosis (WBC >100x109/L) have been reported (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nReversible, mild to moderate elevations in uric acid and alkaline phosphatase, with no associated \n\nclinical effects, were uncommon; reversible, mild to moderate elevations in lactate dehydrogenase, \n\nwith no associated clinical effects, were uncommon in patients receiving pegfilgrastim following \n\ncytotoxic chemotherapy.  \n\n \n\nNausea and headaches were very commonly observed in patients receiving chemotherapy.  \n\n \n\nUncommon elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate \n\naminotransferase (AST), have been observed in patients after receiving pegfilgrastim following \n\ncytotoxic chemotherapy. These elevations are transient and return to baseline.  \n\n \n\nCommon cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported.  \n\n \n\nCases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported in the post-marketing setting with G-CSF use. \n\nThese have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant diseases, sepsis, taking multiple \n\nchemotherapy medications or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe experience in children is limited. A higher frequency of serious adverse reactions in younger \n\nchildren aged 0-5 years (92%) has been observed compared to older children aged 6-11 and \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n12-21 years respectively (80% and 67%) and adults. The most common adverse reaction reported was \n\nbone pain (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose  \n\n \n\nSingle doses of 300 mcg/kg have been administered subcutaneously to a limited number of healthy \n\nvolunteers and patients with non-small cell lung cancer without serious adverse reactions. The adverse \n\nevents were similar to those in subjects receiving lower doses of pegfilgrastim.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, colony stimulating factors; ATC Code: L03AA13. \n\n \n\nNyvepria is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \n\nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\n \n\nHuman G-CSF is a glycoprotein, which regulates the production and release of neutrophils from the \n\nbone marrow. Pegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of recombinant human G-CSF (r-metHuG-CSF) \n\nwith a single 20 kd PEG molecule. Pegfilgrastim is a sustained duration form of filgrastim due to \n\ndecreased renal clearance. Pegfilgrastim and filgrastim have been shown to have identical modes of \n\naction, causing a marked increase in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor \n\nincreases in monocytes and/or lymphocytes. Similarly to filgrastim, neutrophils produced in response \n\nto pegfilgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and \n\nphagocytic function. As with other haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro \n\nstimulating properties on human endothelial cells. G-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells, \n\nincluding malignant cells, in vitro and similar effects may be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro.  \n\n \n\nIn two randomised, double-blind, pivotal studies in patients with high-risk stage II-IV breast cancer \n\nundergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and docetaxel, use of \n\npegfilgrastim, as a single once per cycle dose, reduced the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of \n\nfebrile neutropenia similarly to that observed with daily administrations of filgrastim (a median of \n\n11 daily administrations). In the absence of growth factor support, this regimen has been reported to \n\nresult in a mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia of 5 to 7 days, and a 30-40% incidence of febrile \n\nneutropenia. In one study (n=157), which used a 6 mg fixed dose of pegfilgrastim the mean duration of \n\ngrade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim group was 1.8 days compared with 1.6 days in the filgrastim \n\ngroup (difference 0.23 days, 95% CI -0.15, 0.63). Over the entire study, the rate of febrile neutropenia \n\nwas 13% of pegfilgrastim-treated patients compared with 20% of filgrastim-treated patients (difference \n\n7%, 95% CI of -19%, 5%). In a second study (n=310), which used a weight-adjusted dose \n\n(100 mcg/kg), the mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim group was 1.7 days, \n\ncompared with 1.8 days in the filgrastim group (difference 0.03 days, 95% CI -0.36, 0.30). The overall \n\nrate of febrile neutropenia was 9% of patients treated with pegfilgrastim and 18% of patients treated \n\nwith filgrastim (difference 9%, 95% CI of -16.8%, -1.1%).  \n\n \n\nIn a placebo-controlled, double blind study in patients with breast cancer the effect of pegfilgrastim on \n\nthe incidence of febrile neutropenia was evaluated following administration of a chemotherapy \n\nregimen associated with a febrile neutropenia rate of 10-20% (docetaxel 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for \n\n4 cycles). Nine hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomised to receive either a single dose of \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\npegfilgrastim or placebo approximately 24 hours (day 2) after chemotherapy in each cycle. The \n\nincidence of febrile neutropenia was lower for patients randomised to receive pegfilgrastim compared \n\nwith placebo (1% versus 17%, p < 0.001). The incidence of hospitalisations and IV anti-infective use \n\nassociated with a clinical diagnosis of febrile neutropenia was lower in the pegfilgrastim group \n\ncompared with placebo (1% versus 14%, p <0.001; and 2% versus 10%, p <0.001).  \n\n \n\nA small (n=83), phase II, randomised, double-blind study in patients receiving chemotherapy for \n\nde novo acute myeloid leukaemia compared pegfilgrastim (single dose of 6 mg) with filgrastim, \n\nadministered during induction chemotherapy. Median time to recovery from severe neutropenia was \n\nestimated as 22 days in both treatment groups. Long term outcome was not studied (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIn a phase II (n=37) multicentre, randomised, open-label study of paediatric sarcoma patients receiving \n\n100 mcg/kg pegfilgrastim following cycle 1 of vincristine, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \n\n(VAdriaC/IE) chemotherapy, a longer duration of severe neutropenia (neutrophils <0.5x109) was \n\nobserved in younger children aged 0-5 years (8.9 days) compared to older children aged 6-11 years \n\nand 12-21 years (6 days and 3.7 days, respectively) and adults. Additionally a higher incidence of \n\nfebrile neutropenia was observed in younger children aged 0-5 years (75%) compared to older children \n\naged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (70% and 33%, respectively) and adults (see sections 4.8 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n\n \n\nAfter a single subcutaneous dose of pegfilgrastim, the peak serum concentration of pegfilgrastim \n\noccurs at 16 to 120 hours after dosing and serum concentrations of pegfilgrastim are maintained during \n\nthe period of neutropenia after myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The elimination of pegfilgrastim is \n\nnon-linear with respect to dose; serum clearance of pegfilgrastim decreases with increasing dose. \n\nPegfilgrastim appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil mediated clearance, which becomes \n\nsaturated at higher doses. Consistent with a self-regulating clearance mechanism, the serum \n\nconcentration of pegfilgrastim declines rapidly at the onset of neutrophil recovery (see figure 1). \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Profile of median pegfilgrastim serum concentration and absolute neutrophil count \n\n(ANC) in chemotherapy treated patients after a single 6 mg injection \n\n \n\n \n \n\nDue to the neutrophil-mediated clearance mechanism, the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim is not \n\nexpected to be affected by renal or hepatic impairment. In an open-label, single dose study (n=31) \n\nvarious stages of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease, had no impact on the \n\npharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim.  \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nLimited data indicate that the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim in elderly subjects (> 65 years) is \n\nsimilar to that in adults. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim was studied in 37 paediatric patients with sarcoma, who \n\nreceived 100 mcg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of VAdriaC/IE chemotherapy. The youngest \n\nage group (0-5 years) had a higher mean exposure to pegfilgrastim (AUC) (Â± standard deviation) (47.9 \n\nÂ± 22.5 mcgÂ·hr/mL) than older children aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (22.0 Â± 13.1 mcgÂ·hr/mL and \n\n29.3 Â± 23.2 mcgÂ·hr/mL, respectively) (see section 5.1). With the exception of the youngest age group \n\n(0-5 years), the mean AUC in paediatric subjects appeared similar to that for adult patients with \n\nhigh-risk stage II-IV breast cancer and receiving 100 mcg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of \n\ndoxorubicin/docetaxel (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n\n \n\nPreclinical data from conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity revealed the expected \n\npharmacological effects including increases in leukocyte count, myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, \n\nextramedullary haematopoiesis and splenic enlargement.  \n\n \n\nThere were no adverse effects observed in offspring from pregnant rats given pegfilgrastim \n\nsubcutaneously, but in rabbits pegfilgrastim has been shown to cause embryo/foetal toxicity (embryo \n\nloss) at cumulative doses approximately 4 times the recommended human dose, which were not seen \n\nwhen pregnant rabbits were exposed to the recommended human dose. In rat studies, it was shown that \n\npegfilgrastim may cross the placenta. Studies in rats indicated that reproductive performance, fertility, \n\noestrous cycling, days between pairing and coitus, and intrauterine survival were unaffected by \n\npegfilgrastim given subcutaneously. The relevance of these findings for humans is not known.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \n\nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you.  \n\nâ Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n\nâ If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n\nâ This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n\nâ If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information  \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Nyvepria is and what it is used for  \n\n \n\nNyvepria contains the active substance pegfilgrastim. It is used in patients treated with cytotoxic \n\nchemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells) to reduce the duration of neutropenia \n\n(low neutrophil count, a type of white blood cell) and to help prevent febrile neutropenia (low white \n\nblood cell count with a fever). Nyvepria is for use in adults aged 18 years and over. \n\n \n\nWhite blood cells are important for fighting off infection. If the white blood cell count to fall too low, \n\ndue to your cytotoxic chemotherapy, your body may not be able to fight off microorganisms and this \n\nwill increase the chances of an infection. Pegfilgrastim, is very similar to a natural protein in the body \n\ncalled granulocyte colony stimulating factor and it works by encouraging your bone marrow to \n\nproduce more white blood cells that help your body fight off infections.  \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Nyvepria  \n\n \n\nDo not use Nyvepria  \n\nâ¢ if you are allergic to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n(listed in section 6).  \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Nyvepria: \n\nâ¢ If you have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary \noedema), inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease), or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung \n\ninfiltration).  \n\nâ¢ If you are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) \nor decreased blood platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), which reduces the ability of your blood \n\nto clot.

If you have questions about how to inject, please ask \n\nyour doctor or healthcare provider for help. \n\nâ¢ Make sure the name Nyvepria appears on the carton and pre-filled syringe label. \n\nâ¢ Check the carton and pre-filled syringe label to make sure the dose strength is 6 mg \n(6 mg/0.6 mL). \n\nâ¢ Nyvepria is given as an injection into the tissue just under the skin (subcutaneous injection). \n\nï² Do not use the pre-filled syringe if the date has passed the last day of the month shown. \n\nï² Do not remove the needle cover from the pre-filled syringe until you are ready to inject. \n\nï² Do not use the pre-filled syringe if it has been dropped on a hard surface. Use a new pre-\nfilled syringe and call your doctor or healthcare provider. \n\nï² Do not activate the pre-filled syringe before injection. \n\nï² Do not remove the clear automatic needle guard from the pre-filled syringe. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nï² Do not remove the peelable label on the pre-filled syringe barrel before injecting the \nmedicine. \n\nCall your doctor or healthcare provider if you have any questions. \n\n \n\nStep 1: Prepare \n\nA Remove the pre-filled syringe carton from the refrigerator. Remove the pre-filled syringe inner \n\ncarton from the outer carton by peeling away the cover and gather the supplies needed for your \n\ninjection: alcohol wipes, a cotton ball or gauze pad, a plaster and a sharps disposal container (not \n\nincluded). \n\nFor a more comfortable injection, leave the pre-filled syringe at room temperature (not above 25Â°C) \n\nfor about 30 minutes before injecting. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\n \n\nOn a clean, well-lit work surface, place the new pre-filled syringe and the other supplies. \n\nï² Do not warm the syringe by using a heat source such as hot water or microwave. \nï² Do not leave the pre-filled syringe exposed to direct sunlight. \nï² Do not shake the pre-filled syringe. \nâ¢ Keep pre-filled syringes out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nB Open the inner syringe carton by peeling away the cover. Grab the pre-filled syringe automatic \n\nneedle guard to remove the pre-filled syringe from the carton. \n\n \nFor safety reasons: \n\nï² Do not grasp the plunger rod. \nï² Do not grasp the needle cover. \n \n\nC Inspect the medicine and pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n\n \nï² Do not use the pre-filled syringe if: \n\nâ¢ The medicine is cloudy or there are particles in it. It must be a clear and colourless liquid. \n\nâ¢ Any part appears cracked or broken. \n\nâ¢ The needle cover is missing or not securely attached. \n\nâ¢ The expiry date printed on the label has passed the last day of the month shown. \nIn all cases, call your doctor or healthcare provider. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nStep 2: Get ready \n\nA Wash your hands thoroughly. Prepare and clean your injection site. \n\n \n\n \nYou can use: \n\nâ¢ Upper part of your thigh. \n\nâ¢ Belly, except for a 5 cm (2-inch) area right around your belly button. \n\nâ¢ Outer area of upper arm (only if someone else is giving you the injection). \nClean the injection site with an alcohol wipe. Let your skin dry. \n\n \n\nï² Do not touch the injection site before injecting. \n\nDo not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid injecting into \n\nareas with scars or stretch marks. \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nB Hold the pre-filled syringe by the automatic needle guard. Carefully pull the needle cover straight \n\nout and away from your body. Throw away the needle cover into the sharps disposal container. Do \n\nnot recap. \n\n \n\n            \n \n\nC Pinch your injection site to create a firm surface. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nIt is important to keep the skin pinched when injecting. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nStep 3: Inject \n\nA Hold the pinch. INSERT the needle into skin at 45 to 90 degrees. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nï² Do not touch the cleaned area of the skin.  \n \n\nB PUSH the plunger rod with slow and constant pressure until it reaches the bottom. \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nC When the syringe is empty, LIFT the syringe off skin. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAfter releasing the plunger rod, the pre-filled syringe automatic needle guard will safely cover the \n\ninjection needle.  \n\n \n \n\nï² Do not put the needle cover back on used pre-filled syringes.  \n \n\nWhen you remove the syringe, if it looks like the medicine is still in the syringe barrel, this \n\nmeans you have not received a full dose. Call your doctor or healthcare provider right away.  \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nHealthcare providers only \n\nThe trade name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the \n\npatient file. \n\nRemove and save the pre-filled syringe label. \n\n \n\n \nTurn the plunger rod to move the label into a position where you can remove the syringe label.  \n \n\nStep 4: Finish \n\nA Discard the used pre-filled syringe and other supplies in a sharps disposal container. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMedicines should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n\n \n\nKeep the syringe and sharps disposal container out of sight and reach of children. \n\nï² Do not reuse the pre-filled syringe. \nï² Do not recycle pre-filled syringes or throw them into household waste. \n \n\nB Check the injection site. \n\nIf there is blood, press a cotton ball or gauze pad on your injection site. Do not rub the injection site. \n\nApply a plaster if needed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
