CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of major depressive disorder. \nTreatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. \nTreatment of generalised anxiety disorder. \n \nDuloxetine Zentiva is indicated in adults. \nFor further information see section 5.1. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nMajor depressive disorder \n\nThe starting and recommended maintenance dose is 60 mg once daily with or without food. Dosages \nabove 60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day have been evaluated from a safety \nperspective in clinical trials. However, there is no clinical evidence suggesting that patients not \nresponding to the initial recommended dose may benefit from dose up-titrations. \n \nTherapeutic response is usually seen after 2-4 weeks of treatment. \n \nAfter consolidation of the antidepressive response, it is recommended to continue treatment for several \nmonths, in order to avoid relapse. In patients responding to duloxetine, and with a history of repeated \nepisodes of major depression, further long-term treatment at a dose of 60 to 120 mg/day could be \nconsidered. \n \nGeneralised anxiety disorder \n\nThe recommended starting dose in patients with generalised anxiety disorder is 30 mg once daily with \nor without food. In patients with insufficient response the dose should be increased to 60 mg, which is \nthe usual maintenance dose in most patients. \n \nIn patients with co-morbid major depressive disorder, the starting and maintenance dose is 60 mg once \ndaily (please see also dosing recommendation above). \n \nDoses up to 120 mg per day have been shown to be efficacious and have been evaluated from a safety \nperspective in clinical trials. In patients with insufficient response to 60 mg, escalation up to 90 mg or \n120 mg may therefore be considered. Dose escalation should be based upon clinical response and \ntolerability. \n \nAfter consolidation of the response, it is recommended to continue treatment for several months, in \norder to avoid relapse. \n \nDiabetic peripheral neuropathic pain \n\nThe starting and recommended maintenance dose is 60 mg daily with or without food. Dosages above \n60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day administered in evenly divided doses, \nhave been evaluated from a safety perspective in clinical trials. The plasma concentration of \nduloxetine displays large inter-individual variability (see section 5.2). Hence, some patients that \nrespond insufficiently to 60 mg may benefit from a higher dose. \n \nResponse to treatment should be evaluated after 2 months. In patients with inadequate initial response, \nadditional response after this time is unlikely. \n \nThe therapeutic benefit should be reassessed regularly (at least every three months) (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n\nNo dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients solely on the basis of age. However, as \nwith any medicine, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly, especially with duloxetine \n120 mg per day for major depressive disorder or generalised anxiety disorder, for which data are \nlimited (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nDuloxetine Zentiva must not be used in patients with liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nRenal impairment \n\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine \nclearance 30 to 80 ml/min). Duloxetine Zentiva must not be used in patients with severe renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min; see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \n\nDuloxetine should not be used in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years for the treatment \nof major depressive disorder because of safety and efficacy concerns (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nThe safety and efficacy of duloxetine for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder in paediatric \npatients aged 7-17 years have not been established. Current available data are described in sections \n4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of duloxetine for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain has not \nbeen studied. No data are available. \n \nDiscontinuation of treatment \n\nAbrupt discontinuation should be avoided. When stopping treatment with Duloxetine Zentiva the dose \nshould be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of \nwithdrawal reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in \nthe dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be \nconsidered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nConcomitant use of Duloxetine Zentiva with nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors \n(MAOIs) is contraindicated (see section 4.5). \n \nLiver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nDuloxetine Zentiva should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin or enoxacin \n(i.e. potent CYP1A2 inhibitors) since the combination results in elevated plasma concentrations of \nduloxetine (see section 4.5). \n \nSevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) (see section 4.4). \n \nThe initiation of treatment with Duloxetine Zentiva is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled \nhypertension that could expose patients to a potential risk of hypertensive crisis (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMania and seizures \n \nDuloxetine should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or a diagnosis of bipolar \ndisorder, and/or seizures. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nMydriasis \n \nMydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when \nprescribing Duloxetine Zentiva to patients with increased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute \nnarrow-angle glaucoma. \n \nBlood pressure and heart rate \n \nDuloxetine has been associated with an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant \nhypertension in some patients. This may be due to the noradrenergic effect of duloxetine. Cases of \nhypertensive crisis have been reported with duloxetine, especially in patients with pre-existing \nhypertension. Therefore, in patients with known hypertension and/or other cardiac disease, blood \npressure monitoring is recommended, especially during the first month of treatment. Duloxetine \nshould be used with caution in patients whose conditions could be compromised by an increased heart \nrate or by an increase in blood pressure. Caution should also be exercised when duloxetine is used \nwith medicinal products that may impair its metabolism (see section 4.5). For patients who experience \na sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving duloxetine either dose reduction or gradual \ndiscontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). In patients with uncontrolled hypertension \nduloxetine should not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIncreased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on \nhaemodialysis (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). For patients with severe renal impairment, see \nsection 4.3. See section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction. \n \nSerotonin syndrome \n \nAs with other serotonergic agents, serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, may \noccur with duloxetine treatment, particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents \n(including SSRIs, SNRIs tricyclic antidepressants or triptans), with agents that impair metabolism of \nserotonin such as MAOIs, or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists that may affect the \nserotonergic neurotransmitter systems (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nSerotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, \ncoma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular \naberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea). \n \nIf concomitant treatment with duloxetine and other serotonergic agents that may affect the \nserotonergic and/or dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems is clinically warranted, careful observation \nof the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. \n \nSt. John\u2019s wort \n \nAdverse reactions may be more common during concomitant use of Duloxetine Zentiva and herbal \npreparations containing St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n \nSuicide \n \n\nMajor Depressive Disorder and Generalised Anxiety Disorder \nDepression is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self-harm and suicide (suicide-\nrelated events). This risk persists until significant remission occurs. As improvement may not occur \nduring the first few weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such \nimprovement occurs. It is general clinical experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early \nstages of recovery. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nOther psychiatric conditions for which duloxetine is prescribed can also be associated with an \nincreased risk of suicide-related events. In addition, these conditions may be co-morbid with major \ndepressive disorder. The same precautions observed when treating patients with major depressive \ndisorder should therefore be observed when treating patients with other psychiatric disorders. \n \nPatients with a history of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal \nthoughts prior to commencement of treatment are known to be at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or \nsuicidal behaviour, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. A meta-analysis of \nplacebo-controlled clinical trials of antidepressant medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed \nan increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than \n25 years old. \n \nCases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or \nearly after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8). \n \nClose supervision of patients and in particular those at high risk should accompany medicinal product \ntherapy especially in early treatment and following dose changes. Patients (and caregivers of patients) \nshould be alerted about the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, suicidal behaviour or thoughts \nand unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present. \n \nDiabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain \nAs with other medicinal products with similar pharmacological action (antidepressants), isolated cases \nof suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after \ntreatment discontinuation. Concerning risk factors for suicidality in depression, see above. Physicians \nshould encourage patients to report any distressing thoughts or feelings at any time. \n \nUse in children and adolescents under 18 years of age \n \nDuloxetine should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. \nSuicide-related behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly \naggression, oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in clinical trials among \nchildren and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo. If, based \non clinical need, a decision to treat is nevertheless taken, the patient should be carefully monitored for \nthe appearance of suicidal symptoms (see section 5.1). In addition, long-term safety data in children \nand adolescents concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural development are \nlacking (see section 4.8). \n \nHaemorrhage \n \nThere have been reports of bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and gastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/noradrenaline \nreuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including duloxetine. Duloxetine may increase the risk of postpartum \nhaemorrhage (see section 4.6). Caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants and/or medicinal \nproducts known to affect platelet function (e.g. NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)), and in patients \nwith known bleeding tendencies. \n \nHyponatraemia \n \nHyponatraemia has been reported when administering duloxetine, including cases with serum sodium \nlower than 110 mmol/l. Hyponatraemia may be due to a syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic \nhormone secretion (SIADH). The majority of cases of hyponatraemia were reported in the elderly, \nespecially when coupled with a recent history of, or condition pre-disposing to, altered fluid balance. \nCaution is required in patients at increased risk for hyponatraemia, such as elderly, cirrhotic, or \ndehydrated patients or patients treated with diuretics. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nDiscontinuation of treatment \n \nWithdrawal symptoms when treatment is discontinued are common, particularly if discontinuation is \nabrupt (see section 4.8). In clinical trials adverse events seen on abrupt treatment discontinuation \noccurred in approximately 45% of patients treated with duloxetine and 23% of patients taking placebo. \nThe risk of withdrawal symptoms seen with SSRI\u2019s and SNRI\u2019s may be dependent on several factors \nincluding the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction. The most commonly \nreported reactions are listed in section 4.8. Generally these symptoms are mild to moderate, however, \nin some patients they may be severe in intensity. They usually occur within the first few days of \ndiscontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have \ninadvertently missed a dose. Generally, these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within \n2 weeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged (2-3 months or more). It is therefore \nadvised that duloxetine should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of no \nless than 2 weeks, according to the patient\u2019s needs (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly \n \nData on the use of duloxetine 120 mg in elderly patients with major depressive disorder and \ngeneralised anxiety disorder are limited. Therefore, caution should be exercised when treating the \nelderly with the maximum dosage (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nAkathisia/psychomotor restlessness \n \nThe use of duloxetine has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a \nsubjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability \nto sit or stand still. This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. In patients who \ndevelop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental. \n \nMedicinal products containing duloxetine \n \nDuloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic \npain, major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and stress urinary incontinence). The use \nof more than one of these products concomitantly should be avoided. \n \nHepatitis/increased liver enzymes \n \nCases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver enzymes (>10 times upper limit of normal), \nhepatitis and jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section 4.8). Most of them occurred \nduring the first months of treatment. The pattern of liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular. \nDuloxetine should be used with caution in patients treated with other medicinal products associated \nwith hepatic injury. \n \nSexual dysfunction  \n \nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) \nmay cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction (see section 4.8). There have been reports of long-lasting \nsexual dysfunction where the symptoms have continued despite discontinuation of SSRIs/SNRIs. \n \nSucrose \n \nDuloxetine Zentiva gastro-resistant hard capsules contain sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary \nproblems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency \nshould not take this medicine. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) \n \nDue to the risk of serotonin syndrome, duloxetine should not be used in combination with \nnon-selective irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within at least 14 days of \ndiscontinuing treatment with an MAOI. Based on the half-life of duloxetine, at least 5 days should be \nallowed after stopping Duloxetine Zentiva before starting an MAOI (see section 4.3). \n \nThe concomitant use of Duloxetine Zentiva with selective, reversible MAOIs, like moclobemide, is \nnot recommended (see section 4.4). The antibiotic linezolid is a reversible non-selective MAOI and \nshould not be given to patients treated with duloxetine (see section 4.4). \n \nInhibitors of CYP1A2 \n \nBecause CYP1A2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of duloxetine with potent \ninhibitors of CYP1A2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of duloxetine. Fluvoxamine (100 mg \nonce daily), a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, decreased the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine by \nabout 77% and increased AUCo-t 6-fold. Therefore Duloxetine Zentiva should not be administered in \ncombination with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 like fluvoxamine (see section 4.3). \n \nCNS medicinal products \n \nThe risk of using duloxetine in combination with other CNS-active medicinal products has not been \nsystematically evaluated, except in the cases described in this section. Consequently, caution is \nadvised when duloxetine is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products or \nsubstances, including alcohol and sedative medicinal products (e.g. benzodiazepines, \nmorphinomimetics, antipsychotics, phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines). \n \nSerotonergic agents \n \nIn rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using SSRIs/SNRIs concomitantly with \nserotonergic agents. Caution is advisable if duloxetine is used concomitantly with serotonergic agents \nlike SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants like clomipramine or amitriptyline, MAOIs like \nmoclobemide or linezolid, St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or triptans, tramadol, pethidine and \ntryptophan (see section 4.4). \n \nEffect of duloxetine on other medicinal products \n \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a CYP1A2 substrate, were not significantly affected by co-\nadministration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily). \n \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 \n\nDuloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. When duloxetine was administered at a dose of 60 mg \ntwice daily with a single dose of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased \n3-fold. The co-administration of duloxetine (40 mg twice daily) increases steady state AUC of \ntolterodine (2 mg twice daily) by 71 %, but does not affect the pharmacokinetics of its active 5-\nhydroxyl metabolite and no dosage adjustment is recommended. Caution is advised if duloxetine is co-\nadministered with medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 (risperidone, \ntricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if \nthey have a narrow therapeutic index (such as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol). \n \nOral contraceptives and other steroidal agents \n\nResults of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce the catalytic activity of CYP3A. \nSpecific in vivo drug interaction studies have not been performed. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nAnticoagulants and antiplatelet agents \n\nCaution should be exercised when duloxetine is combined with oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet \nagents due to a potential increased risk of bleeding attributable to a pharmacodynamic interaction. \nFurthermore, increases in INR values have been reported when duloxetine was co-administered to \npatients treated with warfarin. However, concomitant administration of duloxetine with warfarin under \nsteady state conditions, in healthy volunteers, as part of a clinical pharmacology study, did not result \nin a clinically significant change in INR from baseline or in the pharmacokinetics of R- or S-warfarin. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on duloxetine \n \nAntacids and H2 antagonists \n\nCo-administration of duloxetine with aluminium- and magnesium-containing antacids or duloxetine \nwith famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine absorption after \nadministration of a 40 mg oral dose. \n \nInducers of CYP1A2 \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that smokers have almost 50% lower plasma \nconcentrations of duloxetine compared with non-smokers. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data on the use of duloxetine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (AUC) of duloxetine lower than the \nmaximum clinical exposure (see section 5.3). \n \nThe potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \nEpidemiological data have suggested that the use of SSRIs in pregnancy, particularly in late \npregnancy, may increase the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn (PPHN). \nAlthough no studies have investigated the association of PPHN to SNRI treatment, this potential risk \ncannot be ruled out with duloxetine taking into account the related mechanism of action (inhibition of \nthe re-uptake of serotonin). \n \nAs with other serotonergic medicinal products, discontinuation symptoms may occur in the neonate \nafter maternal duloxetine use near term. Discontinuation symptoms seen with duloxetine may include \nhypotonia, tremor, jitteriness, feeding difficulty, respiratory distress and seizures. The majority of \ncases have occurred either at birth or within a few days of birth. \n \nObservational data have provided evidence of an increased risk (less than 2-fold) of postpartum \nhaemorrhage following duloxetine exposure within the month prior to birth. \n \nDuloxetine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the \nfoetus. Women should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant, or intend to \nbecome pregnant, during therapy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nDuloxetine is very weakly excreted into human milk based on a study of 6 lactating patients, who did \nnot breast feed their children. The estimated daily infant dose on a mg/kg basis is approximately \n0.14% of the maternal dose (see section 5.2). As the safety of duloxetine in infants is not known, the \nuse of duloxetine while breast-feeding is not recommended. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nFertility \n \nIn animal studies, duloxetine had no effect on male fertility, and effects in females were only evident \nat doses that caused maternal toxicity. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Duloxetine \nmay be associated with sedation and dizziness. Patients should be instructed that if they experience \nsedation or dizziness they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating \nmachinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with duloxetine were nausea, \nheadache, dry mouth, somnolence, and dizziness. However, the majority of common adverse reactions \nwere mild to moderate, they usually started early in therapy, and most tended to subside even as \ntherapy was continued. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \nclinical trials. \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions \n\nFrequency estimate: Very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000). \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nVery common  Common  Uncommon  Rare  Very Rare \nInfections and infestations \n  Laryngitis   \nImmune system disorders \n   Anaphylactic reaction \n\nHyper-sensitivity \ndisorder \n\n \n\nEndocrine disorders \n   Hypo-thyroidism  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n Decreased \n\nappetite \nHyperglycaemia \n(reported especially \nin diabetic patients) \n\nDehydration \nHyponatraemia \nSIADH6 \n\n \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n Insomnia \n\nAgitation \nLibido decreased \nAnxiety \nOrgasm abnormal \nAbnormal dreams \n\nSuicidal ideation5,7 \nSleep disorder \nBruxism \nDisorientation \nApathy \n\nSuicidal behaviour5,7 \nMania \nHallucinations \nAggression and anger4 \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \nHeadache \nSomnolence \n\nDizziness \nLethargy \nTremor \nParaesthesia \n\nMyoclonus \nAkathisia7 \nNervousness \nDisturbance in \nattention \n\nSerotonin syndrome6 \nConvulsion1 \nPsychomotor \nrestlessness6 \nExtra-pyramidal \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nVery common  Common  Uncommon  Rare  Very Rare \nDysgeusia \nDyskinesia \nRestless legs \nsyndrome \nPoor quality sleep \n\nsymptoms6 \n\nEye disorders \n Blurred vision Mydriasis \n\nVisual impairment \nGlaucoma \n \n\n \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n Tinnitus1 \n\n \nVertigo \nEar pain \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders \n Palpitations Tachycardia \n\nSupra-ventricular \narrhythmia, mainly \natrial fibrillation  \n\n  \n\nVascular disorders \n Blood pressure \n\nincrease3 \nFlushing \n\nSyncope2 \nHypertension3,7 \nOrthostatic \nhypotension2 \nPeripheral coldness \n\nHypertensive crisis3,6 \n \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n Yawning Throat tightness \n\nEpistaxis  \nInterstitial lung \ndisease10 \nEosinophilic \npneumonia6 \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nNausea \nDry mouth \n\nConstipation \nDiarrhoea \nAbdominal pain \nVomiting \nDyspepsia \nFlatulence \n\nGastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage7 \nGastroenteritis \nEructation \nGastritis \nDysphagia \n\nStomatitis \nHaematochezia \nBreath odour \nMicroscopic colitis9 \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n  Hepatitis3 \n\nElevated liver \nenzymes (ALT, AST, \nalkaline phosphatase) \nAcute liver injury \n\nHepatic failure6 \nJaundice6 \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Sweating \n\nincreased \nRash \n\nNight sweats \nUrticaria \nDermatitis contact \nCold sweat \nPhoto-sensitivity \nreactions \nIncreased tendency to \nbruise \n\nStevens-Johnson \nSyndrome6 \nAngio-neurotic \noedema6 \n\nCutaneous \nvasculitis \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n Musculo-skeletal \n\npain \nMuscle spasm \n\nMuscle tightness \nMuscle twitching \n\nTrismus  \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n Dysuria Urinary retention Urine odour abnormal  \n\n\n\n12 \n\nVery common  Common  Uncommon  Rare  Very Rare \nPollakiuria Urinary hesitation \n\nNocturia \nPolyuria \nUrine flow decreased \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n Erectile \n\ndysfunction \nEjaculation \ndisorder \nEjaculation \ndelayed \n\nGynaecological \nhaemorrhage \nMenstrual disorder \nSexual dysfunction \nTesticular pain \n\nMenopausal \nsymptoms \nGalactorrhoea \nHyperprolactinaemia \nPostpartum \nhaemorrhage6 \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n Falls8 \n\nFatigue \nChest pain7 \nFeeling abnormal \nFeeling cold \nThirst \nChills \nMalaise \nFeeling hot \nGait disturbance \n\n  \n\nInvestigations \n Weight decrease Weight increase \n\nBlood creatine \nphosphokinase \nincreased \nBlood potassium \nincreased \n\nBlood cholesterol \nincreased \n\n \n\n1 Cases of convulsion and cases of tinnitus have also been reported after treatment discontinuation. \n2 Cases of orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported especially at the initiation of treatment. \n3 See section 4.4. \n4 Cases of aggression and anger have been reported particularly early in treatment or after treatment \n\ndiscontinuation. \n5 Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after \n\ntreatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n6 Estimated frequency of post-marketing surveillance reported adverse reactions; not observed in placebo-\n\ncontrolled clinical trials. \n7 Not statistically significantly different from placebo. \n8 Falls were more common in the elderly (\u2265 65 years old) \n9 Estimated frequency based on all clinical trial data. \n10Estimated frequency based on placebo-controlled clinical trials. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDiscontinuation of duloxetine (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms. \nDizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia or electric shock-like sensations, particularly \nin the head), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and intense dreams), fatigue, somnolence, \nagitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, headache, myalgia, irritability, diarrhoea, \nhyperhydrosis and vertigo are the most commonly reported reactions. \n \nGenerally, for SSRIs and SNRIs, these events are mild to moderate and self-limiting, however, in \nsome patients they may be severe and/or prolonged. It is therefore advised that when duloxetine \ntreatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nIn the 12 week acute phase of three clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic \npain, small but statistically significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine-\ntreated patients. HbA1c was stable in both duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. In the \n\n\n\n13 \n\nextension phase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, there was an increase in HbA1c in both \nthe duloxetine and routine care groups, but the mean increase was 0.3% greater in the duloxetine-\ntreated group. There was also a small increase in fasting blood glucose and in total cholesterol in \nduloxetine-treated patients while those laboratory tests showed a slight decrease in the routine care \ngroup. \n \nThe heart rate-corrected QT interval in duloxetine-treated patients did not differ from that seen in \nplacebo-treated patients. No clinically significant differences were observed for QT, PR, QRS, or \nQTcB measurements between duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nA total of 509 paediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years with major depressive disorder and 241 paediatric \npatients aged 7 to 17 years with generalised anxiety disorder were treated with duloxetine in clinical \ntrials. In general, the adverse reaction profile of duloxetine in children and adolescents was similar to \nthat seen for adults. \n \nA total of 467 paediatric patients initially randomized to duloxetine in clinical trials experienced a \n0.1 kg mean decrease in weight at 10-weeks compared with a 0.9 kg mean increase in 353 placebo-\ntreated patients. Subsequently, over the four- to six-month extension period, patients on average \ntrended toward recovery to their expected baseline weight percentile based on population data from \nage- and gender-matched peers. \n \nIn studies of up to 9 months an overall mean decrease of 1% in height percentile (decrease of 2% in \nchildren (7-11 years) and increase of 0.3% in adolescents (12-17 years)) was observed in duloxetine- \ntreated paediatric patients (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nCases of overdoses, alone or in combination with other medicinal products, with duloxetine doses of \n5400 mg were reported. Some fatalities have occurred, primarily with mixed overdoses, but also with \nduloxetine alone at a dose of approximately 1,000 mg. Signs and symptoms of overdose (duloxetine \nalone or in combination with other medicinal products) included somnolence, coma, serotonin \nsyndrome, seizures, vomiting and tachycardia. \n \nNo specific antidote is known for duloxetine but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment \n(such as with cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered. A free airway should be \nestablished. Monitoring of cardiac and vital signs is recommended, along with appropriate \nsymptomatic and supportive measures. Gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after \ningestion or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption. \nDuloxetine has a large volume of distribution and forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, and exchange \nperfusion are unlikely to be beneficial. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antidepressants, ATC code: N06AX21 \n \n\nMechanism of action \n \nDuloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor. It weakly \ninhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic \nand adrenergic receptors. Duloxetine dose-dependently increases extracellular levels of serotonin and \nnoradrenaline in various brain areas of animals. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDuloxetine normalised pain thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory \npain and attenuated pain behaviour in a model of persistent pain. The pain inhibitory action of \nduloxetine is believed to be a result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the \ncentral nervous system. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \n\nMajor Depressive Disorder \n\nDuloxetine was studied in a clinical programme involving 3,158 patients (1,285 patient-years of \nexposure) meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression. The efficacy of duloxetine at the \nrecommended dose of 60 mg once a day was demonstrated in three out of three randomised, double-\nblind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose acute studies in adult outpatients with major depressive disorder. \nOverall, duloxetine\u2019s efficacy has been demonstrated at daily doses between 60 and 120 mg in a total \nof five out of seven randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose acute studies in adult \noutpatients with major depressive disorder. \n \nDuloxetine demonstrated statistical superiority over placebo as measured by improvement in the 17-\nitem Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score (including both the emotional and \nsomatic symptoms of depression). Response and remission rates were also statistically significantly \nhigher with duloxetine compared with placebo. Only a small proportion of patients included in pivotal \nclinical trials had severe depression (baseline HAM-D > 25). \n \nIn a relapse prevention study, patients responding to 12-weeks of acute treatment with open-label \nduloxetine 60 mg once daily were randomised to either duloxetine 60 mg once daily or placebo for a \nfurther 6-months. Duloxetine 60 mg once daily demonstrated a statistically significant superiority \ncompared to placebo (p=0.004) on the primary outcome measure, the prevention of depressive relapse, \nas measured by time to relapse. The incidence of relapse during the 6-months double-blind follow-up \nperiod was 17% and 29% for duloxetine and placebo, respectively. \n \nDuring 52 weeks of placebo-controlled double blind treatment, duloxetine-treated patients with \nrecurrent MDD had a significantly longer symptom free period (p < 0.001) compared with patients \nrandomised to placebo. All patients had previously responded to duloxetine during open-label \nduloxetine treatment (28 to 34 weeks) at a dose of 60 to 120 mg/day. During the 52-week placebo-\ncontrolled double blind treatment phase 14.4% of the duloxetine-treated patients and 33.1% of the \nplacebo-treated patients experience a return of their depressive symptoms (p < 0.001). \n \nThe effect of duloxetine 60 mg once a day in elderly depressed patients (\u2265 65 years) was specifically \nexamined in a study that showed a statistically significant difference in the reduction of the HAMD17 \nscore for duloxetine-treated patients compared to placebo. Tolerability of duloxetine 60 mg once daily \nin elderly patients was comparable to that seen in the younger adults. However, data on elderly \npatients exposed to the maximum dose (120 mg per day) are limited and thus, caution is recommended \nwhen treating this population. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nGeneralised Anxiety Disorder \nDuloxetine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo in five out of five studies \nincluding four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled acute studies and a relapse prevention \nstudy in adult patients with generalised anxiety disorder. \n \nDuloxetine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo as measured by \nimprovement in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) total score and by the Sheehan Disability Scale \n(SDS) global functional impairment score. Response and remission rates were also higher with \nduloxetine compared to placebo. Duloxetine showed comparable efficacy results to venlafaxine in \nterms of improvements on the HAM-A total score. \n \nIn a relapse prevention study, patients responding to 6 months of acute treatment with open-label \nduloxetine were randomised to either duloxetine or placebo for a further 6-months. Duloxetine 60 mg \nto 120 mg once daily demonstrated statistically significant superiority compared to placebo \n(p < 0.001) on the prevention of relapse, as measured by time to relapse. The incidence of relapse \nduring the 6-months double-blind follow-up period was 14% for duloxetine and 42% for placebo. \n \nThe efficacy of duloxetine 30-120 mg (flexible dosing) once a day in elderly patients (>65 years) with \ngeneralised anxiety disorder was evaluated in a study that demonstrated statistically significant \nimprovement in the HAM-A total score for duloxetine treated patients compared to placebo treated \npatients. The efficacy and safety of duloxetine 30-120 mg once daily in elderly patients with \ngeneralised anxiety disorder was similar to that seen in studies of younger adult patients. However, \ndata on elderly patients exposed to the maximum dose (120 mg per day) are limited and, thus, caution \nis recommended when using this dose with the elderly population. \n \nDiabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain \n\nThe efficacy of duloxetine as a treatment for diabetic neuropathic pain was established in 2 \nrandomised, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose studies in adults (22 to 88 years) \nhaving diabetic neuropathic pain for at least 6 months. Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major \ndepressive disorder were excluded from these trials. The primary outcome measure was the weekly \nmean of 24-hour average pain, which was collected in a daily diary by patients on an 11-point Likert \nscale. \nIn both studies, duloxetine 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced pain \ncompared with placebo. The effect in some patients was apparent in the first week of treatment. The \ndifference in mean improvement between the two active treatment arms was not significant. At least \n30% reported pain reduction was recorded in approximately 65% of duloxetine treated patients versus \n40% for placebo. The corresponding figures for at least 50% pain reduction were 50% and 26% \nrespectively. Clinical response rates (50% or greater improvement in pain) were analysed according to \nwhether or not the patient experienced somnolence during treatment. For patients not experiencing \nsomnolence, clinical response was observed in 47% of patients receiving duloxetine and 27% of \npatients on placebo. Clinical response rates in patients experiencing somnolence were 60% on \nduloxetine and 30% on placebo. Patients not demonstrating a pain reduction of 30% within 60 days of \ntreatment were unlikely to reach this level during further treatment. \n \nIn an open label long-term uncontrolled study, the pain reduction in patients responding to 8-weeks of \nacute treatment of duloxetine 60 mg once daily was maintained for a further 6-months as measured by \nchange on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 24-hour average pain item. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nDuloxetine has not been studied in patients under the age of 7. \n \nTwo randomized, double-blind, parallel clinical trials were performed in 800 paediatric patients aged 7 \nto 17 years with major depressive disorder (see section 4.2). These two studies included a 10 week \nplacebo and active (fluoxetine) controlled acute phase followed by six months period of active \ncontrolled extension treatment. Neither duloxetine (30-120 mg) nor the active control arm (fluoxetine \n\n\n\n16 \n\n20-40 mg) statistically separated from placebo on change from baseline to endpoint in the Children\u00b4s \nDepression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) total score. Discontinuation due to adverse events was \nhigher in patients taking duloxetine compared with those treated with fluoxetine, mostly due to nausea. \nDuring the 10-week acute treatment period, suicidal behaviours were reported (duloxetine 0/333 [0%], \nfluoxetine 2/225 [0.9%], placebo 1/220 [0.5%]). Over the entire 36-week course of the study, 6 out of \n333 patients initially randomized to duloxetine and 3 out of 225 patients initially randomized to \nfluoxetine experienced suicidal behaviour (exposure adjusted incidence 0.039 events per patient year \nfor duloxetine, and 0.026 for fluoxetine). In addition, one patient who transitioned from placebo to \nduloxetine experienced a suicidal behaviour while taking duloxetine. \n \nA randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in 272 patients aged 7-17 years \nwith generalised anxiety disorder. The study included a 10 week placebo-controlled acute phase, \nfollowed by an 18 week extension treatment period. A flexible dose regimen was used in this study, to \nallow for slow dose escalation from 30 mg once daily to higher doses (maximum 120 mg once daily). \nTreatment with duloxetine showed a statistically significantly greater improvement in GAD \nsymptoms, as measured by PARS severity score for GAD (mean difference between duloxetine and \nplacebo of 2.7 points [95% CI 1.3-4.0]), after 10 weeks of treatment. The maintenance of the effect \nhas not been evaluated. There was no statistically significant difference in discontinuation due to \nadverse events between duloxetine and placebo groups during the 10 week acute treatment phase. Two \npatients who transitioned from placebo to duloxetine after the acute phase experienced suicidal \nbehaviours while taking duloxetine during the extension phase. A conclusion on the overall \nbenefit/risk in this age group has not been established (see also sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nA single study has been performed in paediatric patients with juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome \n(JPFS) in which the duloxetine-treated group did not separate from placebo group for the primary \nefficacy measure. Therefore, there is no evidence of efficacy in this paediatric patient population. The \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study of duloxetine was conducted in 184 \nadolescents aged 13 to 18 years (mean age 15.53 years) with JPFS. The study included a 13- week \ndouble-blind period where patients were randomised to duloxetine 30 mg/60 mg, or placebo daily. \nDuloxetine did not show efficacy in reducing pain as measured by primary outcome measure of Brief \nPain Inventory (BPI) average pain score endpoint: least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in \nBPI average pain score at 13 weeks was -0.97 in the placebo group, compared with -1.62 in the \nduloxetine 30/60 mg group (p = 0.052). The safety results from this study were consistent with the \nknown safety profile of duloxetine. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing duloxetine in all subsets of the paediatric population in the \ntreatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic neuropathic pain and generalised anxiety disorder. See \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDuloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer. Duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative \nenzymes (CYP1A2 and the polymorphic CYP2D6), followed by conjugation. The pharmacokinetics \nof duloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, \nsmoking status and CYP2D6 metaboliser status. \n \nAbsorption \n \nDuloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a Cmax occurring 6 hours post dose. The \nabsolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%). Food delays the \ntime to reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of \nabsorption (approximately 11 %). These changes do not have any clinical significance. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nDistribution \n \nDuloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins. Duloxetine binds to both albumin \nand alpha-l acid glycoprotein. Protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nDuloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in urine. Both \ncytochromes P450-2D6 and 1A2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites glucuronide \nconjugate of 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulphate conjugate of 5-hydroxy 6-methoxy duloxetine. Based \nupon in vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered pharmacologically \ninactive. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers with respect to \nCYP2D6 has not been specifically investigated. Limited data suggest that the plasma levels of \nduloxetine are higher in these patients. \n \nElimination \n \nThe elimination half-life of duloxetine ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 h). After an intravenous \ndose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/h to 46 l/h (mean of 36 l/h). After an oral \ndose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 l/h (mean 101 l/h). \n \nSpecial populations \n \n\nGender \nPharmacokinetic differences have been identified between males and females (apparent plasma \nclearance is approximately 50% lower in females). Based upon the overlap in the range of clearance, \ngender-based pharmacokinetic differences do not justify the recommendation for using a lower dose \nfor female patients. \n \n\nAge \nPharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (\u2265 65 years) \n(AUC increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the \nmagnitude of these changes is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose. As a general \nrecommendation, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nEnd stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving dialysis had 2-fold higher duloxetine Cmax and AUC \nvalues compared with healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic data on duloxetine is limited in patients with \nmild or moderate renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nModerate liver disease (Child Pugh Class B) affected the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine. Compared \nwith healthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% lower, the apparent \nterminal half-life was 2.3 times longer, and the AUC was 3.7 times higher in patients with moderate \nliver disease. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not been studied in patients \nwith mild or severe hepatic insufficiency. \n \nBreast-feeding mothers \n\nThe disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at least 12-weeks \npostpartum. Duloxetine is detected in breast milk, and steady-state concentrations in breast milk are \nabout one-fourth those in plasma. The amount of duloxetine in breast milk is approximately 7 \u03bcg/day \nwhile on 40 mg twice daily dosing. Lactation did not influence duloxetine pharmacokinetics. \n \nPaediatric population \n\nPharmacokinetics of duloxetine in paediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years with major depressive \ndisorder following oral administration of 20 to 120 mg once daily dosing regimen was characterized \nusing population modelling analyses based on data from 3 studies. The model-predicted duloxetine \n\n\n\n18 \n\nsteady state plasma concentrations in paediatric patients were mostly within the concentration range \nobserved in adult patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDuloxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests and was not carcinogenic in rats. \nMultinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other histopathological changes in the rat \ncarcinogenicity study. The underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance are unknown. Female \nmice receiving duloxetine for 2 years had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and \ncarcinomas at the high dose only (144 mg/kg/day), but these were considered to be secondary to \nhepatic microsomal enzyme induction. The relevance of this mouse data to humans is unknown. \nFemale rats receiving duloxetine (45 mg/kg/day) before and during mating and early pregnancy had a \ndecrease in maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live \nbirth indices and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels \nestimated to be at the most at maximum clinical exposure (AUC). In an embryotoxicity study in the \nrabbit, a higher incidence of cardiovascular and skeletal malformations was observed at systemic \nexposure levels below the maximum clinical exposure (AUC). No malformations were observed in \nanother study testing a higher dose of a different salt of duloxetine. In prenatal/postnatal toxicity \nstudies in the rat, duloxetine induced adverse behavioural effects in the offspring at exposures below \nmaximum clinical exposure (AUC). \n \nStudies in juvenile rats reveal transient effects on neurobehaviour, as well as significantly decreased \nbody weight and food consumption; hepatic enzyme induction; and hepatocellular vacuolation at \n45 mg/kg/day. The general toxicity profile of duloxetine in juvenile rats was similar to that in adult \nrats. The no-adverse effect level was determined to be 20 mg/kg/day. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n\u2212 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2212 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2212 If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What you need to know before you take Duloxetine Zentiva \n3. How to take Duloxetine Zentiva \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Duloxetine Zentiva \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Duloxetine Zentiva is and what it is used for \n \nDuloxetine Zentiva contains the active substance duloxetine. Duloxetine Zentiva increases the levels \nof serotonin and noradrenaline in the nervous system. \n \nDuloxetine Zentiva is used in adults to treat: \n\u2022 depression; \n\u2022 generalised anxiety disorder (chronic feeling of anxiety or nervousness); \n\u2022 diabetic neuropathic pain (often described as burning, stabbing, stinging, shooting or aching or \n\nlike an electric shock. There may be loss of feeling in the affected area, or sensations such as \ntouch, heat, cold or pressure may cause pain). \n\n \nDuloxetine Zentiva starts to work in most people with depression or anxiety within two weeks of \nstarting treatment, but it may take 2-4 weeks before you feel better. Tell your doctor if you do not start \nto feel better after this time. Your doctor may continue to give you Duloxetine Zentiva when you are \nfeeling better to prevent your depression or anxiety from returning. \n \nIn people with diabetic neuropathic pain it can take some weeks before you feel better. Talk to your \ndoctor if you do not feel better after 2 months. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Duloxetine Zentiva \n \n\nDo not take Duloxetine Zentiva if you: \n\u2022 are allergic to duloxetine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6); \n\u2022 have liver disease; \n\u2022 have severe kidney disease; \n\u2022 are taking or have taken within the last 14 days, another medicine known as a monoamine \n\noxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (see \u2018Other medicines and Duloxetine Zentiva\u2019); \n\u2022 are taking fluvoxamine which is usually used to treat depression, ciprofloxacin or enoxacin \n\nwhich are used to treat some infections. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n\u2022 are taking other medicines containing duloxetine (see \u2018Other medicines and Duloxetine \nZentiva\u2019)  \n\n \nTalk to your doctor if you have high blood pressure or heart disease. Your doctor will tell you if you \nshould be taking Duloxetine Zentiva. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nThe following are reasons why Duloxetine Zentiva may not be suitable for you. Talk to your doctor \nbefore taking Duloxetine Zentiva if you: \n\u2022 are taking other medicines to treat depression (see \u2018Other medicines and Duloxetine Zentiva\u2019); \n\u2022 are taking St. John\u2019s Wort, a herbal treatment (Hypericum perforatum); \n\u2022 have kidney disease; \n\u2022 have had seizures (fits); \n\u2022 have had mania; \n\u2022 suffer from bipolar disorder; \n\u2022 have eye problems, such as certain kinds of glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye); \n\u2022 have a history of bleeding disorders (tendency to develop bruises), especially if you are \n\npregnant (see \u2018Pregnancy and breast-feeding\u2018); \n\u2022 are at risk of low sodium levels (for example if you are taking diuretics, especially if you are \n\nelderly); \n\u2022 are currently being treated with another medicine which may cause liver damage; \n\u2022 are taking other medicines containing duloxetine (see \u2018Other medicines and Duloxetine \n\nZentiva\u2019). \n \nDuloxetine Zentiva may cause a sensation of restlessness or an inability to sit or stand still. You \nshould tell your doctor if this happens to you. \n \nMedicines like Duloxetine Zentiva (so called SSRIs/SNRIs) may cause symptoms of sexual \ndysfunction (see section 4). In some cases, these symptoms have continued after stopping treatment. \n \nThoughts of suicide and worsening of your depression or anxiety disorder \nIf you are depressed and/or have anxiety disorders you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or \nkilling yourself. These may be increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all \ntake time to work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer. \nYou may be more likely to think like this if you: \n\u2022 have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself; \n\u2022 are a young adult. Information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal \n\nbehaviour in adults aged less than 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an \nantidepressant. \n\n \nIf you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a \nhospital straight away. \n \nYou may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have an anxiety \ndisorder, and ask them to read this leaflet. You might ask them to tell you if they think your depression \nor anxiety is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour. \n \nChildren and adolescents under 18 years of age \nDuloxetine Zentiva should normally not be used for children and adolescents under 18 years. Also, \nyou should know that patients under 18 have an increased risk of side-effects such as suicide attempt, \nsuicidal thoughts and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) when \nthey take this class of medicines. Despite this, your doctor may prescribe Duloxetine Zentiva for \npatients under 18 because he/she decides that this is in their best interests. If your doctor has \nprescribed Duloxetine Zentiva for a patient under 18 and you want to discuss this, please go back to \nyour doctor. You should inform your doctor if any of the symptoms listed above develop or worsen \nwhen patients under 18 are taking Duloxetine Zentiva. Also, the long-term safety effects concerning \n\n\n\n34 \n\ngrowth, maturation, and cognitive and behavioural development of duloxetine in this age group have \nnot yet been demonstrated. \n \nOther medicines and Duloxetine Zentiva \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nThe main ingredient of Duloxetine Zentiva, duloxetine, is used in other medicines for other conditions: \ndiabetic neuropathic pain, depression, anxiety and urinary incontinence. Using more than one of these \nmedicines at the same time should be avoided. Check with your doctor if you are already taking other \nmedicines containing duloxetine. \n \nYour doctor should decide whether you can take Duloxetine Zentiva with other medicines. Do not \nstart or stop taking any medicines, including those bought without a prescription and herbal \nremedies, before checking with your doctor. \n \nYou should also tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: \n \n\u2022 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): You should not take Duloxetine Zentiva if you are \n\ntaking, or have recently taken (within the last 14 days) another antidepressant medicine called a \nmonoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Examples of MAOIs include moclobemide (an \nantidepressant) and linezolid (an antibiotic). Taking a MAOI together with many prescription \nmedicines, including Duloxetine Zentiva, can cause serious or even life-threatening side effects. \nYou must wait at least 14 days after you have stopped taking an MAOI before you can take \nDuloxetine Zentiva. Also, you need to wait at least 5 days after you stop taking Duloxetine \nZentiva before you take a MAOI. \n\n\u2022 Medicines that cause sleepiness: These include medicines prescribed by your doctor including \nbenzodiazepines, strong painkillers, antipsychotics, phenobarbital and antihistamines. \n\n\u2022 Medicines that increase the level of serotonin: Triptans, tramadol, tryptophan, SSRIs (such as \nparoxetine and fluoxetine), SNRIs (such as venlafaxine), tricyclic antidepressants (such as \nclomipramine, amitriptyline), pethidine, St. John\u2019s Wort and MAOIs (such as moclobemide and \nlinezolid). These medicines increase the risk of side effects; if you get any unusual symptom \ntaking any of these medicines together with Duloxetine Zentiva, you should see your doctor. \n\n\u2022 Oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents: Medicines which thin the blood or prevent the \nblood from clotting. These medicines might increase the risk of bleeding. \n\n \nDuloxetine Zentiva with food, drink and alcohol \nDuloxetine Zentiva may be taken with or without food. Care should be taken if you drink alcohol \nwhile you are being treated with Duloxetine Zentiva. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you become pregnant, or you are trying to become pregnant, while you are \n\ntaking Duloxetine Zentiva. You should use Duloxetine Zentiva only after discussing the \npotential benefits and any potential risks to your unborn child with your doctor. \n\n \n\u2022 Make sure your midwife and/or doctor knows you are on Duloxetine Zentiva. When taken \n\nduring pregnancy, similar drugs (SSRIs) may increase the risk of a serious condition in babies, \ncalled persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), making the baby breathe \nfaster and appear bluish. These symptoms usually begin during the first 24 hours after the baby \nis born. If this happens to your baby you should contact your midwife and/or doctor \nimmediately. \n\n \n\u2022 If you take Duloxetine Zentiva near the end of your pregnancy, your baby might have some \n\nsymptoms when it is born. These usually begin at birth or within a few days of your baby being \n\n\n\n35 \n\nborn. These symptoms may include floppy muscles, trembling, jitteriness, not feeding properly, \ntrouble with breathing and fits. If your baby has any of these symptoms when it is born, or you \nare concerned about your baby\u2019s health, contact your doctor or midwife who will be able to \nadvise you. \n\n \n\u2022 If you take Duloxetine Zentiva near the end of your pregnancy there is an increased risk of \n\nexcessive vaginal bleeding shortly after birth, especially if you have a history of bleeding \ndisorders. Your doctor or midwife should be aware that you are taking duloxetine so they can \nadvise you. \n\n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. The use of Duloxetine Zentiva while breast-feeding is \n\nnot recommended. You should ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDuloxetine Zentiva may make you feel sleepy or dizzy. Do not drive or use any tools or machines \nuntil you know how Duloxetine Zentiva affects you. \n \nDuloxetine Zentiva contains sucrose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicinal product. \n \n \n3. How to take Duloxetine Zentiva \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDuloxetine Zentiva is for oral use. You should swallow your capsule whole with a drink of water. \n \nFor depression and diabetic neuropathic pain: \nThe usual dose of Duloxetine Zentiva is 60 mg once a day, but your doctor will prescribe the dose that \nis right for you. \n \nFor generalised anxiety disorder: \nThe usual starting dose of Duloxetine Zentiva is 30 mg once a day after which most patients will \nreceive 60 mg once a day, but your doctor will prescribe the dose that is right for you. The dose may \nbe adjusted up to 120 mg a day based on your response to Duloxetine Zentiva. \n \nTo help you remember to take Duloxetine Zentiva, you may find it easier to take it at the same times \nevery day. \n \nTalk with your doctor about how long you should keep taking Duloxetine Zentiva. Do not stop taking \nDuloxetine Zentiva, or change your dose, without talking to your doctor. Treating your disorder \nproperly is important to help you get better. If it is not treated, your condition may not go away and \nmay become more serious and difficult to treat. \n \nIf you take more Duloxetine Zentiva than you should \nCall your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you take more than the amount of Duloxetine Zentiva \nprescribed by your doctor. Symptoms of overdose include sleepiness, coma, serotonin syndrome (a \nrare reaction which may cause feelings of great happiness, drowsiness, clumsiness, restlessness, \nfeeling of being drunk, fever, sweating or rigid muscles), fits, vomiting and fast heart rate. \n \nIf you forget to take Duloxetine Zentiva \nIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the \nmissed dose and take only a single dose as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten \ndose. Do not take more than the daily amount of Duloxetine Zentiva that has been prescribed for you \nin one day. \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \nIf you stop taking Duloxetine Zentiva \nDO NOT stop taking your capsules without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better. If your \ndoctor thinks that you no longer need Duloxetine Zentiva he or she will ask you to reduce your dose \nover at least 2 weeks before stopping treatment altogether. \n \nSome patients who stop taking Duloxetine Zentiva suddenly have had symptoms such as: \n\u2022 dizziness, tingling, feelings like pins and needles or electric shock-like feelings (particularly in \n\nthe head), sleep disturbances (vivid dreams, nightmares, inability to sleep), fatigue, sleepiness, \nfeeling restless or agitated, feeling anxious, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting), \nshaking (tremor), headaches, muscle pain, feeling irritable, diarrhoea, excessive sweating or \nvertigo. \n\nThese symptoms are usually not serious and disappear within a few days, but if you have symptoms \nthat are troublesome you should ask your doctor for advice. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

nervousness); diabetic neuropathic pain (often described as burning, stabbing, stinging, shooting or aching or like an electric shock. there may be loss of feeling in the affected area, or sensations such as touch, heat, cold or pressure may cause pain). duloxetine zentiva starts to work in most people with depression or anxiety within two weeks of starting treatment, but it may take 2-4 weeks before you feel better. tell your doctor if you do not start to feel better after this time. your doctor may continue to give you duloxetine zentiva when you are feeling better to prevent your depression or anxiety from returning. in people with diabetic neuropathic pain it can take some weeks before you feel better. talk to your doctor if you do not feel better after 2 months.",

to treat some infections. are taking other medicines containing duloxetine (see 'other medicines and duloxetine zentiva') talk to your doctor if you have high blood pressure or heart disease. your doctor will tell you if you should be taking duloxetine zentiva. warnings and precautions the following are reasons why duloxetine zentiva may not be suitable for you. talk to your doctor before

depression or anxiety disorder if you are depressed and/or have anxiety disorders you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. these may be increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all take time to work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer. you may be more likely to think like this if you: have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself; are a young adult. information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal behaviour in adults aged less than 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an antidepressant. if you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a hospital straight away. you may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have an anxiety disorder, and ask them to read this leaflet. you might ask them to tell you if they think your depression or anxiety is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour. children and adolescents under 18 years of age duloxetine zentiva should normally not be used for children and adolescents under 18 years. also, you should know that patients under 18 have an increased risk of side-effects such as suicide attempt, suicidal thoughts and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) when they take this class of medicines. despite this, your doctor may prescribe duloxetine zentiva for patients under 18 because he/she decides that this is in their best interests. if your doctor has prescribed duloxetine zentiva for a patient under 18 and you want to discuss this, please go back to your doctor. you should inform your doctor if any of the symptoms listed above develop or worsen when patients under 18 are taking duloxetine zentiva. also, the long-term safety effects concerning 34 growth, maturation, and cognitive and behavioural development of duloxetine in this age group have not yet been demonstrated. other medicines and duloxetine zentiva tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. the main ingredient of duloxetine zentiva,

avoided. check with your doctor if you are already taking other medicines containing duloxetine. your doctor should decide whether you can take duloxetine zentiva with other medicines. do not start or stop taking any medicines, including those bought without a prescription and herbal remedies, before checking with your doctor. you should also tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois): you should not take duloxetine zentiva if you are taking, or have recently taken (within the last 14 days) another antidepressant medicine called a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (maoi). examples of maois include moclobemide (an antidepressant) and linezolid (an antibiotic). taking a maoi together with many prescription medicines, including duloxetine zentiva, can cause serious or even life-threatening side effects. you must wait at least 14 days after you have stopped taking an maoi before you can take duloxetine zentiva. also, you need to wait at least 5 days after you stop taking duloxetine zentiva before you take a maoi. medicines that cause sleepiness: these include medicines prescribed by your doctor including benzodiazepines, strong painkillers, antipsychotics, phenobarbital and antihistamines. medicines that increase the level of serotonin: triptans, tramadol, tryptophan, ssris (such as paroxetine and fluoxetine), snris (such as venlafaxine), tricyclic antidepressants (such as clomipramine, amitriptyline), pethidine, st. john's wort and maois (such as moclobemide and linezolid). these medicines increase the risk of side effects; if you get any unusual symptom taking any of these medicines together with duloxetine zentiva, you should see your doctor. oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents: medicines which thin the blood or prevent the blood from clotting. these medicines might increase the risk of bleeding. duloxetine zentiva with food, drink and alcohol duloxetine zentiva may be taken with or without food.

planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. tell your doctor if you become pregnant, or you are trying to become pregnant, while you are taking duloxetine zentiva. you should use duloxetine zentiva only after discussing the potential benefits and any potential risks to your unborn child with your doctor. make sure your midwife and/or doctor knows you are on duloxetine zentiva. when taken during pregnancy, similar drugs (ssris) may increase the risk of a serious condition in babies, called persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (pphn), making the baby breathe faster and appear bluish. these symptoms usually begin during the first 24 hours after the baby is born. if this happens to your baby you should contact your midwife and/or doctor immediately. if you take duloxetine zentiva near the end of your pregnancy, your baby might have some symptoms when it is born. these usually begin at birth or within a few days of your baby being 35 born. these symptoms may include floppy muscles, trembling, jitteriness, not feeding properly, trouble with breathing and fits. if your baby has any of these symptoms when it is born, or you are concerned about your baby's health, contact your doctor or midwife who will be able to advise you. if you take duloxetine zentiva near the end of your pregnancy there is an increased risk of excessive vaginal bleeding shortly after birth, especially if you have a history of bleeding disorders. your doctor or midwife should be aware that you are taking duloxetine so they can advise you. tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. the use of duloxetine zentiva while breast-feeding is not recommended. you should ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. driving and using machines

how to take duloxetine zentiva", "Section_Content": "always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. duloxetine zentiva is for oral use. you should swallow your capsule whole with a drink of water. for depression and diabetic neuropathic pain: the usual dose of duloxetine zentiva is 60 mg once a day, but your doctor will prescribe the dose that is right for you. for generalised anxiety disorder: the usual starting dose of duloxetine zentiva is 30 mg once a day after which most patients will receive 60 mg once a day, but your doctor will prescribe the dose that is right for you. the dose may be adjusted up to 120 mg a day based on your response to duloxetine zentiva. to help you remember to take duloxetine zentiva, you may find it easier to take it at the same times every day. talk with your doctor about how long you should keep taking duloxetine zentiva. do not stop taking duloxetine zentiva, or change your dose, without talking to your doctor. treating your disorder properly is important to help you get better. if it is not treated, your condition may not go away and may become more serious and difficult to treat. if you take more duloxetine zentiva than you should call your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you take more than the amount of duloxetine zentiva prescribed by your doctor. symptoms of overdose include sleepiness, coma, serotonin syndrome (a rare reaction which may cause feelings of great happiness, drowsiness, clumsiness, restlessness, feeling of being drunk, fever, sweating or rigid muscles), fits, vomiting and fast heart rate. if you forget to take duloxetine zentiva if you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. however, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and take only a single dose as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. do not take more than the daily amount of duloxetine zentiva that has been prescribed for you in one day. if you stop taking duloxetine zentiva do not stop taking your capsules without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better. if your doctor thinks that you no longer need duloxetine zentiva he or she will ask you to reduce your dose over at least 2 weeks before stopping treatment altogether. some patients who stop taking duloxetine zentiva suddenly have had symptoms such as: dizziness, tingling, feelings like pins and needles or electric shock-like feelings (particularly in the head), sleep disturbances (vivid dreams, nightmares, inability to sleep), fatigue, sleepiness, feeling restless or agitated, feeling anxious, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting), shaking (tremor), headaches, muscle pain, feeling irritable, diarrhoea, excessive sweating or vertigo. these symptoms are usually not serious and disappear within a few days, but if you have symptoms that are troublesome you should ask your doctor for advice. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "duloxetine zentiva", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0},
