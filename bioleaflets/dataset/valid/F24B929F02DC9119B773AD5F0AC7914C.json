CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients (see section 4.2). \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nAranesp treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nPosology \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary. Aranesp \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.  \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved effective dose of Aranesp is \nused to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia whilst maintaining a haemoglobin \nconcentration below or at 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L). Caution should be exercised with escalation of \nAranesp doses in patients with chronic renal failure. In patients with a poor haemoglobin response to \nAranesp, alternative explanations for the poor response should be considered (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n6\n\nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of \n10 g/dL (6.2 mmol/L) to 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than \n12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when \nhaemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) are observed are described below. A rise in \nhaemoglobin of greater than 2 g/dL (1.25 mmol/L) over a four week period should be avoided. If it \noccurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made as provided. \n \nTreatment with Aranesp is divided into two stages, correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients. \n \nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection phase: \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 mcg/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly. Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, the following initial doses can also be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection: 0.75 mcg/kg once every two weeks or 1.5 mcg/kg \nonce monthly. If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dL (0.6 mmol/L) in four \nweeks) increase the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently \nthan once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dL (1.25 mmol/L) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L), a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by \napproximately 25%. If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be \ntemporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be \nreinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose. \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals. \n \nMaintenance phase: \n \nIn dialysis patients, Aranesp may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Aranesp should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose. \n \nIn patients not on dialysis, Aranesp may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly \nor once every two weeks or once monthly. For patients treated with Aranesp once every two weeks, \nafter the target haemoglobin has been achieved, Aranesp may then be administered subcutaneously \nonce monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week dose. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target. \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dL (1.25 mmol/L) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be reduced by approximately 25%. If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin \ncontinues to increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to \ndecrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous \ndose.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks. \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Aranesp. The initial weekly dose \nof Aranesp (mcg/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) \nby 200. The initial every other week dose of Aranesp (mcg/every other week) can be determined by \ndividing the total cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200. Because \nof individual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. \nWhen substituting Aranesp for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two \nweeks and the same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric population with chronic renal failure \n \nTreatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year of age has not been studied in randomised clinical \ntrials (see section 5.1). \n \nCorrection phase: \n \nFor patients \u2265 1 year of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 mcg/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly. Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 mcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every \ntwo weeks. If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dL (0.6 mmol/L) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dL (1.25 mmol/L) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be reduced by approximately 25%. If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin \ncontinues to increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to \ndecrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous \ndose.  \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nCorrection of anaemia in paediatric patients with once monthly Aranesp dosing frequency has not \nbeen studied. \n \nMaintenance phase: \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 1 year of age, in the maintenance phase, Aranesp may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Patients < 6 years of age may \nneed higher doses for maintenance of haemoglobin than patients above that age. Dialysis patients \nconverting from once weekly to once every other week dosing with Aranesp should initially receive a \ndose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  \n \nIn patients \u2265 11 years of age not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once \nevery two week dosing, Aranesp may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial \ndose equal to twice the previous once every two week dose.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n8\n\nClinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that patients receiving r-HuEPO two or three \ntimes weekly may be converted to once weekly Aranesp, and those receiving r-HuEPO once weekly \nmay be converted to once every other week Aranesp. The initial weekly paediatric dose of Aranesp \n(mcg/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240. The \ninitial every other week dose of Aranesp (mcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 240. Because of individual \nvariability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting \nAranesp for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same \nroute of administration should be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dL (1.25 mmol/L) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be reduced by approximately 25%. If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin \ncontinues to increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to \ndecrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous \ndose.  \n \nPatients starting dialysis during treatment with Aranesp should be closely monitored for adequate \ncontrol of their haemoglobin. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks. \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy-induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nAranesp should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dL (6.2 mmol/L)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than \n12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall \nburden of disease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is \nnecessary.  \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of \n10 g/dL (6.2 mmol/L) to 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than \n12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when \nhaemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 mcg (6.75 mcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once \nweekly dosing can be given at 2.25 mcg/kg body weight. If the clinical response of the patient \n(fatigue, haemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nAranesp therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Aranesp is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 mcg, 300 mcg, and 150 mcg should be considered.  \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%. Treatment with Aranesp should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dL (8.1 mmol/L). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to \n12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) or below.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dL (1.25 mmol/L) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nAranesp may be administered subcutaneously by the patient or a carer after being trained by a doctor, \nnurse or pharmacist. \n \nAranesp 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 130, 150, 300, 500 micrograms solution for injection in \npre-filled syringe \nAranesp is administered either subcutaneously or intravenously as described in the posology. \nRotate the injection sites and inject slowly to avoid discomfort at the site of injection. \nAranesp is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled syringe.  \n \nAranesp 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 130, 150, 300, 500 micrograms solution for injection in \npre-filled pen \nAranesp in a pre-filled pen is only for subcutaneous administration. \nRotate the injection sites to avoid discomfort at the site of injection. \nAranesp is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled pen. \n \nAranesp 25, 40, 60, 100, 200, 300 micrograms solution for injection in vial \nAranesp is administered either subcutaneously or intravenously as described in the posology. \nRotate the injection sites and inject slowly to avoid discomfort at the site of injection. \nAranesp is supplied ready for use in a vial. \n \nThe instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the trade name of the \nadministered ESA should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Aranesp therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Aranesp (see section 4.2). Cases of severe \nhypertension, including hypertensive crisis, hypertensive encephalopathy, and seizures, have been \nobserved in CRF patients treated with Aranesp. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n10\n\nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Aranesp should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of ESAs and should therefore be corrected. \nIntercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, haemolysis, severe \naluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis may also compromise \nthe erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of the evaluation. If \ntypical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, an examination of \nthe bone marrow should be considered. If the bone marrow is consistent with PRCA, testing for \nanti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported in association \nwith epoetin treatment. More severe cases have been observed with long-acting epoetins.  \nAt the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored \nclosely for skin reactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, Aranesp should \nbe withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment considered. If the patient has developed a \nsevere cutaneous skin reaction such as SJS or TEN due to the use of Aranesp, treatment with Aranesp \nmust not be restarted in this patient at any time. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with ESAs, including Aranesp. This has been predominantly reported in patients with CRF \ntreated subcutaneously. These antibodies have been shown to cross-react with all erythropoietic \nproteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have neutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should \nnot be switched to Aranesp (see section 4.8). \n \nA paradoxical decrease in haemoglobin and development of severe anaemia associated with low \nreticulocyte counts should prompt to discontinue treatment with epoetin and perform \nanti-erythropoietin antibody testing. Cases have been reported in patients with hepatitis C treated with \ninterferon and ribavirin, when epoetins are used concomitantly. Epoetins are not approved in the \nmanagement of anaemia associated with hepatitis C. \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Aranesp, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of darbepoetin alfa and r-HuEPO, Aranesp should be used with caution in patients with \nliver disease. \n \nAranesp should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia. \n \nMisuse of Aranesp by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cap of the pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of \nlatex), which may cause allergic reactions. \n \nAranesp should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy. Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Aranesp. \n \nThe reported risk of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) should be carefully weighed against the \nbenefits to be derived from treatment with darbepoetin alfa particularly in patients with pre-existing \nrisk factors for TVE, including obesity and prior history of TVEs (e.g., deep venous thrombosis, \npulmonary embolism, and cerebral vascular accident). \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\nChronic renal failure patients \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events including stroke, and vascular \naccess thrombosis was observed when ESAs were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L).  \n \nCaution should be exercised with escalation of Aranesp doses in patients with chronic renal failure, \nsince high cumulative epoetin doses may be associated with an increased risk of mortality, serious \ncardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. In patients with a poor haemoglobin response to epoetins, \nalternative explanations for the poor response should be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values \nbelow 100 mcg/L or whose transferrin saturation is below 20%. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Aranesp therapy. Potassium elevation \nhas been reported in a few patients receiving Aranesp, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Aranesp \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours. In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Aranesp and other ESAs have shown: \n \n\uf0b7 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than \n14 g/dL (8.7 mmol/L), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\uf0b7 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dL (7.5-8.7 mmol/L).  \n\n \n\uf0b7 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy. \nESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\uf0b7 an observed 9% increase in risk for PD or death in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group from a \n\nprimary analysis and a 15% increased risk that cannot be statistically ruled out in patients with \nmetastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to achieve a haemoglobin \nconcentration range of 10 to 12 g/dL (6.2 to 7.5 mmol/L). \n\n \n\uf0b7 non-inferiority of darbepoetin alfa to placebo for overall survival and progression free survival \n\nin patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer receiving chemotherapy when \nadministered to a target haemoglobin of 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) (see section 5.1).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n12\n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer. The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context. Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; \nlife-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events. Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of darbepoetin alfa with other \nsubstances. However, there is potential for an interaction with substances that are highly bound to red \nblood cells e.g. cyclosporin, tacrolimus. If Aranesp is given concomitantly with any of these \ntreatments, blood levels of these substances should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the \nhaemoglobin rises. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Aranesp in pregnant women. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. No alteration of fertility was detected. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing Aranesp to pregnant women. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether Aranesp is excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be \nexcluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain \nfrom Aranesp therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAranesp has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nIdentified adverse reactions associated with Aranesp are hypertension, stroke, thromboembolic events, \nconvulsions, allergic reactions, rash/erythema and pure red cell aplasia (PRCA); see section 4.4. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Aranesp was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. The injection site discomfort was generally mild and transient in nature \nand occurred predominantly after the first injection.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIncidence of adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as: Very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100, < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000, < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000, < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \nData are presented separately for CRF and cancer patients reflecting the different adverse reaction \nprofile in these populations.  \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1,357 patients, 766 who received Aranesp and \n591 patients who received r-HuEPO. In the Aranesp group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% \nwere not receiving dialysis.

In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Aranesp must be discontinued and patients \nshould not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic protein (see section 4.4). \n \nThe frequency of all hypersensitivity reactions was estimated from clinical trial data as very common \nin CRF patients. Hypersensitivity reactions were also very common in the placebo groups. There have \nbeen reports, from post-marketing experience, of serious hypersensitivity reactions including \nanaphylactic reaction, angioedema, allergic bronchospasm, skin rash and urticaria associated with \ndarbepoetin alfa. \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nConvulsions have been reported in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.4). The frequency \nis estimated from clinical trial data as uncommon in CRF patients.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\nIn CRF patients on haemodialysis, events of vascular access thrombosis (such as vascular access \ncomplication, arteriovenous fistula thrombosis, graft thrombosis, shunt thrombosis, arteriovenous fistula \nsite complication, etc.) have been reported in post-marketing data. The frequency is estimated from \nclinical trial data as uncommon.  \n \nCancer patients \n \nHypertension has been observed in cancer patients in post-marketing experience (see section 4.4). The \nfrequency is estimated from clinical trial data as common in cancer patients and was also common in \nthe placebo groups. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have been observed in cancer patients in post-marketing experience. The \nfrequency of all hypersensitivity reactions was estimated from clinical trial data as very common in \ncancer patients. Hypersensitivity reactions were also very common in the placebo groups. There have \nbeen reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, allergic \nbronchospasm, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa.  \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nConvulsions have been reported in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa in post-marketing experience \n(see section 4.4). The frequency is estimated from clinical trial data as uncommon in cancer patients. \nConvulsions were common in the placebo groups. \n \nPaediatric chronic renal failure population \n \nIn all paediatric CRF studies, there were no additional adverse reactions identified for paediatric \npatients compared to those previously reported for adult patients (see section 5.1).  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe maximum amount of Aranesp that can be safely administered in single or multiple doses has not \nbeen determined. Therapy with Aranesp can result in polycythaemia if the haemoglobin is not \ncarefully monitored and the dose appropriately adjusted. Cases of severe hypertension have been \nobserved following overdose with Aranesp (see section 4.4). \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Aranesp should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic preparations, other anti-anaemic preparations, ATC Code: \nB03XA02. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n16\n\nMechanism of action \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nPatients with CRF experienced greater risks for death and serious cardiovascular events when \nadministered ESAs to target higher versus lower haemoglobin levels (13.5 g/dL (8.4 mmol/L) versus \n11.3 g/dL (7.1 mmol/L); 14 g/dL (8.7 mmol/L) versus 10 g/dL (6.2 mmol/L) in two clinical studies. \n \nIn a randomised, double-blind correction study (n = 358) comparing once every two week and once \nmonthly dosing schedules in patients with CRF not on dialysis, darbepoetin alfa once monthly dosing \nwas non-inferior to once every two week dosing for correcting anaemia. The median (quartile 1, \nquartile 3) time to achieve haemoglobin correction (\u2265 10.0 g/dL and \u2265 1.0 g/dL increase from \nbaseline) was 5 weeks for both once every two week (3, 7 weeks) and once monthly dosing (3, \n9 weeks). During the evaluation period (weeks 29-33), the mean (95% CI) weekly equivalent dose was \n0.20 (0.17, 0.24) mcg/kg in the once every two week arm and 0.27 (0.23, 0.32) mcg/kg in the once \nmonthly arm. \n \nIn a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (TREAT) of 4,038 CRF patients not on \ndialysis with type 2 diabetes and haemoglobin levels \u2264 11 g/dL, patients received either treatment with \ndarbepoetin alfa to target haemoglobin levels of 13 g/dL or placebo (with darbepoetin alfa rescue at \nhaemoglobin less than 9 g/dL). The study did not meet either primary objective of demonstrating a \nreduction in risk for all-cause mortality or cardiovascular morbidity (darbepoetin alfa vs placebo; \nHR 1.05, 95% CI (0.94, 1.17)), or all-cause mortality or end stage renal disease (ESRD) (darbepoetin \nalfa vs placebo; HR 1.06, 95% CI (0.95, 1.19)). Analysis of the individual components of the \ncomposite endpoints showed the following HR (95% CI): death 1.05 (0.92, 1.21), congestive heart \nfailure (CHF) 0.89 (0.74, 1.08), myocardial infarction (MI) 0.96 (0.75, 1.23), stroke 1.92 (1.38, 2.68), \nhospitalisation for myocardial ischaemia 0.84 (0.55, 1.27), ESRD 1.02 (0.87, 1.18). \n \nPooled post-hoc analyses of clinical studies of ESAs have been performed in chronic renal \nfailure patients (on dialysis, not on dialysis, in diabetic and non-diabetic patients). A tendency towards \nincreased risk estimates for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events associated \nwith higher cumulative ESA doses independent of the diabetes or dialysis status was observed (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n17\n\nPaediatric population \n \nIn a randomised clinical study 114 paediatric patients aged 2 to 18 with chronic kidney disease \nreceiving or not receiving dialysis who were anaemic (haemoglobin < 10.0 g/dL) and not being treated \nwith an ESA were administered darbepoetin alfa weekly (n = 58) or once every two weeks (n = 56) for \nthe correction of anaemia. Haemoglobin concentrations were corrected to \u2265 10 g/dL in > 98% \n(p < 0.001) of paediatric patients administered darbepoetin alfa once weekly and 84% (p = 0.293) once \nevery two weeks. At the time haemoglobin \u2265 10.0 g/dL was first achieved, the mean (SD) weight-\nadjusted dose was 0.48 (0.24) mcg/kg (range: 0.0 to 1.7 mcg/kg) weekly for the once weekly group \nand 0.76 (0.21) mcg/kg (range: 0.3 to 1.5 mcg/kg) biweekly for the once every two week group. \n \nIn a clinical study in 124 paediatric patients with chronic kidney disease receiving or not receiving \ndialysis aged 1 to 18, patients that were stable on epoetin alfa were randomised to receive either \ndarbepoetin alfa administered once weekly (subcutaneously or intravenously) using a dose conversion \nratio of 238:1 or to continue with epoetin alfa therapy at the current dose, schedule, and route of \nadministration. The primary efficacy endpoint [change in haemoglobin between baseline and the \nevaluation period (week 21-28)] was comparable between the two groups. The mean haemoglobin for \nr-HuEPO and darbepoetin alfa at baseline was 11.1 (SD 0.7) g/dL and 11.3 (SD 0.6) g/dL, \nrespectively. The mean haemoglobin at week 28 for r-HuEPO and darbepoetin alfa was 11.1 (SD \n1.4) g/dL and 11.1 (SD 1.1) g/dL, respectively. \n \nIn an European observational registry study which enrolled 319 paediatric patients with chronic \nkidney disease (13 (4.1%) patients < 1 year of age, 83 (26.0%) patients 1-< 6 years of age, 90 (28.2%) \npatients 6-< 12 years of age, and 133 (41.7%) patients \u2265 12 years of age) receiving darbepoetin alfa, \nmean haemoglobin concentrations ranging between 11.3 and 11.5 g/dL and mean weight-adjusted \ndarbepoetin alfa doses remained relatively constant (between 2.31 mcg/kg month and 2.67 mcg/kg \nmonth) over the study period for the entire study population. \n \nIn these studies, no meaningful differences were identified between the safety profile for paediatric \npatients and that previously reported for adult patients (see section 4.8). \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nEPO-ANE-3010, a randomised, open-label, multicentre study was conducted in 2,098 anaemic women \nwith metastatic breast cancer, who received first line or second line chemotherapy. This was a non \ninferiority study designed to rule out a 15% risk increase in tumour progression or death of epoetin \nalfa plus standard of care (SOC) as compared with SOC alone. At the time of clinical data cutoff, the \nmedian progression free survival (PFS) per investigator assessment of disease progression was \n7.4 months in each arm (HR 1.09, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.20), indicating the study objective was not met. \nSignificantly fewer patients received RBC transfusions in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (5.8% versus \n11.4%); however, significantly more patients had thrombotic vascular events in the epoetin alfa plus \nSOC arm (2.8% versus 1.4%). At the final analysis, 1,653 deaths were reported. Median overall \nsurvival in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group was 17.8 months compared with 18.0 months in the SOC \nalone group (HR 1.07, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.18). The median time to progression (TTP) based on \ninvestigator-determined progressive disease (PD) was 7.5 months in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group \nand 7.5 months in the SOC group (HR 1.099, 95% CI: 0.998, 1.210). The median TTP based on IRC-\ndetermined PD was 8.0 months in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group and 8.3 months in the SOC group \n(HR 1.033, 95% CI: 0.924, 1.156). \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n18\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Aranesp therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomised to receive \nAranesp at 500 mcg once every three weeks or 2.25 mcg/kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 mcg in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 mcg/kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than \n1 g/dL in a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose \nreductions. In the once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports \n500 mcg once every three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the \nincidence of subjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of \ntreatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2,833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an \nopen-label study. Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy. \nThe target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dL; in the remaining three studies it \nwas 12-14 g/dL. In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients \ntreated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls. In the four placebo-controlled studies the \nhazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls. These studies \nhave shown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have \nanaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin \ncompared to controls. Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by \ndifferences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant \nhuman erythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nIn a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study 2,549 adult patients with anaemia \nreceiving chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), \nwere randomised 2:1 to darbepoetin alfa or placebo and treated to a maximum Hb of 12 g/dL. The \nresults showed non-inferiority for the primary endpoint of overall survival with a median survival for \ndarbepoetin alfa versus placebo of 9.5 and 9.3 months, respectively (stratified HR 0.92; 95% CI: 0.83\u2013\n1.01). The secondary endpoint of progression free survival was 4.8 and 4.3 months, respectively \n(stratified HR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.87\u20131.04), ruling out the pre-defined 15% risk increase. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9,000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials. Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8,167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06; 35 trials and \n6,769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dL, is unclear because few \npatients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n19\n\nA patient-level data analysis has also been performed on more than 13,900 cancer patients (chemo-, \nradio-, chemoradio-, or no therapy) participating in 53 controlled clinical trials involving several \nepoetins. Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.06 in \nfavour of controls (95% CI: 1.00, 1.12; 53 trials and 13,933 patients) and for the cancer patients \nreceiving chemotherapy, the overall survival hazard ratio was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.11; 38 trials and \n10,441 patients). Meta-analyses also indicate consistently a significantly increased relative risk of \nthromboembolic events in cancer patients receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 mL/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 mL/kg). \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 mcg/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24). The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics. In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been \nshown that renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum \nhalf-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Aranesp in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the \ndose required to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (2 to 16 years) with CRF who were \neither receiving or not receiving dialysis was assessed for sampling periods up to 2 weeks (336 hours) \nafter one or two subcutaneous or intravenous doses. Where the same sampling duration was used, \nobserved pharmacokinetic data and population pharmacokinetic modelling demonstrated that the \npharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa was similar for paediatric and adult patients with CRF. \n \nIn a phase 1 pharmacokinetic study, following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% \ndifference between paediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity \n(AUC[0-\u221e]) was observed; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) \nobserved for the paediatric patients. AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following subcutaneous administration. Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric \npatients with CRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.  \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 mcg/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/mL (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 mcg/kg weekly and 3 to 9 mcg/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did \nnot change on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks). There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration. A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 mcg/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n20\n\n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of \nthe terminal half-life. In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs darbepoetin alfa produced marked increases in haemoglobin, \nhaematocrits, red blood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected \npharmacological effects. Adverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an \nexaggerated pharmacological effect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). \nThese included myelofibrosis and splenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS \ncomplex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and no effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation \nof non-haematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or \nunexpected mitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of \ndarbepoetin alfa has not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Aranesp is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Aranesp \n3. How to use Aranesp \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Aranesp \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n7. Instructions for injecting with the Aranesp pre-filled syringe \n \n \n1. What Aranesp is and what it is used for \n \nYour doctor has given you Aranesp (an anti-anaemic) to treat your anaemia. Anaemia is when your \nblood does not contain enough red blood cells and the symptoms may be fatigue, weakness and \nshortness of breath.  \n \nAranesp works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is \nproduced in your kidneys and encourages your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. The \nactive substance of Aranesp is darbepoetin alfa produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster \nOvary Cells (CHO-K1).  \n \nIf you have chronic renal failure  \n \nAranesp is used to treat symptomatic anaemia that is associated with chronic renal failure (kidney \nfailure) in adults and children. In kidney failure, the kidney does not produce enough of the natural \nhormone erythropoietin which can often cause anaemia.  \n \nBecause it will take your body some time to make more red blood cells, it will be about four weeks \nbefore you notice any effect. Your normal dialysis routine will not affect the ability of Aranesp to treat \nyour anaemia. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n194\n\n \nIf you are receiving chemotherapy \n \nAranesp is used to treat symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-bone marrow cancers \n(non-myeloid malignancies) who are receiving chemotherapy. \n \nOne of the main side effects of chemotherapy is that it stops the bone marrow producing enough blood \ncells. Towards the end of your chemotherapy course, particularly if you have had a lot of \nchemotherapy, your red blood cell count may fall making you anaemic. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Aranesp \n \nDo not use Aranesp: \n- if you are allergic to darbepoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure which is not being controlled with other \n\nmedicines prescribed by your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Aranesp. \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you are suffering or have suffered from: \n- high blood pressure which is being controlled with medicines prescribed by your doctor; \n- sickle cell anaemia; \n- epileptic fits (seizures);  \n- convulsions (fits or seizures);  \n- liver disease; \n- significant lack of response to medicines used to treat anaemia; \n- an allergy to latex (the needle cap on the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of latex); or \n- hepatitis C. \n \nSpecial warnings: \n- If you have symptoms which include unusual tiredness and a lack of energy this could mean \n\nyou have pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), which has been reported in patients. PRCA means that \nthe body has stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells which causes severe anaemia. \nIf you experience these symptoms you should contact your doctor who will determine the best \ncourse of action to treat your anaemia.  \n\n \n- Take special care with other products that stimulate red blood cell production: Aranesp is one of \n\na group of products that stimulate the production of red blood cells like the human protein \nerythropoietin does. Your healthcare professional should always record the exact product you \nare using. \n\n \n- If you are a patient with chronic renal failure, and particularly if you do not respond properly to \n\nAranesp, your doctor will check your dose of Aranesp because repeatedly increasing your dose \nof Aranesp if you are not responding to treatment may increase the risk of having a problem of \nthe heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. \n\n \n- Your doctor should try to keep your haemoglobin between 10 and 12 g/dL. Your doctor will \n\ncheck that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level, as high haemoglobin \nconcentrations could put you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and \ncould increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n195\n\n- If you have symptoms which include severe headache, drowsiness, confusion, problems with \nyour eyesight, nausea, vomiting or fits (seizures), it could mean that you have very high blood \npressure. If you experience these symptoms you should contact your doctor. \n\n \n- If you are a cancer patient you should be aware that Aranesp may act as a blood cell growth \n\nfactor and in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer. Depending on \nyour individual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable. Please discuss this with your \ndoctor. \n\n \n- Misuse by healthy people can cause life-threatening problems with the heart or blood vessels. \n \n- Serious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal \n\nnecrolysis (TEN) have been reported in association with epoetin treatment. SJS/TEN can appear \ninitially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk. \nAlso, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. These \nserious skin rashes are often preceded by fever and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may \nprogress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-threatening complications.  \nIf you develop a serious rash or another of these skin symptoms, stop taking Aranesp and \ncontact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. \n\n \nOther medicines and Aranesp \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nCyclosporin and tacrolimus (medicines which suppress the immune system) may be affected by the \nnumber of red cells in your blood. It is important to tell your doctor if you are taking either of these \nmedicines. \n \nUsing Aranesp with food and drink \n \nFood and drink do not affect Aranesp. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nAranesp has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you: \n\uf0b7 are pregnant;  \n\uf0b7 think you may be pregnant; or \n\uf0b7 plan to get pregnant.  \n \nIt is not known whether darbepoetin alfa is excreted in human milk. You must stop breast-feeding if \nyou use Aranesp. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nAranesp should not affect your ability to drive or use machinery. \n \nAranesp contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n196\n\n3. How to use Aranesp \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nFollowing blood tests, your doctor has decided you need Aranesp as your haemoglobin level is \n10 g/dL or less. Your doctor will tell you how much and how often you must take Aranesp in order to \nmaintain a haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dL. This may vary depending on whether you are \nan adult or a child.  \n \nInjecting Aranesp yourself \n \nYour doctor may decide that it is best for you or a carer to inject Aranesp. Your doctor, nurse or \npharmacist will show you how to inject yourself with the pre-filled syringe. Do not try to inject \nyourself if you have not been trained. Never inject Aranesp into a vein yourself.  \n \nIf you have chronic renal failure \n \nFor all adult and paediatric patients \u2265 1 year of age with chronic renal failure, Aranesp is given as a \nsingle injection, either under your skin (subcutaneous) or into a vein (intravenous). \n \nIn order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose of Aranesp per kilogram of your body weight will \nbe either: \n\uf0b7 0.75 micrograms once every two weeks, or \n\uf0b7 0.45 micrograms once weekly. \nFor adult patients not on dialysis, 1.5 micrograms/kg once monthly may also be used as the initial \ndose. \n \nFor all adult and paediatric patients \u2265 1 year of age with chronic renal failure, once your anaemia is \ncorrected you will continue to receive Aranesp given as a single injection, either once a week or once \nevery two weeks. For all adults and paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age not on dialysis, Aranesp \ncould also be given as an injection once monthly. \n \nYour doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may \nadjust your dose once every four weeks as necessary in order to maintain long term control of your \nanaemia. \n \nYour doctor will use the lowest effective dose to control the symptoms of your anaemia. \n \nIf you do not respond adequately to Aranesp, your doctor will check your dose and will inform you if \nyou need to change doses of Aranesp. \n \nYour blood pressure will also be checked regularly, particularly at the beginning of your treatment. \n \nIn some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. \n \nYour doctor may decide to change the way that your injection is given (either under the skin or into a \nvein). If this changes you will start on the same dose as you have been receiving and your doctor will \ntake blood samples to make sure that your anaemia is still being managed correctly. \n \nIf your doctor has decided to change your treatment from r-HuEPO (erythropoietin produced by \ngene-technology) to Aranesp, they will choose whether you should receive your Aranesp injection \nonce weekly or once every two weeks. The route of injection is the same as with r-HuEPO but your \ndoctor will tell you how much you should take, and when, and may adjust your dose if necessary. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n197\n\nIf you are receiving chemotherapy \n \nAranesp is given as a single injection, either once a week or once every three weeks, under your skin.  \n \nIn order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose will be \n\uf0b7 500 micrograms once every three weeks (6.75 micrograms of Aranesp per kilogram of your \n\nbody weight), or \n\uf0b7 2.25 micrograms (once weekly) of Aranesp per kilogram of your body weight. \n \nYour doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may \nadjust your dose as necessary. Your treatment will continue until approximately four weeks after the \nend of your chemotherapy. Your doctor will tell you exactly when to stop taking Aranesp. \n \nIn some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. \n \nIf you use more Aranesp than you should \n \nYou could have serious problems if you use more Aranesp than you need, such as very high blood \npressure. You should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if this does happen. If you feel unwell \nin any way you should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Aranesp \n \nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  \n \nIf you have forgotten a dose of Aranesp, you should contact your doctor to discuss when you should \ninject the next dose. \n \nIf you stop using Aranesp \n \nIf you want to stop using Aranesp, you should discuss it with your doctor first. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nThe following side effects have been experienced by some patients taking Aranesp: \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 High blood pressure (hypertension) \n\uf0b7 Allergic reactions \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 Stroke \n\uf0b7 Pain around the area injected  \n\uf0b7 Rash and/or redness of the skin \n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\uf0b7 Blood clots (thrombosis) \n\uf0b7 Convulsions (fits and seizures) \n\uf0b7 Bruising and bleeding at the site of injection  \n\uf0b7 Blood clots in a dialysis access \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n198\n\nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from available data \n\uf0b7 Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) \u2013 (anaemia, unusual tiredness, lack of energy) \n \nCancer patients \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 Allergic reactions \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 High blood pressure (hypertension) \n\uf0b7 Blood clots (thrombosis) \n\uf0b7 Pain around the area injected  \n\uf0b7 Rash and/or redness of the skin \n\uf0b7 Fluid retention (oedema) \n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\uf0b7 Convulsions (fits and seizures) \n\uf0b7 Bruising and bleeding at the site of injection \n \nAll patients \n \nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from available data \n\uf0b7 Serious allergic reactions which may include: \n\n\uf0b7 Sudden life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) \n\uf0b7 Swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in \n\nswallowing or breathing (angioedema) \n\uf0b7 Shortness of breath (allergic bronchospasm) \n\uf0b7 Skin rash \n\uf0b7 Hives (urticaria) \n\n\uf0b7 Serious skin rashes including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have \nbeen reported in association with epoetin treatment. These can appear as reddish target-like \nmacules or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk, skin peeling, ulcers of \nmouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes and can be preceded by fever and flu-like symptoms.  \nStop using Aranesp if you develop these symptoms and contact your doctor or seek medical \nattention immediately.

Instructions for injecting with the Aranesp pre-filled syringe  \n \nThis section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Aranesp. It is important that \nyou do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received training from your doctor, nurse \nor pharmacist. If you have questions about how to inject, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist \nfor assistance. \n \nHow do you or the person injecting you, use the Aranesp pre-filled syringe? \n \nYour doctor has prescribed an Aranesp pre-filled syringe for injection into the tissue just under the \nskin. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will tell you how much Aranesp you need and how frequently \nit should be injected.  \n \nEquipment: \n \nTo give yourself an injection you will need: \n \n\uf0b7 a new Aranesp pre-filled syringe; and \n\uf0b7 alcohol wipes or similar. \n \nWhat should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Aranesp? \n \n1. Remove the pre-filled syringe from the refrigerator. Leave the pre-filled syringe at room \n\ntemperature for approximately 30 minutes. This will make the injection more comfortable. Do \nnot warm Aranesp in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot \nwater). Additionally, do not leave the syringe exposed to direct sunlight. \n\n \n2. Do not shake the pre-filled syringe. \n \n3. Do not remove the cap from the syringe until you are ready to inject. \n \n4. Check that it is the correct dose that your doctor has prescribed. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n202\n\n5. Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed \nthe last day of the month shown. \n\n \n6. Check the appearance of Aranesp. It must be a clear, colourless or slightly pearly liquid. If it is \n\ncloudy or there are particles in it, you must not use it. \n \n7. Wash your hands thoroughly. \n \n8. Find a comfortable, well-lit, clean surface and put all the equipment you need within reach.  \n \nHow do I prepare my Aranesp injection? \n \nBefore you inject Aranesp you must do the following: \n \n1. To avoid bending the needle, gently pull the cap from the needle \n\nwithout twisting as shown in pictures 1 and 2.  \n2. Do not touch the needle or push the plunger. \n3. You may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled syringe. You do not \n\nhave to remove the air bubble before injecting. Injecting the solution \nwith the air bubble is harmless. \n\n4. You can now use the pre-filled syringe. \n\n \nWhere should I give my injection? \n \n\n \n\nThe best places to inject yourself are the top of your thighs and the \nabdomen. If someone else is injecting for you, they can also use the back \nof your arms. \n \nYou may change the injection site if you notice the area is red or sore. \n\n \nHow do I give my injection? \n \n1. Disinfect your skin by using an alcohol wipe and pinch (without squeezing) the skin between \n\nyour thumb and forefinger. \n \n2. Insert the needle fully into the skin as shown by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n3. Inject the prescribed dose subcutaneously as directed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n4. Push the plunger with a slow constant pressure, always keeping your skin pinched, until the \n\nsyringe is empty. \n \n5. Remove the needle and let go of your skin. \n \n6. If you notice a spot of blood you may gently dab it away with a cotton ball or tissue. Do not rub \n\nthe injection site. If needed, you may cover the injection site with a plaster. \n \n7. Only use each syringe for one injection. Do not use any Aranesp that is left in the syringe. \n \nRemember: If you have any problems, please do not be afraid to ask your doctor or nurse for help and \nadvice. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n203\n\nDisposing of used syringes \n \n\uf0b7 Do not put the cap back on used needles, as you may accidentally prick yourself. \n\uf0b7 Keep used syringes out of the reach and sight of children. \n\uf0b7 The used pre-filled syringe should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. Ask \n\nyour pharmacist how to dispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to \nprotect the environment.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n204\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nAranesp 10 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen (SureClick) \nAranesp 15 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen (SureClick) \nAranesp 20 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen (SureClick) \nAranesp 30 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen (SureClick) \nAranesp 40 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen (SureClick) \nAranesp 50 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen (SureClick) \nAranesp 60 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen (SureClick) \nAranesp 80 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen (SureClick) \n\nAranesp 100 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen (SureClick) \nAranesp 130 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen (SureClick) \nAranesp 150 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen (SureClick) \nAranesp 300 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen (SureClick) \nAranesp 500 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen (SureClick) \n\ndarbepoetin alfa \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

What you need to know before you use Aranesp \n3. How to use Aranesp \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Aranesp \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Aranesp is and what it is used for \n \nYour doctor has given you Aranesp (an anti-anaemic) to treat your anaemia. Anaemia is when your \nblood does not contain enough red blood cells and the symptoms may be fatigue, weakness and \nshortness of breath.  \n \nAranesp works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is \nproduced in your kidneys and encourages your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. The \nactive substance of Aranesp is darbepoetin alfa produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster \nOvary Cells (CHO-K1).  \n \nIf you have chronic renal failure  \n \nAranesp is used to treat symptomatic anaemia that is associated with chronic renal failure (kidney \nfailure) in adults and children. In kidney failure, the kidney does not produce enough of the natural \nhormone erythropoietin which can often cause anaemia.  \n \nBecause it will take your body some time to make more red blood cells, it will be about four weeks \nbefore you notice any effect. Your normal dialysis routine will not affect the ability of Aranesp to treat \nyour anaemia. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n205\n\nIf you are receiving chemotherapy \n \nAranesp is used to treat symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-bone marrow cancers \n(non-myeloid malignancies) who are receiving chemotherapy. \n \nOne of the main side effects of chemotherapy is that it stops the bone marrow producing enough blood \ncells. Towards the end of your chemotherapy course, particularly if you have had a lot of \nchemotherapy, your red blood cell count may fall making you anaemic. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Aranesp \n \nDo not use Aranesp: \n- if you are allergic to darbepoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure which is not being controlled with other \n\nmedicines prescribed by your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Aranesp \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you are suffering or have suffered from: \n- high blood pressure which is being controlled with medicines prescribed by your doctor; \n- sickle cell anaemia; \n- epileptic fits (seizures);  \n- convulsions (fits or seizures);  \n- liver disease; \n- significant lack of response to medicines used to treat anaemia; \n- an allergy to latex (the needle cap on the pre-filled pen contains a derivative of latex); or \n- hepatitis C. \n \nSpecial warnings: \n- If you have symptoms which include unusual tiredness and a lack of energy this could mean \n\nyou have pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), which has been reported in patients. PRCA means that \nthe body has stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells which causes severe anaemia. \nIf you experience these symptoms you should contact your doctor who will determine the best \ncourse of action to treat your anaemia.  \n\n \n- Take special care with other products that stimulate red blood cell production: Aranesp is one of \n\na group of products that stimulate the production of red blood cells like the human protein \nerythropoietin does. Your healthcare professional should always record the exact product you \nare using. \n\n \n- If you are a patient with chronic renal failure, and particularly if you do not respond properly to \n\nAranesp, your doctor will check your dose of Aranesp because repeatedly increasing your dose \nof Aranesp if you are not responding to treatment may increase the risk of having a problem of \nthe heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. \n\n \n- Your doctor should try to keep your haemoglobin between 10 and 12 g/dL. Your doctor will \n\ncheck that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level, as high haemoglobin \nconcentrations could put you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and \ncould increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. \n\n \n- If you have symptoms which include severe headache, drowsiness, confusion, problems with \n\nyour eyesight, nausea, vomiting or fits (seizures), it could mean that you have very high blood \npressure. If you experience these symptoms you should contact your doctor. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n206\n\n \n- If you are a cancer patient you should be aware that Aranesp may act as a blood cell growth \n\nfactor and in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer. Depending on \nyour individual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable. Please discuss this with your \ndoctor. \n\n \n- Misuse by healthy people can cause life-threatening problems with the heart or blood vessels. \n \n- Serious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal \n\nnecrolysis (TEN) have been reported in association with epoetin treatment. SJS/TEN can appear \ninitially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk. \nAlso, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. These \nserious skin rashes are often preceded by fever and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may \nprogress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-threatening complications.  \nIf you develop a serious rash or another of these skin symptoms, stop taking Aranesp and \ncontact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. \n\n \nOther medicines and Aranesp \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nCyclosporin and tacrolimus (medicines which suppress the immune system) may be affected by the \nnumber of red cells in your blood. It is important to tell your doctor if you are taking either of these \nmedicines. \n \nUsing Aranesp with food and drink \n \nFood and drink do not affect Aranesp. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nAranesp has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you: \n\uf0b7 are pregnant; \n\uf0b7 think you may be pregnant; or \n\uf0b7 plan to get pregnant.  \n \nIt is not known whether darbepoetin alfa is excreted in human milk. You must stop breast-feeding if \nyou use Aranesp. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nAranesp should not affect your ability to drive or use machinery. \n \nAranesp contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Aranesp \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n207\n\nFollowing blood tests, your doctor has decided you need Aranesp as your haemoglobin level is \n10 g/dL or less. Your injection is to be given under the skin (subcutaneous), and so you may use the \nAranesp pre-filled pen. Your doctor will tell you how much and how often you must take Aranesp in \norder to maintain a haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dL. This may vary depending on whether \nyou are an adult or a child.  \n \nInjecting Aranesp yourself \n \nYour doctor has decided that the Aranesp pre-filled pen is the best way for you, a nurse or a carer to \ninject Aranesp. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will show you how to inject yourself with the \npre-filled pen. Do not try to inject yourself if you have not been trained. Never inject Aranesp into a \nvein yourself. The pre-filled pen is designed to inject the area under your skin only. \n \nFor instructions on use of the pre-filled pen, please read the section at the end of this leaflet. \n \nIf you have chronic renal failure \n \nFor all adult and paediatric patients \u2265 1 year of age with chronic renal failure, Aranesp pre-filled pen is \ngiven as a single injection, under your skin (subcutaneous). \n \nIn order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose of Aranesp per kilogram of your body weight will \nbe either: \n\uf0b7 0.75 micrograms once every two weeks, or \n\uf0b7 0.45 micrograms once weekly.  \nFor adult patients not on dialysis, 1.5 micrograms/kg once monthly may also be used as the initial \ndose. \n \nFor all adult and paediatric patients \u2265 1 year of age with chronic renal failure, once your anaemia is \ncorrected you will continue to receive Aranesp given as a single injection, either once a week or once \nevery two weeks. For all adults and paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age not on dialysis, Aranesp \ncould also be given as an injection once monthly. \n \nYour doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may \nadjust your dose once every four weeks as necessary in order to maintain long term control of your \nanaemia. \n \nYour doctor will use the lowest effective dose to control the symptoms of your anaemia. \n \nIf you do not respond adequately to Aranesp, your doctor will check your dose and will inform you if \nyou need to change doses of Aranesp. \n \nYour blood pressure will also be checked regularly, particularly at the beginning of your treatment. \n \nIn some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. \n \nYour doctor may decide to change the way that your injection is given (either under the skin or into a \nvein). If this changes you will start on the same dose as you have been receiving and your doctor will \ntake blood samples to make sure that your anaemia is still being managed correctly. \n \nIf your doctor has decided to change your treatment from r-HuEPO (erythropoietin produced by \ngene-technology) to Aranesp, they will choose whether you should receive your Aranesp injection \nonce weekly or once every two weeks. The route of injection is the same as with r-HuEPO but your \ndoctor will tell you how much you should take, and when, and may adjust your dose if necessary. \n \nIf you are receiving chemotherapy \n \nAranesp is given as a single injection, either once a week or once every three weeks, under your skin.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n208\n\n \nIn order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose will be \n\uf0b7 500 micrograms once every three weeks (6.75 micrograms of Aranesp per kilogram of your \n\nbody weight), or \n\uf0b7 2.25 micrograms (once weekly) of Aranesp per kilogram of your body weight. \n \nYour doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may \nadjust your dose as necessary. Your treatment will continue until approximately four weeks after the \nend of your chemotherapy. Your doctor will tell you exactly when to stop taking Aranesp. \n \nIn some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. \n \nIf you use more Aranesp than you should \n \nYou could have serious problems if you use more Aranesp than you need, such as very high blood \npressure. You should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if this does happen. If you feel unwell \nin any way you should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Aranesp \n \nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have forgotten a dose of Aranesp, you should contact your doctor to discuss when you should \ninject the next dose. \n \nIf you stop using Aranesp \n \nIf you want to stop using Aranesp, you should discuss it with your doctor first. \n \n \n4.

What Aranesp is and what it is used for \n \nYour doctor has given you Aranesp (an anti-anaemic) to treat your anaemia. Anaemia is when your \nblood does not contain enough red blood cells and the symptoms may be fatigue, weakness and \nshortness of breath.  \n \nAranesp works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is \nproduced in your kidneys and encourages your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. The \nactive substance of Aranesp is darbepoetin alfa produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster \nOvary Cells (CHO-K1).  \n \nIf you have chronic renal failure  \n \nAranesp is used to treat symptomatic anaemia that is associated with chronic renal failure (kidney \nfailure) in adults and children. In kidney failure, the kidney does not produce enough of the natural \nhormone erythropoietin which can often cause anaemia.  \n \nBecause it will take your body some time to make more red blood cells, it will be about four weeks \nbefore you notice any effect. Your normal dialysis routine will not affect the ability of Aranesp to treat \nyour anaemia. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n221\n\nIf you are receiving chemotherapy \n \nAranesp is used to treat symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-bone marrow cancers \n(non-myeloid malignancies) who are receiving chemotherapy. \n \nOne of the main side effects of chemotherapy is that it stops the bone marrow producing enough blood \ncells. Towards the end of your chemotherapy course, particularly if you have had a lot of \nchemotherapy, your red blood cell count may fall making you anaemic. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Aranesp \n \nDo not use Aranesp: \n- if you are allergic to darbepoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure which is not being controlled with other \n\nmedicines prescribed by your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Aranesp. \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you are suffering or have suffered from: \n- high blood pressure which is being controlled with medicines prescribed by your doctor; \n- sickle cell anaemia; \n- epileptic fits (seizures);  \n- convulsions (fits or seizures);  \n- liver disease; \n- significant lack of response to medicines used to treat anaemia; \n- an allergy to latex (the needle cap on the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of latex); or \n- hepatitis C. \n \nSpecial warnings: \n- If you have symptoms which include unusual tiredness and a lack of energy this could mean \n\nyou have pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), which has been reported in patients. PRCA means that \nthe body has stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells which causes severe anaemia. \nIf you experience these symptoms you should contact your doctor who will determine the best \ncourse of action to treat your anaemia.  \n\n \n- Take special care with other products that stimulate red blood cell production: Aranesp is one of \n\na group of products that stimulate the production of red blood cells like the human protein \nerythropoietin does. Your healthcare professional should always record the exact product you \nare using. \n\n \n- If you are a patient with chronic renal failure, and particularly if you do not respond properly to \n\nAranesp, your doctor will check your dose of Aranesp because repeatedly increasing your dose \nof Aranesp if you are not responding to treatment may increase the risk of having a problem of \nthe heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. \n\n \n- Your doctor should try to keep your haemoglobin between 10 and 12 g/dL. Your doctor will \n\ncheck that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level, as high haemoglobin \nconcentrations could put you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and \ncould increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. \n\n \n- If you have symptoms which include severe headache, drowsiness, confusion, problems with \n\nyour eyesight, nausea, vomiting or fits (seizures), it could mean that you have very high blood \npressure. If you experience these symptoms you should contact your doctor. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n222\n\n \n- If you are a cancer patient you should be aware that Aranesp may act as a blood cell growth \n\nfactor and in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer. Depending on \nyour individual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable. Please discuss this with your \ndoctor. \n\n \n- Misuse by healthy people can cause life-threatening problems with the heart or blood vessels. \n \n- Serious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal \n\nnecrolysis (TEN) have been reported in association with epoetin treatment. SJS/TEN can appear \ninitially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk. \nAlso, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. These \nserious skin rashes are often preceded by fever and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may \nprogress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-threatening complications. If you develop a \nserious rash or another of these skin symptoms, stop taking Aranesp and contact your doctor or \nseek medical attention immediately. \n\n \nOther medicines and Aranesp \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nCyclosporin and tacrolimus (medicines which suppress the immune system) may be affected by the \nnumber of red cells in your blood. It is important to tell your doctor if you are taking either of these \nmedicines. \n \nUsing Aranesp with food and drink \n \nFood and drink do not affect Aranesp. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nAranesp has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you: \n\uf0b7 are pregnant;  \n\uf0b7 think you may be pregnant; or \n\uf0b7 plan to get pregnant.  \n \nIt is not known whether darbepoetin alfa is excreted in human milk. You must stop breast-feeding if \nyou use Aranesp. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nAranesp should not affect your ability to drive or use machinery. \n \nAranesp contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Aranesp \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n223\n\nFollowing blood tests, your doctor has decided you need Aranesp as your haemoglobin level is \n10 g/dL or less. Your doctor will tell you how much and how often you must take Aranesp in order to \nmaintain a haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dL. This may vary depending on whether you are \nan adult or a child.  \n \nInjecting Aranesp yourself \n \nYour doctor may decide that it is best for you or a carer to inject Aranesp. Your doctor, nurse or \npharmacist will show you how to inject yourself with the pre-filled syringe. Do not try to inject \nyourself if you have not been trained. Never inject Aranesp into a vein yourself.  \n \nIf you have chronic renal failure \n \nFor all adult and paediatric patients \u2265 1 year of age with chronic renal failure, Aranesp is given as a \nsingle injection, either under your skin (subcutaneous) or into a vein (intravenous). \n \nIn order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose of Aranesp per kilogram of your body weight will \nbe either: \n\uf0b7 0.75 micrograms once every two weeks, or \n\uf0b7 0.45 micrograms once weekly. \nFor adult patients not on dialysis, 1.5 micrograms/kg once monthly may also be used as the initial \ndose. \n \nFor all adult and paediatric patients \u2265 1 year of age with chronic renal failure, once your anaemia is \ncorrected you will continue to receive Aranesp given as a single injection, either once a week or once \nevery two weeks. For all adults and paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age not on dialysis, Aranesp \ncould also be given as an injection once monthly. \n \nYour doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may \nadjust your dose once every four weeks as necessary in order to maintain long term control of your \nanaemia. \n \nYour doctor will use the lowest effective dose to control the symptoms of your anaemia. \n \nIf you do not respond adequately to Aranesp, your doctor will check your dose and will inform you if \nyou need to change doses of Aranesp. \n \nYour blood pressure will also be checked regularly, particularly at the beginning of your treatment. \n \nIn some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. \n \nYour doctor may decide to change the way that your injection is given (either under the skin or into a \nvein). If this changes you will start on the same dose as you have been receiving and your doctor will \ntake blood samples to make sure that your anaemia is still being managed correctly. \n \nIf your doctor has decided to change your treatment from r-HuEPO (erythropoietin produced by \ngene-technology) to Aranesp, they will choose whether you should receive your Aranesp injection \nonce weekly or once every two weeks. The route of injection is the same as with r-HuEPO but your \ndoctor will tell you how much you should take, and when, and may adjust your dose if necessary. \n \nIf you are receiving chemotherapy \n \nAranesp is given as a single injection, either once a week or once every three weeks, under your skin.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n224\n\nIn order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose will be \n\uf0b7 500 micrograms once every three weeks (6.75 micrograms of Aranesp per kilogram of your \n\nbody weight), or \n\uf0b7 2.25 micrograms (once weekly) of Aranesp per kilogram of your body weight. \n \nYour doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may \nadjust your dose as necessary. Your treatment will continue until approximately four weeks after the \nend of your chemotherapy. Your doctor will tell you exactly when to stop taking Aranesp. \n \nIn some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. \n \nIf you use more Aranesp than you should \n \nYou could have serious problems if you use more Aranesp than you need, such as very high blood \npressure. You should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if this does happen. If you feel unwell \nin any way you should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Aranesp \n \nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have forgotten a dose of Aranesp, you should contact your doctor to discuss when you should \ninject the next dose. \n \nIf you stop using Aranesp \n \nIf you want to stop using Aranesp, you should discuss it with your doctor first. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nThe following side effects have been experienced by some patients taking Aranesp: \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 High blood pressure (hypertension) \n\uf0b7 Allergic reactions \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 Stroke \n\uf0b7 Pain around the area injected  \n\uf0b7 Rash and/or redness of the skin \n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\uf0b7 Blood clots (thrombosis) \n\uf0b7 Convulsions (fits and seizures) \n\uf0b7 Bruising and bleeding at the site of injection \n\uf0b7 Blood clots in a dialysis access \n \nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from available data \n\uf0b7 Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) \u2013 (anaemia, unusual tiredness, lack of energy) \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n225\n\nCancer patients \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 Allergic reactions \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 High blood pressure (hypertension) \n\uf0b7 Blood clots (thrombosis) \n\uf0b7 Pain around the area injected  \n\uf0b7 Rash and/or redness of the skin \n\uf0b7 Fluid retention (oedema) \n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\uf0b7 Convulsions (fits and seizures) \n\uf0b7 Bruising and bleeding at the site of injection \n \nAll patients \n \nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from available data \n\uf0b7 Serious allergic reactions which may include: \n\n\uf0b7 Sudden life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) \n\uf0b7 Swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in \n\nswallowing or breathing (angioedema) \n\uf0b7 Shortness of breath (allergic bronchospasm) \n\uf0b7 Skin rash \n\uf0b7 Hives (urticaria) \n\n\uf0b7 Serious skin rashes including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have \nbeen reported in association with epoetin treatment. These can appear as reddish target-like \nmacules or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk, skin peeling, ulcers of \nmouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes and can be preceded by fever and flu-like symptoms. \nStop using Aranesp if you develop these symptoms and contact your doctor or seek medical \nattention immediately.

What Aranesp is and what it is used for \n \nYour doctor has given you Aranesp (an anti-anaemic) to treat your anaemia. Anaemia is when your \nblood does not contain enough red blood cells and the symptoms may be fatigue, weakness and \nshortness of breath.  \n \nAranesp works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is \nproduced in your kidneys and encourages your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. The \nactive substance of Aranesp is darbepoetin alfa produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster \nOvary Cells (CHO-K1).  \n \nIf you have chronic renal failure  \n \nAranesp is used to treat symptomatic anaemia that is associated with chronic renal failure (kidney \nfailure) in adults and children. In kidney failure, the kidney does not produce enough of the natural \nhormone erythropoietin which can often cause anaemia.  \n \nBecause it will take your body some time to make more red blood cells, it will be about four weeks \nbefore you notice any effect. Your normal dialysis routine will not affect the ability of Aranesp to treat \nyour anaemia. \n \nIf you are receiving chemotherapy \n \nAranesp is used to treat symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-bone marrow cancers \n(non-myeloid malignancies) who are receiving chemotherapy. \n \nOne of the main side effects of chemotherapy is that it stops the bone marrow producing enough blood \ncells. Towards the end of your chemotherapy course, particularly if you have had a lot of \nchemotherapy, your red blood cell count may fall making you anaemic. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n236 \n\n \n2. What you need to know before you use Aranesp \n \nDo not use Aranesp: \n- if you are allergic to darbepoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure which is not being controlled with other \n\nmedicines prescribed by your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Aranesp. \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you are suffering or have suffered from: \n- high blood pressure which is being controlled with medicines prescribed by your doctor; \n- sickle cell anaemia; \n- epileptic fits (seizures);  \n- convulsions (fits or seizures);  \n- liver disease; \n- significant lack of response to medicines used to treat anaemia; or \n- hepatitis C. \n \nSpecial warnings: \n- If you have symptoms which include unusual tiredness and a lack of energy this could mean \n\nyou have pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), which has been reported in patients. PRCA means that \nthe body has stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells which causes severe anaemia. \nIf you experience these symptoms you should contact your doctor who will determine the best \ncourse of action to treat your anaemia.  \n\n \n- Take special care with other products that stimulate red blood cell production: Aranesp is one of \n\na group of products that stimulate the production of red blood cells like the human protein \nerythropoietin does. Your healthcare professional should always record the exact product you \nare using. \n\n \n- If you are a patient with chronic renal failure, and particularly if you do not respond properly to \n\nAranesp, your doctor will check your dose of Aranesp because repeatedly increasing your dose \nof Aranesp if you are not responding to treatment may increase the risk of having a problem of \nthe heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. \n\n \n- Your doctor should try to keep your haemoglobin between 10 and 12 g/dL. Your doctor will \n\ncheck that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level, as high haemoglobin \nconcentrations could put you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and \ncould increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. \n\n \n- If you have symptoms which include severe headache, drowsiness, confusion, problems with \n\nyour eyesight, nausea, vomiting or fits (seizures), it could mean that you have very high blood \npressure. If you experience these symptoms you should contact your doctor. \n\n \n- If you are a cancer patient you should be aware that Aranesp may act as a blood cell growth \n\nfactor and in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer. Depending on \nyour individual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable. Please discuss this with your \ndoctor. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n237 \n\n- Misuse by healthy people can cause life-threatening problems with the heart or blood vessels. \n \n- Serious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal \n\nnecrolysis (TEN) have been reported in association with epoetin treatment. SJS/TEN can appear \ninitially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk. \nAlso, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. These \nserious skin rashes are often preceded by fever and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may \nprogress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-threatening complications.  \nIf you develop a serious rash or another of these skin symptoms, stop taking Aranesp and \ncontact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. \n\n \nOther medicines and Aranesp \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nCyclosporin and tacrolimus (medicines which suppress the immune system) may be affected by the \nnumber of red cells in your blood. It is important to tell your doctor if you are taking either of these \nmedicines. \n \nUsing Aranesp with food and drink \n \nFood and drink do not affect Aranesp. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nAranesp has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you: \n\uf0b7 are pregnant;  \n\uf0b7 think you may be pregnant; or \n\uf0b7 plan to get pregnant.  \n \nIt is not known whether darbepoetin alfa is excreted in human milk. You must stop breast-feeding if \nyou use Aranesp. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nAranesp should not affect your ability to drive or use machinery. \n \nAranesp contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Aranesp \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nFollowing blood tests, your doctor has decided you need Aranesp as your haemoglobin level is \n10 g/dL or less. Your doctor will tell you how much and how often you must take Aranesp in order to \nmaintain a haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dL. This may vary depending on whether you are \nan adult or a child.  \n \nThe injections will be given by a healthcare professional. \n\n\n\n \n\n238 \n\n \nIf you have chronic renal failure \n \nFor all adult and paediatric patients \u2265 1 year of age with chronic renal failure, Aranesp is given as a \nsingle injection by a healthcare professional, either under your skin (subcutaneous) or into a vein \n(intravenous). \n \nIn order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose of Aranesp per kilogram of your body weight will \nbe either: \n\uf0b7 0.75 micrograms once every two weeks, or \n\uf0b7 0.45 micrograms once weekly.  \nFor adult patients not on dialysis, 1.5 micrograms/kg once monthly may also be used as the initial \ndose. \n \nFor all adult and paediatric patients \u2265 1 year of age with chronic renal failure, once your anaemia is \ncorrected you will continue to receive Aranesp given as a single injection, either once a week or once \nevery two weeks. For all adults and paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age not on dialysis, Aranesp \ncould also be given as an injection once monthly. \n \nYour doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may \nadjust your dose once every four weeks as necessary in order to maintain long term control of your \nanaemia. \n \nYour doctor will use the lowest effective dose to control the symptoms of your anaemia. \n \nIf you do not respond adequately to Aranesp, your doctor will check your dose and will inform you if \nyou need to change doses of Aranesp. \n \nYour blood pressure will also be checked regularly, particularly at the beginning of your treatment. \n \nIn some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. \n \nYour doctor may decide to change the way that your injection is given (either under the skin or into a \nvein). If this changes you will start on the same dose as you have been receiving and your doctor will \ntake blood samples to make sure that your anaemia is still being managed correctly. \n \nIf your doctor has decided to change your treatment from r-HuEPO (erythropoietin produced by \ngene-technology) to Aranesp, they will choose whether you should receive your Aranesp injection \nonce weekly or once every two weeks. The route of injection is the same as with r-HuEPO but your \ndoctor will tell you how much you should take, and when, and may adjust your dose if necessary. \n \nIf you are receiving chemotherapy \n \nAranesp is given as a single injection, either once a week or once every three weeks, under your skin.  \n \nIn order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose will be \n\uf0b7 500 micrograms once every three weeks (6.75 micrograms of Aranesp per kilogram of your \n\nbody weight), or \n\uf0b7 2.25 micrograms (once weekly) of Aranesp per kilogram of your body weight. \n \nYour doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may \nadjust your dose as necessary. Your treatment will continue until approximately four weeks after the \nend of your chemotherapy. Your doctor will tell you exactly when to stop taking Aranesp. \n \nIn some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n239 \n\nIf you use more Aranesp than you should \n \nYou could have serious problems if you receive more Aranesp than you need, such as very high blood \npressure. You should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if this does happen. If you feel unwell \nin any way you should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist immediately. \n \nIf you miss a dose of Aranesp \n \nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you miss a dose of Aranesp, you should contact your doctor to discuss when you should receive the \nnext dose. \n \nIf you stop using Aranesp \n \nIf you want to stop using Aranesp, you should discuss it with your doctor first. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nThe following side effects have been experienced by some patients taking Aranesp: \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 High blood pressure (hypertension) \n\uf0b7 Allergic reactions \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 Stroke \n\uf0b7 Pain around the area injected  \n\uf0b7 Rash and/or redness of the skin \n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\uf0b7 Blood clots (thrombosis) \n\uf0b7 Convulsions (fits and seizures) \n\uf0b7 Bruising and bleeding at the site of injection \n\uf0b7 Blood clots in a dialysis access \n \nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from available data \n\uf0b7 Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) \u2013 (anaemia, unusual tiredness, lack of energy) \n \nCancer patients \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 Allergic reactions \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 High blood pressure (hypertension) \n\uf0b7 Blood clots (thrombosis) \n\uf0b7 Pain around the area injected  \n\uf0b7 Rash and/or redness of the skin \n\uf0b7 Fluid retention (oedema) \n \n\n\n\n \n\n240 \n\nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\uf0b7 Convulsions (fits and seizures) \n\uf0b7 Bruising and bleeding at the site of injection \n \nAll patients \n \nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from available data \n\uf0b7 Serious allergic reactions which may include: \n\n\uf0b7 Sudden life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) \n\uf0b7 Swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in \n\nswallowing or breathing (angioedema) \n\uf0b7 Shortness of breath (allergic bronchospasm) \n\uf0b7 Skin rash \n\uf0b7 Hives (urticaria) \n\n\uf0b7 Serious skin rashes including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have \nbeen reported in association with epoetin treatment. These can appear as reddish target-like \nmacules or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk, skin peeling, ulcers of \nmouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes and can be preceded by fever and flu-like symptoms. Stop \nusing Aranesp if you develop these symptoms and contact your doctor or seek medical attention \nimmediately.

"Section_Content": "do not use aranesp: - if you are allergic to darbepoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure which is not being controlled with other medicines prescribed by your doctor. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using aranesp. please tell your doctor if you are suffering or have suffered from: - high blood pressure which is being controlled with medicines prescribed by your doctor; - sickle cell anaemia; - epileptic fits (seizures); - convulsions (fits or seizures); - liver disease; - significant lack of response to medicines used to treat anaemia; - an allergy to latex (the needle cap on the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of latex); or - hepatitis c. special warnings: - if you have symptoms which include unusual tiredness and a lack of energy this could mean you have pure red cell aplasia (prca), which has been reported in patients. prca means that the body has stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells which causes severe anaemia. if you experience these symptoms you should contact your doctor who will determine the best course of action to treat your anaemia. - take special care with other products that stimulate red blood cell production: aranesp is one of a group of products that stimulate the production of red blood cells like the human protein erythropoietin does. your healthcare professional should always record the exact product you are using. - if you are a patient with chronic renal failure, and particularly if you do not respond properly to aranesp, your doctor will check your dose of aranesp because repeatedly increasing your dose of aranesp if you are not responding to treatment may increase the risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. - your doctor should try to keep your haemoglobin between 10 and 12 g/dl. your doctor will check that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level, as high haemoglobin concentrations could put you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. - if you have symptoms which include severe headache, drowsiness, confusion, problems with your eyesight, nausea, vomiting or fits (seizures), it could mean that you have very high blood pressure. if you experience these symptoms you should contact your doctor. - if you are a cancer patient you should be aware that aranesp may act as a blood cell growth factor and in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer. depending on your individual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable. please discuss this with your doctor. - misuse by healthy people can cause life-threatening problems with the heart or blood vessels. - serious skin reactions including stevens-johnson syndrome (sjs) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (ten) have been reported in association with epoetin treatment. sjs/ten can appear initially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk. also, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. these serious skin rashes are often preceded by fever and/or flu-like symptoms. the rashes may progress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-threatening complications. if you develop a serious rash or another of these skin symptoms, stop taking aranesp and contact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. other medicines and aranesp tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. cyclosporin and tacrolimus (medicines which suppress the immune system) may be affected by the number of red cells in your blood. it is important to tell your doctor if you are taking either of these medicines. using aranesp with food and drink food and drink do not affect aranesp. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. aranesp has not been tested in pregnant women. it is important to tell your doctor if you: are pregnant; think you may be pregnant; or plan to get pregnant. it is not known whether darbepoetin alfa is excreted in human milk. you must stop breast-feeding if you use aranesp. driving and using machines aranesp should not affect your ability to drive or use machinery. aranesp contains sodium this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'sodium-free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":

pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. following blood tests, your doctor has decided you need aranesp as your haemoglobin level is 10 g/dl or less. your doctor will tell you how much and how often you must take aranesp in order to maintain a haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dl. this may vary depending on whether you are an adult or a child. injecting aranesp yourself your doctor may decide that it is best for you or a carer to inject aranesp. your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will show you how to inject yourself with the pre-filled syringe. do not try to inject yourself if you have not been trained. never inject aranesp into a vein yourself. if you have chronic renal failure for all adult and paediatric patients \u2265 1 year of age with chronic renal failure, aranesp is given as a single injection, either under your skin (subcutaneous) or into a vein (intravenous). in order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose of aranesp per kilogram of your body weight will be either: 0.75 micrograms once every two weeks, or 0.45 micrograms once weekly. for adult patients not on dialysis, 1.5 micrograms/kg once monthly may also be used as the initial dose. for all adult and paediatric patients \u2265 1 year of age with chronic renal failure, once your anaemia is corrected you will continue to receive aranesp given as a single injection, either once a week or once every two weeks. for all adults and paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age not on dialysis, aranesp could also be given as an injection once monthly. your doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may adjust your dose once every four weeks as necessary in order to maintain long term control of your anaemia. your doctor will use the lowest effective dose to control the symptoms of your anaemia. if you do not respond adequately to aranesp, your doctor will check your dose and will inform you if you need to change doses of aranesp. your blood pressure will also be checked regularly, particularly at the beginning of your treatment. in some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. your doctor may decide to change the way that your injection is given (either under the skin or into a vein). if this changes you will start on the same dose as you have been receiving and your doctor will take blood samples to make sure that your anaemia is still being managed correctly. if your doctor has decided to change your treatment from r-huepo (erythropoietin produced by gene-technology) to aranesp, they will choose whether you should receive your aranesp injection once weekly or once every two weeks. the route of injection is the same as with r-huepo but your doctor will tell you how much you should take, and when, and may adjust your dose if necessary. if you are receiving chemotherapy aranesp is given as a single injection, either once a week or once every three weeks, under your skin. in order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose will be 500 micrograms once every three weeks (6.75 micrograms of aranesp per kilogram of your body weight), or 2.25 micrograms (once weekly) of aranesp per kilogram of your body weight. your doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may adjust your dose as necessary. your treatment will continue until approximately four weeks after the end of your chemotherapy. your doctor will tell you exactly when to stop taking aranesp. in some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. if you use more aranesp than you should you could have serious problems if you use more aranesp than you need, such as very high blood pressure. you should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if this does happen. if you feel unwell in any way you should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist immediately. if you forget to use aranesp do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you have forgotten a dose of aranesp, you should contact your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose. if you stop using aranesp if you want to stop using aranesp, you should discuss it with your doctor first.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "aranesp", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "this medicine", "Type":
