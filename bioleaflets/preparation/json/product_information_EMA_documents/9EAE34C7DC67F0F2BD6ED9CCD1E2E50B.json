NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \nZevalin 1.6 mg/ml kit for radiopharmaceutical preparations for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \nZevalin is supplied as a kit for the preparation of yttrium-90 radiolabelled ibritumomab tiuxetan.  \nThe kit contains one ibritumomab tiuxetan vial, one sodium acetate vial, one formulation buffer vial, \nand one empty reaction vial. The radionuclide is not part of the kit. \n \nOne ibritumomab tiuxetan vial contains 3.2 mg ibritumomab tiuxetan* in 2 ml solution (1.6 mg per \nml).  \n*murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster \novary (CHO) cell line and conjugated to the chelating agent MX-DTPA. \n \nThe final formulation after radiolabelling contains 2.08 mg ibritumomab tiuxetan [90Y] in a total \nvolume of 10 ml. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product can contain up to 28 mg sodium per dose, depending on the radioactivity \nconcentration. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \nKit for radiopharmaceutical preparations for infusion. \n \nIbritumomab tiuxetan vial: Clear colourless solution. \nSodium acetate vial: Clear colourless solution. \nFormulation buffer vial: Clear yellow to amber coloured solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nZevalin is indicated in adults. \n \n[90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin is indicated as consolidation therapy after remission induction in \npreviously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma. The benefit of Zevalin following rituximab in \ncombination with chemotherapy has not been established. \n \n[90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with rituximab relapsed or \nrefractory CD20+ follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\n[90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin must only be received, handled and administered by qualified personnel \nand must be prepared in accordance with both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality \nrequirements (for more details see also sections 4.4, 6.6 and 12). \n \nPosology \nZevalin must be used following pretreatment with rituximab. Please refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of rituximab for detailed guidance on its use. \nThe treatment regimen consists of two intravenous administrations of rituximab and one \nadministration of [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution in the following order:  \n \n Day 1: intravenous infusion of 250 mg/m2 rituximab.  \n \n\n Day 7 or 8 or 9:  \n \n - intravenous infusion of 250 mg/m2 rituximab shortly (within 4 hours) before \n\nadministration of [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution. \n \n - 10-minute intravenous infusion of [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution. \n \nRepeated use: Data on the re-treatment of patients with Zevalin are not available. \n \nThe recommended radioactivity dose of [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution is:  \n \nTreatment of rituximab relapsed or refractory CD20+ follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n(NHL): \n \n- patients with ≥ 150,000 platelets/mm3: 15 MBq/kg body weight. \n- patients with 100,000-150,000 platelets/mm3: 11 MBq/kg  \n \nThe maximum dose must not exceed 1200 MBq. \n \nRepeated use: Data on the re-treatment of patients with [90Y]-radiolabeled Zevalin are not available. \n \nConsolidation therapy after remission induction in previously untreated patients with follicular \nlymphoma \n \n-    patients with ≥ 150,000 platelets/mm³: 15 MBq/kg up to a maximum of \n1200 MBq \n-    for patients with less than 150,000 platelets per mm³ see section ‘4.4’ \n \nRepeated use: Data on the re-treatment of patients with [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin are not available. \n \nSpecial populations \n\nPaediatric population \nZevalin is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of data \non safety and efficacy. \n \n\nOlder people \nLimited data in elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years) are available. No overall differences in safety or \nefficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \nThe safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \nPatients with renal impairment \n\nThe safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution must be prepared according to section 12. \nBefore administration to the patient, the percent radioincorporation of the prepared \n[90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin must be checked according to the procedure outlined in section 12.  \nIf the average radiochemical purity is less than 95%, the preparation must not be administered.  \n \nThe prepared solution must be given as a slow intravenous infusion over 10 minutes.  \nThe infusion must not be administered as an intravenous bolus. \n \nZevalin may be infused directly by stopping the flow from an infusion bag and administering it \ndirectly into the line. A 0.2 or 0.22 micron low protein-binding filter must be on line between the \npatient and the infusion port. The line must be flushed with at least 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for injection after the infusion of Zevalin. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to ibritumomab tiuxetan, to yttrium chloride, or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n\n \n- Hypersensitivity to rituximab or to other murine-derived proteins. \n \n- Pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \nSince the Zevalin regimen includes rituximab, see also the Summary of Product Characteristics of \nrituximab. \n \n[90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution must only be received, handled and administered by qualified \npersonnel with the appropriate government authorization for the use and manipulation of \nradionuclides within a designated clinical setting. Its receipt, preparation, use, transfer, storage, and \ndisposal are subject to the regulations and/or appropriate authorisation/licences of the local competent \nofficial organisations.  \nRadiopharmaceuticals must be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety \nand pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions must be taken, complying \nwith the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice of pharmaceuticals.  \nInfusions must be administered under the close supervision of an experienced physician with full \nresuscitation facilities immediately available (for radiopharmaceutical precautions see also sections \n‘4.2 and 12’). \n \n[90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution must not be administered to patients who are likely to develop \nlife-threatening haematological toxicity signs. \n \nZevalin must not be administered in patients mentioned below, as safety and efficacy have not been \nestablished:  \n\n- > 25% of the bone marrow infiltrated by lymphoma cells  \n- prior external beam radiation affecting more than 25% of active bone marrow  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n- platelet counts <100,000/mm3 (monotherapy) and <150,000/mm3 (consolidation treatment) \n- neutrophil counts < 1,500/mm3 \n- prior bone marrow transplant or stem cell support \n\n \n Haematological toxicity \nSpecial caution is required with respect to bone marrow depletion. In most patients, administration of \nZevalin (after pretreatment with rituximab) results in severe and prolonged cytopenia which is \ngenerally reversible (see section 4.8). Therefore, complete blood cell and platelet counts must be \nmonitored following Zevalin treatment weekly until levels recover or as clinically indicated. The risk \nof haematological toxicity may be increased after prior therapy with fludarabine containing regimens \n(for details see section 4.5).   \n\n \n Treatment with growth factors \nPatients must not receive growth factor treatment such as G-CSF for 3 weeks prior to Zevalin  \nadministration as well as for 2 weeks following completion of the treatment in order to assess the \nadequate bone marrow reserve correctly and because of the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing \nmyeloid cells to radiation (see also section 4.5). \n \n Human anti-murine antibodies \nPatients who had received murine-derived proteins before Zevalin treatment must be tested for human \nanti-murine antibodies (HAMA). Patients who have developed HAMAs may have allergic or \nhypersensitivity reactions when treated with Zevalin or other murine-derived proteins.  \n \nAfter use of Zevalin, patients must generally be tested for HAMA before any further treatment with \nmurine-derived proteins. \n \n Infusion reactions \nInfusion reactions may occur during or following Zevalin administration after pretreatment with \nRituximab. Signs and symptoms of infusion reactions may include dizziness, cough, nausea, vomiting, \nrash, pruritus, tachycardia, asthenia, pyrexia and rigors (see section 4.8). In case of a potential severe \ninfusion reaction treatment must be stopped immediately.  \n \n Hypersensitivity \nHypersensitivity reactions following Zevalin administration are commonly observed. Severe \nhypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis occur in < 1 % of patients (see also section 4.8). In \ncase of hypersensitivity reactions, Zevalin infusion must be stopped immediately. Medicinal products \nfor the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. adrenaline, antihistamines and corticosteroids, \nmust be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of \nrituximab or Zevalin. \n \n Severe mucocutaneous reactions \nSevere mucocutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal outcome, \nhave been reported in association with Zevalin after pretreatment with rituximab. The onset of the \nreactions varied from days to months. In patients experiencing a severe mucocutaneous reaction \ntreatment must be discontinued. \n \n Contraception \nLong-term animal studies on the effect on fertility and reproductive function have not been \nperformed. There is a potential risk that ionizing radiation by [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin could cause \ntoxic effects on female and male gonads. Due to the nature of the compound, women of child-bearing \npotential, as well as males, must use effective contraceptive methods during and up to 12 months after \ntreatment with Zevalin (see also section 4.6 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n Immunization \nThe safety and efficacy of immunization with any vaccine, particularly live viral vaccines, following \ntherapy with Zevalin have not been studied.  Due to the potential risk of developing viral infections it \nis not recommended to administer live viral vaccines to patients who have recently received Zevalin \n(see section 4.5). A potentially limited ability to generate a primary or anamnestic humoral response \nto any vaccine following Zevalin treatment has to be taken into consideration.  \n \n NHL with CNS involvement \nNo data are available on patients with CNS-lymphoma as those patients were not included in clinical \nstudies. The use of Zevalin is therefore not recommended in NHL patients with CNS involvement.  \n \n Extravasation \nClose monitoring for evidence of extravasation during the injection of Zevalin is required in order to \navoid radiation-associated tissue damage. If any signs or symptoms of extravasation have occurred, \nthe infusion must be immediately terminated and restarted in another vein. \n \n Secondary malignancies \nThe use of Zevalin is associated with an increased risk of secondary malignancies, including acute \nmyeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), (see also section 4.8). \n \n Excipients \nThe final [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution contains up to 28 mg sodium per dose, depending on \nthe radioactivity concentration. Patients on a controlled sodium diet must take this into consideration.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere are no known interactions with other medicinal products. No interaction studies have been \nperformed. \n \nGrowth factor treatment such as G-CSF must not be given to patients for 3 weeks prior to Zevalin \nadministration as well as for 2 weeks following completion of the treatment (see also section 4.4).  \n \nIn a clinical trial in which Zevalin was administered as consolidation after prior first line \nchemotherapy, a higher frequency of severe and prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was \nobserved in patients who had received Zevalin within 4 months after a combination chemotherapy of \nfludarabine with mitoxantrone and/or cyclophosphamide compared to those patients who had received \nany other chemotherapy. Hence the risk of haematological toxicity may be increased when Zevalin is \nadministered shortly (< 4 months) after fludarabine-containing regimens (see also section 4.4). \n \nThe safety and efficacy of immunization with any vaccine, particularly live viral vaccines, following \ntherapy with Zevalin have not been studied (see also section ‘Special warnings and precautions for \nuse’). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \nAnimal reproduction studies were not conducted with ibritumomab tiuxetan. Since IgGs are known to \ncross the placenta, and because of the significant risk associated with radiation, Zevalin is \ncontraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).  \n \nPregnancy must be excluded before the start of treatment in women.  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nAny woman who has missed a period must be assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise and \nalternative therapies which do not involve ionising radiation must be then considered. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential as well as males must use effective contraceptive methods during \nand up to 12 months after treatment with Zevalin. \n  \nBreast-feeding \nAlthough it is not known whether ibritumomab tiuxetan is excreted in human milk, maternal IgGs are \nknown to be excreted in human milk. Therefore, women must discontinue breast-feeding, as the \npotential for absorption and immunosuppression in the infant is unknown. Zevalin must be used \nfollowing pretreatment with rituximab for which breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment \nand up to 12 months following treatment (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of \nrituximab for detailed guidance on its use). \n \nFertility \n\nNo animal studies have been performed to determine the effects of Zevalin on fertility in males or \nfemales. There is a potential risk that ionizing radiation by [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin could cause \ntoxic effects on female and male gonads (see sections ‘4.4 and 5.2). Patients should be advised that \nfertility may be affected and that male patients may wish to consider semen cryopreservation. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nZevalin could affect the ability to drive and to use machines, as dizziness has been reported as a \ncommon side effect. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \nhereditary defects. In all cases it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from \nthe disease itself. \nSince Zevalin is used after pretreatment with rituximab (for details see section 4.2), see also the \nprescribing information of rituximab. \n \nThe overall safety profile of Zevalin after pretreatment with rituximab is based on data from 349 \npatients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed B-cell non-Hodgkin’s \nlymphoma studied in five clinical trials, on data from a study with 204 patients receiving Zevalin as \nconsolidation therapy after first-line remission induction, and from post-marketing surveillance. \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions in patients receiving Zevalin after pretreatment \nwith rituximab are thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, infections, pyrexia, \nnausea, asthenia, rigors, petechiae, and fatigue.  \n \nThe most serious adverse drug reactions in patients receiving Zevalin after pretreatment with \nrituximab are: \n\n Severe and prolonged cytopenias (see also ‘Special warnings and precautions for use’) \n Infections \n Haemorrhage while thrombocytopenic \n Severe mucocutaneous reactions (see also ‘Special warnings and precautions for use’) \n Myelodysplastic syndrome / acute myeloid leukaemia \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nFatal outcomes have been reported for each of the following serious adverse drug reactions. These \nreports originated either from clinical trials or from postmarking experience.  \n\n Infection \n Sepsis \n Pneumonia \n Myelodysplastic syndrome / Acute myeloid leukaemia \n Anaemia \n Pancytopenia \n Haemorrhage while thrombocytopenic \n Intracranial haemorrhage while thrombocytopenic \n Mucocutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome \n\n \nThe frequencies of the adverse drug reactions which were considered to be at least possibly related to \nZevalin after pretreatment with rituximab are represented in the table below. These adverse drug \nreactions are based upon 349 patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed \nB-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma studied in 5 clinical trials. In addition, the adverse drug reactions \nmarked with ** were observed in the study with 204 patients receiving Zevalin as consolidation \ntherapy after first-line remission induction where indicated. The adverse drug reactions identified only \nduring post-marketing surveillance, and for which a frequency could not be estimated, are listed under \n“not known“.  \n \nAdverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and System Organ Class \n(MedDRA).  \n \nFrequency groupings are defined according to the following convention:  \n(very common ≥1/10, common ≥1/100 to <1/10, uncommon ≥ 1/1,000 to 1/100, rare:  1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000; very rare: <1/10,000).  \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \nTable 1: Adverse drug reactions reported in clinical trials or during post-marketing surveillance in \npatients treated with Zevalin after pretreatment with rituximab \n \nSystem Organ Class \n\n(MedDRA) \n\nVery common Common \n\n \n\nUncommon \n\n \n\nRare Not known  \n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations  \n\nInfection* Sepsis*,  \nPneumonia*,  \nUrinary tract \ninfection,  \nOral candidiasis   \n\n   \n\nNeoplasms benign, \n\nmalignant and \n\nunspecified (incl cysts \n\nand polyps) \n\n Tumour pain, \nMyelodysplastic \nsyndrome/Acute \nmyeloid \nleukaemia*, ** \n\n Meningioma  \n\nBlood and lymphatic \n\nsystem disorders  \n\nThrombocytopenia, \nLeukocytopenia,  \nNeutropenia,  \nAnaemia* \n\nFebrile neutropenia,  \nPancytopenia*, \nLymphocytopenia \n\n   \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders  \n\n Hypersensitivity \nreaction \n\n   \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition disorders \n\n Anorexia    \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSystem Organ Class \n\n(MedDRA) \n\nVery common Common \n\n \n\nUncommon \n\n \n\nRare Not known  \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Anxiety,  \nInsomnia \n\n   \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\n Dizziness,  \nHeadache \n\n   \n\nCardiac disorders   Tachycardia   \nVascular disorders Petechiae** Haemorrhage while \n\nthrombocytopenic* \nHypertension** \nHypotension** \n\n Intracranial \nhaemorrhage while \nthrombocyto- \npenic* \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic, \n\nand mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\n Cough,  \nRhinitis \n\n   \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders  \n\nNausea Vomiting, \nAbdominal pain, \nDiarrhoea,  \nDyspepsia,  \nThroat irritation,  \nConstipation \n\n   \n\nReproductive system \n\nand breast disorders \n\n Amenorrhea**    \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n Rash,  \nPruritus  \n \n\n  Mucocutaneous \nreaction \n(including Stevens \nJohnson \nSyndrome) * \n\nMusculoskeletal and \n\nconnective tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n Arthralgia,  \nMyalgia, \nBack pain,  \nNeck pain \n\n   \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nAsthenia,  \nPyrexia,  \nRigors \nFatigue** \n\nPain, \nFlu-like symptoms, \nMalaise,  \nPeripheral oedema, \nSweating increased \n\n  Extravasation with \nsubsequent \ninfusion site \nreactions, \nDamage to \nlymphoma-\nsurrounding tissue \nand complications \ndue to lymphoma \nswelling \n\n* fatal outcome has been observed  \n** has been observed in a study with 204 patients receiving Zevalin as consolidation after first-line remission induction \n \n \nThe most appropriate MedDRA term is used to describe a certain reaction and its synonyms and \nrelated conditions. \n \n Blood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nHaematological toxicity has been very commonly observed in clinical trials, and is dose-limiting \n(see also section ‘Special warnings and precautions for use’).  \nMedian time to blood platelet and granulocyte nadirs were around 60 days after start of treatment. \nIn clinical trials with the indication of relapsed and refractory NHL, grade 3 or 4 \nthrombocytopenia was reported with median times to recovery of 13 and 21 days and grade 3 or 4 \nneutropenia with median times to recovery of 8 and 14 days. Following Zevalin as consolidation \n\n\n\n10 \n\nafter first line remission induction the median times to recovery was 20 days and 35 days for \ngrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and 20 days and 28 days for grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. \n\n Infections and infestations  \n- Data from 349 patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular lymphoma, or \n\ntransformed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma studied in five trials: \nDuring the first 13 weeks after treatment with Zevalin, patients very commonly developed \ninfections. Grade 3 and grade 4 infections were reported commonly. During follow-up, \ninfections occurred commonly. Of these, grade 3 was common, grade 4 uncommon. \n \n\n- Data from 204 patients receiving Zevalin as consolidation therapy after first line remission \ninduction:  \nInfections were very commonly observed.  \n\n \nInfections may be bacterial, fungal, viral including reactivation of latent viruses.  \n \n\n General disorders and administration site conditions \nReports of extravasation with subsequent infusion site reactions including e.g. infusion site \ndermatitis, infusion site desquamation, and infusion site ulcer have been received. \nZevalin-associated radiation might cause damage to lymphoma-surrounding tissue and \ncomplications due to lymphoma swelling \n \n\n Immune system disorders \nData from 349 patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular lymphoma, or \ntransformed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma studied in five trials: \nHypersensitivity reactions following Zevalin administration are commonly observed. Severe \n(Grade 3/4) hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis occur in less than 1% of patients (see \nalso section ‘Special warnings and precautions for use’).  \n \n\n Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps)  \n- Secondary malignancies \n\n \nRefractory or relapsed NHL: \nMyelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/ acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has been reported in eleven out \nof 211 patients with relapsed or refractory NHL assigned to treatment with Zevalin in four studies. \n \nConsolidation therapy: \nFrom the final analysis at around 7.5 years of a study investigating the efficacy and safety of Zevalin \nconsolidation in patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma responding to first-line \nchemotherapy (Study 4, Section 5.1) of the 204 patients receiving Y-90 Zevalin following first line \nchemotherapy, 26 (12.7%) patients in the Zevalin arm developed a second primary malignancy \ncompared to 14 (6.8%) of patients in the control arm.  Seven patients (3.4%, 7/204) were diagnosed \nwith MDS/AML after receiving Zevalin, compared to one patient (0.5%, 1/205) in the control arm, \nwith a median follow-up of 7.3 years.  Deaths due to second primary malignancy included 8 (3.9%) \npatients in the Zevalin arm compared to 3 (1.5%) patients in the control arm.  Deaths due to \nMDS/AML included five (2.5%) patients in the Zevalin arm compared to no patients in the control \narm. \nThe risk of developing secondary myelodysplasia or leukaemia following therapy with alkylating \nagents is well known.   \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions afterauthorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses up to 19.2 MBq/kg of Zevalin have been administered in clinical trials. Expected \nhaematological toxicity was observed, including grade 3 or 4. Patients recovered from these toxicity \nsigns, and overdoses were not associated with serious or fatal outcome. \n \nThere is no known specific antidote for [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin overdosage. Treatment consists of \ndiscontinuation of Zevalin and supportive therapy, which may include growth factors. If available, \nautologous stem cell support must be administered to manage haematological toxicity. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Various therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code: V10XX02 \n \n\nMechanism of action \n \nIbritumomab tiuxetan is a recombinant murine IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody specific for the B-cell \nantigen CD20. Ibritumomab tiuxetan targets the antigen CD20 which is located on the surface of \nmalignant and normal B-lymphocytes. During B-cell maturation, CD20 is first expressed in the \nmidstage of B-lymphoblast (pre-B-cell), and is lost during the final stage of B-cell maturation to \nplasma cells. It is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalise on antibody binding.  \n \n[90Y]-radiolabelled ibritumomab tiuxetan binds specifically to CD20-expressing B-cells, including \nmalignant cells. The isotope yttrium-90 is a pure β-emitter and has a mean path length of about 5 mm. \nThis results in the ability to kill both targeted and neighbouring cells. \n \nThe conjugated antibody has an apparent affinity constant for the CD20 antigen of approximately \n17 nM. The binding pattern is very restricted, with no cross-reactivity to other leukocytes or to other \ntypes of human tissue. \nRituximab pretreatment is necessary to clear circulating B-cells, enabling ibritumomab tiuxetan [90Y] \nto deliver radiation more specifically to the lymphoma B-cells. Rituximab is administered in a \nreduced dose when compared with the approved monotherapy.  \n\n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \nTreatment with [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin also leads to depletion of normal CD20+ B-cells. \nPharmacodynamic analysis demonstrated that this was a temporary effect; recovery of normal B-cells \nbegan within 6 months and median counts of B-cells were within normal range within 9 months after \ntreatment. \n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen were evaluated in two multi-center trials \nenrolling a total of 197 subjects. The Zevalin therapeutic regimen was administered in two steps (see \n4.2). The efficacy and safety of a variation of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen employing a reduced  \ndose of ibritumomab tiuxetan [90Y] was further defined in a third study enrolling a total of 30 patients \nwho had mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100,000 to 149,000 cells/mm3). \n \nStudy 1 was a single-arm study of 54 patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma refractory to \nrituximab treatment. Patients were considered refractory if their last prior treatment with rituximab \ndid not result in a complete or partial response, or if time to disease progression (TTP) was \n\n\n\n12 \n\n 6 months. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the overall response rate (ORR) using the \nInternational Workshop Response Criteria (IWRC). Secondary efficacy endpoints included time to \ndisease progression (TTP) and duration of response (DR). In a secondary analysis comparing \nobjective response to the Zevalin therapeutic regimen with that observed with the most recent \ntreatment with rituximab, the median duration of response following the Zevalin therapeutic regimen \nwas 6 vs. 4 months. Table 1 summarizes efficacy data from this study. \n \nStudy 2 was a randomized, controlled, multicenter study comparing the Zevalin therapeutic regimen \nversus treatment with rituximab. The trial was conducted in 143 rituximab-naïve patients with \nrelapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), or transformed B-cell \nNHL. A total of 73 patients received the Zevalin therapeutic regimen, and 70 patients received \nrituximab given as an intravenous infusion at 375 mg/m2 weekly times 4 doses. The primary efficacy \nendpoint of the study was to determine the ORR using the IWRC (see Table 2). The ORR was \nsignificantly higher (80% vs. 56%, p = 0.002) for patients treated with the Zevalin therapeutic \nregimen. The secondary endpoints, duration of response and time to progression, were not \nsignificantly different between the two treatment arms. \n \n\nTable 2.Summary of Efficacy Data in patients with relapsed/refractory low-grade or \n\nfollicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), or transformed B-cell NHL \n\n Study 1 Study 2 \n\n \n\nZevalin  \n\ntherapeutic \n\nregimen \n\nN = 54 \n\nZevalin \n\ntherapeutic \n\nregimen \n\nN = 73 \n\nRituximab \n\n \n\nN = 70 \n\nOverall Response Rate (%) \n \n\n74 80 56 \n\nComplete Response Rate (%) \n \n\n15 30 16 \n\nCRu Rate2 (%) \n \n\n0 4 4 \n\nMedian DR3,4 \n(Months) \n[Range5] \n \n\n \n6.4 \n\n[0.5-24.9+] \n\n \n13.9 \n\n[1.0-30.1+] \n\n \n11.8 \n\n[1.2-24.5] \n\nMedian TTP3,6 \n(Months) \n[Range5] \n \n\n \n6.8 \n\n[1.1-25.9+] \n\n \n11.2 \n\n[0.8-31.5+] \n\n \n10.1 \n\n[0.7-26.1] \n1IWRC:  International Workshop response criteria \n2CRu:  Unconfirmed complete response \n3Estimated with observed range. \n4Duration of response:  interval from the onset of response to disease progression. \n5“+” indicates an ongoing response. \n6Time to Disease Progression:  interval from the first infusion to disease progression. \n \n\nStudy 3 was a single arm study of 30 patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or \ntransformed B-cell NHL who had mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100,000 to 149,000 \ncells/mm3). Excluded from the study were patients with 25% lymphoma marrow involvement and/or \nimpaired bone marrow reserve. Patients were considered to have impaired bone marrow reserve if \nthey had any of the following: prior myeloablative therapy with stem cell support; prior external beam \nradiation to >25% of active marrow; a platelet count <100,000 cells/mm3; or neutrophil count <1,500 \ncells/mm3. In this study, a modification of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen with a lower [90Y]-Zevalin \nactivity per body weight (11 MBq/kg) was used. Objective, durable clinical responses were observed \n\n\n\n13 \n\n[67% ORR (95% CI: 48-85%), 11.8 months median DR (range: 4-17 months)] and resulted in a \ngreater incidence of haematologic toxicity (see 4.8) than in Studies 1 and 2. \n \nStudy 4 investigated the efficacy and safety of Zevalin consolidation in patients with advanced-stage \nfollicular lymphoma responding to first-line chemotherapy. Major inclusion criteria were: \nCD20+ grade 1 or 2 follicular lymphoma; stage III or IV at diagnosis; normal peripheral \nblood cell counts; < 25% bone marrow involvement; age ≥ 18 yrs; and complete response \n(CR/Cru) or partial response (PR) after first-line chemotherapy determined by physical \nexamination, CT scans and bone marrow biopsy. After completing induction therapy, patients \nwere randomized to receive either Zevalin (250 mg/m2 rituximab on day -7 and on day 0 \nfollowed on day 0 by Zevalin 15 MBq/kg body weight; maximal dose 1200 MBq; [n=208]) or no \nfurther treatment (control; n=206). Induction therapies included CVP n=106, CHOP (-like) n=188, \nfludarabine combinations n=22, chlorambucil n=39 and rituximab-chemotherapy combinations \nn=59. Median progression free survival (PFS) was calculated at a median follow-up of 2.9 years. PFS \nincreased from 13.5 months (control) to 37 months (Zevalin; p<0.0001; HR 0.465). For patient \nsubgroups in PR or CR after induction, median PFS was 6.3 vs 29.7 months (p<0.0001; HR \n0.304) and 29.9 vs 54.6 months (p=0.015; HR 0.613), respectively. After Zevalin consolidation, \n77% of patients in PR after induction therapy converted to CR. Patients whose response status \nchanged after Zevalin from PR to CR showed a significantly longer median progression free survival \ntime (986 days) compared to those patients who remained in PR (median progression free survival \ntime of 460 days, p=0.0004). In total, 87% of patients were in CR(u); 76% in CR and 11% in CRu. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \nIn patients given intravenous infusions of 250 mg/m2 rituximab followed by intravenous injections of \n15 MBq/kg of [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin, the median serum effective half-life of ibritumomab \ntiuxetan [90Y] was 28 h. \n \n\nAs 90Y forms a stable complex with ibritumomab tiuxetan, the biodistribution of the radiolabel \nfollows the biodistribution of the antibody. Irradiation by the emitted beta particles from 90Y occurs in \na radius of 5 mm around the isotope. \n \nIn clinical studies, the [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin after pretreatment with rituximab results in a \nsignificant radiation dose to the testes. The radiation dose to the ovaries has not been established. \nThere is a potential risk that [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin after pretreatment with rituximab could cause \ntoxic effects on the male and female gonads (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single and repeated dose \ntoxicity. \nThe human radiation dose estimates derived from biodistribution studies in mice with [90Y]- or \n[111In]-radiolabelled ibritumomab tiuxetan predicted acceptable radiation to normal human tissue with \nlimited levels of skeleton and bone marrow radiation. The linker chelate tiuxetan forms a stable \ncomplex with the radioisotopes yttrium-90 and indium-111 and only negligible degradation due to \nradiolysis is expected. \n \nThe single and repeated dose toxicity studies of the non-radioactive compound in cynomolgus \nmonkeys did not indicate any other risk than the expected B-cell depletion arising from the use of \nibritumomab tiuxetan alone or in combination with rituximab. Studies on reproductive and \ndevelopmental toxicity have not been performed.  \n \nStudies on the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of Zevalin have not been performed. Due to the \nexposure to ionising radiation derived from the radiolabel, a risk of mutagenic and carcinogenic \neffects has to be taken into account. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n \n6.

The product of radioactive decay is stable zirconium-90. The path length of \nbeta emission (90) by yttrium-90 in tissue is 5 mm.  \n \nAnalyses of estimated radiation absorbed dose were carried out using quantitative imaging with the \ngamma-emitter [111In]-radiolabelled Zevalin, blood sampling, and the MIRDOSE3 software program. \nThe imaging dose of [111In]-radiolabelled Zevalin was always given immediately following an \ninfusion with rituximab at 250 mg/m² to deplete peripheral CD20+ cells and to optimise bio-\ndistribution. Following administration of [111In]-radiolabelled Zevalin, whole body scans were \nperformed at up to eight time-points, acquiring both anterior and posterior images. Blood samples, \nused to calculate residence times for red marrow, were drawn up to eight time-points. \n \nBased upon dosimetry studies with [111In]-radiolabelled Zevalin, the estimated radiation dosimetry for \nindividual organs following administration of [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin at activities of 15 MBq/kg \nand 11 MBq/kg was calculated according to Medical Internal Radiation Dosimetry (MIRD) (Table 3). \nThe estimated radiation-absorbed doses to normal organs were substantially below recognised upper \nsafety limits. Individual patient dosimetry results were not predictive for [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin \ntoxicity.  \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3. \n\nEstimated Radiation Absorbed Doses From [90Y]-Zevalin \n\nOrgan \n\n[90Y]-Zevalin mGy/MBq \n\nMedian Range \n\nSpleen1 9.4 1.8 - 20.0 \nLiver1 4.8 2.9 - 8.1 \nLower Large Intestinal Wall1 4.7 3.1 – 8.2 \nUpper Large Intestinal Wall1 3.6 2.0 – 6.7 \nHeart Wall1 2.9 1.5 - 3.2 \nLungs1 2.0 1.2 - 3.4 \nTestes1 1.5 1.0 – 4.3 \nSmall Intestine1 1.4 0.8 – 2.1 \nRed Marrow2 1.3 0.6 - 1.8 \nUrinary Bladder Wall3 0.9 0.7 - 1.3 \nBone Surfaces2 0.9 0.5 - 1.2 \nOvaries3 0.4 0.3 - 0.5 \nUterus3 0.4 0.3 - 0.5 \nAdrenals3 0.3 0.2 - 0.5 \nBrain3 0.3 0.2 - 0.5 \nBreasts3 0.3 0.2 - 0.5 \nGallbladder Wall3 0.3 0.2 - 0.5 \nMuscle3 0.3 0.2 - 0.5 \nPancreas3 0.3 0.2 - 0.5 \nSkin3 0.3 0.2 - 0.5 \nStomach3 0.3 0.2 - 0.5 \nThymus3 0.3 0.2 - 0.5 \nThyroid3 0.3 0.2 - 0.5 \nKidneys1 0.1 0.0 - 0.3 \nTotal Body3 0.5 0.4- 0.7 \n\n \n\n1 Organ region of interest \n2 Sacrum region of interest \n3 Whole body region of interest \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\n12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS \n \nRead complete directions thoroughly before starting the preparation procedure. \n \nProper aseptic technique and precautions for handling radioactive materials must be employed.  \n \nWaterproof gloves must be utilised in the preparation and during the determination of radiochemical \npurity of [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin. \n \nRadiation protection precaution in accordance with local regulations must be taken, since \nadministration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or \ncontamination from spills of urine, vomiting, etc.. \n \nCharacteristics of yttrium-90 \n \n The following minimum yttrium-90 characteristics are recommended: \n \nRadioactivity concentration at time of use 1.67 to 3.34 GBq/ml  \n  \nTotal extractable activity to deliver at time of use  1.48 GBq corresponding to 0.44 ml to \n\n0.89 ml of yttrium-90 solution \n  \nHCl concentration 0.035-0.045 M \n  \nChloride identification Positive \n  \nYttrium identification Positive \n  \nRadiochemical purity of the yttrium-90 chloride \nsolution \n\n 95% of free ionic yttrium-90 \n\n  \nBacterial endotoxins 150 EU/ml \n  \nSterility No growth \n  \nRadionuclidic purity strontium-90 content  0.74 MBq strontium-90 /  \n\n37 GBq yttrium-90 \n  \nMetal impurities  \n Total metals*  50 ppm \n  \n Individual metals*  10 ppm each \n  \n* Metals to be included need to be based on the specific manufacturing process. Control of these \nmetals can be achieved either through process validation or release test. \n \n\n Additional testing that might be required for suitability assessment: \n \nProcess-specific impurities:  \nTotal organic carbon (e.g. organic chelators) Below limit of quantitation* \nProcess residuals (e.g. ammonia, nitrate) Below limit of quantitation* \nTotal Alpha impurities Below limit of quantitation* \nTotal other Beta impurities (non-strontium-90) Below limit of quantitation* \n\n\n\n19 \n\nTotal Gamma impurities Below limit of quantitation* \n \n\n* Needs to be included as release test or controlled through process validation if above limit of \nquantitation \n \n\nDirections for radio-labelling of Zevalin with yttrium-90: \n \nSterile, pyrogen-free yttrium-90 chloride of the above specified quality must be used for the \npreparation of [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin.  \n \nBefore radiolabelling, bring refrigerated Zevalin cold kit to room temperature 25°C. \n \nClean the rubber stopper of all cold kit vials and the yttrium-90 chloride vial with a suitable alcohol \nswab and allow to air dry. \n \nPlace cold kit reaction vial in a suitable dispensing shield (plastic enclosed in lead). \n \nStep 1: Transfer sodium acetate solution to the reaction vial \n \nUsing a 1-ml sterile syringe, transfer sodium acetate solution to reaction vial. The volume of sodium \nacetate solution added is equivalent to 1.2 times the volume of yttrium-90 chloride to be transferred in \nstep 2. \n \nStep 2: Transfer yttrium-90 chloride to the reaction vial \n \nAseptically transfer 1500 MBq of yttrium-90 chloride with a 1 ml sterile syringe to the reaction vial \ncontaining the sodium acetate solution transferred in step 1. Mix completely by coating the entire \ninner surface of the reaction vial. Mix by inversion, rolling the container, avoid foaming or agitating \nthe solution. \n \nStep 3: Transfer ibritumomab tiuxetan solution to the reaction vial \n \nUsing a 2-3 ml sterile syringe, transfer 1.3 ml ibritumomab tiuxetan solution to the reaction vial. Mix \ncompletely by coating the entire inner surface of the reaction vial. Mix by inversion, rolling the \ncontainer, avoid foaming or agitating the solution.  \n \nIncubate the yttrium-90 chloride/acetate/ibritumomab tiuxetan solution at room temperature for five \nminutes. Labelling time longer than six minutes or shorter than four minutes will result in inadequate \nradioincorporation. \n \nStep 4: Add the formulation buffer to the reaction vial \n \nUsing a 10-ml syringe with a large bore needle (18-20 G), draw formulation buffer that will result in a \ncombined total volume of 10 ml. \n \nAfter the 5-minute incubation period, withdraw from the reaction vial the same volume of air as the \nformulation buffer to be added in order to normalise pressure and immediately thereafter gently add \nthe formulation buffer down the side of the reaction vial to terminate incubation. Do not foam, shake, \nor agitate the mixture. \n \nStep 5: Assay the [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution for its specific radioactivity  \n \nRadiochemical purity of the radiolabelled preparation applies as long as more than 95% of yttrium-90 \nis incorporated into the monoclonal antibody. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nBefore administration to the patient, the percent radioincorporation of the prepared \n[90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin must be checked according to the procedure outlined below. \n \nCaution: Patient dose not to exceed 1200 MBq. \n \nInstructions for determining the percent radioincorporation \n \nThe radioincorporation assay for radiochemical purity, is performed by Instant Thin Layer \nChromatography (ITLC) and must be carried out according to the following procedure. \n \nRequired materials not supplied in the Zevalin kit: \n \n- Developing chamber for chromatography \n- Mobile phase: sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution, bacteriostatic-free \n- ITLC strips (e.g. ITLC TEC-Control Chromatography Strips, Biodex, Shirley, New York, USA, Art. \n\nNr. 150-772 or equivalent, dimensions: approximately 0.5-1 cm x 6 cm) \n- Scintillation vials  \n- Liquid scintillation cocktail (e.g. Ultima Gold, catalog No. 6013329, Packard Instruments, USA or \n\nequivalent) \n \nAssay procedure: \n \n1.) Add approximately 0.8 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution to developing chamber \nassuring the liquid will not touch the 1.4 cm origin mark on the ITCL strip.  \n \n2.) Using a 1 ml insulin syringe with a 25- to 26-G needle, place a hanging drop (7-10 µl) of [90Y]-\nradiolabelled Zevalin onto the ITLC strip at its origin. Spot one strip at a time and run three ITLC \nstrips. It may be necessary to perform a dilution (1:100) before application of the [90Y]-radiolabelled \nZevalin to the ITLC strips. \n \n3.) Place ITLC strip in the developing chamber and allow the solvent front to migrate past the 5.4 cm \nmark. \n \n4.) Remove ITLC strip and cut in half at the 3.5 cm cut line. Place each half into separate scintillation \nvials to which 5 ml LSC cocktail must be added (e.g. Ultima Gold, catalog No. 6013329, Packard \nInstruments, USA or equivalent). Count each vial in a beta counter or in an appropriate counter for \none minute (CPM), record net counts, corrected for background. \n \n5.) Calculate the average Radiochemical Purity (RCP) as follows: \n \n6.) Average % RCP =   net CPM bottom half x 100  \n    net CPM top half + net CPM bottom half  \n \n7.) If the average radiochemical purity is less than 95%, the preparation must not be administered.  \n \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \nDetailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines \nAgency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\n \n \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n21 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nANNEX II \n\n \nA.

What you need to know before you are given Zevalin \n3. How to use Zevalin \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Zevalin \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \n\n \n\n1. WHAT ZEVALIN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\n \n\nThis medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for therapy only. \n \nZevalin is a kit for the preparation of the active substance ibritumomab tiuxetan [90Y], a monoclonal \nantibody labelled with the radioactive substance yttrium-90 (90Y). Zevalin attaches to a protein \n(CD20) on the surface of certain white blood cells (B-cells) and kills them by irradiation. \n \nZevalin is used to treat patients suffering from specific subgroups of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n(CD20+ indolent or transformed B-cell NHL) if an earlier rituximab, another monoclonal antibody, \ntreatment has not worked, or has stopped working (refractory or relapsed disease).   \n \nZevalin is also used  in previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma. It is used as a \nconsolidation therapy to improve the reduction in the number of lymphoma cells (remission) \nachieved with the initial chemotherapy regimen.  \n \nThe use of Zevalin does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the \nnuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the \nprocedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. \n \n\n \n\n2. WHAT  YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU ARE GIVEN ZEVALIN  \n \n\nYou must not be given Zevalin: \n\n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the following: \n ibritumomab tiuxetan, yttrium chloride or to any of the other ingredients of Zevalin (listed in \n\nsection 6 ‘What Zevalin contains’) \n rituximab or other murine-derived proteins \n\n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding (see also section “pregnancy and breast feeding”). \n \nTake special care with Zevalin \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\nIn the following cases, Zevalin use is not recommended since its safety and efficacy have not been \nestablished: \n\n more than a quarter of your bone marrow contains malignant abnormal cells. \n If you have had external beam radiation (a type of radiotherapy) to more than a quarter \n\nof your bone marrow. \n If you receive Zevalin alone and the number of your blood platelets is fewer than \n\n100,000/mm3  \n If the number of your blood platelets is fewer than 150,000/mm3 after chemotherapy \n If the number of your white blood cells is fewer than 1,500/mm3 \n\n If you have had a bone marrow transplant or have received blood stem cells in the \npast. \n\n \nIf you have been treated with other proteins (especially mouse-derived) before Zevalin treatment, \nyou may be more likely to have an allergic reaction. You may, therefore, need to be tested for special \nantibodies.  \n \nIn addition, Zevalin is not recommended for the use in patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \ninvolving the brain and/or spinal cord as those patients were not included in clinical studies. \n \nChildren \n\nZevalin is not recommended for use in children below age 18 since safety and efficacy have not been \nestablished. \n \nElderly patients \n\nLimited data in elderly patients (aged 65 years or over) are available. No overall differences in safety \nor efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients. \n \nOther medicines and Zevalin \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.  \nIn particular, your doctor will need to interrupt treatment with growth factors such as filgrastim for a \nperiod of three weeks before giving you Zevalin to two weeks after Zevalin treatment. \nIf you are given Zevalin less than 4 months after chemotherapy containing the active substance \nfludarabine, you may have a higher risk of having a reduced number of blood cells.  \nPlease tell your doctor that you were given Zevalin if you are due for vaccination after using it.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nZevalin must not be used during pregnancy. Your doctor will perform tests to exclude pregnancy \nbefore you start the treatment. Women of child-bearing potential and male patients must use reliable \ncontraception during treatment with Zevalin and for up to one year after stopping treatment. \nThere is a potential risk that ionizing radiation by Zevalin could harm your ovaries and testicles. \nPlease ask your doctor how this may affect you, especially if you are planning on having children in \nthe future. \n \nWomen must not breast-feed during treatment and for 12 months following the treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \n\nZevalin can affect your ability to drive and use machines, as dizziness is a common side effect. Please \nbe cautious until you are sure you are not affected. \n \n\nZevalin contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains up to 28 mg sodium per dose, depending on the radioactivity concentration. \nTo be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.  \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n3. HOW TO USE ZEVALIN \n\n \nThere are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. Zevalin will \nonly be used in special controlled areas. This product will only be handled and given to you by people \nwho are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for the safe use of \nthis product and will keep you informed of their actions. \n \nThe dose of Zevalin depends on your body weight, blood platelet counts and what Zevalin is being \nused for (indication). The maximum dose must not exceed 1200 MBq (‘megabecquerel’, a unit to \nmeasure radioactivity). \n \nZevalin is used with another medicine containing the active substance rituximab.  \n \nYou will be given a total of 3 infusions in the course of two visits to a medical facility, 7 to 9 days \napart. \n \n- On day 1 you will be given one rituximab infusion \n- On day 7, 8, or 9 you will be given one rituximab infusion, followed by one Zevalin infusion \n\nshortly afterwards (within 4 hours). \n \n The recommended dose is: \n\n \nFor consolidation therapy in patients with follicular lymphoma \n The usual dose is 15 MBq/kg body weight.  \n\n \nFor therapy of patients with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma not responding to \nrituximab \n The usual dose is 11 or 15 MBq per kg body weight, depending on your blood platelet count.  \n \nPreparation of Zevalin \n\nZevalin is not used directly, but must be prepared by your healthcare professional first. The kit allows \nthe coupling of antibody ibritumomab tiuxetan with the radioactive isotope yttrium 90Y \n(radiolabelling).  \n \n\nHow Zevalin is given \n\nZevalin is given by intravenous infusion (drip into a vein) usually lasting about 10 minutes.  \n \nAfter you are given Zevalin \n\nThe amount of radiation that your body will be exposed to due to Zevalin is smaller than with \nradiotherapy. Most radioactivity will decay within the body, but a small part will be eliminated \nthrough your urine. Therefore, for one week after the Zevalin infusion you must wash your hands \nthoroughly each time after urinating. \n \nAfter treatment your doctor will perform regular blood tests to check your platelet and white cell \ncounts. These usually decrease around two months after start of treatment.  \n \nIf your doctor plans to treat you with some other antibody after treatment with Zevalin, you will need \nto be tested for special antibodies. Your doctor will tell you if this applies to you. \n \nIf you have received more Zevalin than you should \n\nYour doctor will treat you, as appropriate, if you have any particular ill effects. This may include \ndiscontinuation of Zevalin therapy and treatment with growth factors or your own stem cells. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n\n \nLike all medicines, Zevalin can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you notice symptoms of any of the following: \n infection: fever, chills  \n blood poisoning (sepsis): fever and chills, changes in mental status, rapid breathing, \n\nincreased heart rate, decreased urine output, low blood pressure, shock, problems with \nbleeding or clotting \n\n infections of the lung (pneumonia): breathing difficulties \n Low counts of blood cells: unusual bruising, more bleeding then usual after injury, fever, or \n\nif you feel unusually tired or breathless \n severe mucous membrane reactions, which may occur days or months after Zevalin and/or \n\nrituximab administration.
