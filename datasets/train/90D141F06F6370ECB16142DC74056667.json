This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nXarelto 2.5 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 2.5 mg rivaroxaban.  \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach film-coated tablet contains 33.92 mg lactose (as monohydrate), see section 4.4. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet)  \n \nLight yellow, round biconvex tablets (6 mm diameter, 9 mm radius of curvature) marked with the \nBAYER-cross on one side and \"2.5\" and a triangle on the other side.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nXarelto, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or \nticlopidine, is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients after an acute \ncoronary syndrome (ACS) with elevated cardiac biomarkers (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nXarelto, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of \natherothrombotic events in adult patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or symptomatic \nperipheral artery disease (PAD) at high risk of ischaemic events. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily.  \n \n\uf0b7 ACS \nPatients taking Xarelto 2.5 mg twice daily should also take a daily dose of 75 - 100 mg ASA or a daily \ndose of 75 - 100 mg ASA in addition to either a daily dose of 75 mg clopidogrel or a standard daily \ndose of ticlopidine. \n \nTreatment should be regularly evaluated in the individual patient weighing the risk for ischaemic \nevents against the bleeding risks. Extension of treatment beyond 12 months should be done on an \nindividual patient basis as experience up to 24 months is limited (see section 5.1). \n \nTreatment with Xarelto should be started as soon as possible after stabilisation of the ACS event \n(including revascularisation procedures); at the earliest 24 hours after admission to hospital and at the \ntime when parenteral anticoagulation therapy would normally be discontinued. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\uf0b7 CAD/PAD \nPatients taking Xarelto 2.5 mg twice daily should also take a daily dose of 75 - 100 mg ASA. \n \nDuration of treatment should be determined for each individual patient based on regular evaluations \nand should consider the risk for thrombotic events versus the bleeding risks. \n \nIn patients with an acute thrombotic event or vascular procedure and a need for dual antiplatelet \ntherapy, the continuation of Xarelto 2.5 mg twice daily should be evaluated depending on the type of \nevent or procedure and antiplatelet regimen. Safety and efficacy of Xarelto 2.5 mg twice daily in \ncombination with ASA plus clopidogrel/ticlopidine has only been studied in patients with recent ACS \n(see section 4.1). Dual antiplatelet therapy has not been studied in combination with Xarelto 2.5 mg \ntwice daily in patients with CAD/PAD (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  \n \nIf a dose is missed the patient should continue with the regular dose as recommended at the next \nscheduled time. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose. \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Xarelto \nWhen converting patients from VKAs to Xarelto, International Normalised Ratio (INR) values could \nbe falsely elevated after the intake of Xarelto. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant \nactivity of Xarelto, and therefore should not be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Xarelto to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that Xarelto can contribute to an elevated INR.  \nIn patients converting from Xarelto to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is \u2265 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Xarelto and VKA the \nINR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \nXarelto. Once Xarelto is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least 24 hours after the last \ndose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to Xarelto \nFor patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant \nand start Xarelto 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the parenteral \nmedicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of discontinuation \nof a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous unfractionated heparin). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to parenteral anticoagulants \nGive the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next Xarelto dose would be taken.  \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Xarelto is to be \nused with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance \n< 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n50 - 80 ml/min) or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nElderly population  \nNo dose adjustment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \nThe risk of bleeding increases with increasing age (see section 4.4). \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Xarelto 2.5 mg tablets in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available. Therefore, Xarelto 2.5 mg tablets are not recommended for use in \nchildren below 18 years of age.  \n \nMethod of administration  \nXarelto is for oral use. \nThe tablets can be taken with or without food (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nCrushing of tablets \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Xarelto tablet may be crushed and mixed with \nwater or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally.  \nThe crushed tablet may also be given through gastric tubes (see sections 5.2 and 6.6). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant treatment of ACS with antiplatelet therapy in patients with a prior stroke or a transient \nischaemic attack (TIA) (see section 4.4).  \n \nConcomitant treatment of CAD/PAD with ASA in patients with previous haemorrhagic or lacunar \nstroke, or any stroke within a month (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn ACS patients, efficacy and safety of Xarelto 2.5 mg have been investigated in combination with the \nantiplatelet agents ASA alone or ASA plus clopidogrel/ticlopidine. Treatment in combination with \nother antiplatelet agents, e.g. prasugrel or ticagrelor, has not been studied and is not recommended. \nIn patients at high risk of ischaemic events with CAD/PAD, efficacy and safety of Xarelto 2.5 mg \nhave only been investigated in combination with ASA.  \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \nHaemorrhagic risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Xarelto are to be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. \nIt is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. Xarelto \nadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see section 4.9). \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment on top of single or dual anti-platelet therapy. Thus, in addition \nto adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to \ndetect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be \nappropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, the use \nof Xarelto in combination with dual antiplatelet therapy in patients at known increased risk for \nbleeding should be balanced against the benefit in terms of prevention of atherothrombotic events. In \naddition these patients are to be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications \nand anaemia after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels \nmay be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nXarelto is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min. Use is not \nrecommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) concomitantly \nreceiving other medicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations Xarelto is to be \nused with caution (see section 4.5). \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \nThe use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with \nazole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) or HIV \nprotease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and \nP-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant degree \n(2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see section 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and \nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPatients on treatment with Xarelto and ASA or with Xarelto and ASA plus clopidogrel/ticlopidine \nshould only receive concomitant treatment with NSAIDs if the benefit outweighs the bleeding risk. \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n\uf0b7 congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n\uf0b7 uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n\uf0b7 other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n\uf0b7 vascular retinopathy \n\uf0b7 bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \nIt should be used with caution in ACS and CAD/PAD patients: \n\uf0b7 \u2265 75 years of age if co-administered with ASA alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine. \n\nThe benefit-risk of the treatment should be individually assessed on a regular basis. \n\uf0b7 with lower body weight (< 60 kg) if co-administered with ASA alone or with ASA plus \n\nclopidogrel or ticlopidine. \n\uf0b7 CAD patients with severe symptomatic heart failure. Study data indicate that such patients may \n\nbenefit less from treatment with rivaroxaban (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients with prosthetic valves \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been studied \nin patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that Xarelto provides \nadequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Xarelto is not recommended for \nthese patients. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates \nof recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nPatients with prior stroke and/or TIA \nPatients with ACS \nXarelto 2.5 mg is contraindicated for the treatment of ACS in patients with a prior stroke or TIA (see \nsection 4.3). Few ACS patients with a prior stroke or TIA have been studied but the limited efficacy \ndata available indicate that these patients do not benefit from treatment. \n \nPatients with CAD/PAD \nCAD/PAD patients with previous haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke, or an ischaemic, non-lacunar stroke \nwith in the previous month were not studied (see section 4.3).  \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical \n\n\n\n7 \n\nexperience with the use of Xarelto 2.5 mg with ASA alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine \nin these situations. \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low (see section 5.2). However, the exact \ntiming to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.  \nPlatelet aggregation inhibitors should be discontinued as suggested by the manufacturer\u2019s prescribing \ninformation.  \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention  \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Xarelto 2.5 mg should be stopped at least \n12 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the physician. If a \npatient is to undergo elective surgery and anti-platelet effect is not desired, platelet aggregation \ninhibitors should be discontinued as directed by the manufacturer\u2019s prescribing information.  \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \nXarelto should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention \nprovided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as determined by \nthe treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).  \n \nDermatological reactions \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \nXarelto contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say \nessentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban CRmaxR, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4).  \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in \nCRmaxR. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and CRmaxR. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRRmaxR when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRRmaxR when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean CRmaxR. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-\nrisk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \nAnticoagulants \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response.  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-\nmajor clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-\nfactor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the \nfourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity \nand ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the CRtroughR of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \n\n\n\n9 \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers  \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John\u2019s Wort 16T(Hypericum perforatum)) 16T may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \nNo clinically relevant interaction with food was observed (see section 4.2). \n \nLaboratory parameters \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the intrinsic \nrisk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Xarelto is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3).  \nWomen of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from animals \nindicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Xarelto is contraindicated during breast-\nfeeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from therapy.  \n \nFertility \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXarelto has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like syncope \n(frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see section 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies in adults including \n53,103 patients exposed to rivaroxaban, and in two phase II and one phase III paediatric studies \nincluding 412 patients.

As incidence of \nadverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS \nstudy data were not included for frequency calculation in this table. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Xarelto may be associated with an increased \nrisk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post haemorrhagic \nanaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary according to the \nlocation and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 \u201cManagement of \nbleeding\u201d). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito \nurinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more \nfrequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to \nadequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to \ndetect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be \nappropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with \nuncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see \nsection 4.4 \u201cHaemorrhagic risk\u201d). Menstrual bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. \nHaemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained \nswelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of \ncardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris have been observed.  \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for Xarelto. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to \nbe considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in 45TAppendix V45T. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nRare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or other \nadverse reactions. Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma \nexposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above.  \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa). \nThe use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised \naccording to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could \nbe used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis \nwith bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products \n(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or \nplatelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific \nfactor Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), \nshould be considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on \nlimited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated \ndepending on improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a \ncoagulation expert should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor \n\n\n\n15 \n\nexperience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving \nrivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  \n \nMechanism of action \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant.  \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \nThe activated partial thomboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated, rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-\nfactor-Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nACS \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban for the \nprevention of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke in subjects with a \nrecent ACS (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], non- ST-elevation myocardial infarction \n[NSTEMI] or unstable angina [UA]). In the pivotal double-blind ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 study, \n15,526 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of three treatment groups: \nrivaroxaban 2.5 mg orally twice daily, 5 mg orally twice daily or to placebo twice daily co-\nadministered with ASA alone or with ASA plus a thienopyridine (clopidogrel or ticlopidine). Patients \nwith an ACS under the age of 55 had to have either diabetes mellitus or a previous MI. The median \ntime on treatment was 13 months and overall treatment duration was up to almost 3 years. 93.2% of \npatients received ASA concomitantly plus thienopyridine treatment and 6.8% ASA only. Among \npatients receiving dual anti-platelets therapy 98.8% received clopidogrel, 0.9% received ticlopidine \nand 0.3% received prasugrel. Patients received the first dose of rivaroxaban at a minimum of 24 hours \nand up to 7 days (mean 4.7 days) after admission to the hospital, but as soon as possible after \nstabilisation of the ACS event, including revascularisation procedures and when parenteral \nanticoagulation therapy would normally be discontinued. \nBoth the 2.5 mg twice daily and the 5 mg twice daily regimens of rivaroxaban were effective in \nfurther reducing the incidence of CV events on a background of standard antiplatelet care. The 2.5 mg \ntwice daily regimen reduced mortality, and there is evidence that the lower dose had lower bleeding \nrisks, therefore rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone \n\n\n\n16 \n\nor with ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine is recommended for the prevention of atherothrombotic \nevents in adult patients after an ACS with elevated cardiac biomarkers. \nRelative to placebo, rivaroxaban significantly reduced the primary composite endpoint of CV death, \nMI or stroke. The benefit was driven by a reduction in CV death and MI and appeared early with a \nconstant treatment effect over the entire treatment period (see Table 4 and Figure 1). Also the first \nsecondary endpoint (all-cause death, MI or stroke) was reduced significantly. An additional \nretrospective analysis showed a nominally significant reduction in the incidence rates of stent \nthrombosis compared with placebo (see Table 4). The incidence rates for the principal safety outcome \n(non-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) TIMI major bleeding events) were higher in patients \ntreated with rivaroxaban than in patients who received placebo (see Table 6). However the incidence \nrates were balanced between rivaroxaban and placebo for the components of fatal bleeding events, \nhypotension requiring treatment with intravenous inotropic agents and surgical intervention for \nongoing bleeding.  \nIn Table 5 the efficacy results of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are \npresented. The safety results in this subgroup of patients undergoing PCI were comparable to the \noverall safety results.  \nPatients with elevated biomarkers (troponin or CK-MB) and without a prior stroke/TIA constituted \n80% of the study population. The results of this patient population were also consistent with the \noverall efficacy and safety results.  \n \nTable 4: Efficacy results from phase III ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 \n\nStudy population \n \n\nPatients with a recent acute coronary syndrome P\n\na) \n \n\nTreatment dose \n \n\nRivaroxaban 2.5 mg, twice daily, \nN=5,114 \nn (%)  \nHazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) p-\nvalue P\n\nb) \n\nPlacebo \nN=5,113  \nn (%) \n\nCardiovascular death, MI or stroke 313 (6.1%) \n0.84 (0.72, 0.97) p = 0.020* \n\n376 (7.4%) \n \n\nAll-cause death, MI or stroke 320 (6.3%) \n0.83 (0.72, 0.97) p = 0.016* \n\n386 (7.5%) \n\nCardiovascular death 94 (1.8%) \n0.66 (0.51, 0.86) p = 0.002** \n\n143 (2.8%) \n \n\nAll-cause death 103 (2.0%) \n0.68 (0.53, 0.87) p = 0.002** \n\n153 (3.0%) \n\nMI 205 (4.0%) \n0.90 (0.75, 1.09) p = 0.270 \n\n229 (4.5%) \n\nStroke 46 (0.9%) \n1.13 (0.74, 1.73) p = 0.562 \n\n41 (0.8%) \n\nStent thrombosis 61 (1.2%) \n0.70 (0.51, 0.97) p = 0.033** \n\n87 (1.7%) \n\na) modified intent to treat analysis set (intent to treat total analysis set for stent thrombosis) \nb) vs placebo; Log-Rank p-value \n* statistically superior  \n** nominally significant \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTable 5: Efficacy results from phase III ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 in patients undergoing PCI \nStudy population \n \n\nPatients with recent acute coronary syndrome \nundergoing PCI P\n\na) \nTreatment dose \n \n\nRivaroxaban 2.5 mg, twice daily, \nN=3114 \nn (%)  \nHR (95% CI) p-value P\n\nb) \n\nPlacebo \nN=3096  \nn (%) \n\nCardiovascular death, MI or stroke 153 (4.9%) \n0.94 (0.75, 1.17) p = 0.572 \n\n165 (5.3%) \n\nCardiovascular death 24 (0.8%) \n0.54 (0.33, 0.89) p = 0.013** \n\n45 (1.5%) \n\nAll-cause death 31 (1.0%) \n0.64 (0.41, 1.01) p = 0.053 \n\n49 (1.6%) \n\nMI 115 (3.7%) \n1.03 (0.79, 1.33) p = 0.829 \n\n113 (3.6%) \n\nStroke 27 (0.9%) \n1.30 (0.74, 2.31) p = 0.360 \n\n21 (0.7%) \n\nStent thrombosis 47 (1.5%) \n0.66 (0.46, 0.95) p = 0.026** \n\n71 (2.3%) \n\na) modified intent to treat analysis set (intent to treat total analysis set for stent thrombosis) \nb) vs placebo; Log-Rank p-value \n** nominally significant \n\n \nTable 6: Safety results from phase III ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 \n\nStudy population Patients with recent acute coronary syndrome P\n\na) \nTreatment dose \n \n\nRivaroxaban 2.5 mg, twice daily, \nN=5,115 \nn (%) \nHR (95% CI) p-value P\n\nb) \n\nPlacebo \nN=5,125 \nn(%) \n\nNon-CABG TIMI major bleeding \nevent \n\n65 (1.3%) \n3.46 (2.08, 5.77) p = < 0.001* \n\n19 (0.4%) \n\nFatal bleeding event 6 (0.1%) \n0.67 (0.24, 1.89) p = 0.450   \n\n9 (0.2%) \n\nSymptomatic intracranial \nhaemorrhage \n\n14 (0.3%) \n2.83 (1.02, 7.86) p = 0.037   \n\n5 (0.1%) \n\nHypotension requiring treatment \nwith intravenous inotropic agents \n\n3 (0.1%) 3 (0.1%) \n\nSurgical intervention for ongoing \nbleeding \n\n7 (0.1%) 9 (0.2%) \n\nTransfusion of 4 or more units of \nblood over a 48 hour period \n\n19 (0.4%) 6 (0.1%) \n\na) safety population, on treatment  \nb) vs placebo; Log-Rank p-value \n* statistically significant \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nFigure 1: Time to first occurrence of primary efficacy endpoint (CV death, MI or stroke)  \n\n \n \nCAD/PAD \nThe phase III COMPASS study (27,395 patients, 78.0% male, 22.0% female) demonstrated the \nefficacy and safety of rivaroxaban for the prevention of a composite of CV death, MI, stroke in \npatients with CAD or symptomatic PAD at high risk of ischaemic events. Patients were followed for a \nmedian of 23 months and maximum of 3.9 years.  \n \nSubjects without a continuous need for treatment with a proton pump inhibitor were randomised to \npantoprazole or placebo.

For patients < 65 years of age atherosclerosis \ninvolving at least two vascular beds or at least two additional cardiovascular risk factors were \nrequired.  \n \nPAD patients had previous interventions such as bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal \nangioplasty or limb or foot amputation for arterial vascular disease or intermittent claudication with \nankle/arm blood pressure ratio < 0.90 and/ or significant peripheral artery stenosis or previous carotid \nrevascularisation or asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis \u2265 50%.  \n \nExclusion criteria included the need for dual antiplatelet or other non-ASA antiplatelet or oral \nanticoagulant therapy and patients with high bleeding risk, or heart failure with ejection fraction \n< 30% or New York Heart Association class III or IV, or any ischaemic, non-lacunar stroke within \n1 month or any history of haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke.  \n \nRivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with ASA 100 mg once daily was superior to ASA \n100 mg, in the reduction of the primary composite outcome of CV death, MI, stroke (see Table 7 and \nFigure 2).  \n \nThere was a significant increase of the primary safety outcome (modified ISTH major bleeding events) \nin patients treated with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with ASA 100 mg once daily \ncompared to patients who received ASA 100 mg (see Table 8).  \n\n0 90 180 270 360 450 540 630 720 810\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\nC\nu\nm\n\nu\nla\n\nti\nve\n\n E\nve\n\nn\nt \n\nR\nat\n\ne \n(%\n\n)\n\nRelative Days from the RandomizationNo. of Patients at Risk\nXARELTO 5114 4431 3943 3199 2609 2005 1425 878 415 89\n\nPlacebo 5113 4437 3974 3253 2664 2059 1460 878 421 87\n\nXARELTO 2.5 mg twice daily\nPlacebo\n\nHazard Ratio: 0.84\n95% CI:  (0.72, 0.97)\nP-value=0.020*\n\n\n\n19 \n\nFor the primary efficacy outcome, the observed benefit of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus ASA \n100 mg once daily compared with ASA 100 mg once daily was HR=0.89 (95% CI 0.7-1.1) in patients \n\u226575 years (incidence: 6.3% vs 7.0%) and HR=0.70 (95% CI 0.6-0.8) in patients < 75 years (3.6% vs \n5.0%).

The overall median study treatment duration was 504 days.  \nPatients must have had symptomatic HF for at least 3 months and left ventricular ejection fraction \n(LVEF) of \u226440% within one year of enrollment. At baseline, the median ejection fraction was 34% \n(IQR: 28%-38%) and 53% of subjects were NYHA Class III or IV.  \nThe primary efficacy analysis (i.e. composite of all-cause mortality, MI, or stroke) showed no \nstatistically significant difference between the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily group and the placebo \ngroup with a HR=0.94 (95% CI 0.84 - 1.05), p=0.270. For all-cause mortality, there was no difference \nbetween rivaroxaban and placebo in the number of events (event rate per 100 patient-years; 11.41 vs \n11.63, HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.10; p=0.743). The event rates for MI per 100 patient-years \n(rivaroxaban vs placebo) were 2.08 vs 2.52 (HR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.63 to 1.08; p=0.165) and for stroke \nthe event rates per 100 patient-years were 1.08 vs 1.62 (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.95; p=0.023). The \nprincipal safety outcome (i.e. composite of fatal bleeding or bleeding into a critical space with a \npotential for permanent disability), occurred in 18 (0.7%) patients in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice \ndaily treatment group and in 23 (0.9%) patients in the placebo group, respectively (HR=0.80; 95% CI \n0.43 - 1.49; p=0.484). There was a statistically significant increase in ISTH major bleeding in the \nrivaroxaban group compared with placebo (event rate per 100 patient-years: 2.04 vs 1.21, HR 1.68; \n95% CI: 1.18 to 2.39; p=0.003). \nIn patients with mild and moderate heart failure the treatment effects for the COMPASS study \nsubgroup were similar to those of the entire study population (see section CAD/PAD). \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicentre study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for \nall 3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies). The study was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of \n\nKaplan-Meier Estimates (%) at 30 months:  \nXarelto 2.5mg bid + ASA 100mg od: 5.2 (4.7 - 5.8)  \nASA 100mg od: 7.2 (6.5 - 7.9) \n\n\n\n22 \n\n120 patients due to an excess of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was \n569 days. 59 patients were randomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine \nclearance (CrCl) < 50 mL/min) and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in \n12% of patients randomised to rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No \nevents were reported in patients randomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) \nof the rivaroxaban group and 2 patients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXarelto in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of thromboembolic events (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (CRmaxR) appearing 2 - 4 hours after \ntablet intake.  \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or CRmaxR at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose. Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablets can be \ntaken with or without food.  \nRivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily. At higher doses \nrivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and decreased \nabsorption rate with increased dose. This is more marked in fasting state than in fed state. Variability \nin rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) ranging from \n30% to 40%. \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% \nand 56% decrease in AUC and CRmaxR compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and CRmaxR) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being \nthe main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with VRssR being approximately \n50 litres. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination  \nOf the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half \nthen being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the \nadministered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly \nvia active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \n\n\n\n23 \n\nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between \nmale and female patients. \n \nElderly population \nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nExtremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary. \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics. \n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor \nchanges in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly \ncomparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3 fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  \nRivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via \ncreatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min), \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) renal \nimpairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 fold \nrespectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In \nindividuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; \nprolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no \ndata in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban is to be used \nwith caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in \npatients with ACS the geometric mean concentration (90% prediction interval) 2 - 4 h and about 12 h \nafter dose (roughly representing maximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was \n47 (13 - 123) and 9.2 (4.4 - 18) mcg/l, respectively. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nThe pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (factor-Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated \nafter administration of a wide range of doses (5 - 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor-Xa activity was best described by an ERmaxR model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects.  \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety and efficacy have not been established in the indications ACS and CAD/PAD for children and \nadolescents up to 18 years.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-\nnatal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee \nreplacement surgery. \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPrevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery \nThe recommended dose is 10 mg rivaroxaban taken orally once daily. The initial dose should be taken \n6 to 10 hours after surgery, provided that haemostasis has been established.  \n \nThe duration of treatment depends on the individual risk of the patient for venous thromboembolism \nwhich is determined by the type of orthopaedic surgery. \n\uf0b7 For patients undergoing major hip surgery, a treatment duration of 5 weeks is recommended. \n\uf0b7 For patients undergoing major knee surgery, a treatment duration of 2 weeks is recommended. \n \nIf a dose is missed the patient should take Xarelto immediately and then continue the following day \nwith once daily intake as before. \n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  \nThe recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first \nthree weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE.  \n\n\n\n27 \n\nShort duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE \nprovoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of \ntherapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk \nfactors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE.   \n \nWhen extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least \n6 months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom \nthe risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or \nwho have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Xarelto 10 mg once daily, a \ndose of Xarelto 20 mg once daily should be considered.  \n \nThe duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the \ntreatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).  \n \n\n Time period Dosing schedule Total daily dose \n\nTreatment and \nprevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nDay 1-21 15 mg twice daily  30 mg \n\nDay 22 onwards 20 mg once daily  20 mg \nPrevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE  \n\nFollowing completion \nof at least 6 months \ntherapy for DVT or PE \n\n10 mg once daily or  \n20 mg once daily  \n\n10 mg  \nor 20 mg \n\n \nTo support the dose switch from 15 mg to 20 mg after Day 21 a first 4 weeks treatment initiation pack \nof Xarelto for treatment of DVT/PE is available. \n \nIf a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1 - 21), the patient should take \nXarelto immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg Xarelto per day. In this case two 15 mg tablets may be \ntaken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice daily intake as recommended \non the following day.  \n \nIf a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Xarelto immediately, \nand continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be \ndoubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose. \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Xarelto \nFor patients treated for DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence, VKA treatment should be stopped and \nXarelto therapy should be initiated once the INR is \u2264 2.5.  \n \nWhen converting patients from VKAs to Xarelto, International Normalised Ratio (INR) values will be \nfalsely elevated after the intake of Xarelto. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity \nof Xarelto, and therefore should not be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Xarelto to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that Xarelto can contribute to an elevated INR. \nIn patients converting from Xarelto to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is \u2265 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Xarelto and VKA the \nINR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \nXarelto. Once Xarelto is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least 24 hours after the last \ndose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to Xarelto \nFor patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant \nand start Xarelto 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the parenteral \n\n\n\n28 \n\nmedicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of discontinuation \nof a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous unfractionated heparin). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to parenteral anticoagulants \nGive the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next Xarelto dose would be taken. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Xarelto is to be \nused with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance \n< 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n- For the prevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement \n\nsurgery, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance 50 - 80 ml/min) or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30- 49 ml/min) \n(see section 5.2). \n\n \n- For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, no dose \n\nadjustment from the recommended dose is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min) (see section 5.2).  \nIn patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance \n15 - 29 ml/min) renal impairment: patients should be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first \n3 weeks. Thereafter, when the recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose \nfrom 20 mg once daily to 15 mg once daily should be considered if the patient\u2019s assessed risk \nfor bleeding outweighs the risk for recurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of \n15 mg is based on PK modelling and has not been studied in this clinical setting (see \nsections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  \nWhen the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended \ndose is necessary. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Xarelto 10 mg tablets in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available. Therefore, Xarelto 10 mg tablets are not recommended for use in \nchildren below 18 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \nXarelto is for oral use.  \nThe tablets can be taken with or without food (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nCrushing of tablets \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Xarelto tablet may be crushed and mixed with \nwater or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally.  \nThe crushed tablet may also be given through gastric tubes (see sections 5.2 and 6.6). \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \nHaemorrhagic risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Xarelto are to be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. \nIt is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. Xarelto \nadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see section 4.9). \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate \nclinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult \nbleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are \nto be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after \ninitiation of treatment (see section 4.8). In patients receiving Xarelto for VTE prevention following \nelective hip or knee replacement surgery, this may be done by regular physical examination of the \npatients, close observation of the surgical wound drainage and periodic measurements of haemoglobin. \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels \nmay be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nXarelto is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min. Use is not \nrecommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n30 \n\nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) concomitantly \nreceiving other medicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations Xarelto is to be \nused with caution (see section 4.5). \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \nThe use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with \nazole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) or HIV \nprotease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and \nP-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant degree \n(2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see section 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and \nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n\uf0b7 congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n\uf0b7 uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n\uf0b7 other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n\uf0b7 vascular retinopathy \n\uf0b7 bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \nPatients with prosthetic valves \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been studied \nin patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that Xarelto provides \nadequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Xarelto is not recommended for \nthese patients. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates \nof recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nHip fracture surgery \nRivaroxaban has not been studied in interventional clinical studies in patients undergoing hip fracture \nsurgery to evaluate efficacy and safety. \n \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \nXarelto is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary \nembolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in these clinical \nsituations.  \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \n\n\n\n31 \n\nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low (see section 5.2). \nAt least 18 hours should elapse after the last administration of rivaroxaban before removal of an \nepidural catheter. Following removal of the catheter, at least 6 hours should elapse before the next \nrivaroxaban dose is administered. \nIf traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention other than \nelective hip or knee replacement surgery \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Xarelto 10 mg should be stopped at least \n24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the physician.  \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \nXarelto should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention \nprovided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as determined by \nthe treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nDermatological reactions \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \nXarelto contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say \nessentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban CRmaxR, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4).  \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \n\n\n\n32 \n\nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in \nCRmaxR. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and CRmaxR. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRRmaxR when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRRmaxR when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean Cmax. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-\nrisk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \nAnticoagulants \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response.  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-\nmajor clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-\nfactor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the \n\n\n\n33 \n\nfourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity \nand ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the CRtroughR of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers  \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \nNo clinically relevant interaction with food was observed (see section 4.2). \n \nLaboratory parameters \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy  \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the intrinsic \nrisk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Xarelto is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3).  \nWomen of child bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from animals \nindicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Xarelto is contraindicated during breast-\nfeeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from therapy. \n \nFertility \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXarelto has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like syncope \n(frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see section 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies in adults including \n53,103 patients exposed to rivaroxaban and in two phase II and one phase III paediatric studies \nincluding 412 patients .

As incidence of \nadverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS \nstudy data were not included for frequency calculation in this table. \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Xarelto may be associated with an increased \nrisk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post haemorrhagic \nanaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary according to the \nlocation and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 \u201cManagement of \nbleeding\u201d). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito \nurinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more \nfrequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to \nadequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to \ndetect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be \nappropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with \nuncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see \nsection 4.4 \u201cHaemorrhagic risk\u201d). Menstrual bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. \nHaemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained \nswelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of \ncardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris have been observed.  \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for Xarelto. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to \nbe considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nRare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or other \nadverse reactions. Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma \nexposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above.  \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa). \nThe use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised \naccording to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could \nbe used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis \nwith bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products \n(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or \nplatelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific \nfactor Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), \nshould be considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on \nlimited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated \ndepending on improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a \ncoagulation expert should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor \n\n\n\n39 \n\nexperience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving \nrivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  \n \nMechanism of action \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant. In patients undergoing major orthopaedic \nsurgery, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of \nmaximum effect) ranged from 13 to 25 s (baseline values before surgery 12 to 15 s). \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \nThe activated partial thomboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-\nfactor Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nPrevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery  \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban for the \nprevention of VTE, i.e. proximal and distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism \n(PE) in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery of the lower limbs. Over 9,500 patients (7,050 \nin total hip replacement surgery and 2,531 in total knee replacement surgery) were studied in \ncontrolled randomised double-blind phase III clinical studies, the RECORD-programme.  \nRivaroxaban 10 mg once daily (od) started no sooner than 6 hours post-operatively was compared \nwith enoxaparin 40 mg once daily started 12 hours pre-operatively. \nIn all three phase III studies (see table 4), rivaroxaban significantly reduced the rate of total VTE (any \nvenographically detected or symptomatic DVT, non-fatal PE and death) and major VTE (proximal \nDVT, non-fatal PE and VTE-related death), the pre-specified primary and major secondary efficacy \nendpoints. Furthermore, in all three studies the rate of symptomatic VTE (symptomatic DVT, non-\nfatal PE, VTE-related death) was lower in rivaroxaban treated patients compared to patients treated \nwith enoxaparin. \nThe main safety endpoint, major bleeding, showed comparable rates for patients treated with \nrivaroxaban 10 mg compared to enoxaparin 40 mg. \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nTable 4: Efficacy and safety results from phase III clinical studies \n RECORD 1 RECORD 2 RECORD 3 \n\nStudy \npopulation \n\n4,541 patients undergoing \ntotal hip replacement surgery \n\n2,509 patients undergoing total \nhip replacement surgery \n\n2,531 patients undergoing \ntotal knee replacement \nsurgery \n\nTreatment \ndose and \nduration \nafter \nsurgery \n\nRivaroxab\nan \n10 mg od \n35 \u00b1 4 da\nys \n\nEnoxapari\nn \n40 mg od \n35 \u00b1 4 day\ns \n\np Rivaroxab\nan \n10 mg od \n35 \u00b1 4 da\nys \n\nEnoxaparin \n40 mg od \n12 \u00b1 2 days \n\np Rivaroxab\nan \n10 mg od \n12 \u00b1 2 day\ns \n\nEnoxapari\nn \n40 mg od \n12 \u00b1 2 day\ns \n\np \n\nTotal VTE 18 \n(1.1%) \n\n58 \n(3.7%) \n\n< 0.001 17 \n(2.0%)  \n\n81 (9.3%) < 0.001 79 \n(9.6%) \n\n166 \n(18.9%) \n\n< 0.001 \n\nMajor \nVTE \n\n4 (0.2%) 33 \n(2.0%) \n\n< 0.001 6 (0.6%) 49 (5.1%) < 0.001 9 (1.0%) 24 (2.6%) 0.01 \n\nSymptomati\nc VTE  \n\n6 (0.4%) 11 \n(0.7%) \n\n 3 (0.4%) 15 (1.7%)  8 (1.0%) 24 (2.7%)  \n\nMajor \nbleedings \n\n6 (0.3%) 2 (0.1%)  1 (0.1%) 1 (0.1%)  7 (0.6%) 6 (0.5%)  \n\n \nThe analysis of the pooled results of the phase III studies corroborated the data obtained in the \nindividual studies regarding reduction of total VTE, major VTE and symptomatic VTE with \nrivaroxaban 10 mg once daily compared to enoxaparin 40 mg once daily. \n  \nIn addition to the phase III RECORD programme, a post-authorisation, non-interventional, open-label \ncohort study (XAMOS) has been conducted in 17,413 patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery \nof the hip or knee, to compare rivaroxaban with other pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (standard-\nof-care) under real-life setting. Symptomatic VTE occurred in 57 (0.6%) patients in the rivaroxaban \ngroup (n=8,778) and 88 (1.0%) of patients in the standard-of-care group (n=8,635; HR 0.63; 95% CI \n0.43-0.91); safety population). Major bleeding occurred in 35 (0.4%) and 29 (0.3%) of patients in the \nrivaroxaban and standard-of-care groups (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.67-1.80). Thus, the results were \nconsistent with the results of the pivotal randomised studies. \n \nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the \ninitial and continued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence. \nOver 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein \nDVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice). and additionally a predefined pooled \nanalysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment \nduration in all studies was up to 21 months.  \n \nIn Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the \nprevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded \nfrom this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This \nwas followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  \n \nIn Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. \nThis was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  \n \nIn both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of \nenoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until \nthe PT/INR was in therapeutic range (\uf0b3 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist \ndose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \nIn Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had \ncompleted 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism depending on the clinical \njudgment of the investigator. Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo.  \n \nEinstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of \nrecurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality.  \nIn Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed 6-12 \nmonths of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal \nsymptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed \nanticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending \non the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily and \nrivaroxaban 10 mg once daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE.  \nIn the Einstein DVT study (see Table 5) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); Hazard Ratio \n(HR): 0.680 (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit \n(primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 \n((95% CI: 0.47 - 0.95), nominal p value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within \nthe therapeutic range a mean of 60.3% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and \n55.4%, 60.1%, and 62.8% of the time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration groups, \nrespectively. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of mean \ncentre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 \u2013 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the incidence of \nthe recurrent VTE (P=0.932 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to centre, the HR \nwith rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35 - 1.35). \n \nThe incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding \nevents) as well as the secondary safety outcome (major bleeding events) were similar for both \ntreatment groups. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nTable 5: Efficacy and safety results from phase III Einstein DVT \n\nStudy population \n3,449 patients with symptomatic acute deep vein \nthrombosis \n\nTreatment dose and duration \nRivaroxaban P\n\na) \n\n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,731 \n\nEnoxaparin/VKAP\n\nb) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,718 \n\nSymptomatic recurrent VTE* \n36 \n(2.1%) \n\n51 \n(3.0%) \n\n Symptomatic recurrent PE \n20 \n(1.2%) \n\n18 \n(1.0%) \n\n Symptomatic recurrent DVT \n14 \n(0.8%) \n\n28 \n(1.6%) \n\n Symptomatic PE and DVT \n1 \n(0.1%) \n\n0 \n\n Fatal PE/death where PE cannot \nbe ruled out \n\n4 \n(0.2%) \n\n6 \n(0.3%) \n\nMajor or clinically relevant non-major \nbleeding \n\n139 \n(8.1%) \n\n138 \n(8.1%) \n\nMajor bleeding events \n14 \n(0.8%) \n\n20 \n(1.2%) \n\na) Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily \nb) Enoxaparin for at least 5 days, overlapped with and followed by VKA \n* p < 0.0001 (non-inferiority to a prespecified HR of 2.0); HR: 0.680 (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 \n\n(superiority) \n \nIn the Einstein PE study (see Table 6) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p=0.0026 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 1.123 \n(0.749 \u2013 1.684)).

There were differences in patient baseline characteristics including age, cancer and \nrenal impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for measured \nbaseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. Adjusted HRs \ncomparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality \nwere 0.77 (95% CI 0.40 - 1.50), 0.91 (95% CI 0.54 - 1.54) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.07), respectively.  \nThese results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this indication. \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicentre study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for \nall 3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies). The study was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of \n120 patients due to an excess of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was \n569 days. 59 patients were randomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine \nclearance (CrCl) < 50 mL/min) and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in \n12% of patients randomised to rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No \nevents were reported in patients randomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) \nof the rivaroxaban group and 2 patients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \nPaediatric population \n The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXarelto in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of thromboembolic events (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (CRmaxR) appearing 2 - 4 hours after \ntablet intake. \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or CRmaxR at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose. Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablets can be \ntaken with or without food. Rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg \nonce daily. At higher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased \nbioavailability and decreased absorption rate with increased dose. This is more marked in fasting state \nthan in fed state. Variability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual \nvariability (CV%) ranging from 30% to 40%, apart from on the day of surgery and the following day \nwhen variability in exposure is high (70%). \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% \nand 56% decrease in AUC and CRmaxR compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and CRmaxR) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being \nthe main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with VRssR being approximately \n50 litres. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination  \nOf the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half \nthen being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the \nadministered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly \nvia active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between \nmale and female patients. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \nElderly population  \nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nExtremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary. \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics. \n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor \nchanges in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly \ncomparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3 fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  \nRivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via \ncreatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min), \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) renal \nimpairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 fold \nrespectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In \nindividuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; \nprolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no \ndata in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban is to be used \nwith caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for prevention of VTE 10 mg once daily the geometric mean \nconcentration (90% prediction interval) 2 - 4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing \nmaximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 101 (7 - 273) and \n14 (4 \u2011 51) mcg/l, respectively. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nThe pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated \nafter administration of a wide range of doses (5 - 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an ERmaxR model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \n\n\n\n48 \n\nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects. In patients, baseline factor Xa and PT were \ninfluenced by the surgery resulting in a difference in the concentration-PT slope between the day post-\nsurgery and steady state.  \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety and efficacy have not been established in the indication primary prevention of VTE for children \nand adolescents up to 18 years.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-\nnatal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAdults \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with \none or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age \u2265 75 years, diabetes \nmellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack.  \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) \n \nPaediatric population  \nTreatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of VTE recurrence in children and \nadolescents aged less than 18 years and weighing from 30 kg to 50 kg after at least 5 days of initial \nparenteral anticoagulation treatment. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adults \nThe recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, which is also the recommended maximum dose.  \n \nTherapy with Xarelto should be continued long term provided the benefit of prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism outweighs the risk of bleeding (see section 4.4).  \n \nIf a dose is missed the patient should take Xarelto immediately and continue on the following day with \nthe once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be doubled within the same day to make \nup for a missed dose.  \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults \nThe recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first \nthree weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE.  \n \nShort duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE \nprovoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of \ntherapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk \nfactors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE.   \n \nWhen extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least \n6 months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom \nthe risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or \nwho have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Xarelto 10 mg once daily, a \ndose of Xarelto 20 mg once daily should be considered.  \n \nThe duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the \ntreatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).  \n \n\n Time period Dosing schedule Total daily dose \n\nTreatment and \nprevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nDay 1 - 21 15 mg twice daily  30 mg \n\nDay 22 onwards 20 mg once daily  20 mg \n\nPrevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE  \n\nFollowing completion \nof at least 6 months \ntherapy for DVT or PE  \n\n10 mg once daily or  \n20 mg once daily  \n\n10 mg  \nor 20 mg \n\n \nTo support the dose switch from 15 mg to 20 mg after Day 21 a first 4 weeks treatment initiation pack \nof Xarelto for treatment of DVT/PE is available. \n \nIf a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1 - 21), the patient should take \nXarelto immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg Xarelto per day. In this case two 15 mg tablets may be \ntaken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice daily intake as recommended \non the following day.  \n \nIf a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Xarelto immediately, \nand continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be \ndoubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.  \n \nTreatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence in children and adolescents \nXarelto treatment in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years should be initiated following at \nleast 5 days of initial parenteral anticoagulation treatment (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe dose for children and adolescent is calculated based on body weight.  \n- Body weight from 30 to 50 kg: \n\na once daily dose of 15 mg rivaroxaban is recommended. This is the maximum daily dose.  \n- Body weight of 50 kg or more: \n\na once daily dose of 20 mg rivaroxaban is recommended. This is the maximum daily dose.  \n- For patients with body weight less 30 kg refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of \n\nXarelto granules for oral suspension.  \n \nThe weight of a child should be monitored and the dose reviewed regularly. This is to ensure a \ntherapeutic dose is maintained. Dose adjustments should be made based on changes in body weight \nonly. \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\nTreatment should be continued for at least 3 months in children and adolescents. Treatment can be \nextended up to 12 months when clinically necessary. There is no data available in children to support a \ndose reduction after 6 months treatment. The benefit-risk of continued therapy after 3 months should \nbe assessed on an individual basis taking into account the risk for recurrent thrombosis versus the \npotential bleeding risk.  \n \nIf a dose is missed, the missed dose should be taken as soon as possible after it is noticed, but only on \nthe same day. If this is not possible, the patient should skip the dose and continue with the next dose as \nprescribed. The patient should not take two doses to make up for a missed dose.  \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Xarelto \n- Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism:  \n\nVKA treatment should be stopped and Xarelto therapy should be initiated when the \nInternational Normalised Ratio (INR) is \u2264 3.0.  \n\n- Treatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence in adults and treatment of VTE and \nprevention of recurrence in paediatric patients:  \nVKA treatment should be stopped and Xarelto therapy should be initiated once the INR is \u2264 2.5.  \n\nWhen converting patients from VKAs to Xarelto, INR values will be falsely elevated after the intake \nof Xarelto. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity of Xarelto, and therefore should \nnot be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Xarelto to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that Xarelto can contribute to an elevated INR.  \nIn patients converting from Xarelto to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is \u2265 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Xarelto and VKA the \nINR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \nXarelto. Once Xarelto is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least 24 hours after the last \ndose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric patients:  \nChildren who convert from Xarelto to VKA need to continue Xarelto for 48 hours after the first dose \nof VKA. After 2 days of co-administration an INR should be obtained prior to the next scheduled dose \nof Xarelto. Co-administration of Xarelto and VKA is advised to continue until the INR is \u2265 2.0. Once \nXarelto is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably 24 hours after the last dose (see above and \nsection 4.5). \n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to Xarelto \nFor adult and paediatric patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the \nparenteral anticoagulant and start Xarelto 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled \nadministration of the parenteral medicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due \nor at the time of discontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. \nintravenous unfractionated heparin). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to parenteral anticoagulants \nDiscontinue Xarelto and give the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next Xarelto \ndose would be taken.  \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nAdults:  \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Xarelto is to be \nused with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance \n< 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \nIn patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance 15-\n29 ml/min) renal impairment the following dose recommendations apply: \n \n- For the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial \n\nfibrillation, the recommended dose is 15 mg once daily (see section 5.2). \n \n\n- For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE: patients \nshould be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks. Thereafter, when the \nrecommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose from 20 mg once daily to 15 mg \nonce daily should be considered if the patient\u2019s assessed risk for bleeding outweighs the risk for \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of 15 mg is based on PK modelling and \nhas not been studied in this clinical setting (see sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  \nWhen the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended \ndose is necessary.  \n\n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n50 - 80 ml/min) (see section 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population:  \n- Children and adolescents with mild renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n50 - 80 mL/min/1.73 mP\n\n2\nP): no dose adjustment is required, based on data in adults and limited \n\ndata in paediatric patients (see section 5.2). \n- Children and adolescents with moderate or severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n< 50 mL/min/1.73 mP\n\n2\nP): Xarelto is not recommended as no clinical data is available (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \nNo clinical data is available in children with hepatic impairment.  \n \nElderly population  \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment for adults (see section 5.2) \nFor paediatric patients the dose is determined based on body weight.  \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nXarelto can be initiated or continued in patients who may require cardioversion.  \nFor transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) guided cardioversion in patients not previously treated \nwith anticoagulants, Xarelto treatment should be started at least 4 hours before cardioversion to ensure \nadequate anticoagulation (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). For all patients, confirmation should be sought \nprior to cardioversion that the patient has taken Xarelto as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and \nduration of treatment should take established guideline recommendations for anticoagulant treatment \nin patients undergoing cardioversion into account. \n \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) \nwith stent placement \nThere is limited experience of a reduced dose of 15 mg Xarelto once daily (or 10 mg Xarelto once \ndaily for patients with moderate renal impairment [creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min]) in addition to \na P2Y12 inhibitor for a maximum of 12 months in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who \nrequire oral anticoagulation and undergo PCI with stent placement (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Xarelto in children aged 0 to < 18 years have not been established in the \nindication prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. \nNo data are available. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age in \nindications other than the treatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence.  \n \nMethod of administration  \nAdults \nXarelto is for oral use.  \nThe tablets are to be taken with food (see section 5.2). \n \nCrushing of tablets \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Xarelto tablet may be crushed and mixed with \nwater or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally. After the administration of \ncrushed Xarelto 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should be immediately followed by \nfood. \nThe crushed tablet may also be given through gastric tubes (see sections 5.2 and 6.6). \n \nChildren and adolescents weighing 30 kg to 50 kg \nXarelto is for oral use.  \n49TThe patient should be advised to 49Tswallow the tablet with liquid. It should also be taken with food (see \nsection 5.2). The tablets should be taken approximately 24 hours apart. \n \nIn case the patient immediately spits up the dose or vomits within 30 minutes after receiving the dose, \na new dose should be given. However, if the patient vomits more than 30 minutes after the dose, the \ndose should not be re-administered and the next dose should be taken as scheduled. \n \nThe tablet must not be split in an attempt to provide a fraction of a tablet dose.  \n \nCrushing of tablets \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Xarelto granules for oral suspension should be \nused.  \nIf the oral suspension is not immediately available, when doses of 15 mg or 20 mg rivaroxaban are \nprescribed, these could be provided by crushing the 15 mg or 20 mg tablet and mixing it with water or \napple puree immediately prior to use and administering orally. \nThe crushed tablet may be given through a nasogastric or gastric feeding tube (see sections 5.2 \nand 6.6).  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \nHaemorrhagic risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Xarelto are to be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. \nIt is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. Xarelto \nadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see section 4.9). \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate \nclinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult \nbleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are \nto be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after \ninitiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is limited data in children with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis who have a CNS infection \n(see section 5.1). The risk of bleeding should be carefully evaluated before and during therapy with \nrivaroxaban. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma \nlevels may be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding \nrisk. Xarelto is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min. Use is not \nrecommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nXarelto should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment concomitantly receiving other \nmedicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (see section 4.5). \nXarelto is not recommended in children and adolescents with moderate or severe renal impairment \n(glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min/1.73 mP\n\n2\nP), as no clinical data is available.  \n\n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \nThe use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with \nazole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) or HIV \nprotease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and \nP-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant degree \n(2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. No clinical data is available in \nchildren receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of both CYP 3A4 and P-gp \n(see section 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid and \n\n\n\n56 \n\nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5).  \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n\uf0b7 congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n\uf0b7 uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n\uf0b7 other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n\uf0b7 vascular retinopathy \n\uf0b7 bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \nPatients with prosthetic valves \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been studied \nin patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that Xarelto provides \nadequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Xarelto is not recommended for \nthese patients. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates \nof recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement \nClinical data are available from an interventional study with the primary objective to assess safety in \npatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement. Data on efficacy \nin this population are limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). No data are available for such patients with a \nhistory of stroke/ transient ischaemic attack (TIA).  \n \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \nXarelto is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary \nembolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in these clinical \nsituations.  \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical \nexperience with the use of 15 mg rivaroxaban in these situations. \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \n\n\n\n57 \n\nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low. However, the exact timing to reach a \nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known and should be weighed against the \nurgency of a diagnostic procedure. \nFor the removal of an epidural catheter and based on the general PK characteristics at least 2x half-\nlife, i.e. at least 18 hours in young adult patients and 26 hours in elderly patients should elapse after \nthe last administration of rivaroxaban (see section 5.2). Following removal of the catheter, at least \n6 hours should elapse before the next rivaroxaban dose is administered. \nIf traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours.  \nNo data is available on the timing of the placement or removal of neuraxial catheter in children while \non Xarelto. In such cases, discontinue rivaroxaban and consider a short acting parenteral \nanticoagulant. \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention  \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Xarelto 15 mg should be stopped at least \n24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the physician.  \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \nXarelto should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention \nprovided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as determined by \nthe treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nDermatological reactions \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \nXarelto contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say \nessentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe extent of interactions in the paediatric population is not known. The below mentioned interaction \ndata was obtained in adults and the warnings in section 4.4 should be taken into account for the \npaediatric population. \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban CRmaxR, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4).  \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \n\n\n\n58 \n\nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in \nCRmaxR. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and CRmaxR. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRRmaxR when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRRmaxR when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean CRmaxR. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-\nrisk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \nAnticoagulants \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response.  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-\nmajor clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-\nfactor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the \n\n\n\n59 \n\nfourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity \nand ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the CRtroughR of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers  \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \n \nLaboratory parameters \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the intrinsic \nrisk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Xarelto is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3).  \nWomen of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from animals \nindicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Xarelto is contraindicated during breast-\nfeeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from therapy.  \n \nFertility \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXarelto has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like syncope \n(frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see section 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies in adults including \n53,103 patients exposed to rivaroxaban and in two phase II and one phase III paediatric studies \nincluding 412 patients. See phase III studies as listed in table 1. \n \n\n\n\n60 \n\nTable 1: Number of patients studied, total daily dose and maximum treatment duration in adult \nand paediatric phase III studies \n\nIndication Number of \npatients* \n\nTotal daily dose  Maximum \ntreatment duration \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolism \n(VTE) in adult patients undergoing \nelective hip or knee replacement surgery \n\n6,097 10 mg 39 days \n\nPrevention of VTE in medically ill \npatients \n\n3,997 10 mg 39 days \n\nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention \nof recurrence \n\n6,790 Day 1 - 21: 30 mg \nDay 22 and onwards: \n20 mg \nAfter at least 6 \nmonths: 10 mg or 20 \nmg \n\n21 months \n\nTreatment of VTE and prevention of \nVTE recurrence in term neonates and \nchildren aged less than 18 years \nfollowing initiation of standard \nanticoagulation treatment \n\n329 Body weight-adjusted \ndose to achieve a \nsimilar exposure as \nthat observed in adults \ntreated for DVT with \n20 mg rivaroxaban \nonce daily \n\n12 months \n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism in patients with non-valvular \natrial fibrillation \n\n7,750 20 mg 41 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events \nin patients after an ACS \n\n10,225 5 mg or 10 mg \nrespectively, co-\nadministered with \neither ASA or ASA \nplus clopidogrel or \nticlopidine \n\n31 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic events \nin patients with CAD/PAD \n\n18,244 5 mg co-administered \nwith ASA or 10 mg \nalone \n\n47 months \n\n* Patients exposed to at least one dose of rivaroxaban \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients receiving rivaroxaban were bleedings (see \nsection 4.4. and \u2018Description of selected adverse reactions\u2019 below) (Table 2).

A pre-specified selective approach to adverse event collection was applied. As incidence of \nadverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS \nstudy data were not included for frequency calculation in this table. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Xarelto may be associated with an increased \nrisk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post haemorrhagic \nanaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary according to the \nlocation and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 \u201cManagement of \n\n\n\n64 \n\nbleeding\u201d). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito \nurinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more \nfrequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to \nadequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to \ndetect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be \nappropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with \nuncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see \nsection 4.4 \u201cHaemorrhagic risk\u201d). Menstrual bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. \nHaemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained \nswelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of \ncardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris have been observed.  \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for Xarelto. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to \nbe considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety assessment in children and adolescents is based on the safety data from two phase II and \none phase III open-label active controlled studies in paediatric patients aged birth to less than 18 years. \nThe safety findings were generally similar between rivaroxaban and comparator in the various \npaediatric age groups. Overall, the safety profile in the 412 children and adolescents treated with \nrivaroxaban was similar to that observed in the adult population and consistent across age subgroups, \nalthough assessment is limited by the small number of patients. \nIn paediatric patients, headache (very common, 16.7%), fever (very common, 11.7%), epistaxis (very \ncommon, 11.2%), vomiting (very common, 10.7%), tachycardia (common, 1.5%), increase in bilirubin \n(common, 1.5%) and bilirubin conjugated increased (uncommon, 0.7%) were reported more \nfrequently as compared to adults. Consistent with adult population, menorrhagia was observed in 6.6% \n(common) of female adolescents after menarche. Thrombocytopenia as observed in the post-marketing \nexperience in adult population was common (4.6%) in paediatric clinical studies. The adverse drug \nreactions in paediatric patients were primarily mild to moderate in severity. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn adults, rare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or \nother adverse reactions. There is limited data available in children. Due to limited absorption a ceiling \neffect with no further increase in average plasma exposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of \n50 mg rivaroxaban or above in adults, however, no data is available at supratherapeutic doses in \nchildren.  \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable for adults, but not established in children (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of \nandexanet alfa). \nThe use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours in adults. The half life in children estimated using population \npharmacokinetic (popPK) modelling approaches is shorter (see section 5.2). Management should be \nindividualised according to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic \ntreatment could be used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical \nhaemostasis with bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood \n\n\n\n65 \n\nproducts (packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) \nor platelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific \nfactor Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), \nshould be considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in adults and in children receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also \nbased on limited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and \ntitrated depending on improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a \ncoagulation expert should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in adults receiving rivaroxaban. There is no experience on the use of these agents in children \nreceiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor experience with the use of \nthe systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma \nprotein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  \n \nMechanism of action \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant.  \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence, the 5/95 \npercentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of maximum effect) for \n15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily ranged from 17 to 32 s and for 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily from 15 \nto 30 s. At trough (8 - 16 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles for 15 mg twice daily ranged from \n14 to 24 s and for 20 mg once daily (18 - 30 h after tablet intake) from 13 to 20 s. \nIn patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 1 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the \ntime of maximum effect) in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 14 to 40 s and in \npatients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 10 to 50 s. At trough \n(16 - 36 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged \nfrom 12 to 26 s and in patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 12 \nto 26 s. \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \n\n\n\n66 \n\nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-\nfactor Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nPT (neoplastin reagent), aPTT, and anti-Xa assay (with a calibrated quantitative test) display a close \ncorrelation to plasma concentrations in children. The correlation between anti-Xa to plasma \nconcentrations is linear with a slope close to 1. Individual discrepancies with higher or lower anti-Xa \nvalues as compared to the corresponding plasma concentrations may occur. There is no need for \nroutine monitoring of coagulation parameters during clinical treatment with rivaroxaban. However, if \nclinically indicated, rivaroxaban concentrations can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-\nFactor Xa tests in mcg/L (see table 13 in section 5.2 for ranges of observed rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations in children). The lower limit of quantifications must be considered when the anti-Xa \ntest is used to quantify plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban in children. No threshold for efficacy or \nsafety events has been established. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban for the \nprevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.  \nIn the pivotal double-blind ROCKET AF study, 14,264 patients were assigned either to rivaroxaban \n20 mg once daily (15 mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) or to \nwarfarin titrated to a target INR of 2.5 (therapeutic range 2.0 to 3.0). The median time on treatment \nwas 19 months and overall treatment duration was up to 41 months.  \n34.9% of patients were treated with acetylsalicylic acid and 11.4% were treated with class III \nantiarrhythmic including amiodarone.  \n \nRivaroxaban was non-inferior to warfarin for the primary composite endpoint of stroke and non-CNS \nsystemic embolism. In the per-protocol population on treatment, stroke or systemic embolism occurred \nin 188 patients on rivaroxaban (1.71% per year) and 241 on warfarin (2.16% per year) (HR 0.79; \n95% CI, 0.66 - 0.96; P<0.001 for non-inferiority). Among all randomised patients analysed according \nto ITT, primary events occurred in 269 on rivaroxaban (2.12% per year) and 306 on warfarin (2.42% \nper year) (HR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74 - 1.03; P<0.001 for non-inferiority; P=0.117 for superiority). Results \nfor secondary endpoints as tested in hierarchical order in the ITT analysis are displayed in Table 4. \nAmong patients in the warfarin group, INR values were within the therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0) a \nmean of 55% of the time (median, 58%; interquartile range, 43 to 71). The effect of rivaroxaban did \nnot differ across the level of centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized \nquartiles (P=0.74 for interaction). Within the highest quartile according to centre, the Hazard Ratio \n(HR) with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.49 - 1.12). \nThe incidence rates for the principal safety outcome (major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding \nevents) were similar for both treatment groups (see Table 5). \n \n\n\n\n67 \n\nTable 4: Efficacy results from phase III ROCKET AF \n\nStudy population \nITT analyses of efficacy in patients with non-valvular atrial \nfibrillation \n\nTreatment dose \n\nRivaroxaban \n20 mg once daily  \n(15 mg once daily in \npatients with moderate \nrenal impairment) \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nWarfarin \ntitrated to a target \nINR of 2.5 (therapeutic \nrange 2.0 to 3.0) \n \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nHR (95% CI) \np-value, test for \nsuperiority \n\nStroke and non-CNS \nsystemic embolism \n\n269 \n(2.12) \n\n306 \n(2.42) \n\n0.88 (0.74 - 1.03) \n0.117 \n\nStroke, non-CNS systemic \nembolism and vascular death \n\n572 \n(4.51) \n\n609 \n(4.81) \n\n0.94 (0.84 - 1.05) \n0.265 \n\nStroke, non-CNS systemic \nembolism, vascular death \nand myocardial infarction \n\n659 \n(5.24) \n\n709 \n(5.65) \n\n0.93 (0.83 - 1.03) \n0.158 \n\n Stroke \n253  \n(1.99) \n\n281 \n(2.22) \n\n0.90 (0.76 - 1.07) \n0.221 \n\n Non-CNS systemic \nembolism \n\n20  \n(0.16) \n\n27 \n(0.21) \n\n0.74 (0.42 - 1.32) \n0.308 \n\nMyocardial infarction \n130 \n(1.02) \n\n142 \n(1.11) \n\n0.91 (0.72 - 1.16)  \n0.464 \n\n \n\n\n\n68 \n\nTable 5: Safety results from phase III ROCKET AF \nStudy population Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillationP\n\na) \n\nTreatment dose  \n\nRivaroxaban \n20 mg once daily  \n(15 mg once daily in \npatients with moderate \nrenal impairment) \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nWarfarin \ntitrated to a target INR \nof 2.5 (therapeutic \nrange 2.0 to 3.0) \n \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nHR (95% CI) \np-value  \n\nMajor and non-major \nclinically relevant bleeding \nevents \n\n1,475 \n(14.91) \n\n1,449 \n(14.52) \n\n1.03 (0.96 - 1.11) \n0.442 \n\nMajor bleeding events \n395 \n(3.60) \n\n386 \n(3.45) \n\n1.04 (0.90 - 1.20) \n0.576 \n\nDeath due to \n\nbleeding* \n\n27 \n(0.24) \n\n55 \n(0.48) \n\n0.50 (0.31 - 0.79) \n0.003 \n\nCritical organ \n\nbleeding* \n\n91 \n(0.82) \n\n133 \n(1.18) \n\n0.69 (0.53 - 0.91) \n0.007 \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage* \n\n55  \n(0.49) \n\n84 \n(0.74) \n\n0.67 (0.47 - 0.93) \n0.019 \n\nHaemoglobin drop* \n305 \n(2.77) \n\n254 \n(2.26) \n\n1.22 (1.03 - 1.44) \n0.019 \n\nTransfusion of 2 or \nmore units of packed \nred blood cells or \n\nwhole blood* \n\n183 \n(1.65) \n\n149 \n(1.32) \n\n1.25 (1.01 - 1.55) \n0.044 \n\nNon-major clinically \nrelevant bleeding events \n\n1,185 \n(11.80) \n\n1,151 \n(11.37) \n\n1.04 (0.96 - 1.13) \n0.345 \n\nAll-cause mortality \n208 \n(1.87) \n\n250 \n(2.21) \n\n0.85 (0.70 - 1.02) \n0.073 \n\na) Safety population, on treatment \n\n* Nominally significant \n \nIn addition to the phase III ROCKET AF study, a prospective, single-arm, post-authorisation, non-\ninterventional, open-label cohort study (XANTUS) with central outcome adjudication including \nthromboembolic events and major bleeding has been conducted. 6,785 patients with non-valvular \natrial fibrillation were enrolled for prevention of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) \nsystemic embolism in clinical practice. The mean CHADSR2R and HAS-BLED scores were both 2.0 in \nXANTUS, compared to a mean CHADSR2R and HAS-BLED score of 3.5 and 2.8 in ROCKET AF, \nrespectively. Major bleeding occurred in 2.1 per 100 patient years. Fatal haemorrhage was reported in \n0.2 per 100 patient years and intracranial haemorrhage in 0.4 per 100 patient years. Stroke or non-CNS \nsystemic embolism was recorded in 0.8 per 100 patient years. \nThese observations in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this \nindication. \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nA prospective, randomised, open-label, multicentre, exploratory study with blinded endpoint \nevaluation (X-VERT) was conducted in 1504 patients (oral anticoagulant naive and pre-treated) with \nnon-valvular atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion to compare rivaroxaban with dose-adjusted \nVKA (randomised 2:1), for the prevention of cardiovascular events. TEE- guided (1 - 5 days of pre-\ntreatment) or conventional cardioversion (at least three weeks of pre-treatment) strategies were \nemployed. The primary efficacy outcome (all stroke, transient ischaemic attack, non-CNS systemic \nembolism, myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death) occurred in 5 (0.5%) patients in the \nrivaroxaban group (n = 978) and 5 (1.0%) patients in the VKA group (n = 492; RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.15-\n1.73; modified ITT population). The principal safety outcome (major bleeding) occurred in 6 (0.6%) \nand 4 (0.8%) patients in the rivaroxaban (n = 988) and VKA (n = 499) groups, respectively (RR 0.76; \n\n\n\n69 \n\n95% CI 0.21-2.67; safety population). This exploratory study showed comparable efficacy and safety \nbetween rivaroxaban and VKA treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. \n \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement \nA randomised, open-label, multicentre study (PIONEER AF-PCI) was conducted in 2,124 patients \nwith non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent PCI with stent placement for primary \natherosclerotic disease to compare safety of two rivaroxaban regimens and one VKA regimen. Patients \nwere randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion for an overall 12-month-therapy. Patients with a history of \nstroke or TIA were excluded.  \nGroup 1 received rivaroxaban 15 mg once daily (10 mg once daily in patients with creatinine \nclearance 30 - 49 ml/min) plus P2Y12 inhibitor. Group 2 received rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus \nDAPT (dual antiplatelet therapy i.e. clopidogrel 75 mg [or alternate P2Y12 inhibitor] plus low-dose \nacetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by rivaroxaban 15 mg (or 10 mg for \nsubjects with creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) once daily plus low-dose ASA. Group 3 received \ndose-adjusted VKA plus DAPT for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by dose-adjusted VKA plus low-dose \nASA.  \nThe primary safety endpoint, clinically significant bleeding events, occurred in 109 (15.7%), 117 \n(16.6%), and 167 (24.0%) subjects in group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively (HR 0.59; 95% CI \n0.47-0.76; p<0.001, and HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.50-0.80; p<0.001, respectively). The secondary endpoint \n(composite of cardiovascular events CV death, MI, or stroke) occurred in 41 (5.9%), 36 (5.1%), and \n36 (5.2%) subjects in the group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively. Each of the rivaroxaban \nregimens showed a significant reduction in clinically significant bleeding events compared to the \nVKA regimen in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent a PCI with stent \nplacement. \nThe primary objective of PIONEER AF-PCI was to assess safety. Data on efficacy (including \nthromboembolic events) in this population are limited.  \n \nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the \ninitial and continued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence. \nOver 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein \nDVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice) and additionally a predefined pooled \nanalysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment \nduration in all studies was up to 21 months. \n \nIn Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the \nprevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded \nfrom this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This \nwas followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  \n \nIn Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. \nThis was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  \n \nIn both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of \nenoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until \nthe PT/INR was in therapeutic range (\uf0b3 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist \ndose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. \n \nIn Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had \ncompleted 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism depending on the clinical \njudgment of the investigator. Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo.  \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \nEinstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of \nrecurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality.  \n \nIn Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed 6-12 \nmonths of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal \nsymptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed \nanticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending \non the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily and \nrivaroxaban 10 mg once daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE.  \n \nIn the Einstein DVT study (see Table 6) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 0.680 \n(0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy \noutcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 ((95% CI: 0.47 - 0.95), nominal \np value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban.

There were differences in patient baseline characteristics including age, cancer and \nrenal impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for measured \nbaseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. Adjusted HRs \ncomparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality \nwere 0.77 (95% CI 0.40 - 1.50), 0.91 (95% CI 0.54 - 1.54) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.07), respectively.  \nThese results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this indication. \n \nPaediatric population \nTreatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence in paediatric patients  \nA total of 727 children with confirmed acute VTE, of whom 528 received rivaroxaban, were studied in \n6 open-label, multicentre paediatric studies. Body weight-adjusted dosing in patients from birth to less \nthan 18 years resulted in rivaroxaban exposure similar to that observed in adult DVT patients treated \nwith rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily as confirmed in the phase III study (see section 5.2).  \n \nThe EINSTEIN Junior phase III study was a randomised, active-controlled, open-label multicentre \nclinical study in 500 paediatric patients (aged from birth to < 18 years) with confirmed acute VTE. \n\n\n\n74 \n\nThere were 276 children aged 12 to < 18 years, 101 children aged 6 to < 12 years, 69 children aged \n2 to < 6 years, and 54 children aged < 2 years.  \n \nIndex VTE was classified as either central venous catheter-related VTE (CVC-VTE; 90/335 patients \nin the rivaroxaban group, 37/165 patients in the comparator group), cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis \n(CVST; 74/335 patients in the rivaroxaban group, 43/165 patients in the comparator group), and all \nothers including DVT and PE (non-CVC-VTE; 171/335 patients in the rivaroxaban group, \n84/165 patients in the comparator group). The most common presentation of index thrombosis in \nchildren aged 12 to < 18 years was non-CVC-VTE in 211 (76.4%); in children aged 6 to < 12 years \nand aged 2 to < 6 years was CVST in 48 (47.5%) and 35 (50.7%), respectively; and in children aged \n< 2 years was CVC-VTE in 37 (68.5%). There were no children < 6 months with CVST in the \nrivaroxaban group. 22 of the patients with CVST had a CNS infection (13 patients in the rivaroxaban \ngroup and 9 patients in comparator group). \n \nVTE was provoked by persistent, transient, or both persistent and transient risk factors in 438 (87.6%) \nchildren.  \n \nPatients received initial treatment with therapeutic doses of UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux for at least \n5 days, and were randomised 2:1 to receive either body weight-adjusted doses of rivaroxaban or \ncomparator group (heparins, VKA) for a main study treatment period of 3 months (1 month for \nchildren < 2 years with CVC-VTE). At the end of the main study treatment period, the diagnostic \nimaging test, which was obtained at baseline, was repeated, if clinically feasible. The study treatment \ncould be stopped at this point, or at the discretion of the Investigator continued for up to 12 months \n(for children < 2 years with CVC-VTE up to 3 months) in total. \n \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE. The primary safety outcome was the \ncomposite of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB). All efficacy and \nsafety outcomes were centrally adjudicated by an independent committee blinded for treatment \nallocation. The efficacy and safety results are shown in Tables 11 and 12 below. \n \nRecurrent VTEs occurred in the rivaroxaban group in 4 of 335 patients and in the comparator group in \n5 of 165 patients. The composite of major bleeding and CRNMB was reported in 10 of 329 patients \n(3%) treated with rivaroxaban and in 3 of 162 patients (1.9%) treated with comparator. Net clinical \nbenefit (symptomatic recurrent VTE plus major bleeding events) was reported in the rivaroxaban \ngroup in 4 of 335 patients and in the comparator group in 7 of 165 patients. Normalisation of the \nthrombus burden on repeat imaging occurred in 128 of 335 patients with rivaroxaban treatment and in \n43 of 165 patients in the comparator group. These findings were generally similar among age groups. \nThere were 119 (36.2%) children with any treatment-emergent bleeding in the rivaroxaban group and \n45 (27.8%) children in the comparator group. \n \n\n\n\n75 \n\nTable 11: Efficacy results at the end of the main treatment period  \nEvent Rivaroxaban  \n\nN=335* \nComparator \nN=165* \n\nRecurrent VTE (primary efficacy outcome) 4 \n(1.2%, 95% CI \n0.4% \u2013 3.0%) \n\n5 \n(3.0%, 95% CI \n1.2% - 6.6%) \n\nComposite: Symptomatic recurrent VTE + \nasymptomatic deterioration on repeat imaging \n\n5 \n(1.5%, 95% CI \n0.6% \u2013 3.4%) \n\n6 \n(3.6%, 95% CI \n1.6% \u2013 7.6%) \n\nComposite: Symptomatic recurrent VTE + \nasymptomatic deterioration + no change on repeat \nimaging \n\n21 \n(6.3%, 95% CI \n4.0% \u2013 9.2%) \n\n19 \n(11.5%, 95% CI \n7.3% \u2013 17.4%) \n\nNormalisation on repeat imaging  128 \n(38.2%, 95% CI \n33.0% - 43.5%) \n\n43 \n(26.1%, 95% CI \n19.8% - 33.0%) \n\nComposite: Symptomatic recurrent VTE + major \nbleeding (net clinical benefit) \n\n4 \n(1.2%, 95% CI \n0.4% - 3.0%) \n\n7 \n(4.2%, 95% CI \n2.0% - 8.4%) \n\nFatal or non-fatal pulmonary embolism 1 \n(0.3%, 95% CI \n0.0% \u2013 1.6%) \n\n1 \n(0.6%, 95% CI \n0.0% \u2013 3.1%) \n\n*FAS= full analysis set, all children who were randomised \n\n \nTable 12: Safety results at the end of the main treatment period  \n\n Rivaroxaban  \nN=329* \n\nComparator \nN=162* \n\nComposite: Major bleeding + CRNMB (primary safety \noutcome) \n\n10 \n(3.0%, 95% CI \n1.6% - 5.5%) \n\n3 \n(1.9%, 95% CI \n0.5% - 5.3%) \n\nMajor bleeding 0 \n(0.0%, 95% CI \n0.0% - 1.1%) \n\n2 \n(1.2%, 95% CI \n0.2% - 4.3%) \n\nAny treatment-emergent bleedings 119 (36.2%) 45 (27.8%) \n* SAF= safety analysis set, all children who were randomised and received at least 1 dose of study \n\nmedicinal product.  \n \nThe efficacy and safety profile of rivaroxaban was largely similar between the paediatric VTE \npopulation and the DVT/PE adult population, however, the proportion of subjects with any bleeding \nwas higher in the paediatric VTE population as compared to the DVT/PE adult population. \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicentre study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for \nall 3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies). The study was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of \n120 patients due to an excess of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was \n569 days. 59 patients were randomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine \nclearance (CrCl) < 50 mL/min) and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in \n12% of patients randomised to rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No \nevents were reported in patients randomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) \nof the rivaroxaban group and 2 patients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXarelto in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of thromboembolic events (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThe following information is based on the data obtained in adults.  \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (CRmaxR) appearing 2 - 4 hours after \ntablet intake.  \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or CRmaxR at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose.  \nDue to a reduced extent of absorption an oral bioavailability of 66% was determined for the 20 mg \ntablet under fasting conditions. When rivaroxaban 20 mg tablets are taken together with food increases \nin mean AUC by 39% were observed when compared to tablet intake under fasting conditions, \nindicating almost complete absorption and high oral bioavailability. Rivaroxaban 15 mg and 20 mg are \nto be taken with food (see section 4.2). \nRivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily in fasting state. \nUnder fed conditions rivaroxaban 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg tablets demonstrated dose-proportionality. \nAt higher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and \ndecreased absorption rate with increased dose.  \nVariability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) \nranging from 30% to 40%. \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% \nand 56% decrease in AUC and CRmaxR compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and CRmaxR) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren received rivaroxaban tablet or oral suspension during or closely after feeding or food intake \nand with a typical serving of liquid to ensure reliable dosing in children. As in adults, rivaroxaban is \nreadily absorbed after oral administration as tablet or granules for oral suspension formulation in \nchildren. No difference in the absorption rate nor in the extent of absorption between the tablet and \ngranules for oral suspension formulation was observed. No PK data following intravenous \nadministration to children are available so that the absolute bioavailability of rivaroxaban in children is \nunknown. A decrease in the relative bioavailability for increasing doses (in mg/kg bodyweight) was \nfound, suggesting absorption limitations for higher doses, even when taken together with food. \nRivaroxaban 15 mg tablets should be taken with feeding or with food (see section 4.2).  \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in adults is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being the \nmain binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with VRssR being approximately \n50 litres. \n \n\n\n\n77 \n\nPaediatric population \nNo data on rivaroxaban plasma protein binding specific to children is available. No PK data following \nintravenous administration of rivaroxaban to children is available. VRssR estimated via population PK \nmodelling in children (age range 0 to < 18 years) following oral administration of rivaroxaban is \ndependent on body weight and can be described with an allometric function, with an average of 113 L \nfor a subject with a body weight of 82.8 kg. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination  \nIn adults, of the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, \nwith half then being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 \nof the administered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, \nmainly via active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo metabolism data specific to children is available. No PK data following intravenous administration \nof rivaroxaban to children is available. CL estimated via population PK modelling in children (age \nrange 0 to < 18 years) following oral administration of rivaroxaban is dependent on body weight and \ncan be described with an allometric function, with an average of 8 L/h for a subject with body weight \nof 82.8 kg. The geometric mean values for disposition half-lives (tR1/2R) estimated via population PK \nmodelling decrease with decreasing age and ranged from 4.2 h in adolescents to approximately 3 h in \nchildren aged 2-12 years down to 1.9 and 1.6 h in children aged 0.5-< 2 years and less than 0.5 years, \nrespectively. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender \nIn adults, there were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics \nbetween male and female patients. An exploratory analysis did not reveal relevant differences in \nrivaroxaban exposure between male and female children. \n \nElderly population \nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nIn adults, extremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary.  \nIn children, rivaroxaban is dosed based on body weight. An exploratory analysis did not reveal a \nrelevant impact of underweight or obesity on rivaroxaban exposure in children. \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nIn adults, no clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, \nHispanic, Japanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics.  \nAn exploratory analysis did not reveal relevant inter-ethnic differences in rivaroxaban exposure among \nJapanese, Chinese or Asian children outside Japan and China compared to the respective overall \npaediatric population. \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic adult patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only \nminor changes in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), \nnearly comparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3 fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  \nRivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsection 4.3). \nNo clinical data is available in children with hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn adults, there was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as \nassessed via creatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance \n50 - 80 ml/min), moderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance \n15 - 29 ml/min) renal impairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 \nand 1.6 fold respectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more \npronounced. In individuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of \nfactor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy \nvolunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. \nThere are no data in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban is to be used \nwith caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \nNo clinical data is available in children 1 year or older with moderate or severe renal impairment \n(glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min/1.73 mP\n\n2\nP). \n\n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of acute DVT 20 mg once daily the geometric mean \nconcentration (90% prediction interval) 2 - 4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing \nmaximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 215 (22 - 535) and \n32 (6 - 239) mcg/l, respectively. \n \nIn paediatric patients with acute VTE receiving body weight-adjusted rivaroxaban leading to an \nexposure similar to that in adult DVT patients receiving a 20 mg once daily dose, the geometric mean \nconcentrations (90% interval) at sampling time intervals roughly representing maximum and minimum \nconcentrations during the dose interval are summarised in Table 13.  \n \n\n\n\n79 \n\nTable 13: Summary statistics (geometric mean (90% interval)) of rivaroxaban steady state \nplasma concentrations (mcg/L) by dosing regimen and age \n\nTime \nintervals \n\n        \n\no.d.

The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an ERmaxR model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects.  \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety and efficacy have not been established in the indication prevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation for children and adolescents up to 18 years.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-\nnatal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \nRivaroxaban was tested in juvenile rats up to 3-month treatment duration starting at postnatal day 4 \nshowing a non dose-related increase in periinsular haemorrhage. No evidence of target organ-specific \ntoxicity was seen.  \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAdults \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with \none or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age \u2265 75 years, diabetes \nmellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack.  \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) \n \nPaediatric population  \nTreatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of VTE recurrence in children and \nadolescents aged less than 18 years and weighing more than 50 kg after at least 5 days of initial \nparenteral anticoagulation treatment. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adults \nThe recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, which is also the recommended maximum dose.  \n \nTherapy with Xarelto should be continued long term provided the benefit of prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism outweighs the risk of bleeding (see section 4.4).  \n \nIf a dose is missed the patient should take Xarelto immediately and continue on the following day with \nthe once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be doubled within the same day to make \nup for a missed dose.  \n \n\n\n\n83 \n\nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults \nThe recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first \nthree weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE.  \n \nShort duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE \nprovoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of \ntherapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk \nfactors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE.   \n \nWhen extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least \n6 months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom \nthe risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or \nwho have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Xarelto 10 mg once daily, a \ndose of Xarelto 20 mg once daily should be considered. \n \nThe duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the \ntreatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).  \n \n\n Time period Dosing schedule Total daily dose \n\nTreatment and \nprevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nDay 1 - 21 15 mg twice daily  30 mg \n\nDay 22 onwards 20 mg once daily  20 mg \n\nPrevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE  \n\nFollowing completion \nof at least 6 months \ntherapy for DVT or PE \n\n10 mg once daily or  \n20 mg once daily  \n\n10 mg  \nor 20 mg \n\n \nTo support the dose switch from 15 mg to 20 mg after Day 21 a first 4 weeks treatment initiation pack \nof Xarelto for treatment of DVT/PE is available. \n \nIf a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1 - 21), the patient should take \nXarelto immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg Xarelto per day. In this case two 15 mg tablets may be \ntaken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice daily intake as recommended \non the following day.  \n \nIf a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Xarelto immediately, \nand continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be \ndoubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.  \n \nTreatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence in children and adolescents  \nXarelto treatment in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years should be initiated following at \nleast 5 days of initial parenteral anticoagulation treatment (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe dose for children and adolescent is calculated based on body weight.  \n- Body weight of 50 kg or more: \n\na once daily dose of 20 mg rivaroxaban is recommended. This is the maximum daily dose.  \n- Body weight from 30 to 50 kg: \n\na once daily dose of 15 mg rivaroxaban is recommended. This is the maximum daily dose.  \n- For patients with body weight less 30 kg refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of \n\nXarelto granules for oral suspension.  \n \nThe weight of a child should be monitored and the dose reviewed regularly. This is to ensure a \ntherapeutic dose is maintained. Dose adjustments should be made based on changes in body weight \nonly. \n \n\n\n\n84 \n\nTreatment should be continued for at least 3 months in children and adolescents. Treatment can be \nextended up to 12 months when clinically necessary. There is no data available in children to support a \ndose reduction after 6 months treatment. The benefit-risk of continued therapy after 3 months should \nbe assessed on an individual basis taking into account the risk for recurrent thrombosis versus the \npotential bleeding risk.  \n \nIf a dose is missed, the missed dose should be taken as soon as possible after it is noticed, but only on \nthe same day. If this is not possible, the patient should skip the dose and continue with the next dose as \nprescribed. The patient should not take two doses to make up for a missed dose. \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Xarelto \n- Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism:  \n\nVKA treatment should be stopped and Xarelto therapy should be initiated when the \nInternational Normalised Ratio (INR) is \u2264 3.0.  \n\n- Treatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence in adults and treatment of VTE and \nprevention of recurrence in paediatric patients:  \nVKA treatment should be stopped and Xarelto therapy should be initiated once the INR is \u2264 2.5.  \n\nWhen converting patients from VKAs to Xarelto, INR values will be falsely elevated after the intake \nof Xarelto. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity of Xarelto, and therefore should \nnot be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Xarelto to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that Xarelto can contribute to an elevated INR.  \nIn patients converting from Xarelto to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is \u2265 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Xarelto and VKA the \nINR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \nXarelto. Once Xarelto is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least 24 hours after the last \ndose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric patients:  \nChildren who convert from Xarelto to VKA need to continue Xarelto for 48 hours after the first dose \nof VKA. After 2 days of co-administration an INR should be obtained prior to the next scheduled dose \nof Xarelto. Co-administration of Xarelto and VKA is advised to continue until the INR is \u2265 2.0. Once \nXarelto is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably 24 hours after the last dose (see above and \nsection 4.5). \n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to Xarelto \nFor adult and paediatric patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the \nparenteral anticoagulant and start Xarelto 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled \nadministration of the parenteral medicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due \nor at the time of discontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. \nintravenous unfractionated heparin). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to parenteral anticoagulants \nDiscontinue Xarelto and give the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next Xarelto \ndose would be taken.  \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nAdults: \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Xarelto is to be \nused with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance \n< 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \nIn patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance \n15 - 29 ml/min) renal impairment the following dose recommendations apply: \n \n- For the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial \n\nfibrillation, the recommended dose is 15 mg once daily (see section 5.2). \n \n\n- For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE: patients \nshould be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks. Thereafter, when the \nrecommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose from 20 mg once daily to 15 mg \nonce daily should be considered if the patient\u2019s assessed risk for bleeding outweighs the risk for \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of 15 mg is based on PK modelling and \nhas not been studied in this clinical setting (see sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  \nWhen the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended \ndose is necessary.  \n \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n50 - 80 ml/min) (see section 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population:  \n- Children and adolescents with mild renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n50 - 80 mL/min/1.73 mP\n\n2\nP): no dose adjustment is required, based on data in adults and limited \n\ndata in paediatric patients (see section 5.2). \n- Children and adolescents with moderate or severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n< 50 mL/min/1.73 mP\n\n2\nP): Xarelto is not recommended as no clinical data is available (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \nNo clinical data is available in children with hepatic impairment.  \n \nElderly population  \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment for adults (see section 5.2) \nFor paediatric patients the dose is determined based on body weight.  \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nXarelto can be initiated or continued in patients who may require cardioversion.  \nFor transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) guided cardioversion in patients not previously treated \nwith anticoagulants, Xarelto treatment should be started at least 4 hours before cardioversion to ensure \nadequate anticoagulation (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). For all patients, confirmation should be sought \nprior to cardioversion that the patient has taken Xarelto as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and \nduration of treatment should take established guideline recommendations for anticoagulant treatment \nin patients undergoing cardioversion into account. \n \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) \nwith stent placement \nThere is limited experience of a reduced dose of 15 mg Xarelto once daily (or 10 mg Xarelto once \ndaily for patients with moderate renal impairment [creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min]) in addition to \na P2Y12 inhibitor for a maximum of 12 months in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who \nrequire oral anticoagulation and undergo PCI with stent placement (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Xarelto in children aged 0 to < 18 years have not been established in the \nindication prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. \nNo data are available. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age in \nindications other than the treatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence.  \n \nMethod of administration  \nAdults \nXarelto is for oral use.  \nThe tablets are to be taken with food (see section 5.2). \n \nCrushing of tablets \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Xarelto tablet may be crushed and mixed with \nwater or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally. After the administration of \ncrushed Xarelto 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should be immediately followed by \nfood. \nThe crushed tablet may also be given through gastric tubes (see sections 5.2 and 6.6). \n \nChildren and adolescents weighing more than 50 kg \nXarelto is for oral use.  \n49TThe patient should be advised to 49Tswallow the tablet with liquid. It should also be taken with food (see \nsection 5.2). The tablets should be taken approximately 24 hours apart.  \n \nIn case the patient immediately spits up the dose or vomits within 30 minutes after receiving the dose, \na new dose should be given. However, if the patient vomits more than 30 minutes after the dose, the \ndose should not be re-administered and the next dose should be taken as scheduled. \n \nThe tablet must not be split in an attempt to provide a fraction of a tablet dose.  \n \nCrushing of tablets \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Xarelto granules for oral suspension should be \nused. If the oral suspension is not immediately available, when doses of 15 mg or 20 mg rivaroxaban \nare prescribed, these could be provided by crushing the 15 mg or 20 mg tablet and mixing it with \nwater or apple puree immediately prior to use and administering orally.  \nThe crushed tablet may be given through a nasogastric or gastric feeding tube (see sections 5.2 \nand 6.6).  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n87 \n\nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \nHaemorrhagic risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Xarelto are to be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. \nIt is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. Xarelto \nadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see section 4.9). \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate \nclinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult \nbleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are \nto be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after \ninitiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is limited data in children with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis who have a CNS infection \n(see section 5.1). The risk of bleeding should be carefully evaluated before and during therapy with \nrivaroxaban. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma \nlevels may be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding \nrisk. Xarelto is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min. Use is not \nrecommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nXarelto should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment concomitantly receiving other \nmedicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (see section 4.5). \nXarelto is not recommended in children and adolescents with moderate or severe renal impairment \n(glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min/1.73 mP\n\n2\nP), as no clinical data is available.  \n\n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \nThe use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with \nazole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) or HIV \nprotease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and \nP-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant degree \n(2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. No clinical data is available in \nchildren receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp \n(see section 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid and \n\n\n\n88 \n\nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5).  \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n\uf0b7 congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n\uf0b7 uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n\uf0b7 other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n\uf0b7 vascular retinopathy \n\uf0b7 bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \nPatients with prosthetic valves \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been studied \nin patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that Xarelto provides \nadequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Xarelto is not recommended for \nthese patients. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates \nof recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement \nClinical data are available from an interventional study with the primary objective to assess safety in \npatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement. Data on efficacy \nin this population are limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). No data are available for such patients with a \nhistory of stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA). \n \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \nXarelto is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary \nembolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in these clinical \nsituations.  \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical \nexperience with the use of 20 mg rivaroxaban in these situations.  \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \n\n\n\n89 \n\nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low. However, the exact timing to reach a \nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known and should be weighed against the \nurgency of a diagnostic procedure. \nFor the removal of an epidural catheter and based on the general PK characteristics at least 2x half-\nlife, i.e. at least 18 hours in young adult patients and 26 hours in elderly patients should elapse after \nthe last administration of rivaroxaban (see section 5.2). Following removal of the catheter, at least \n6 hours should elapse before the next rivaroxaban dose is administered. \nIf traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. \nNo data is available on the timing of the placement or removal of neuraxial catheter in children while \non Xarelto. In such cases, discontinue rivaroxaban and consider a short acting parenteral \nanticoagulant. \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention  \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Xarelto 20 mg should be stopped at least \n24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the physician.  \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \nXarelto should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention \nprovided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as determined by \nthe treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nDermatological reactions \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \nXarelto contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say \nessentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe extent of interactions in the paediatric population is not known. The below mentioned interaction \ndata was obtained in adults and the warnings in section 4.4 should be taken into account for the \npaediatric population. \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban CRmaxR, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4).  \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \n\n\n\n90 \n\nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in \nCRmaxR. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and CRmaxR. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRRmaxR when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRRmaxR when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean CRmaxR. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-\nrisk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \nAnticoagulants \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response.  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-\nmajor clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-\nfactor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the \n\n\n\n91 \n\nfourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity \nand ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the CRtroughR of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers  \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \n \nLaboratory parameters \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the intrinsic \nrisk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Xarelto is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3).  \nWomen of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from animals \nindicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Xarelto is contraindicated during breast-\nfeeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from therapy.  \n \nFertility \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXarelto has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like syncope \n(frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see section 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies in adults including \n53,103 patients exposed to rivaroxaban and in two phase II and one phase III paediatric studies \nincluding 412 patients. See phase III studies as listed in table 1. \n \n\n\n\n92 \n\nTable 1: Number of patients studied, total daily dose and maximum treatment duration in adult \nand paediatric phase III studies \n\nIndication Number of \npatients* \n\nTotal daily dose Maximum \ntreatment \nduration \n\nPrevention of venous \nthromboembolism (VTE) in adult \npatients undergoing elective hip or \nknee replacement surgery \n\n6,097 10 mg 39 days \n\nPrevention of VTE in medically ill \npatients \n\n3,997 10 mg 39 days \n\nTreatment of DVT, PE and \nprevention of recurrence \n\n6,790 Day 1 - 21: 30 mg \nDay 22 and \nonwards: 20 mg \nAfter at least 6 \nmonths: 10 mg or \n20 mg \n\n21 months \n\nTreatment of VTE and prevention of \nVTE recurrence in term neonates \nand children aged less than 18 years \nfollowing initiation of standard \nanticoagulation treatment \n\n329 Body weight-\nadjusted dose to \nachieve a similar \nexposure as that \nobserved in adults \ntreated for DVT \nwith 20 mg \nrivaroxaban once \ndaily \n\n12 months \n\nPrevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism in patients with non-\nvalvular atrial fibrillation \n\n7,750 20 mg 41 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic \nevents in patients after an acute \ncoronary syndrome (ACS) \n\n10,225 5 mg or 10 mg \nrespectively, co-\nadministered with \neither ASA or ASA \nplus clopidogrel or \nticlopidine \n\n31 months \n\nPrevention of atherothrombotic \nevents in patients with CAD/PAD \n\n18,244 5 mg co-\nadministered with \nASA or 10 mg \nalone \n\n47 months \n\n* Patients exposed to at least one dose of rivaroxaban \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients receiving rivaroxaban were bleedings (see \nsection 4.4. and \u2018Description of selected adverse reactions\u2019 below) (Table 2).

As incidence of \nadverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS \nstudy data were not included for frequency calculation in this table. \n\n \n\n\n\n96 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Xarelto may be associated with an increased \nrisk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post haemorrhagic \nanaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary according to the \nlocation and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 \u201cManagement of \nbleeding\u201d). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito \nurinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more \nfrequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to \nadequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to \ndetect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be \nappropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with \nuncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see \nsection 4.4 \u201cHaemorrhagic risk\u201d). Menstrual bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. \nHaemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained \nswelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of \ncardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris have been observed.  \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for Xarelto. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to \nbe considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety assessment in children and adolescents is based on the safety data from two phase II and \none phase III open-label active controlled studies in paediatric patients aged birth to less than 18 years. \nThe safety findings were generally similar between rivaroxaban and comparator in the various \npaediatric age groups. Overall, the safety profile in the 412 children and adolescents treated with \nrivaroxaban was similar to that observed in the adult population and consistent across age subgroups, \nalthough assessment is limited by the small number of patients.  \nIn paediatric patients, headache (very common, 16.7%), fever (very common, 11.7%), epistaxis (very \ncommon, 11.2%), vomiting (very common, 10.7%), tachycardia (common, 1.5%), increase in bilirubin \n(common, 1.5%) and bilirubin conjugated increased (uncommon, 0.7%) were reported more \nfrequently as compared to adults. Consistent with adult population, menorrhagia was observed in 6.6% \n(common) of female adolescents after menarche. Thrombocytopenia as observed in the post-marketing \nexperience in adult population was common (4.6%) in paediatric clinical studies. The adverse drug \nreactions in paediatric patients were primarily mild to moderate in severity. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn adults, rare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or \nother adverse reactions. There is limited data available in children. Due to limited absorption a ceiling \neffect with no further increase in average plasma exposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of \n50 mg rivaroxaban or above in adults, however, no data is available at supratherapeutic doses in \nchildren. \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable for adults, but not established in children (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of \nandexanet alfa). \nThe use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours in adults. The half life in children estimated using population \n\n\n\n97 \n\npharmacokinetic (popPK) modelling approaches is shorter (see section 5.2). Management should be \nindividualised according to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic \ntreatment could be used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical \nhaemostasis with bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood \nproducts (packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) \nor platelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific \nfactor Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), \nshould be considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in adults and in children receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also \nbased on limited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and \ntitrated depending on improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a \ncoagulation expert should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in adults receiving rivaroxaban. There is no experience on the use of these agents in children \nreceiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor experience with the use of \nthe systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma \nprotein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  \n \nMechanism of action \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant.  \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence, the 5/95 \npercentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of maximum effect) for \n15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily ranged from 17 to 32 s and for 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily from 15 \nto 30 s. At trough (8 - 16 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles for 15 mg twice daily ranged from \n14 to 24 s and for 20 mg once daily (18 - 30 h after tablet intake) from 13 to 20 s. \nIn patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 1 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the \ntime of maximum effect) in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 14 to 40 s and in \npatients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 10 to 50 s. At trough \n(16 - 36 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged \nfrom 12 to 26 s and in patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 12 \nto 26 s. \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \n\n\n\n98 \n\nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-\nfactor Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nPT (neoplastin reagent), aPTT, and anti-Xa assay (with a calibrated quantitative test) display a close \ncorrelation to plasma concentrations in children. The correlation between anti-Xa to plasma \nconcentrations is linear with a slope close to 1. Individual discrepancies with higher or lower anti-Xa \nvalues as compared to the corresponding plasma concentrations may occur. There is no need for \nroutine monitoring of coagulation parameters during clinical treatment with rivaroxaban. However, if \nclinically indicated, rivaroxaban concentrations can be measured by calibrated quantitative \nanti-Factor Xa tests in mcg/L (see table 13 in section 5.2 for ranges of observed rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations in children). The lower limit of quantifications must be considered when the anti-Xa \ntest is used to quantify plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban in children. No threshold for efficacy or \nsafety events has been established. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nPrevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban for the \nprevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.  \nIn the pivotal double-blind ROCKET AF study, 14,264 patients were assigned either to rivaroxaban \n20 mg once daily (15 mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) or to \nwarfarin titrated to a target INR of 2.5 (therapeutic range 2.0 to 3.0). The median time on treatment \nwas 19 months and overall treatment duration was up to 41 months.  \n34.9% of patients were treated with acetylsalicylic acid and 11.4% were treated with class III \nantiarrhythmic including amiodarone.  \n \nRivaroxaban was non-inferior to warfarin for the primary composite endpoint of stroke and non-CNS \nsystemic embolism. In the per-protocol population on treatment, stroke or systemic embolism occurred \nin 188 patients on rivaroxaban (1.71% per year) and 241 on warfarin (2.16% per year) (HR 0.79; \n95% CI, 0.66 - 0.96; P<0.001 for non-inferiority). Among all randomised patients analysed according \nto ITT, primary events occurred in 269 on rivaroxaban (2.12% per year) and 306 on warfarin (2.42% \nper year) (HR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74 - 1.03; P<0.001 for non-inferiority; P=0.117 for superiority). Results \nfor secondary endpoints as tested in hierarchical order in the ITT analysis are displayed in Table 4. \nAmong patients in the warfarin group, INR values were within the therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0) a \nmean of 55% of the time (median, 58%; interquartile range, 43 to 71). The effect of rivaroxaban did \nnot differ across the level of centre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized \nquartiles (P=0.74 for interaction). Within the highest quartile according to centre, the Hazard Ratio \n(HR) with rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.49 - 1.12). \nThe incidence rates for the principal safety outcome (major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding \nevents) were similar for both treatment groups (see Table 5). \n \n\n\n\n99 \n\nTable 4: Efficacy results from phase III ROCKET AF \n\nStudy population \nITT analyses of efficacy in patients with non-valvular atrial \nfibrillation \n\nTreatment dose \n\nRivaroxaban \n20 mg once daily  \n(15 mg once daily in \npatients with moderate \nrenal impairment) \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nWarfarin \ntitrated to a target \nINR of 2.5 (therapeutic \nrange 2.0 to 3.0) \n \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nHR (95% CI) \np-value, test for \nsuperiority \n\nStroke and non-CNS \nsystemic embolism \n\n269 \n(2.12) \n\n306 \n(2.42) \n\n0.88 (0.74 - 1.03) \n0.117 \n\nStroke, non-CNS systemic \nembolism and vascular \ndeath \n\n572 \n(4.51) \n\n609 \n(4.81) \n\n0.94 (0.84 - 1.05) \n0.265 \n\nStroke, non-CNS systemic \nembolism, vascular death \nand myocardial infarction \n\n659 \n(5.24) \n\n709 \n(5.65) \n\n0.93 (0.83 - 1.03) \n0.158 \n\nStroke \n253  \n(1.99) \n\n281 \n(2.22) \n\n0.90 (0.76 - 1.07) \n0.221 \n\nNon-CNS systemic \nembolism \n\n20  \n(0.16) \n\n27 \n(0.21) \n\n0.74 (0.42 - 1.32) \n0.308 \n\nMyocardial infarction \n130 \n (1.02) \n\n142 \n(1.11) \n\n0.91 (0.72 - 1.16)  \n0.464 \n\n \n\n\n\n100 \n\nTable 5: Safety results from phase III ROCKET AF \nStudy population Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillationP\n\na) \n\nTreatment dose  \n\nRivaroxaban \n20 mg once daily  \n(15 mg once daily in \npatients with moderate \nrenal impairment) \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nWarfarin \ntitrated to a target INR \nof 2.5 (therapeutic \nrange 2.0 to 3.0) \n \nEvent rate (100 pt-yr) \n\nHR (95% CI) \np-value  \n\nMajor and non-major \nclinically relevant bleeding \nevents \n\n1,475 \n(14.91) \n\n1,449 \n(14.52) \n\n1.03 (0.96 - 1.11) \n0.442 \n\nMajor bleeding events \n395 \n(3.60) \n\n386 \n(3.45) \n\n1.04 (0.90 - 1.20) \n0.576 \n\nDeath due to \n\nbleeding* \n\n27 \n(0.24) \n\n55 \n(0.48) \n\n0.50 (0.31 - 0.79) \n0.003 \n\nCritical organ \n\nbleeding* \n\n91 \n(0.82) \n\n133 \n(1.18) \n\n0.69 (0.53 - 0.91) \n0.007 \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage* \n\n55  \n(0.49) \n\n84 \n(0.74) \n\n0.67 (0.47 - 0.93) \n0.019 \n\nHaemoglobin drop* \n305 \n(2.77) \n\n254 \n(2.26) \n\n1.22 (1.03 - 1.44) \n0.019 \n\nTransfusion of 2 or \nmore units of packed \nred blood cells or \nwhole blood* \n\n183 \n(1.65) \n\n149 \n(1.32) \n\n1.25 (1.01 - 1.55) \n0.044 \n\nNon-major clinically \nrelevant bleeding events \n\n1,185 \n(11.80) \n\n1,151 \n(11.37) \n\n1.04 (0.96 - 1.13) \n0.345 \n\nAll-cause mortality \n208 \n(1.87) \n\n250 \n(2.21) \n\n0.85 (0.70 - 1.02) \n0.073 \n\na) Safety population, on treatment \n* Nominally significant \n\n \nIn addition to the phase III ROCKET AF study, a prospective, single-arm, post-authorisation, non-\ninterventional, open-label cohort study (XANTUS) with central outcome adjudication including \nthromboembolic events and major bleeding has been conducted. 6,785 patients with non-valvular \natrial fibrillation were enrolled for prevention of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) \nsystemic embolism in clinical practice. The mean CHADSR2R and HAS-BLED scores were both 2.0 in \nXANTUS, compared to a mean CHADSR2R and HAS-BLED score of 3.5 and 2.8 in ROCKET AF, \nrespectively. Major bleeding occurred in 2.1 per 100 patient years. Fatal haemorrhage was reported in \n0.2 per 100 patient years and intracranial haemorrhage in 0.4 per 100 patient years. Stroke or non-CNS \nsystemic embolism was recorded in 0.8 per 100 patient years.  \nThese observations in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this \nindication. \n \nPatients undergoing cardioversion \nA prospective, randomised, open-label, multicentre, exploratory study with blinded endpoint \nevaluation (X-VERT) was conducted in 1504 patients (oral anticoagulant naive and pre-treated) with \nnon-valvular atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion to compare rivaroxaban with dose-adjusted \nVKA (randomised 2:1), for the prevention of cardiovascular events. TEE- guided (1 - 5 days of pre-\ntreatment) or conventional cardioversion (at least three weeks of pre-treatment) strategies were \nemployed. The primary efficacy outcome (all stroke, transient ischaemic attack, non-CNS systemic \nembolism, myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death) occurred in 5 (0.5%) patients in the \nrivaroxaban group (n = 978) and 5 (1.0%) patients in the VKA group (n = 492; RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.15-\n1.73; modified ITT population). The principal safety outcome (major bleeding) occurred in 6 (0.6%) \nand 4 (0.8%) patients in the rivaroxaban (n = 988) and VKA (n = 499) groups, respectively (RR 0.76; \n\n\n\n101 \n\n95 % CI 0.21-2.67; safety population). This exploratory study showed comparable efficacy and safety \nbetween rivaroxaban and VKA treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. \n \nPatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI with stent placement \nA randomised, open-label, multicentre study (PIONEER AF-PCI) was conducted in 2,124 patients \nwith non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent PCI with stent placement for primary \natherosclerotic disease to compare safety of two rivaroxaban regimens and one VKA regimen. Patients \nwere randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion for an overall 12-month-therapy. Patients with a history of \nstroke or TIA were excluded.  \nGroup 1 received rivaroxaban 15 mg once daily (10 mg once daily in patients with creatinine \nclearance 30 - 49 ml/min) plus P2Y12 inhibitor. Group 2 received rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus \nDAPT (dual antiplatelet therapy i.e. clopidogrel 75 mg [or alternate P2Y12 inhibitor] plus low-dose \nacetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by rivaroxaban 15 mg (or 10 mg for \nsubjects with creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) once daily plus low-dose ASA. Group 3 received \ndose-adjusted VKA plus DAPT for 1, 6 or 12 months followed by dose-adjusted VKA plus low-dose \nASA.  \nThe primary safety endpoint, clinically significant bleeding events, occurred in 109 (15.7%), 117 \n(16.6%), and 167 (24.0%) subjects in group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively (HR 0.59; 95% CI \n0.47-0.76; p<0.001, and HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.50-0.80; p<0.001, respectively). The secondary endpoint \n(composite of cardiovascular events CV death, MI, or stroke) occurred in 41 (5.9%), 36 (5.1%), and \n36 (5.2%) subjects in the group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively. Each of the rivaroxaban \nregimens showed a significant reduction in clinically significant bleeding events compared to the \nVKA regimen in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who underwent a PCI with stent \nplacement. \nThe primary objective of PIONEER AF-PCI was to assess safety. Data on efficacy (including \nthromboembolic events) in this population are limited. \n \nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the \ninitial and continued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence. \nOver 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein \nDVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice) and additionally a predefined pooled \nanalysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment \nduration in all studies was up to 21 months. \n \nIn Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the \nprevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded \nfrom this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This \nwas followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  \n \nIn Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. \nThis was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily. \n \nIn both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of \nenoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until \nthe PT/INR was in therapeutic range (\uf0b3 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist \ndose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. \n \nIn Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had \ncompleted 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism depending on the clinical \njudgment of the investigator. Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo.  \n\n\n\n102 \n\nEinstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of \nrecurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality.  \nIn Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed 6-\n12 months of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal \nsymptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed \nanticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending \non the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily and \nRivaroxaban 10 mg once daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily.  \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE.  \n \nIn the Einstein DVT study (see Table 6) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 0.680 \n(0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy \noutcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 ((95% CI: 0.47 - 0.95), nominal \np value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within the therapeutic range a mean of \n60.3% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and 55.4%, 60.1%, and 62.8% of the \ntime in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration groups, respectively. In the \nenoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of mean centre TTR (Time in \nTarget INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the incidence of the recurrent VTE \n(P=0.932 for interaction). Within the highest tertile according to centre, the HR with rivaroxaban \nversus warfarin was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35 - 1.35). \n \nThe incidence rates for the primary safety outcome (major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding \nevents) as well as the secondary safety outcome (major bleeding events) were similar for both \ntreatment groups. \n \nTable 6: Efficacy and safety results from phase III Einstein DVT \n\nStudy population \n3,449 patients with symptomatic acute deep vein \nthrombosis \n\nTreatment dose and duration \nRivaroxaban P\n\na) \n\n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,731 \n\nEnoxaparin/VKAP\n\nb) \n3, 6 or 12 months \nN=1,718 \n\nSymptomatic recurrent VTE* \n36 \n(2.1%) \n\n51 \n(3.0%) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent PE \n20 \n(1.2%) \n\n18 \n(1.0%) \n\nSymptomatic recurrent \nDVT \n\n14 \n(0.8%) \n\n28 \n(1.6%) \n\nSymptomatic PE and DVT \n1 \n(0.1%) \n\n0 \n\nFatal PE/death where PE \ncannot be ruled out \n\n4 \n(0.2%) \n\n6 \n(0.3%) \n\nMajor or clinically relevant non-\nmajor bleeding \n\n139 \n(8.1%) \n\n138 \n(8.1%) \n\nMajor bleeding events \n14 \n(0.8%) \n\n20 \n(1.2%) \n\na) Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily \nb) Enoxaparin for at least 5 days, overlapped with and followed by VKA \n\n* p < 0.0001 (non-inferiority to a prespecified HR of 2.0); HR: 0.680 (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 \n(superiority) \n\n \n\n\n\n103 \n\nIn the Einstein PE study (see Table 7) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p=0.0026 (test for non-inferiority); HR: 1.123 \n(0.749 - 1.684)). The prespecified net clinical benefit (primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding \nevents) was reported with a HR of 0.849 ((95% CI: 0.633 - 1.139), nominal p value p= 0.275).

There were differences in patient baseline characteristics including age, cancer and \nrenal impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for measured \nbaseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. Adjusted HRs \ncomparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality \nwere 0.77 (95% CI 0.40 - 1.50), 0.91 (95% CI 0.54 - 1.54) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.07), respectively.  \nThese results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this indication. \n \nPaediatric population \nTreatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence in paediatric patients  \nA total of 727 children with confirmed acute VTE, of whom 528 received rivaroxaban, were studied in \n6 open-label, multicentre paediatric studies. Body weight-adjusted dosing in patients from birth to less \nthan 18 years resulted in rivaroxaban exposure similar to that observed in adult DVT patients treated \nwith rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily as confirmed in the phase III study (see section 5.2).  \n \nThe EINSTEIN Junior phase III study was a randomised, active-controlled, open-label multicentre \nclinical study in 500 paediatric patients (aged from birth to < 18 years) with confirmed acute VTE. \n\n\n\n106 \n\nThere were 276 children aged 12 to < 18 years, 101 children aged 6 to < 12 years, 69 children aged 2 \nto < 6 years, and 54 children aged < 2 years.  \n \nIndex VTE was classified as either central venous catheter-related VTE (CVC-VTE; 90/335 patients \nin the rivaroxaban group, 37/165 patients in the comparator group), cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis \n(CVST; 74/335 patients in the rivaroxaban group, 43/165 patients in the comparator group), and all \nothers including DVT and PE (non-CVC-VTE; 171/335 patients in the rivaroxaban group, \n84/165 patients in the comparator group). The most common presentation of index thrombosis in \nchildren aged 12 to < 18 years was non-CVC-VTE in 211 (76.4%); in children aged 6 to < 12 years \nand aged 2 to < 6 years was CVST in 48 (47.5%) and 35 (50.7%), respectively; and in children aged \n< 2 years was CVC-VTE in 37 (68.5%). There were no children < 6 months with CVST in the \nrivaroxaban group. 22 of the patients with CVST had a CNS infection (13 patients in the rivaroxaban \ngroup and 9 patients in comparator group). \n \nVTE was provoked by persistent, transient, or both persistent and transient risk factors in 438 (87.6%) \nchildren.  \n \nPatients received initial treatment with therapeutic doses of UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux for at least \n5 days, and were randomised 2:1 to receive either body weight-adjusted doses of rivaroxaban or \ncomparator group (heparins, VKA) for a main study treatment period of 3 months (1 month for \nchildren < 2 years with CVC-VTE). At the end of the main study treatment period, the diagnostic \nimaging test, which was obtained at baseline, was repeated, if clinically feasible. The study treatment \ncould be stopped at this point, or at the discretion of the Investigator continued for up to 12 months \n(for children <2 years with CVC-VTE up to 3 months) in total. \n \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE. The primary safety outcome was the \ncomposite of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB). All efficacy and \nsafety outcomes were centrally adjudicated by an independent committee blinded for treatment \nallocation. The efficacy and safety results are shown in Tables 11 and 12 below. \n \nRecurrent VTEs occurred in the rivaroxaban group in 4 of 335 patients and in the comparator group in \n5 of 165 patients. The composite of major bleeding and CRNMB was reported in 10 of 329 patients \n(3%) treated with rivaroxaban and in 3 of 162 patients (1.9%) treated with comparator. Net clinical \nbenefit (symptomatic recurrent VTE plus major bleeding events) was reported in the rivaroxaban \ngroup in 4 of 335 patients and in the comparator group in 7 of 165 patients. Normalisation of the \nthrombus burden on repeat imaging occurred in 128 of 335 patients with rivaroxaban treatment and in \n43 of 165 patients in the comparator group. These findings were generally similar among age groups. \nThere were 119 (36.2%) children with any treatment-emergent bleeding in the rivaroxaban group and \n45 (27.8%) children in the comparator group. \n \n \n\n\n\n107 \n\nTable 11: Efficacy results at the end of the main treatment period  \nEvent Rivaroxaban  \n\nN=335* \nComparator \nN=165* \n\nRecurrent VTE (primary efficacy outcome) 4 \n(1.2%, 95% CI \n0.4% \u2013 3.0%) \n\n5 \n(3.0%, 95% CI \n1.2% - 6.6%) \n\nComposite: Symptomatic recurrent VTE + \nasymptomatic deterioration on repeat imaging \n\n5 \n(1.5%, 95% CI \n0.6% \u2013 3.4%) \n\n6 \n(3.6%, 95% CI \n1.6% \u2013 7.6%) \n\nComposite: Symptomatic recurrent VTE + \nasymptomatic deterioration + no change on repeat \nimaging \n\n21 \n(6.3%, 95% CI \n4.0% \u2013 9.2%) \n\n19 \n(11.5%, 95% CI \n7.3% \u2013 17.4%) \n\nNormalisation on repeat imaging  128 \n(38.2%, 95% CI \n33.0% - 43.5%) \n\n43 \n(26.1%, 95% CI \n19.8% - 33.0%) \n\nComposite: Symptomatic recurrent VTE + major \nbleeding (net clinical benefit) \n\n4 \n(1.2%, 95% CI \n0.4% - 3.0%) \n\n7 \n(4.2%, 95% CI \n2.0% - 8.4%) \n\nFatal or non-fatal pulmonary embolism 1 \n(0.3%, 95% CI \n0.0% \u2013 1.6%) \n\n1 \n(0.6%, 95% CI \n0.0% \u2013 3.1%) \n\n* FAS= full analysis set, all children who were randomised \n\n \nTable 12: Safety results at the end of the main treatment period  \n\n Rivaroxaban  \nN=329* \n\nComparator \nN=162* \n\nComposite: Major bleeding + CRNMB (primary safety \noutcome) \n\n10 \n(3.0%, 95% CI \n1.6% - 5.5%) \n\n3 \n(1.9%, 95% CI \n0.5% - 5.3%) \n\nMajor bleeding 0 \n(0.0%, 95% CI \n0.0% - 1.1%) \n\n2 \n(1.2%, 95% CI \n0.2% - 4.3%) \n\nAny treatment-emergent bleedings 119 (36.2%) 45 (27.8%) \n* SAF = safety analysis set, all children who were randomised and received at least 1 dose of study \nmedicinal product \n\n \nThe efficacy and safety profile of rivaroxaban was largely similar between the paediatric VTE \npopulation and the DVT/PE adult population, however, the proportion of subjects with any bleeding \nwas higher in the paediatric VTE population as compared to the DVT/PE adult population. \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicentre study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for \nall 3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies). The study was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of \n120 patients due to an excess of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was \n569 days. 59 patients were randomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine \nclearance (CrCl) < 50 mL/min) and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in \n12% of patients randomised to rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No \nevents were reported in patients randomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) \nof the rivaroxaban group and 2 patients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXarelto in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of thromboembolic events (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThe following information is based on the data obtained in adults.  \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (CRmaxR) appearing 2 - 4 hours after \ntablet intake.  \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or CRmaxR at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose.  \nDue to a reduced extent of absorption an oral bioavailability of 66% was determined for the 20 mg \ntablet under fasting conditions. When rivaroxaban 20 mg tablets are taken together with food increases \nin mean AUC by 39% were observed when compared to tablet intake under fasting conditions, \nindicating almost complete absorption and high oral bioavailability. Rivaroxaban 15 mg and 20 mg are \nto be taken with food (see section 4.2). \nRivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily in fasting state. \nUnder fed conditions rivaroxaban 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg tablets demonstrated dose-proportionality. \nAt higher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and \ndecreased absorption rate with increased dose.  \nVariability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) \nranging from 30% to 40%. \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% \nand 56% decrease in AUC and CRmaxR compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and CRmaxR) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren received rivaroxaban tablet or oral suspension during or closely after feeding or food intake \nand with a typical serving of liquid to ensure reliable dosing in children. As in adults, rivaroxaban is \nreadily absorbed after oral administration as tablet or granules for oral suspension formulation in \nchildren. No difference in the absorption rate nor in the extent of absorption between the tablet and \ngranules for oral suspension formulation was observed. No PK data following intravenous \nadministration to children are available so that the absolute bioavailability of rivaroxaban in children is \nunknown. A decrease in the relative bioavailability for increasing doses (in mg/kg bodyweight) was \nfound, suggesting absorption limitations for higher doses, even when taken together with food. \nRivaroxaban 20 mg tablets should be taken with feeding or with food (see section 4.2).  \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in adults is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being the \nmain binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with VRssR being approximately \n50 litres. \n \n\n\n\n109 \n\nPaediatric population \nNo data on rivaroxaban plasma protein binding specific to children is available. No PK data following \nintravenous administration of rivaroxaban to children is available. VRssR estimated via population PK \nmodelling in children (age range 0 to < 18 years) following oral administration of rivaroxaban is \ndependent on body weight and can be described with an allometric function, with an average of 113 L \nfor a subject with a body weight of 82.8 kg. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination  \nIn adults, of the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, \nwith half then being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 \nof the administered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, \nmainly via active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo metabolism data specific to children is available. No PK data following intravenous administration \nof rivaroxaban to children is available. CL estimated via population PK modelling in children (age \nrange 0 to < 18 years) following oral administration of rivaroxaban is dependent on body weight and \ncan be described with an allometric function, with an average of 8 L/h for a subject with body weight \nof 82.8 kg. The geometric mean values for disposition half-lives (tR1/2R) estimated via population PK \nmodelling decrease with decreasing age and ranged from 4.2 h in adolescents to approximately 3 h in \nchildren aged 2-12 years down to 1.9 and 1.6 h in children aged 0.5-< 2 years and less than 0.5 years, \nrespectively. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender \nIn adults, there were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics \nbetween male and female patients. An exploratory analysis did not reveal relevant differences in \nrivaroxaban exposure between male and female children. \n \nElderly population \nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nIn adults, extremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary.  \nIn children, rivaroxaban is dosed based on body weight. An exploratory analysis did not reveal a \nrelevant impact of underweight or obesity on rivaroxaban exposure in children. \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nIn adults, no clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, \nHispanic, Japanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics.  \nAn exploratory analysis did not reveal relevant inter-ethnic differences in rivaroxaban exposure among \nJapanese, Chinese or Asian children outside Japan and China compared to the respective overall \npaediatric population. \n\n\n\n110 \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic adult patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only \nminor changes in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), \nnearly comparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3 fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  \nRivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsection 4.3). \nNo clinical data is available in children with hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn adults, there was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as \nassessed via creatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance \n50 - 80 ml/min), moderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance \n15 - 29 ml/min) renal impairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 \nand 1.6 fold respectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more \npronounced. In individuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of \nfactor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy \nvolunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. \nThere are no data in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban is to be used \nwith caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \nNo clinical data is available in children 1 year or older with moderate or severe renal impairment \n(glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min/1.73 mP\n\n2\nP). \n\n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of acute DVT 20 mg once daily the geometric mean \nconcentration (90% prediction interval) 2 - 4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing \nmaximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 215 (22 - 535) and \n32 (6 - 239) mcg/l, respectively. \n \nIn paediatric patients with acute VTE receiving body weight-adjusted rivaroxaban leading to an \nexposure similar to that in adult DVT patients receiving a 20 mg once daily dose, the geometric mean \nconcentrations (90% interval) at sampling time intervals roughly representing maximum and minimum \nconcentrations during the dose interval are summarised in Table 13.  \n \n\n\n\n111 \n\nTable 13: Summary statistics (geometric mean (90% interval)) of rivaroxaban steady state \nplasma concentrations (mcg/L) by dosing regimen and age \n\nTime \nintervals \n\n        \n\no.d.

The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an ERmaxR model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects.  \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety and efficacy have not been established in the indication prevention of stroke and systemic \nembolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation for children and adolescents up to 18 years.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-\nnatal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \nRivaroxaban was tested in juvenile rats up to 3-month treatment duration starting at postnatal day 4 \nshowing a non dose-related increase in periinsular haemorrhage. No evidence of target organ-specific \ntoxicity was seen.  \n\n\n\n112 \n\n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nTreatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE \nThe recommended dose for the initial treatment of acute DVT or PE is 15 mg twice daily for the first \nthree weeks followed by 20 mg once daily for the continued treatment and prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE.  \n \nShort duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be considered in patients with DVT or PE \nprovoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or trauma). Longer duration of \ntherapy should be considered in patients with provoked DVT or PE not related to major transient risk \nfactors, unprovoked DVT or PE, or a history of recurrent DVT or PE.   \n \nWhen extended prevention of recurrent DVT and PE is indicated (following completion of at least \n6 months therapy for DVT or PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom \n\n\n\n115 \n\nthe risk of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated comorbidities, or \nwho have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended prevention with Xarelto 10 mg once daily, a \ndose of Xarelto 20 mg once daily should be considered. \n \nThe duration of therapy and dose selection should be individualised after careful assessment of the \ntreatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4).  \n \n\n Time period Dosing schedule Total daily dose \n\nTreatment and \nprevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE \n\nDay 1 - 21 15 mg twice daily  30 mg \n\nDay 22 onwards 20 mg once daily  20 mg \n\nPrevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE  \n\nFollowing completion \nof at least 6 months \ntherapy for DVT or PE \n\n10 mg once daily or  \n20 mg once daily  \n\n10 mg  \nor 20 mg \n\n \nThe 4-week treatment initiation pack of Xarelto is dedicated to patients who will transition from \n15 mg twice daily to 20 mg once daily from Day 22 onwards (see section 6.5). \nFor patients with moderate or severe renal impairment where the decision has been taken for 15 mg \nonce daily from Day 22 onwards, other pack sizes only containing 15 mg film-coated tablets are \navailable (see dosing instructions in section \u201cSpecial populations\u201d below). \n \nIf a dose is missed during the 15 mg twice daily treatment phase (day 1 - 21), the patient should take \nXarelto immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg Xarelto per day. In this case two 15 mg tablets may be \ntaken at once. The patient should continue with the regular 15 mg twice daily intake as recommended \non the following day.  \n \nIf a dose is missed during the once daily treatment phase, the patient should take Xarelto immediately, \nand continue on the following day with the once daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be \ndoubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.  \n \nConverting from Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) to Xarelto \nFor patients treated for DVT, PE and prevention of recurrence, VKA treatment should be stopped and \nXarelto therapy should be initiated once the International Normalised Ratio (INR) is \u2264 2.5.  \nWhen converting patients from VKAs to Xarelto, INR values will be falsely elevated after the intake \nof Xarelto. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity of Xarelto, and therefore should \nnot be used (see section 4.5). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Xarelto to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that Xarelto can contribute to an elevated INR.  \nIn patients converting from Xarelto to VKA, VKA should be given concurrently until the INR is \u2265 2.0. \nFor the first two days of the conversion period, standard initial dosing of VKA should be used \nfollowed by VKA dosing, as guided by INR testing. While patients are on both Xarelto and VKA the \nINR should not be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the next dose of \nXarelto. Once Xarelto is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably at least 24 hours after the last \ndose (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to Xarelto \nFor patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, discontinue the parenteral anticoagulant \nand start Xarelto 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of the parenteral \nmedicinal product (e.g. low molecular weight heparins) would be due or at the time of discontinuation \nof a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous unfractionated heparin). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to parenteral anticoagulants \nGive the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next Xarelto dose would be taken.  \n\n\n\n116 \n\n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nLimited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) \nindicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased. Therefore, Xarelto is to be \nused with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance \n< 15 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nIn patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance \n15 - 29 ml/min) renal impairment the following dose recommendations apply: \n \n- For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, patients \n\nshould be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks.  \nThereafter, when the recommended dose is 20 mg once daily, a reduction of the dose from \n20 mg once daily to 15 mg once daily should be considered if the patient\u2019s assessed risk for \nbleeding outweighs the risk for recurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use of \n15 mg is based on PK modelling and has not been studied in this clinical setting (see \nsections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  \nWhen the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, no dose adjustment from the recommended \ndose is necessary. \n \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n50 - 80 ml/min) (see section 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nElderly population  \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \nPaediatric population \nXarelto treatment initiation pack should not be used in children aged 0 to 18 years because it is \nspecifically designed for treatment of adult patients and is not appropriate for use in paediatric \npatients.  \n \nMethod of administration  \nXarelto is for oral use.  \nThe tablets are to be taken with food (see section 5.2). \n \nCrushing of tablets \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Xarelto tablet may be crushed and mixed with \nwater or apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally. After the administration of \ncrushed Xarelto 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should be immediately followed by \nfood. \nThe crushed tablet may also be given through gastric tubes (see sections 5.2 and 6.6). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n117 \n\nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \nHaemorrhagic risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Xarelto are to be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. \nIt is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. Xarelto \nadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see section 4.9). \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate \nclinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult \nbleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are \nto be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after \ninitiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) rivaroxaban plasma levels \nmay be significantly increased (1.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. \nXarelto is to be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min. Use is not \nrecommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nXarelto should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment concomitantly receiving other \nmedicinal products which increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (see section 4.5). \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \nThe use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with \nazole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) or HIV \nprotease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and \n\n\n\n118 \n\nP-gp and therefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant degree \n(2.6 fold on average) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see section 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid and \nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5).  \n \nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n\uf0b7 congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n\uf0b7 uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension \n\uf0b7 other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n\uf0b7 vascular retinopathy \n\uf0b7 bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \nPatients with prosthetic valves \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been studied \nin patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that Xarelto provides \nadequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Xarelto is not recommended for \nthese patients. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates \nof recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \nXarelto is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary \nembolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in these clinical \nsituations.  \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or puncture \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical \nexperience with the use of 15 mg or 20 mg rivaroxaban in these situations. \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \n\n\n\n119 \n\nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low. However, the exact timing to reach a \nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. \nFor the removal of an epidural catheter and based on the general PK characteristics at least 2x half-\nlife, i.e. at least 18 hours in young patients and 26 hours in elderly patients should elapse after the last \nadministration of rivaroxaban (see section 5.2). Following removal of the catheter, at least 6 hours \nshould elapse before the next rivaroxaban dose is administered. \nIf traumatic puncture occurs the administration of rivaroxaban is to be delayed for 24 hours. \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention  \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Xarelto 15 mg/ Xarelto 20 mg should be \nstopped at least 24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the \nphysician.  \nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \nXarelto should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention \nprovided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as determined by \nthe treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nIncreasing age may increase haemorrhagic risk (see section 5.2). \n \nDermatological reactions \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \nXarelto contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say \nessentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban CRmaxR, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4).  \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in \nCRmaxR. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and CRmaxR. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \n\n\n\n120 \n\nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRRmaxR when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRRmaxR when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean CRmaxR. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-\nrisk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \nAnticoagulants \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response.  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-\nmajor clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-\nfactor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the \nfourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity \nand ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the CRtroughR of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \n\n\n\n121 \n\nCYP3A4 inducers  \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. \n \nOther concomitant therapies  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \n \nLaboratory parameters \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the intrinsic \nrisk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Xarelto is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3).  \nWomen of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with rivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from animals \nindicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Xarelto is contraindicated during breast-\nfeeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from therapy.  \n \nFertility \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXarelto has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like syncope \n(frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see section 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies in adults including \n53,103 patients exposed to rivaroxaban and in two phase II and one phase III paediatric studies \nincluding 412 patients.

As incidence of \nadverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS \nstudy data were not included for frequency calculation in this table. \n\n \n\n\n\n126 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Xarelto may be associated with an increased \nrisk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post haemorrhagic \nanaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary according to the \nlocation and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 \u201cManagement of \nbleeding\u201d). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito \nurinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more \nfrequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to \nadequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to \ndetect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be \nappropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with \nuncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see \nsection 4.4 \u201cHaemorrhagic risk\u201d). Menstrual bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. \nHaemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained \nswelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of \ncardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris have been observed.  \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for Xarelto. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to \nbe considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nRare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or other \nadverse reactions. Due to limited absorption a ceiling effect with no further increase in average plasma \nexposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg rivaroxaban or above.  \nA specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is \navailable (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa). \nThe use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered.  \n \nManagement of bleeding \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised \naccording to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could \nbe used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis \nwith bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products \n(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or \nplatelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, either the administration of a specific \nfactor Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet alfa), which antagonises the pharmacodynamic effect of \nrivaroxaban, or a specific procoagulant reversal agent, such as prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa), \nshould be considered. However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of \nthese medicinal products in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. The recommendation is also based on \nlimited non-clinical data. Re-dosing of recombinant factor VIIa shall be considered and titrated \ndepending on improvement of bleeding. Depending on local availability, a consultation with a \ncoagulation expert should be considered in case of major bleedings (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor \n\n\n\n127 \n\nexperience with the use of the systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving \nrivaroxaban. Due to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  \n \nMechanism of action \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant.  \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence, the 5/95 \npercentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of maximum effect) for \n15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily ranged from 17 to 32 s and for 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily from 15 \nto 30 s. At trough (8 - 16 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles for 15 mg twice daily ranged from \n14 to 24 s and for 20 mg once daily (18 - 30 h after tablet intake) from 13 to 20 s. \nIn patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 1 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the \ntime of maximum effect) in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 14 to 40 s and in \npatients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 10 to 50 s. At trough \n(16 - 36 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged \nfrom 12 to 26 s and in patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 12 \nto 26 s. \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical routine. \nHowever, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated quantitative anti-\nfactor Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nTreatment of DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE  \nThe rivaroxaban clinical programme was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the \ninitial and continued treatment of acute DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence. \nOver 12,800 patients were studied in four randomised controlled phase III clinical studies (Einstein \nDVT, Einstein PE, Einstein Extension and Einstein Choice) and additionally a predefined pooled \nanalysis of the Einstein DVT and Einstein PE studies was conducted. The overall combined treatment \nduration in all studies was up to 21 months. \n \n\n\n\n128 \n\nIn Einstein DVT 3,449 patients with acute DVT were studied for the treatment of DVT and the \nprevention of recurrent DVT and PE (patients who presented with symptomatic PE were excluded \nfrom this study). The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial 3 week treatment of acute DVT 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily. This \nwas followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  \n \nIn Einstein PE, 4,832 patients with acute PE were studied for the treatment of PE and the prevention of \nrecurrent DVT and PE. The treatment duration was for 3, 6 or 12 months depending on the clinical \njudgement of the investigator. \nFor the initial treatment of acute PE 15 mg rivaroxaban was administered twice daily for three weeks. \nThis was followed by 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily.  \n \nIn both the Einstein DVT and the Einstein PE study, the comparator treatment regimen consisted of \nenoxaparin administered for at least 5 days in combination with vitamin K antagonist treatment until \nthe PT/INR was in therapeutic range (\uf0b3 2.0). Treatment was continued with a vitamin K antagonist \ndose-adjusted to maintain the PT/INR values within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. \n \nIn Einstein Extension 1,197 patients with DVT or PE were studied for the prevention of recurrent \nDVT and PE. The treatment duration was for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had \ncompleted 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism depending on the clinical \njudgment of the investigator. Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was compared with placebo.  \n \nEinstein DVT, PE and Extension used the same pre-defined primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE. The secondary efficacy outcome was defined as the composite of \nrecurrent DVT, non-fatal PE and all-cause mortality.  \n \nIn Einstein Choice, 3,396 patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE who completed 6-12 \nmonths of anticoagulant treatment were studied for the prevention of fatal PE or non-fatal \nsymptomatic recurrent DVT or PE. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dosed \nanticoagulation were excluded from the study. The treatment duration was up to 12 months depending \non the individual randomisation date (median: 351 days). Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily and \nrivaroxaban 10 mg once daily were compared with 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily. \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE defined as the composite of recurrent \nDVT or fatal or non-fatal PE.  \nIn the Einstein DVT study (see Table 4) rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to \nenoxaparin/VKA for the primary efficacy outcome (p < 0.0001 (test for non-inferiority); Hazard Ratio \n(HR): 0.680 (0.443 - 1.042), p=0.076 (test for superiority)). The prespecified net clinical benefit \n(primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding events) was reported with a HR of 0.67 \n((95% CI: 0.47 - 0.95), nominal p value p=0.027) in favour of rivaroxaban. INR values were within \nthe therapeutic range a mean of 60.3% of the time for the mean treatment duration of 189 days, and \n55.4%, 60.1%, and 62.8% of the time in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month intended treatment duration groups, \nrespectively. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, there was no clear relation between the level of mean \ncentre TTR (Time in Target INR Range of 2.0 - 3.0) in the equally sized tertiles and the incidence of \nthe recurrent VTE (P=0.932 for interaction).

There were differences in patient baseline characteristics including age, cancer and \nrenal impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified analysis was used to adjust for measured \nbaseline differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, influence the results. Adjusted HRs \ncomparing rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality \nwere 0.77 (95% CI 0.40 - 1.50), 0.91 (95% CI 0.54 - 1.54) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.07), respectively.  \nThese results in clinical practice are consistent with the established safety profile in this indication. \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicentre study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for \nall 3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies). The study was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of \n120 patients due to an excess of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was \n569 days. 59 patients were randomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine \nclearance (CrCl) < 50 mL/min) and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in \n12% of patients randomised to rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No \nevents were reported in patients randomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) \nof the rivaroxaban group and 2 patients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n\n\n\n133 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nXarelto treatment initiation pack is specifically designed for treatment of adult patients and is not \nappropriate for use in paediatric patients. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (CRmaxR) appearing 2 - 4 hours after \ntablet intake.  \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions. Intake with food does not affect \nrivaroxaban AUC or CRmaxR at the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose.  \nDue to a reduced extent of absorption an oral bioavailability of 66% was determined for the 20 mg \ntablet under fasting conditions. When rivaroxaban 20 mg tablets are taken together with food increases \nin mean AUC by 39% were observed when compared to tablet intake under fasting conditions, \nindicating almost complete absorption and high oral bioavailability. Rivaroxaban 15 mg and 20 mg are \nto be taken with food (see section 4.2). \nRivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily in fasting state. \nUnder fed conditions rivaroxaban 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg tablets demonstrated dose-proportionality. \nAt higher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and \ndecreased absorption rate with increased dose.  \nVariability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) \nranging from 30% to 40%. \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% \nand 56% decrease in AUC and CRmaxR compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and CRmaxR) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being \nthe main binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with VRssR being approximately \n50 litres. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination  \nOf the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, with half \nthen being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 of the \nadministered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, mainly \nvia active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \n\n\n\n134 \n\nSpecial populations \nGender \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between \nmale and female patients. \n \nElderly population \nElderly patients exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with mean AUC values \nbeing approximately 1.5 fold higher, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total and renal clearance. No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nDifferent weight categories \nExtremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations (less than 25%). No dose adjustment is necessary. \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nNo clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, \nJapanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics. \n \nHepatic impairment \nCirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor \nchanges in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly \ncomparable to their matched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (classified as Child Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by \n2.3 fold compared to healthy volunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also \nhad reduced renal elimination of rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  \nRivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nThere was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as assessed via \ncreatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min), \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min) renal \nimpairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 fold \nrespectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more pronounced. In \nindividuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of factor Xa \nactivity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy volunteers; \nprolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. There are no \ndata in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \nUse is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban is to be used \nwith caution in patients with creatinine clearance 15 - 29 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of acute DVT 20 mg once daily the geometric mean \nconcentration (90% prediction interval) 2 - 4 h and about 24 h after dose (roughly representing \nmaximum and minimum concentrations during the dose interval) was 215 (22 - 535) and \n32 (6 - 239) mcg/l, respectively. \n \n\n\n\n135 \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nThe pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentration and several PD endpoints (factor Xa inhibition, PT, aPTT, Heptest) has been evaluated \nafter administration of a wide range of doses (5 - 30 mg twice a day). The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an ERmaxR model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/l). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects.  \n \nPaediatric population \nXarelto treatment initiation pack is specifically designed for treatment of adult patients and is not \nappropriate for use in paediatric patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and post-\nnatal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams. \n \n \n6.

Dose adjustments should be made \nbased on changes in body weight only. \n \nFrequency of dosing:  \n\uf0b7 For a once a day regimen \n\nThe doses should be taken approximately 24 hours apart. \n\uf0b7 For a two times a day regimen \n\nThe doses should be taken approximately 12 hours apart. \n\uf0b7 For a three times a day regimen \n\nThe doses should be taken approximately 8 hours apart. \n \nFor patients with body weight of at least 2.6 kg to less than 30 kg only the oral suspension should be \nused. Do not split Xarelto tablets or use Xarelto tablets of lower strength in an attempt to provide \ndoses for children with body weight below 30 kg.  \nFor patients with body weight of at least 30 kg, Xarelto oral suspension or tablets of 15 mg or 20 mg \nstrength can be administered once a day.  \n \nXarelto oral suspension is provided with either 1 mL or 5 mL and 10 mL blue syringes (oral dosing \nsyringe) with their adapter. To ensure accurate dosing it is recommended to use the blue syringes as \nfollows (see Table 1): \n\uf0b7 1 mL blue syringe (with 0.1 mL graduations) must be used in patients weighing less than 4 kg \n\uf0b7 5 mL blue syringe (with 0.2 mL graduations) may be used in patients weighing 4 kg up to less \n\nthan 30 kg \n\uf0b7 10 mL blue syringe (with 0.5 mL graduations) is only recommended for use in patients \n\nweighing 12 kg or more \nFor patients weighing 12 kg up to less than 30 kg, either 5 mL or 10 mL blue syringes can be used. \nIt is recommended that the healthcare professional advises the patient or caregiver which blue syringe \nto use to ensure that the correct volume is administered. \nInstructions for Use booklet is provided with the medicinal product. \n \nInitiation of treatment  \n\uf0b7 Paediatric patients from term neonates to less than 6 months \n\nTreatment for paediatric patients from term neonates to less than 6 months of age, who at birth \nhad at least 37 weeks of gestation, weigh at least 2.6 kg, and have had at least 10 days of oral \nfeeding should be initiated following at least 5 days of initial parenteral anticoagulation \n\n\n\n139 \n\ntreatment (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Xarelto is dosed based on body weight using the oral \nsuspension formulation (see Table 1).  \n \n\n\uf0b7 Paediatric patients from 6 months of age to less than 18 years \nTreatment for paediatric patients from 6 months to less than 18 years of age should be initiated \nfollowing at least 5 days of initial parenteral anticoagulation treatment (see section 5.1). Xarelto \nis dosed based on body weight (see Table 1).  \n\n \nDuration of treatment  \n\uf0b7 All children, except those aged less than 2 years with catheter-related thrombosis \n\nTherapy should be continued for at least 3 months. Treatment can be extended up to 12 months \nwhen clinically necessary. There is no data available in children to support a dose reduction \nafter 6 months treatment. The benefit-risk of continued therapy after 3 months should be \nassessed on an individual basis taking into account the risk for recurrent thrombosis versus the \npotential bleeding risk. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Children aged less than 2 years with catheter-related thrombosis \n\nTherapy should be continued for at least 1 month. Treatment can be extended up to 3 months \nwhen clinically necessary. The benefit-risk of continued therapy after 1 month should be \nassessed on an individual basis taking into account the risk for recurrent thrombosis versus the \npotential bleeding risk. \n\n \nMissed doses \n\uf0b7 Once a day regimen \n\nIf taken once a day, a missed dose should be taken as soon as possible after it is noticed, but \nonly on the same day. If this is not possible, the patient should skip the dose and continue with \nthe next dose as prescribed. The patient should not take two doses to make up for a missed dose. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Two times a day regimen \n\nIf taken twice a day, a missed morning dose should be taken immediately when it is noticed, and \nit may be taken together with the evening dose. A missed evening dose can only be taken during \nthe same evening, the patient should not take two doses the next morning. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Three times a day regimen  \n\nIf taken three times a day, the three times daily administration schedule with approximately \n8-hour intervals should simply be resumed at the next scheduled dose without compensating for \nthe missed dose. \n\n \nOn the following day, the child should continue with the regular once, twice or three times daily \nregimen. \n \nConverting from parenteral anticoagulants to Xarelto  \nFor patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, start Xarelto 0 to 2 hours before the time of \nthe next scheduled administration of the parenteral medicinal product (e.g. LMWH) or at the time of \ndiscontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral medicinal product (e.g. intravenous \nunfractionated heparin). \n \nConverting from Xarelto to parenteral anticoagulants  \nDiscontinue Xarelto and give the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the time that the next Xarelto \ndose would be taken.  \n \nConverting from Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) to Xarelto  \nVKA treatment should be stopped and Xarelto therapy should be initiated once the International \nNormalised Ratio (INR) is \u2264 2.5.  \nWhen converting patients from VKAs to Xarelto, INR values will be falsely elevated after the intake \nof Xarelto. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity of Xarelto, and therefore should \nnot be used (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n140 \n\n \nConverting from Xarelto to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  \nThere is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation during the transition from Xarelto to VKA. \nContinuous adequate anticoagulation should be ensured during any transition to an alternate \nanticoagulant. It should be noted that Xarelto can contribute to an elevated INR. \nChildren who convert from Xarelto to VKA need to continue Xarelto for 48 hours after the first dose \nof VKA. After 2 days of co-administration an INR should be obtained prior to the next scheduled dose \nof Xarelto. Co-administration of Xarelto and VKA is advised to continue until the INR is \u2265 2.0. Once \nXarelto is discontinued INR testing may be done reliably 24 hours after the last dose (see above and \nsection 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \n\uf0b7 Children 1 year or older with mild renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n50 - 80 mL/min/1.73 mP\n\n2\nP): no dose adjustment is required, based on data in adults and limited \n\ndata in paediatric patients (see section 5.2).  \n\uf0b7 Children 1 year or older with moderate or severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n< 50 mL/min/1.73 mP\n\n2\nP): Xarelto is not recommended as no clinical data is available (see \n\nsection 4.4).  \n\uf0b7 Children below 1 year: the renal function should only be determined using serum creatinine. \n\nXarelto is not recommended in children younger than 1 year with serum creatinine results above \n97.5th percentile (see Table 2), as no data are available (see section 4.4). \n\n \nTable 2: Reference values of serum creatinine in children younger than 1 year of age (Boer et al, \n2010) \nAge 97.5P\n\nth\nP percentile of \n\ncreatinine (\u00b5mol/L ) \n97.5P\n\nth\nP percentile of \n\ncreatinine (mg/dL ) \nDay 1 81 0.92 \nDay 2 69 0.78 \nDay 3 62 0.70 \nDay 4 58 0.66 \nDay 5 55 0.62 \nDay 6 53 0.60 \nDay 7 51 0.58 \nWeek 2 46 0.52 \nWeek 3 41 0.46 \nWeek 4 37 0.42 \nMonth 2 33 0.37 \nMonth 3 30 0.34 \nMonth 4\u20136 30 0.34 \nMonth 7\u20139 30 0.34 \nMonth 10\u201312 32 0.36 \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nNo clinical data is available in children with hepatic impairment. \nXarelto is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically \nrelevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nBody weight  \nFor children the dose is determined based on body weight (see Posology above). \n \nGender \nNo dose adjustment (see section 5.2) \n \n\n\n\n141 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Xarelto in children aged 0 to < 18 years have not been established in \nindications other than treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of VTE \nrecurrence. No data are available for other indications. Therefore, Xarelto is not recommended for use \nin children below 18 years of age in indications other than the treatment of VTE and prevention of \nVTE recurrence. \n \nMethod of administration  \nXarelto is for oral use. \nThe oral suspension should be taken with feeding or with food (see section 5.2). \n \nFor details on preparation and administration of the oral suspension see section 6.6.  \nThe oral suspension may be given through a nasogastric or gastric feeding tube (see sections 5.2 and \n6.6). \n \nEach dose should be immediately followed by the intake of one typical serving of liquid. This typical \nserving may include liquid volume used for feeding. \nIn case the patient immediately spits up the dose or vomits within 30 minutes after receiving the dose, \na new dose should be given. However, if the patient vomits more than 30 minutes after the dose, the \ndose should not be re-administered and the next dose should be taken as scheduled.  \n \nIf the oral suspension is not immediately available, when doses of 15 mg or 20 mg rivaroxaban are \nprescribed, these could be provided by crushing the 15 mg or 20 mg tablet and mixing it with water or \napple puree immediately prior to use and administering it orally (see sections 5.2 and 6.6).  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive clinically significant bleeding. \n \nLesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current \nor recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent \nbrain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, \nknown or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major \nintraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. \n \nConcomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants, e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low \nmolecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral \nanticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under specific circumstances of \nswitching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain \nan open central venous or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). \n \nHepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk including cirrhotic \npatients with Child Pugh B and C (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinical surveillance in line with anticoagulation practice is recommended throughout the treatment \nperiod. \n \nDosing of rivaroxaban cannot be reliably determined in the following patient populations and was not \nstudied. It is therefore not recommended in children less than 6 months of age who: \n\n\n\n142 \n\n\uf0b7 at birth had less than 37 weeks of gestation, or \n\uf0b7 have a body weight of less than 2.6 kg, or \n\uf0b7 had less than 10 days of oral feeding. \n \nHaemorrhagic risk \nAs with other anticoagulants, patients taking Xarelto are to be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. \nIt is recommended to be used with caution in conditions with increased risk of haemorrhage. Xarelto \nadministration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see section 4.9). \n \nIn the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary \nincluding abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequent \nduring long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate \nclinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult \nbleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. \n \nSeveral sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at an increased risk of bleeding. These patients \nare to be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after \ninitiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  \nAny unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. \n \nAlthough treatment with rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of exposure, rivaroxaban \nlevels measured with a calibrated quantitative anti-factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional \nsituations where knowledge of rivaroxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. \noverdose and emergency surgery (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nThere is limited data in children with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis who have a CNS infection \n(see section 5.1). The risk of bleeding should be carefully evaluated before and during therapy with \nrivaroxaban. \n \nRenal impairment \nXarelto is not recommended in children 1 year or older with moderate or severe renal impairment \n(glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min/1.73 mP\n\n2\nP), as no clinical data is available.  \n\nXarelto is not recommended in children younger than 1 year with serum creatinine results above \n97.5th percentile, as no clinical data are available.  \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \nNo clinical data is available in children receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp.  \nXarelto is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with azole-\nantimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) or HIV protease \ninhibitors (e.g. ritonavir). These active substances are strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp and \ntherefore may increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant degree (2.6 fold on \naverage) which may lead to an increased bleeding risk (see section 4.5). \n \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with medicinal products affecting haemostasis \nsuch as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid and \nplatelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin \nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). For patients at risk of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease \nan appropriate prophylactic treatment may be considered (see section 4.5).  \n \n\n\n\n143 \n\nOther haemorrhagic risk factors \nAs with other antithrombotics, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with an increased bleeding \nrisk such as: \n\uf0b7 congenital or acquired bleeding disorders \n\uf0b7 uncontrolled arterial hypertension  \n\uf0b7 other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially lead to bleeding \n\ncomplications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal \nreflux disease) \n\n\uf0b7 vascular retinopathy \n\uf0b7 bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding \n \nPatients with prosthetic valves \nRivaroxaban should not be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients having recently undergone \ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been studied \nin patients with prosthetic heart valves; therefore, there are no data to support that this medicinal \nproduct provides adequate anticoagulation in this patient population. Treatment with Xarelto is not \nrecommended for these patients. \n \nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome \nDirect acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including rivaroxaban are not recommended for patients \nwith a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for \npatients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates \nof recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. \n \nHaemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy \nXarelto is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary \nembolism who are haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary \nembolectomy since the safety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in these clinical \nsituations.  \n \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture \nWhen neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, \npatients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk \nof developing an epidural or spinal haematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or \nthe concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. The risk may also be increased by \ntraumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or bladder \ndysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior \nto neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in \nanticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. There is no clinical \nexperience with the use of rivaroxaban in these situations. \nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and \nneuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or lumbar puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \nrivaroxaban. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when \nthe anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is estimated to be low. However, the exact timing to reach a \nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known and should be weighed against the \nurgency of a diagnostic procedure. \nNo data is available on the timing of the placement or removal of neuraxial catheter in children while \non Xarelto. In such cases, discontinue rivaroxaban and consider a short acting parenteral \nanticoagulant. \n \nDosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention  \nIf an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, Xarelto should be stopped at least \n24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the physician.  \n\n\n\n144 \n\nIf the procedure cannot be delayed the increased risk of bleeding should be assessed against the \nurgency of the intervention. \nXarelto should be restarted as soon as possible after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention \nprovided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established as determined by \nthe treating physician (see section 5.2). \n \nDermatological reactions \nSerious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS \nsyndrome, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in association with the use of \nrivaroxaban (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy: the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first weeks of \ntreatment. Rivaroxaban should be discontinued at the first appearance of a severe skin rash (e.g. \nspreading, intense and/or blistering), or any other sign of hypersensitivity in conjunction with mucosal \nlesions. \n \nInformation about excipients \nXarelto granules for oral suspension contains 1.8 mg sodium benzoate (E 211) in each mL oral \nsuspension. Sodium benzoate may increase jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn \ninfants (up to 4 weeks old). Increase in bilirubinaemia following its displacement from albumin may \nincrease neonatal jaundice which may develop into kernicterus (non-conjugated bilirubin deposits in \nthe brain tissue). \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per millilitre, that is to say \nessentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe extent of interactions in the paediatric population is not known. The below mentioned interaction \ndata was obtained in adults and the warnings in section 4.4 should be taken into account for the \npaediatric population. \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a \nday) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in \nmean rivaroxaban CRmaxR, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong \ninhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4).  \n \nActive substances strongly inhibiting only one of the rivaroxaban elimination pathways, either \nCYP3A4 or P-gp, are expected to increase rivaroxaban plasma concentrations to a lesser extent. \nClarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), for instance, considered as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and \nmoderate P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.4 fold increase in \nCRmaxR. The interaction with clarithromycin is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be \npotentially significant in high-risk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nErythromycin (500 mg three times a day), which inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp moderately, led to a \n1.3 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and CRmaxR. The interaction with erythromycin is likely not \nclinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-risk patients. \nIn subjects with mild renal impairment erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 1.8 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRRmaxR when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. In subjects with moderate renal impairment, erythromycin led to a 2.0 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and 1.6 fold increase in CRRmaxR when compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. The effect of erythromycin is additive to that of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n145 \n\nFluconazole (400 mg once daily), considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold \nincrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in mean CRmaxR. The interaction with \nfluconazole is likely not clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-\nrisk patients. (For patients with renal impairment: see section 4.4). \n \nGiven the limited clinical data available with dronedarone, co-administration with rivaroxaban should \nbe avoided. \n \nAnticoagulants \nAfter combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single \ndose) an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on \nclotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. \nDue to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any \nother anticoagulants (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nNSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors \nNo clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of \nrivaroxaban (15 mg) and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more \npronounced pharmacodynamic response.  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. \nClopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a \npharmacokinetic interaction with rivaroxaban (15 mg) but a relevant increase in bleeding time was \nobserved in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or \nGPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. \nCare is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) \nand platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding \nrisk (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs/SNRIs \nAs with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in \ncase of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets. When \nconcomitantly used in the rivaroxaban clinical programme, numerically higher rates of major or non-\nmajor clinically relevant bleeding were observed in all treatment groups. \n \nWarfarin \nConverting patients from the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) to rivaroxaban (20 mg) or \nfrom rivaroxaban (20 mg) to warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) increased prothrombin time/INR (Neoplastin) \nmore than additively (individual INR values up to 12 may be observed), whereas effects on aPTT, \ninhibition of factor Xa activity and endogenous thrombin potential were additive.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban during the conversion period, anti-\nfactor Xa activity, PiCT, and Heptest can be used as these tests were not affected by warfarin. On the \nfourth day after the last dose of warfarin, all tests (including PT, aPTT, inhibition of factor Xa activity \nand ETP) reflected only the effect of rivaroxaban.  \nIf it is desired to test the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin during the conversion period, INR \nmeasurement can be used at the CRtroughR of rivaroxaban (24 hours after the previous intake of \nrivaroxaban) as this test is minimally affected by rivaroxaban at this time point. \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between warfarin and rivaroxaban. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers  \nCo-administration of rivaroxaban with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin led to an approximate \n50% decrease in mean rivaroxaban AUC, with parallel decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The \nconcomitant use of rivaroxaban with other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital or St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also lead to reduced rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be \navoided unless the patient is closely observed for signs and symptoms of thrombosis.  \n \n\n\n\n146 \n\nOther concomitant therapies  \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when \nrivaroxaban was co-administered with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4), digoxin (substrate of P-gp), \natorvastatin (substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp) or omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). Rivaroxaban \nneither inhibits nor induces any major CYP isoforms like CYP3A4. \n \nLaboratory parameters \nClotting parameters (e.g. PT, aPTT, HepTest) are affected as expected by the mode of action of \nrivaroxaban (see section 5.1).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the intrinsic \nrisk of bleeding and the evidence that rivaroxaban passes the placenta, Xarelto is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3).  \nFemale adolescents of child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with \nrivaroxaban. \n \nBreast-feeding \nSafety and efficacy of Xarelto have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from animals \nindicate that rivaroxaban is secreted into milk. Therefore Xarelto is contraindicated during breast-\nfeeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from therapy.  \n \nFertility \nNo specific studies with rivaroxaban in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In \na study on male and female fertility in rats no effects were seen (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXarelto has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions like syncope \n(frequency: uncommon) and dizziness (frequency: common) have been reported (see section 4.8). \nPatients experiencing these adverse reactions should not drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of rivaroxaban has been evaluated in thirteen phase III studies in adults including \n53,103 patients exposed to rivaroxaban and in two phase II and one phase III paediatric studies \nincluding 412 patients.

As incidence of \nadverse reactions did not increase and no new adverse reaction was identified, COMPASS \nstudy data were not included for frequency calculation in this table. \n\n \n\n\n\n151 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nDue to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Xarelto may be associated with an increased \nrisk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post haemorrhagic \nanaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary according to the \nlocation and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 \u201cManagement of \nbleeding\u201d). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito \nurinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more \nfrequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to \nadequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to \ndetect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be \nappropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with \nuncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see \nsection 4.4 \u201cHaemorrhagic risk\u201d). Menstrual bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. \nHaemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained \nswelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of \ncardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris have been observed.  \nKnown complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure \ndue to hypoperfusion have been reported for Xarelto. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to \nbe considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. \n \nPaediatric patients \nThe safety assessment in children and adolescents is based on the safety data from two phase II and \none phase III open-label active controlled studies in paediatric patients aged birth to less than 18 years. \nThe safety findings were generally similar between rivaroxaban and comparator in the various \npaediatric age groups. Overall, the safety profile in the 412 children and adolescents treated with \nrivaroxaban was similar to that observed in the adult population and consistent across age subgroups, \nalthough assessment is limited by the small number of patients.  \nIn paediatric patients, headache (very common, 16.7%), fever (very common, 11.7%), epistaxis (very \ncommon, 11.2%), vomiting (very common, 10.7%), tachycardia (common, 1.5%), increase in bilirubin \n(common, 1.5%) and bilirubin conjugated increased (uncommon, 0.7%) were reported more \nfrequently as compared to adults. Consistent with adult population, menorrhagia was observed in 6.6% \n(common) of female adolescents after menarche. Thrombocytopenia as observed in the post-marketing \nexperience in adult population was common (4.6%) in paediatric clinical studies. The adverse drug \nreactions in paediatric patients were primarily mild to moderate in severity. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nIn adults, rare cases of overdose up to 600 mg have been reported without bleeding complications or \nother adverse reactions. There is limited data available in children. Due to limited absorption a ceiling \neffect with no further increase in average plasma exposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of \n50 mg rivaroxaban or above in adults, however no data is available at supratherapeutic doses in \nchildren. \nA specific reversal agent antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is not established in \nchildren. \nThe use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban overdose may be considered. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \nManagement of bleeding \nShould a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving rivaroxaban, the next rivaroxaban \nadministration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Rivaroxaban has \na half-life of approximately 5 to 13 hours in adults. The half-life in children estimated using \n\n\n\n152 \n\npopulation pharmacokinetic (popPK) modelling approaches is shorter (see section 5.2). Management \nshould be individualised according to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate \nsymptomatic treatment could be used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe \nepistaxis), surgical haemostasis with bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and \nhaemodynamic support, blood products (packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on \nassociated anaemia or coagulopathy) or platelets. \nIf bleeding cannot be controlled by the above measures, administration of a specific procoagulant \nreversal agent should be considered, such as prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated \nprothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa). However, there is \ncurrently very limited clinical experience with the use of these medicinal products in adults and in \nchildren receiving rivaroxaban (see section 5.1). \n \nProtamine sulphate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. \nThere is limited experience with tranexamic acid and no experience with aminocaproic acid and \naprotinin in adults receiving rivaroxaban. There is no experience on the use of these agents in children \nreceiving rivaroxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor experience with the use of \nthe systemic haemostatic desmopressin in individuals receiving rivaroxaban.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors, ATC code: B01AF01  \n \nMechanism of action \nRivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of \nfactor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting \nboth thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin \n(activated factor II) and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nDose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity was observed in humans. Prothrombin time (PT) is \ninfluenced by rivaroxaban in a dose dependent way with a close correlation to plasma concentrations \n(r value equals 0.98) if Neoplastin is used for the assay. Other reagents would provide different results. \nThe readout for PT is to be done in seconds, because the INR is only calibrated and validated for \ncoumarins and cannot be used for any other anticoagulant.  \nIn patients receiving rivaroxaban for treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrence, the 5/95 \npercentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 2 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the time of maximum effect) for \n15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily ranged from 17 to 32 s and for 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily from 15 \nto 30 s. At trough (8 - 16 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles for 15 mg twice daily ranged from \n14 to 24 s and for 20 mg once daily (18 - 30 h after tablet intake) from 13 to 20 s. \nIn patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and \nsystemic embolism, the 5/95 percentiles for PT (Neoplastin) 1 - 4 hours after tablet intake (i.e. at the \ntime of maximum effect) in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged from 14 to 40 s and in \npatients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 10 to 50 s. At trough \n(16 - 36 h after tablet intake) the 5/95 percentiles in patients treated with 20 mg once daily ranged \nfrom 12 to 26 s and in patients with moderate renal impairment treated with 15 mg once daily from 12 \nto 26 s. \nIn a clinical pharmacology study on the reversal of rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy adult \nsubjects (n=22), the effects of single doses (50 IU/kg) of two different types of PCCs, a 3-factor PCC \n(Factors II, IX and X) and a 4-factor PCC (Factors II, VII, IX and X) were assessed. The 3-factor PCC \nreduced mean Neoplastin PT values by approximately 1.0 second within 30 minutes, compared to \nreductions of approximately 3.5 seconds observed with the 4-factor PCC. In contrast, the 3-factor PCC \nhad a greater and more rapid overall effect on reversing changes in endogenous thrombin generation \nthan the 4-factor PCC (see section 4.9). \n\n\n\n153 \n\nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest are also prolonged dose-dependently; \nhowever, they are not recommended to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban. There is no \nneed for monitoring of coagulation parameters during treatment with rivaroxaban in routine clinical \npractice. However, if clinically indicated rivaroxaban levels can be measured by calibrated \nquantitative anti-factor Xa tests (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nPT (neoplastin reagent), aPTT, and anti-Xa assay (with a calibrated quantitative test) display a close \ncorrelation to plasma concentrations in children. The correlation between anti-Xa to plasma \nconcentrations is linear with a slope close to 1. Individual discrepancies with higher or lower anti-Xa \nvalues as compared to the corresponding plasma concentrations may occur. There is no need for \nroutine monitoring of coagulation parameters during clinical treatment with rivaroxaban. However, if \nclinically indicated, rivaroxaban concentrations can be measured by calibrated quantitative \nanti-Factor Xa tests in mcg/L (see Table 8 in section 5.2 for ranges of observed rivaroxaban plasma \nconcentrations in children). The lower limit of quantifications must be considered when the anti-Xa \ntest is used to quantify plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban in children. No threshold for efficacy or \nsafety events has been established. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nTreatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence in paediatric patients  \nA total of 727 children with confirmed acute VTE, of whom 528 received rivaroxaban, were studied in \n6 open-label, multicentre paediatric studies. Body weight-adjusted dosing in patients from birth to less \nthan 18 years resulted in rivaroxaban exposure similar to that observed in adult DVT patients treated \nwith rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily as confirmed in the phase III study (see section 5.2).  \n \nThe EINSTEIN Junior phase III study was a randomised, active-controlled, open-label multicentre \nclinical study in 500 paediatric patients (aged from birth to < 18 years) with confirmed acute VTE. \nThere were 276 children aged 12 to < 18 years, 101 children aged 6 to < 12 years, 69 children aged 2 \nto < 6 years, and 54 children aged < 2 years.  \n \nIndex VTE was classified as either central venous catheter-related VTE (CVC-VTE; 90/335 patients \nin the rivaroxaban group, 37/165 patients in the comparator group), cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis \n(CVST; 74/335 patients in the rivaroxaban group, 43/165 patients in the comparator group), and all \nothers including DVT and PE (non-CVC-VTE; 171/335 patients in the rivaroxaban group, \n84/165 patients in the comparator group). The most common presentation of index thrombosis in \nchildren aged 12 to < 18 years was non-CVC-VTE in 211 (76.4%); in children aged 6 to < 12 years \nand aged 2 to < 6 years was CVST in 48 (47.5%) and 35 (50.7%), respectively; and in children aged \n< 2 years was CVC-VTE in 37 (68.5%). There were no children < 6 months with CVST in the \nrivaroxaban group. 22 of the patients with CVST had a CNS infection (13 patients in the rivaroxaban \ngroup and 9 patients in comparator group). \n \nVTE was provoked by persistent, transient, or both persistent and transient risk factors in 438 (87.6%) \nchildren.  \n \nPatients received initial treatment with therapeutic doses of UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux for at least \n5 days, and were randomised 2:1 to receive either body weight-adjusted doses of rivaroxaban or \ncomparator group (heparins, VKA) for a main study treatment period of 3 months (1 month for \nchildren < 2 years with CVC-VTE). At the end of the main study treatment period, the diagnostic \nimaging test, which was obtained at baseline, was repeated, if clinically feasible. The study treatment \ncould be stopped at this point, or at the discretion of the Investigator continued for up to 12 months \n(for children < 2 years with CVC-VTE up to 3 months) in total. \n \nThe primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE. The primary safety outcome was the \ncomposite of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB). All efficacy and \nsafety outcomes were centrally adjudicated by an independent committee blinded for treatment \nallocation. The efficacy and safety results are shown in Tables 6 and 7 below. \n \n\n\n\n154 \n\nRecurrent VTEs occurred in the rivaroxaban group in 4 of 335 patients and in the comparator group in \n5 of 165 patients. The composite of major bleeding and CRNMB was reported in 10 of 329 patients \n(3%) treated with rivaroxaban and in 3 of 162 patients (1.9%) treated with comparator. Net clinical \nbenefit (symptomatic recurrent VTE plus major bleeding events) was reported in the rivaroxaban \ngroup in 4 of 335 patients and in the comparator group in 7 of 165 patients. Normalisation of the \nthrombus burden on repeat imaging occurred in 128 of 335 patients with rivaroxaban treatment and in \n43 of 165patients in the comparator group. These findings were generally similar among age groups. \nThere were 119 (36.2%) children with any treatment-emergent bleeding in the rivaroxaban group and \n45 (27.8%) children in the comparator group. \n \nTable 6: Efficacy results at the end of the main treatment period  \n\nEvent Rivaroxaban  \nN=335* \n\nComparator \nN=165* \n\nRecurrent VTE (primary efficacy outcome) 4 \n(1.2%, 95% CI \n0.4% \u2013 3.0%) \n\n5 \n(3.0%, 95% CI \n1.2% - 6.6%) \n\nComposite: Symptomatic recurrent VTE + \nasymptomatic deterioration on repeat imaging \n\n5 \n(1.5%, 95% CI \n0.6% \u2013 3.4%) \n\n6 \n(3.6%, 95% CI \n1.6% \u2013 7.6%) \n\nComposite: Symptomatic recurrent VTE + \nasymptomatic deterioration + no change on repeat \nimaging \n\n21 \n(6.3%, 95% CI \n4.0% \u2013 9.2%) \n\n19 \n(11.5%, 95% CI \n7.3% \u2013 17.4%) \n\nNormalisation on repeat imaging  128 \n(38.2%, 95% CI \n33.0% - 43.5%) \n\n43 \n(26.1%, 95% CI \n19.8% - 33.0%) \n\nComposite: Symptomatic recurrent VTE + major \nbleeding (net clinical benefit) \n\n4 \n(1.2%, 95% CI \n0.4% - 3.0%) \n\n7 \n(4.2%, 95% CI \n2.0% - 8.4%) \n\nFatal or non-fatal pulmonary embolism 1 \n(0.3%, 95% CI \n0.0% \u2013 1.6%) \n\n1 \n(0.6%, 95% CI \n0.0% \u2013 3.1%) \n\n* FAS = full analysis set, all children who were randomised \n\n \nTable 7: Safety results at the end of the main treatment period  \n\n Rivaroxaban  \nN=329* \n\nComparator \nN=162* \n\nComposite: Major bleeding + CRNMB (primary safety \noutcome) \n\n10 \n(3.0%, 95% CI \n1.6% - 5.5%) \n\n3 \n(1.9%, 95% CI \n0.5% - 5.3%) \n\nMajor bleeding 0 \n(0.0%, 95% CI \n0.0% - 1.1%) \n\n2 \n(1.2%, 95% CI \n0.2% - 4.3%) \n\nAny treatment-emergent bleedings 119 (36.2%) 45 (27.8%) \n* SAF = safety analysis set, all children who were randomised and received at least 1 dose of study \n\nmedicinal product  \n \nThe efficacy and safety profile of rivaroxaban was largely similar between the paediatric VTE \npopulation and the DVT/PE adult population, however, the proportion of subjects with any bleeding \nwas higher in the paediatric VTE population as compared to the DVT/PE adult population. \n \nPatients with high risk triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome \nIn an investigator sponsored, randomised open-label multicentre study with blinded endpoint \nadjudication, rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in patients with a history of thrombosis, \ndiagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and at high risk for thromboembolic events (positive for all \n\n\n\n155 \n\n3 antiphospholipid tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \nanti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies). The study was terminated prematurely after the enrolment of \n120 patients due to an excess of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was \n569 days. 59 patients were randomised to rivaroxaban 20 mg (15 mg for patients with creatinine \nclearance (CrCl) < 50 mL/min) and 61 to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Thromboembolic events occurred in \n12% of patients randomised to rivaroxaban (4 ischaemic strokes and 3 myocardial infarctions). No \nevents were reported in patients randomised to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients (7%) of \nthe rivaroxaban group and 2 patients (3%) of the warfarin group. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThe following information is based on the data obtained in adults.  \nRivaroxaban is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (CRmaxR) appearing 2 - 4 hours after \ntablet intake.  \nOral absorption of rivaroxaban is almost complete and oral bioavailability is high (80 - 100%) for the \n2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet dose, irrespective of fasting/fed conditions.  \nDue to a reduced extent of absorption an oral bioavailability of 66% was determined for the 20 mg \ntablet under fasting conditions. When rivaroxaban 20 mg tablets are taken together with food increases \nin mean AUC by 39% were observed when compared to tablet intake under fasting conditions, \nindicating almost complete absorption and high oral bioavailability.  \nRivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are approximately linear up to about 15 mg once daily in fasting state. \nUnder fed conditions rivaroxaban 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg tablets demonstrated dose-proportionality. \nAt higher doses rivaroxaban displays dissolution limited absorption with decreased bioavailability and \ndecreased absorption rate with increased dose.  \nBioequivalence was demonstrated for the granules for oral suspension formulation compared to the \nmarketed tablet at the 10 mg dose in fasted state as well as for the 20 mg dose in fed state. \nVariability in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (CV%) \nranging from 30% to 40%. \nAbsorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of its release in the gastrointestinal tract. A 29% \nand 56% decrease in AUC and CRmaxR compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is \nreleased in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when rivaroxaban is released in \nthe distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the \nstomach should be avoided since this can result in reduced absorption and related rivaroxaban \nexposure. \nBioavailability (AUC and CRmaxR) was comparable for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a \ncrushed tablet mixed in apple puree, or suspended in water and administered via a gastric tube \nfollowed by a liquid meal, compared to a whole tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional \npharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable \nto lower rivaroxaban doses. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren received a rivaroxaban tablet or oral suspension during or closely after feeding or food intake \nand with a typical serving of liquid to ensure reliable dosing in children. As in adults, rivaroxaban is \nreadily absorbed after oral administration as a tablet or granules for oral suspension formulation in \nchildren. No difference in the absorption rate nor in the extent of absorption between the tablet and \ngranules for oral suspension formulation was observed. No PK data following intravenous \nadministration to children is available so the absolute bioavailability of rivaroxaban in children is \nunknown. A decrease in the relative bioavailability for increasing doses (in mg/kg bodyweight) was \nfound, suggesting absorption limitations for higher doses, even when taken together with food. \nRivaroxaban oral suspension should be taken with feeding or with food (see section 4.2).  \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding in adults is high at approximately 92% to 95%, with serum albumin being the \nmain binding component. The volume of distribution is moderate with VRssR being approximately \n50 litres. \n \n\n\n\n156 \n\nPaediatric population \nNo data on rivaroxaban plasma protein binding specific to children is available. No PK data following \nintravenous administration of rivaroxaban to children is available. VRssR estimated via population PK \nmodelling in children (age range 0 to < 18 years) following oral administration of rivaroxaban is \ndependent on body weight and can be described with an allometric function, with an average of 113 L \nfor a subject with a body weight of 82.8 kg. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination  \nIn adults, of the administered rivaroxaban dose, approximately 2/3 undergoes metabolic degradation, \nwith half then being eliminated renally and the other half eliminated by the faecal route. The final 1/3 \nof the administered dose undergoes direct renal excretion as unchanged active substance in the urine, \nmainly via active renal secretion. \nRivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP-independent mechanisms. Oxidative \ndegradation of the morpholinone moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bonds are the major sites of \nbiotransformation. Based on in vitro investigations rivaroxaban is a substrate of the transporter \nproteins P-gp (P-glycoprotein) and Bcrp (breast cancer resistance protein). \nUnchanged rivaroxaban is the most important compound in human plasma, with no major or active \ncirculating metabolites being present. With a systemic clearance of about 10 l/h, rivaroxaban can be \nclassified as a low-clearance substance. After intravenous administration of a 1 mg dose the \nelimination half-life is about 4.5 hours. After oral administration the elimination becomes absorption \nrate limited. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with terminal half-lives of 5 to 9 hours in \nyoung individuals, and with terminal half-lives of 11 to 13 hours in the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo metabolism data specific to children is available. No PK data following intravenous administration \nof rivaroxaban to children is available. CL estimated via population PK modelling in children (age \nrange 0 to < 18 years) following oral administration of rivaroxaban is dependent on body weight and \ncan be described with an allometric function, with an average of 8 L/h for a subject with body weight \nof 82.8 kg. The geometric mean values for disposition half-lives (tR1/2R) estimated via population PK \nmodelling decrease with decreasing age and ranged from 4.2 h in adolescents to approximately 3 h in \nchildren aged 2-12 years down to 1.9 and 1.6 h in children aged 0.5-< 2 years and less than 0.5 years, \nrespectively. \n \nSpecial populations \nHepatic impairment \nNo clinical data is available in children with hepatic impairment. In adults, cirrhotic patients with mild \nhepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) exhibited only minor changes in rivaroxaban \npharmacokinetics (1.2 fold increase in rivaroxaban AUC on average), nearly comparable to their \nmatched healthy control group. In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic impairment (classified as \nChild Pugh B), rivaroxaban mean AUC was significantly increased by 2.3 fold compared to healthy \nvolunteers. Unbound AUC was increased 2.6 fold. These patients also had reduced renal elimination \nof rivaroxaban, similar to patients with moderate renal impairment. There are no data in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment. \nThe inhibition of factor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 2.6 in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment as compared to healthy volunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor \nof 2.1. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment were more sensitive to rivaroxaban resulting in a \nsteeper PK/PD relationship between concentration and PT.  \nRivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and \nclinically relevant bleeding risk, including cirrhotic patients with Child Pugh B and C (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo clinical data is available in children 1 year or older with moderate or severe renal impairment \n(glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min/1.73 mP\n\n2\nP) or in children younger than 1 year with serum \n\ncreatinine results above 97.5th percentile (see section 4.4). \nIn adults, there was an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlated to decrease in renal function, as \nassessed via creatinine clearance measurements. In individuals with mild (creatinine clearance \n\n\n\n157 \n\n50 - 80 mL/min), moderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance \n15 - 29 mL/min) renal impairment, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (AUC) were increased 1.4, 1.5 \nand 1.6 fold respectively. Corresponding increases in pharmacodynamic effects were more \npronounced. In individuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment the overall inhibition of \nfactor Xa activity was increased by a factor of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0 respectively as compared to healthy \nvolunteers; prolongation of PT was similarly increased by a factor of 1.3, 2.2 and 2.4 respectively. \nThere are no data in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialysable. \n \nGender \nIn adults, there were no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics \nbetween male and female patients. An exploratory analysis did not reveal relevant differences in \nrivaroxaban exposure between male and female children.  \n \nDifferent weight categories \nIn adults, extremes in body weight (< 50 kg or > 120 kg) had only a small influence on rivaroxaban \nplasma concentrations (less than 25%). In children, rivaroxaban is dosed based on body weight. An \nexploratory analysis in children did not reveal a relevant impact of underweight or obesity on \nrivaroxaban exposure.  \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nIn adults, no clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, \nHispanic, Japanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics.  \nAn exploratory analysis did not reveal relevant inter-ethnic differences in rivaroxaban exposure among \nJapanese, Chinese or Asian children outside Japan and China compared to the respective overall \npaediatric population.  \n \nPharmacokinetic data in patients \nIn paediatric patients with acute VTE receiving body weight-adjusted rivaroxaban leading to an \nexposure similar to that in adult DVT patients receiving a 20 mg once daily dose, the geometric mean \nconcentrations (90% interval) at sampling time intervals roughly representing maximum and minimum \nconcentrations during the dose interval are summarised in Table 8.  \n \n\n\n\n158 \n\nTable 8: Summary statistics (geometric mean (90% interval)) of rivaroxaban steady state \nplasma concentrations (mcg/L) by dosing regimen and age \n\nTime \nintervals \n\n        \n\no.d.

The relationship between \nrivaroxaban concentration and factor Xa activity was best described by an ERmaxR model. For PT, the \nlinear intercept model generally described the data better. Depending on the different PT reagents \nused, the slope differed considerably. When Neoplastin PT was used, baseline PT was about 13 s and \nthe slope was around 3 to 4 s/(100 mcg/L). The results of the PK/PD analyses in Phase II and III were \nconsistent with the data established in healthy subjects.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and juvenile \ntoxicity. \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of rivaroxaban. In rats, increased IgG and IgA plasma levels were seen at clinically relevant \nexposure levels. \nIn rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. Animal studies have shown reproductive \ntoxicity related to the pharmacological mode of action of rivaroxaban (e.g. haemorrhagic \ncomplications). Embryo-foetal toxicity (post-implantation loss, retarded/progressed ossification, \nhepatic multiple light coloured spots) and an increased incidence of common malformations as well as \nplacental changes were observed at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In the pre- and \npost-natal study in rats, reduced viability of the offspring was observed at doses that were toxic to the \ndams. \n \nRivaroxaban was tested in juvenile rats up to 3-month treatment duration starting at postnatal day 4 \nshowing a non dose-related increase in periinsular haemorrhage. No evidence of target organ-specific \ntoxicity was seen.  \n \n \n\n\n\n159 \n\n6.

Gastric placement of the \ntube should be confirmed before administering Xarelto. Since rivaroxaban absorption is dependent on \nthe site of active substance release, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the stomach should be \navoided, as this can result in reduced absorption and thereby, reduced active substance exposure. After \nthe administration, the feeding tube should be flushed with water. This should then be immediately \nfollowed by nasogastric or gastric feeding. \n \n \n7.

What Xarelto is and what it is used for \n \nYou have been given Xarelto because  \n\n- you have been diagnosed with an acute coronary syndrome (a group of conditions that \nincludes heart attack and unstable angina, a severe type of chest pain) and have been \nshown to have had an increase in certain cardiac blood tests. \nXarelto reduces the risk in adults of having another heart attack or reduces the risk of \ndying from a disease related to your heart or your blood vessels. \nXarelto will not be given to you on its own. Your doctor will also tell you to take either: \n\uf0b7 acetylsalicylic acid or \n\uf0b7 acetylsalicylic acid plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine. \n \nor  \n\n \n- you have been diagnosed with a high risk of getting a blood clot due to a coronary artery \n\ndisease or peripheral artery disease which causes symptoms.  \nXarelto reduces the risk in adults of getting blot clots (atherothrombotic events).  \nXarelto will not be given to you on its own. Your doctor will also tell you to take \nacetylsalicylic acid. \n\n \nXarelto contains the active substance rivaroxaban and belongs to a group of medicines called \nantithrombotic agents. It works by blocking a blood clotting factor (factor Xa) and thus reducing the \ntendency of the blood to form clots.  \n \n \n\n\n\n234 \n\n2.

How to take Xarelto \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nHow much to take \nThe recommended dose is one 2.5 mg tablet twice a day. Take Xarelto around the same time every day \n(for example, one tablet in the morning and one in the evening). This medicine can be taken with or \nwithout food.  \n \nIf you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take \nXarelto. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately before you take \nit.  \nIf necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Xarelto tablet through a stomach tube. \n \nXarelto will not be given to you on its own. \nYour doctor will also tell you to take acetylsalicylic acid. If you get Xarelto after an acute coronary \nsyndrome, your doctor may tell you to also take clopidogrel or ticlopidine. \n \nYour doctor will tell you how much of these to take (usually between 75 to 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid \ndaily or a daily dose of 75 to 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid plus a daily dose of either 75 mg clopidogrel \nor a standard daily dose of ticlopidine). \n \nWhen to start Xarelto \nTreatment with Xarelto after an acute coronary syndrome should be started as soon as possible after \nstabilisation of the acute coronary syndrome, at the earliest 24 hours after admission to hospital and at \nthe time when parenteral (via injection) anticoagulation therapy would normally be stopped. \nYour doctor will tell you when to start treatment with Xarelto if you have been diagnosed with \ncoronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. \nYour doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment. \n \nIf you take more Xarelto than you should \n16TContact your doctor immediately 16T if you have taken too many Xarelto tablets. Taking too much Xarelto \nincreases the risk of bleeding.  \n \nIf you forget to take Xarelto  \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. If you miss a dose, take your next dose at the \nusual time. \n \nIf you stop taking Xarelto \nTake Xarelto on a regular basis and for as long as your doctor keeps prescribing it.  \n \nDo not stop taking Xarelto without talking to your doctor first. If you stop taking this medicine, it may \nincrease your risk of having another heart attack or stroke or dying from a disease related to your heart \nor your blood vessels. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n237 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Xarelto can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nLike other similar medicines to reduce the formation of blood clots, Xarelto may cause bleeding which \nmay potentially be life threatening.

What Xarelto is and what it is used for \n \nXarelto contains the active substance rivaroxaban and is used in adults to  \n-  prevent blood clots in the veins after a hip or knee replacement operation. Your doctor has \n\nprescribed this medicine for you because after an operation you are at an increased risk of \ngetting blood clots. \n\n-  treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of \nyour lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood \nvessels of your legs and/or lungs. \n\n \nXarelto belongs to a group of medicines called antithrombotic agents. It works by blocking a blood \nclotting factor (factor Xa) and thus reducing the tendency of the blood to form clots.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Xarelto \n \nDo not take Xarelto \n- 16Tif you are allergic16T to rivaroxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- 16Tif you are bleeding excessively \n16T- if you have a disease or condition in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious \n\nbleeding (e.g. stomach ulcer, injury or bleeding in the brain, recent surgery of the brain or eyes) \n- if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban or \n\nheparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin through a \nvenous or arterial line to keep it open \n\n- 16Tif you have a liver disease16T which leads to an increased risk of bleeding \n- 16Tif you are pregnant or breast-feeding \n16TDo not take Xarelto 16T 16Tand tell your doctor16T if any of these apply to you. \n \n\n\n\n243 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Xarelto. \n \nTake special care with Xarelto \n\uf0b7 if you have 16Tan increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case in situations16T such as: \n\n\u25aa 16T moderate or severe kidney disease16T, since your kidney function may affect the amount of \nmedicine that works in your body \n\n\u25aa if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, \napixaban or heparin), when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin \nthrough a venous or arterial line to keep it open (see section \u201cOther medicines and \nXarelto\u201d) \n\n\u25aa 16Tbleeding disorders16T  \n\u25aa 16Tvery high blood pressure,16T not controlled by medical treatment \n\u25aa diseases of your stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the \n\nbowels or stomach, or inflammation of the oesophagus (gullet), e.g. due to \ngastroesophageal reflux disease (disease where stomach acid goes upwards into the \noesophagus) \n\n\u25aa 16Ta problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes16T (retinopathy) \n\u25aa a lung disease where your bronchi are widened and filled with pus (bronchiectasis), or \n\nprevious bleeding from your lung \n\uf0b7 if you have a prosthetic heart valve \n\uf0b7 if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the \n\nimmune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if \nthe treatment may need to be changed. \n\n\uf0b7 if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or surgical \nprocedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned. \n\n \n16TIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor 16Tbefore you take Xarelto. Your doctor will decide, \nif you should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer observation.  \n \nIf you need to have an operation \n\uf0b7 it is very important to take Xarelto before and after the operation exactly at the times you have \n\nbeen told by your doctor.  \n\uf0b7 If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for epidural or \n\nspinal anaesthesia or pain reduction):  \n\u25aa it is very important to take Xarelto exactly at the times you have been told by your doctor  \n\u25aa tell your doctor immediately if you get numbness or weakness of your legs or problems \n\nwith your bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia, because urgent care is necessary. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nXarelto 10 mg tablets are 16Tnot recommended for people under 18 years of age.16T There is not enough \ninformation on their use in children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Xarelto \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \n\n\n\n244 \n\n\uf0b7 If you are taking \n\uf0a7 some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, \n\nposaconazole), unless they are only applied to the skin \n\uf0a7 ketoconazole tablets (used to treat Cushing\u2019s syndrome - when the body produces an \n\nexcess of cortisol) \n\uf0a7 some medicines for bacterial infections (e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin)  \n\uf0a7 some anti-viral medicines for HIV / AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) \n\uf0a7 other medicines to reduce blood clotting (e.g. enoxaparin, clopidogrel or vitamin K \n\nantagonists such as warfarin and acenocoumarol)  \n\uf0a7 anti-inflammatory and pain relieving medicines (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic acid) \n\uf0a7 dronedarone, a medicine to treat abnormal heart beat \n\uf0a7 some medicines to treat depression (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or \n\nserotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)) \n \n\n16TIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor16T before taking Xarelto, because the effect of \nXarelto may be increased. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with this medicine \nand if you should be kept under closer observation.  \n16TIf your doctor thinks that you are at increased risk of developing stomach or bowel ulcers, he \nmay also use a preventative ulcer treatment. \n\n \n\uf0b7 - If you are taking \n\n\uf0a7 some medicines for treatment of epilepsy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) \n\uf0a7 St John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used for depression \n\uf0a7 rifampicin, an antibiotic \n\n \n16TIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor16T before taking Xarelto, because the effect of \nXarelto may be reduced.

How to take Xarelto \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nHow much to take \n- To prevent blood clots in the veins after a hip or knee replacement operation \n\n16TThe recommended dose is one tablet Xarelto 10 mg once a day16T.  \n \n- To treat blood clots in the veins of your legs and blood clots in the blood vessels of your lungs, \n\nand for preventing blood clots from re-occurring \n\n\n\n245 \n\nAfter at least 6 months blood clot treatment, the recommended dose is either one 10 mg tablet \nonce a day or one 20 mg tablet once a day. Your doctor has prescribed you Xarelto 10 mg once \na day.  \n\n \nSwallow the tablet preferably with water. \nXarelto can be taken with or without food. \n \nIf you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take \nXarelto. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately before you take \nit.  \nIf necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Xarelto tablet through a stomach tube. \n \nWhen to take Xarelto \nTake the tablet every day until your doctor tells you to stop.  \nTry to take the tablet at the same time every day to help you to remember it. \nYour doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment.  \n \nTo prevent blood clots in the veins after a hip or knee replacement operation: \n16TTake the first tablet 6 - 10 hours after your operation.  \n16TIf you have had a major hip operation 16Tyou will usually take the tablets for 5 weeks.  \n16TIf you have had a major knee operation 16T you will usually take the tablets for 2 weeks. \n \nIf you take more Xarelto than you should \n16TContact your doctor immediately 16T if you have taken too many Xarelto tablets. Taking too much Xarelto \nincreases the risk of bleeding.  \n \nIf you forget to take Xarelto  \nIf you have missed a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Take the next tablet on the following day \nand then carry on taking a tablet once a day as normal.  \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n \nIf you stop taking Xarelto  \nDo not stop taking Xarelto without talking to your doctor first, because Xarelto prevents the \ndevelopment of a serious condition. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

What Xarelto is and what it is used for \n \nXarelto contains the active substance rivaroxaban.  \nXarelto is used in adults to:  \n- prevent blood clots in brain (stroke) and other blood vessels in your body if you have a form of \n\nirregular heart rhythm called non-valvular atrial fibrillation.  \n- treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of \n\nyour lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood \nvessels of your legs and/or lungs. \n\nXarelto is used in children and adolescents below 18 years and with a body weight of 30 kg or more \nto:  \n- treat blood clots and prevent re-occurrence of blood clots in the veins or in the blood vessels of \n\nthe lungs, following initial treatment of at least 5 days with injectable medicines used to treat \nblood clots.  \n\n \nXarelto belongs to a group of medicines called antithrombotic agents. It works by blocking a blood \nclotting factor (factor Xa) and thus reducing the tendency of the blood to form clots.  \n \n \n\n\n\n252 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Xarelto \n \nDo not take Xarelto \n- 16Tif you are allergic16T to rivaroxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- 16Tif you are bleeding excessively \n- 16Tif you have a disease or condition in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious \n\nbleeding (e.g. stomach ulcer, injury or bleeding in the brain, recent surgery of the brain or eyes) \n- if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban or \n\nheparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin through a \nvenous or arterial line to keep it open. \n\n- 16Tif you have a liver disease16T which leads to an increased risk of bleeding \n- 16Tif you are pregnant or are breast-feeding \n16TDo not take Xarelto 16T 16Tand tell your doctor16T if any of these apply to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Xarelto. \n \nTake special care with Xarelto \n\uf0b7 if you have 16Tan increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case in situations16T such as: \n\n\u25aa severe kidney disease for adults, and moderate or severe kidney disease for children and \nadolescents, since your kidney function may affect the amount of medicine that works in \nyour body \n\n\u25aa if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, \napixaban or heparin), when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin \nthrough a venous or arterial line to keep it open (see section \u201cOther medicines and \nXarelto\u201d) \n\n\u25aa 16Tbleeding disorders16T  \n\u25aa 16Tvery high blood pressure,16T not controlled by medical treatment \n\u25aa diseases of your stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the \n\nbowels or stomach, or inflammation of the oesophagus (gullet), e.g. due to \ngastroesophageal reflux disease (disease where stomach acid goes upwards into the \noesophagus) \n\n\u25aa 16Ta problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes16T (retinopathy) \n\u25aa a lung disease where your bronchi are widened and filled with pus (bronchiectasis), or \n\nprevious bleeding from your lung \n\uf0b7 if you have a prosthetic heart valve \n\uf0b7 if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the \n\nimmune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if \nthe treatment may need to be changed. \n\n\uf0b7 if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or surgical \nprocedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned \n\n \n16TIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor 16Tbefore you take Xarelto. Your doctor will decide, \nif you should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer observation.  \n \nIf you need to have an operation \n\uf0b7 it is very important to take Xarelto before and after the operation exactly at the times you have \n\nbeen told by your doctor. \n\uf0b7 If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for epidural or \n\nspinal anaesthesia or pain reduction): \n\uf0a7 16Tit is very important to take Xarelto before and after the injection or removal of the catheter \n\nexactly at the times you have been told by your doctor \n\uf0a7 tell your doctor immediately if you get numbness or weakness of your legs or problems \n\nwith your bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia, because urgent care is necessary. \n \n\n\n\n253 \n\n16TChildren and adolescents \nXarelto tablets are16T not recommended for children with a body weight below 30 kg.16T  \nThere is not enough information on the use of Xarelto in children and adolescents in the adult \nindications.  \n \nOther medicines and Xarelto \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\uf0b7 If you are taking \n\n\uf0a7 some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, \nposaconazole), unless they are only applied to the skin \n\n\uf0a7 ketoconazole tablets (used to treat Cushing\u2019s syndrome - when the body produces an \nexcess of cortisol) \n\n\uf0a7 some medicines for bacterial infections (e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin)  \n\uf0a7 some anti-viral medicines for HIV / AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) \n\uf0a7 other medicines to reduce blood clotting (e.g. enoxaparin, clopidogrel or vitamin K \n\nantagonists such as warfarin and acenocoumarol)  \n\uf0a7 anti-inflammatory and pain relieving medicines (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic acid) \n\uf0a7 dronedarone, a medicine to treat abnormal heart beat \n\uf0a7 some medicines to treat depression (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or \n\nserotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)) \n \n16TIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor16T before taking Xarelto, because the effect of \nXarelto may be increased. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with this medicine \nand if you should be kept under closer observation.  \n16TIf your doctor thinks that you are at increased risk of developing stomach or bowel ulcers, he \nmay also use a preventative ulcer treatment.  \n \n\n\uf0b7 If you are taking \n\uf0a7 some medicines for treatment of epilepsy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) \n\uf0a7 St John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used for depression \n\uf0a7 rifampicin, an antibiotic \n \n16TIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor16T before taking Xarelto, because the effect of \nXarelto may be reduced. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with Xarelto and if \nyou should be kept under closer observation.  \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take Xarelto16T if you are pregnant or breast-feeding16T. If there is a chance that you could become \npregnant, use a reliable contraceptive while you are taking Xarelto. If you become pregnant while you \nare taking this medicine, tell your doctor immediately, who will decide how you should be treated. \n \nDriving and using machines \nXarelto may cause dizziness (common side effect) or fainting (uncommon side effect) (see section 4, \n\u201dPossible side effects\u201d). You should not drive, ride a bicycle or use any tools or machines if you are \naffected by these symptoms.  \n \nXarelto contains lactose and sodium \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u201csodium-\nfree\u201d. \n \n \n\n\n\n254 \n\n3. How to take Xarelto \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nYou must take Xarelto together with a meal.  \nSwallow the tablet(s) preferably with water. \n \nIf you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take \nXarelto. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately before you take \nit. This mixture should be immediately followed by food. \nIf necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Xarelto tablet through a stomach tube. \n \nHow much to take \n\uf0b7 Adults \n\n\uf0a7 To prevent blood clots in brain (stroke) and other blood vessels in your body \nThe recommended dose is one tablet Xarelto 20 mg once a day.  \nIf you have kidney problems, the dose may be reduced to one tablet Xarelto 15 mg once a \nday.  \n \nIf you need a procedure to treat blocked blood vessels in your heart (called a \npercutaneous coronary intervention - PCI with an insertion of a stent), there is limited \nevidence to reduce the dose to one tablet Xarelto 15 mg once a day (or to one tablet \nXarelto 10 mg once a day in case your kidneys are not working properly) in addition to an \nantiplatelet medicine such as clopidogrel. \n\n \n\uf0a7 To treat blood clots in the veins of your legs and blood clots in the blood vessels of your \n\nlungs, and for preventing blood clots from re-occurring \nThe recommended dose is one tablet Xarelto 15 mg twice a day for the first 3 weeks. For \ntreatment after 3 weeks, the recommended dose is one tablet Xarelto 20 mg once a day.  \nAfter at least 6 months blood clot treatment your doctor may decide to continue treatment \nwith either one 10 mg tablet once a day or one 20 mg tablet once a day. \nIf you have kidney problems and take one tablet Xarelto 20 mg once a day, your doctor \nmay decide to reduce the dose for the treatment after 3 weeks to one tablet Xarelto 15 mg \nonce a day if the risk for bleeding is greater than the risk for having another blood clot.  \n\n \n\uf0b7 Children and adolescents  \n\nThe dose of Xarelto depends on the body weight, and will be calculated by the doctor.  \n\uf0a7 The recommended dose for children and adolescents with a body weight between 30 kg \n\nand less than 50 kg is one Xarelto 15 mg tablet once a day. \n\uf0a7 The recommended dose for children and adolescents with a body weight of 50 kg or \n\nmore is one Xarelto 20 mg tablet once a day.  \nTake each Xarelto dose with a drink (e.g. water or juice) during a meal. Take the tablets every \nday at approximately the same time. Consider setting an alarm to remind you. \nFor parents or caregivers: please observe the child to ensure the full dose is taken.  \n \nAs the Xarelto dose is based on body weight it is important to keep scheduled doctor\u2019s visits \nbecause the dose may need to be adjusted as the weight changes. \nNever adjust the dose of Xarelto by yourself. The doctor will adjust the dose if necessary. \n \nDo not split the tablet in an attempt to provide a fraction of a tablet dose. If a lower dose is \nrequired please use the alternative presentation of Xarelto granules for oral suspension. \nFor children and adolescents who are unable to swallow tablets whole, please use Xarelto \ngranules for oral suspension.  \nIf the oral suspension is not available, you may crush the Xarelto tablet and mix with water or \napple puree immediately before taking. Take some food after taking this mixture. If necessary, \nyour doctor may also give the crushed Xarelto tablet through a stomach tube. \n\n\n\n255 \n\n \nIf you spit up the dose or vomit \n\uf0b7 less than 30 minutes after you have taken Xarelto, take a new dose.  \n\uf0b7 more than 30 minutes after you have taken Xarelto, do not take a new dose. In this case, \n\ntake the next Xarelto dose at the usual time. \n \nContact the doctor if you repeatedly spit up the dose or vomit after taking Xarelto. \n\n \nWhen to take Xarelto \nTake the tablet(s) every day until your doctor tells you to stop.  \nTry to take the tablet(s) at the same time every day to help you to remember it. \nYour doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment.  \n \nTo prevent blood clots in the brain (stroke) and other blood vessels in your body: \nIf your heart beat needs to be restored to normal by a procedure called cardioversion, take Xarelto at \nthe times your doctor tells you. \n \nIf you forget to take Xarelto \n- Adults, children and adolescents:  \n\nIf you are taking one 20 mg tablet or one 15 mg tablet once a day and have missed a dose, take \nit as soon as you remember. Do not take more than one tablet in a single day to make up for a \nforgotten dose. Take the next tablet on the following day and then carry on taking one tablet \nonce a day. \n\n \n- Adults: \n\nIf you are taking one 15 mg tablet twice a day and have missed a dose, take it as soon as you \nremember. Do not take more than two 15 mg tablets in a single day. If you forget to take a dose \nyou can take two 15 mg tablets at the same time to get a total of two tablets (30 mg) on one day. \nOn the following day you should carry on taking one 15 mg tablet twice a day. \n\n \nIf you take more Xarelto than you should \n16TContact your doctor immediately 16T if you have taken too many Xarelto tablets. Taking too much Xarelto \nincreases the risk of bleeding.  \n \nIf you stop taking Xarelto \nDo not stop taking Xarelto without talking to your doctor first, because Xarelto treats and prevents \nserious conditions.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Xarelto can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nLike other similar medicines to reduce the formation of blood clots, Xarelto may cause bleeding which \nmay potentially be life threatening. Excessive bleeding may lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure \n(shock).

What Xarelto is and what it is used for \n \nXarelto contains the active substance rivaroxaban and is used in adults to:  \n- treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of \n\nyour lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood \nvessels of your legs and/or lungs. \n\n \nXarelto belongs to a group of medicines called antithrombotic agents. It works by blocking a blood \nclotting factor (factor Xa) and thus reducing the tendency of the blood to form clots.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Xarelto \n \nDo not take Xarelto \n- 16Tif you are allergic16T to rivaroxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- 16Tif you are bleeding excessively \n- 16Tif you have a disease or condition in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious \n\nbleeding (e.g. stomach ulcer, injury or bleeding in the brain, recent surgery of the brain or eyes) \n- if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban or \n\nheparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin through a \nvenous or arterial line to keep it open. \n\n- 16Tif you have a liver disease16T which leads to an increased risk of bleeding \n- 16Tif you are pregnant or breast-feeding \n16TDo not take Xarelto 16T 16Tand tell your doctor16T if any of these apply to you. \n\n\n\n263 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Xarelto. \n \nTake special care with Xarelto \n\uf0b7 if you have 16Tan increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case in situations16T such as: \n\n\u25aa severe kidney disease, since your kidney function may affect the amount of medicine that \nworks in your body \n\n\u25aa if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, \napixaban or heparin), when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin \nthrough a venous or arterial line to keep it open (see section \u201cOther medicines and \nXarelto\u201d) \n\n\u25aa 16Tbleeding disorders16T  \n\u25aa 16Tvery high blood pressure,16T not controlled by medical treatment \n\u25aa diseases of your stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the \n\nbowels or stomach, or inflammation of the oesophagus (gullet), e.g. due to \ngastroesophageal reflux disease (disease where stomach acid goes upwards into the \noesophagus) \n\n\u25aa 16Ta problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes16T (retinopathy) \n\u25aa a lung disease where your bronchi are widened and filled with pus (bronchiectasis), or \n\nprevious bleeding from your lung \n\uf0b7 if you have a prosthetic heart valve \n\uf0b7 if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the \n\nimmune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if \nthe treatment may need to be changed. \n\n\uf0b7 if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or surgical \nprocedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned \n\n \n16TIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor 16Tbefore you take Xarelto. Your doctor will decide, \nif you should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer observation.  \n \nIf you need to have an operation \n\uf0b7 it is very important to take Xarelto before and after the operation exactly at the times you have \n\nbeen told by your doctor. \n\uf0b7 If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for epidural or \n\nspinal anaesthesia or pain reduction): \n\uf0a7 16Tit is very important to take Xarelto before and after the injection or removal of the catheter \n\nexactly at the times you have been told by your doctor \n\uf0a7 tell your doctor immediately if you get numbness or weakness of your legs or problems \n\nwith your bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia, because urgent care is necessary. \n \n16TChildren and adolescents \nXarelto treatment initiation pack is 16Tnot recommended for people under 18 years of age as it is \n16Tspecifically designed for initiation of treatment in adult patients and is not appropriate for use in \nchildren and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Xarelto \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n\n\n264 \n\n\uf0b7 If you are taking \n\uf0a7 some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, \n\nposaconazole), unless they are only applied to the skin \n\uf0a7 ketoconazole tablets (used to treat Cushing\u2019s syndrome - when the body produces an \n\nexcess of cortisol) \n\uf0a7 some medicines for bacterial infections (e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin)  \n\uf0a7 some anti-viral medicines for HIV / AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) \n\uf0a7 other medicines to reduce blood clotting (e.g. enoxaparin, clopidogrel or vitamin K \n\nantagonists such as warfarin and acenocoumarol)  \n\uf0a7 anti-inflammatory and pain relieving medicines (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic acid) \n\uf0a7 dronedarone, a medicine to treat abnormal heart beat \n\uf0a7 some medicines to treat depression (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or \n\nserotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)) \n16TIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor16T before taking Xarelto, because the effect of \nXarelto may be increased. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with this medicine \nand if you should be kept under closer observation.  \n16TIf your doctor thinks that you are at increased risk of developing stomach or bowel ulcers, he \nmay also use a preventative ulcer treatment.  \n \n\n\uf0b7 If you are taking \n\uf0a7 some medicines for treatment of epilepsy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) \n\uf0a7 St John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used for depression \n\uf0a7 rifampicin, an antibiotic \n \n16TIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor16T before taking Xarelto, because the effect of \nXarelto may be reduced.

You should not drive, ride a bicycle or use any tools or machines if you are \naffected by these symptoms.  \n \nXarelto contains lactose and sodium \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u201csodium-\nfree\u201d. \n \n \n3. How to take Xarelto \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nYou must take Xarelto together with a meal.  \nSwallow the tablet(s) preferably with water. \n \nIf you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take \nXarelto. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately before you take \nit. This mixture should be immediately followed by food. \nIf necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Xarelto tablet through a stomach tube. \n\n\n\n265 \n\n \nHow much to take \nThe recommended dose is one tablet Xarelto 15 mg twice a day for the first 3 weeks. For treatment \nafter 3 weeks, the recommended dose is one tablet Xarelto 20 mg once a day.  \nThis Xarelto 15 mg and 20 mg treatment initiation pack is only for the first 4 weeks of treatment.  \nUpon completion of this pack, treatment will continue on Xarelto 20 mg once daily as your doctor has \ntold you.  \nIf you have kidney problems, your doctor may decide to reduce the dose for the treatment after 3 \nweeks to one tablet Xarelto 15 mg once a day if the risk for bleeding is greater than the risk for having \nanother blood clot.  \n \nWhen to take Xarelto \nTake the tablet(s) every day until your doctor tells you to stop.  \nTry to take the tablet(s) at the same time every day to help you to remember it. \nYour doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment.  \n \nIf you take more Xarelto than you should \n16TContact your doctor immediately 16T if you have taken too many Xarelto tablets. Taking too much Xarelto \nincreases the risk of bleeding.  \n \nIf you forget to take Xarelto \n- If you are taking one 15 mg tablet twice a day and have missed a dose, take it as soon as you \n\nremember. Do not take more than two 15 mg tablets in a single day. If you forget to take a dose \nyou can take two 15 mg tablets at the same time to get a total of two tablets (30 mg) on one day. \nOn the following day you should carry on taking one 15 mg tablet twice a day. \n \n\n- If you are taking one 20 mg tablet once a day and have missed a dose, take it as soon as you \nremember. Do not take more than one tablet in a single day to make up for a forgotten dose. \nTake the next tablet on the following day and then carry on taking one tablet once a day. \n\n \nIf you stop taking Xarelto \nDo not stop taking Xarelto without talking to your doctor first, because Xarelto treats and prevents \nserious conditions.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Xarelto can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nLike other similar medicines to reduce the formation of blood clots, Xarelto may cause bleeding which \nmay potentially be life threatening. Excessive bleeding may lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure \n(shock). In some cases the bleeding may not be obvious. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following side effects: \n\uf0b7 Signs of bleeding \n\n- bleeding into the brain or inside the skull (symptoms can include headache, one-sided \nweakness, vomiting, seizures, decreased level of consciousness, and neck stiffness. \nA serious medical emergency.

What Xarelto is and what it is used for \n \nXarelto contains the active substance rivaroxaban. \nXarelto belongs to a group of medicines called antithrombotic agents. It works by blocking a blood \nclotting factor (factor Xa) and thus reducing the tendency of the blood to form clots. \n \nXarelto is used in full-term newborn babies, infants and toddlers, children and adolescents below \n18 years to: \n- treat blood clots and prevent re-occurrence of blood clots in the veins or in the blood vessels of \n\nthe lungs, following an initial treatment of at least 5 days with injectable medicines used to treat \nblood clots. \n\n \nRead and follow the Instructions for Use provided with this medicine because it will show you how to \nprepare and take or give Xarelto oral suspension. \n \n \n\n\n\n272 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take or give Xarelto \n \nDo not take or give Xarelto if you or the child  \n- 16Tare allergic16T to rivaroxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n- 16Tare bleeding excessively \n- 16Thave a disease or condition in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious bleeding \n\n(e.g. stomach ulcer, injury or bleeding in the brain, recent surgery of the brain or eyes) \n- are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban or heparin), \n\nexcept \n\u2022 when changing medicines to prevent blood clotting or  \n\u2022 while getting heparin through a venous or arterial line to keep it open. \n\n- 16Thave a liver disease16T associated with an increased risk of bleeding \n- 16Tare pregnant or breast-feeding \n16TDo not take or give Xarelto 16T 16Tand tell your doctor16T if any of these apply to you or the child. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Xarelto if: \n\uf0b7 you or the child have 16Tan increased risk of bleeding. This could be the case in situations16T such as: \n\n\u25aa moderate or severe kidney disease; as the kidney function may affect the amount of \nmedicine that works in the body \n\n\u25aa if you or the child are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, \ndabigatran, apixaban or heparin), if these are absolutely necessary (see section \u201cDo not \ntake or give Xarelto\u201d) \n\n\u25aa 16Tbleeding disorders \n\u25aa 16Tvery high blood pressure,16T not controlled by medical treatment \n\u25aa diseases of stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the \n\nbowels or stomach, or inflammation of the food pipe due to a disease where stomach acid \ngoes upwards into the food pipe \n\n\u25aa 16Ta problem with the blood vessels in the back of the eyes 16T (retinopathy) \n\u25aa a lung disease where the bronchi are widened and filled with pus (bronchiectasis), or \n\nprevious bleeding from the lung \n\uf0b7 you or the child have a prosthetic heart valve \n\uf0b7 you or the child have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the immune \n\nsystem that causes an increased risk of blood clots) \n\uf0b7 your or the child\u2019s blood pressure is unstable  \n\uf0b7 another treatment or surgical procedure is planned to remove the blood clot from the lungs  \n \n16TIf any of the above apply to you or to the child, tell your doctor 16Tbefore you take or give Xarelto. The \ndoctor will decide, if you or the child should be treated with this medicine and should be kept under \ncloser observation.  \n \nDo not give Xarelto to children under 6 months of age who  \n- were born before 37 weeks of pregnancy, or \n- weigh less than 2.6 kg, or \n- had less than 10 days of breast or formula feeding \nIn these cases, dosing of Xarelto cannot be reliably determined and has not been studied in these \nchildren. \n \nIf you or the child need to have an operation \n\uf0b7 It is very important to take or give Xarelto before and after the operation exactly at the times \n\nyour doctor has told you. \n\uf0b7 If the operation involves a catheter or injection into the spinal column (e.g. for epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia or pain reduction): \n\uf0a7 16Tit is very important to take or give Xarelto before and after the injection or removal of the \n\ncatheter exactly at the times your doctor has told you  \n\n\n\n273 \n\n\uf0a7 tell your doctor immediately if you or the child get numbness or weakness of the legs or \nproblems with the bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia. In this case, urgent care is \nnecessary. \n\n \n16TChildren and adolescents \nXarelto oral suspension is to be used for patients below 18 years to treat blood clots and prevent \nre-occurrence of blood clots in the veins or in the blood vessels of the lungs. There is not enough \ninformation on its use in children and adolescents in other indications. \n \nOther medicines and Xarelto \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child are taking, have recently taken or might take any \nother medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\uf0b7 If you or the child are taking: \n\n\uf0a7 some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, \nposaconazole), unless they are only applied to the skin \n\n\uf0a7 ketoconazole tablets (used to treat Cushing\u2019s syndrome - when the body produces an \nexcess of cortisol) \n\n\uf0a7 some medicines for bacterial infections (e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin)  \n\uf0a7 some medicines for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) \n\uf0a7 other medicines to reduce blood clotting (e.g. enoxaparin, clopidogrel or vitamin K \n\nantagonists such as warfarin and acenocoumarol)  \n\uf0a7 medicines to relieve inflammation and pain (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic acid) \n\uf0a7 dronedarone, a medicine to treat abnormal heart beat \n\uf0a7 some medicines to treat depression (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or \n\nserotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) \n \n16TIf any of the above apply to you or the child, tell your doctor16T before taking or giving Xarelto, \nbecause the effect of Xarelto may be increased. Your doctor will decide, if you or the child \nshould be treated with this medicine and should be kept under closer observation. \n16TIf the doctor thinks that you or the child are at increased risk of developing stomach or bowel \nulcers, a preventive ulcer treatment might be necessary.  \n \n\n\uf0b7 If you or the child are taking: \n\uf0a7 some medicines to treat epilepsy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) \n\uf0a7 St John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used for depression \n\uf0a7 rifampicin, an antibiotic \n \n16TIf any of the above apply to you or the child, tell your doctor16T before taking or giving Xarelto, \nbecause the effect of Xarelto may be reduced. The doctor will decide, if you or the child should \nbe treated with Xarelto and should be kept under closer observation.  \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\u2022 If you or the adolescent are pregnant or breast-feeding do not take or give Xarelto.  \n\u2022 If there is a chance that you or the adolescent could become pregnant, a reliable contraceptive \n\nshould be used while taking Xarelto.  \n\u2022 If you or the adolescent become pregnant while taking this medicine, tell your doctor \n\nimmediately, who will decide how the treatment should be continued. \n \nDriving and using machines \nXarelto may cause dizziness or fainting. You or the child should not drive, ride a bicycle or use any \ntools or machines if affected by these symptoms.  \n \nXarelto contains sodium benzoate and sodium \nThis medicine contains 1.8 mg sodium benzoate (E 211) in each mL oral suspension. Sodium benzoate \n(E 211) may increase jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies (up to 4 weeks old). \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per millilitre, that is to say essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n\n\n\n274 \n\n \n \n3. How to take or give Xarelto \n \nAlways take this medicine or give this medicine to the child exactly as your doctor has told you. \nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nMake sure that the correct information on how much and how often to take or give Xarelto is written \non the designated area of the carton. If not, ask your pharmacist or doctor to provide the relevant \ninformation.  \n \nInstructions for Use \nFor how to prepare and take or give the Xarelto oral suspension:   \n- See the Instructions for Use booklet included in the carton and  \n- Watch the educational video which you can access via the QR code which is displayed on the \n\nPatient Alert Card that is provided with this medicine.  \n \nHow to take or give  \nTake or give Xarelto oral suspension with feeding (breast milk or formula feeding) or with a meal. \nEach Xarelto dose has to be swallowed along with one typical serving of liquid (for example 20 mL in \nchildren aged 6 months up to 240 mL in adolescents). This typical serving may include usual amount \nof drink used for feeding (e.g. breast milk, infant formula, nutrition drink). \n \nYour doctor may give the oral suspension also via a stomach tube. \n \nHow much to take or give \nThe dose of Xarelto depends on the patient\u2019s body weight. It will be calculated by the doctor as an \namount (volume) in millilitres (mL) of the oral suspension. This should be measured out using the \nblue syringe (either 1 mL or 5 mL or 10 mL syringe, see table 1) supplied with this medicine. Your \ndoctor will prescribe the volume required including the particular syringe you should use.  \nYour doctor will tell you how much of the oral suspension you or the child must take. \nBelow is the table that your doctor will use. Do not adjust the dose yourself. \n \nAll materials to prepare and administer the oral suspension are provided with the medicine (except for \ndrinking water.) Only use non-carbonated water to avoid bubbles. Only use the syringe provided to \nadminister Xarelto to ensure accurate dosing. Do not use any other method to administer the solution, \ne.g. alternative syringe, spoon etc. \n \nAs the Xarelto dose is based on body weight it is important to keep scheduled doctor\u2019s visits because \nthe dose may need to be adjusted as the weight changes, especially for children below 12 kg. This \nensures that the child receives the correct dose of Xarelto. \n \n\n\n\n275 \n\nTable 1: Recommended dose for Xarelto in children   \n\nBody weight [kg] Single dose* \nDaily frequency of \nintake  \n\nTotal daily dose*  Suitable blue \nsyringe \n\n2.6 to under 3 0.8 mL \n\n3 times \n\n2.4 mL \n1 mL \n\n3 to under 4 0.9 mL 2.7 mL \n\n4 to under 5 1.4 mL 4.2 mL \n\n5 mL \n\n5 to under 7 1.6 mL 4.8 mL \n7 to under 8 1.8 mL 5.4 mL \n8 to under 9 2.4 mL 7.2 mL \n9 to under 10 2.8 mL 8.4 mL \n10 to under 12 3.0 mL 9.0 mL \n12 to under 30 5.0 mL 2 times 10.0 mL 5 mL or 10 mL \n30 to under 50 15.0 mL \n\nonce \n15.0 mL \n\n10 mL \n50 or more 20.0 mL 20.0 mL \n* 1 mL of the oral suspension corresponds to 1 mg rivaroxaban.  \n\n \nYour doctor may also prescribe tablets if you or the child are able to swallow the tablet and are \nweighing at least 30 kg. \n \nWhen to take or give Xarelto \nTake or give the oral suspension as directed every day until the doctor tells you to stop. \nTake or give the oral suspension at the same time every day to help you to remember it. Consider \nsetting an alarm to remind you.  \nPlease observe the child to ensure the full dose is taken.  \n \nIf the doctor has told you to take or give Xarelto: \n- once a day, do this approximately 24 hours apart \n- twice a day, do this approximately 12 hours apart \n- three times a day, do this approximately 8 hours apart \n \nYour doctor will decide how long you or the child must continue treatment. \n \nIf you or the child spits up the dose or vomits \n- less than 30 minutes after the intake of Xarelto, take or give a new dose.  \n- more than 30 minutes after the intake of Xarelto, do not take or give a new dose. Continue to \n\ntake or give the next Xarelto dose at the next scheduled time. \n \n\nContact the doctor if you or the child repeatedly spit up the dose or vomit after taking Xarelto. \n \nIf you forget to take or give Xarelto  \n- If you are taking or giving Xarelto once a day, take or give the missed Xarelto dose as soon \n\nas you remember on the same day. If this is not possible, skip this dose. Then take or give the \nnext Xarelto dose on the following day. Do not take or give more than one dose per day.  \n\n- If you are taking or giving Xarelto twice a day:  \n\u2022 Missed morning dose: Take or give the missed dose as soon as you remember. You may \n\ntake or give it together with the evening dose.  \n\u2022 Missed evening dose: You may take or give the missed dose only in the same evening. \n\nDo not take or give two doses the next morning.  \n- If you are taking or giving Xarelto three times a day, do not make up for the missed dose. \n\nContinue with the next scheduled dose (given every 8 hours). \n \nOn the day following a missed dose, continue as prescribed by the doctor once, twice or three times a \nday. \n \n\n\n\n276 \n\nIf you take or give more Xarelto than you should \nContact your doctor immediately if you have taken or given too much Xarelto oral suspension. Taking \nor giving too much Xarelto increases the risk of bleeding. \n \nIf you stop taking or giving Xarelto  \nDo not stop Xarelto without talking to your doctor first, because Xarelto treats and prevents serious \nconditions. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nLike other similar medicines to reduce the formation of blood clots, Xarelto may cause bleeding which \nmay potentially be life threatening. Excessive bleeding may lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure \n(shock). In some cases the bleeding may not be obvious. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you or the child experience any of the following side effects: \n\uf0b7 Signs of bleeding \n\n- bleeding into the brain or inside the skull (symptoms can include headache, one-sided \nweakness, vomiting, seizures, decreased level of consciousness, and neck stiffness. \nA serious medical emergency.

That \n\nmeans you can use either \n\uf0a7 fresh tap water or \n\uf0a7 non-carbonated (still) mineral water \n\n\uf0b7 It is very important that the precise amount of water is added to the granules in the bottle to \nensure the correct concentration of Xarelto. \n\uf0a7 Use the water syringe for measurement of 50 mL water, see below for more information. \n\uf0a7 Measure the amount water to be provided to the bottle very carefully. \n\n\uf0b7 After preparation the suspension can be used for 14 days if stored at room temperature.  \nEnsure to write the expiry date of the suspension (date of preparation plus 14 days) on the \ndedicated field on the bottle label. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not store the suspension above 30 \u00b0C. Do not freeze.  \nIf the suspension has been stored in the refrigerator, allow the suspension to adjust to room \ntemperature before extracting the relevant dose. \n\n\uf0b7 Shake the suspension for initial preparation for at least 60 seconds.  \n\uf0b7 Shake the suspension in the bottle for at least 10 seconds before each administration. \n\uf0b7 It is very important that the prescribed dose volume of Xarelto is being administered. \n\n\uf0a7 Make sure that you know the prescribed dose and frequency of administration. Ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you do not know the prescribed dose and frequency.  \n\n\uf0a7 Carefully adjust the blue syringe according the prescribed volume. \n\uf0a7 Administer the prescribed dose by using the blue syringe. Follow the doctor\u2019s instructions \n\n\n\n285 \n\non how often per day you should administer the prescribed dose.   \n\uf0a7 Check for air bubbles in the blue syringe before administration of the oral suspension. \n\n\uf0b7 If your child repeatedly does not take all the required dose or spits some of it out, call your \nchild\u2019s doctor to find out what to do. \n\n\uf0b7 Between dosing, store the oral suspension out of sight and reach of children. \n\uf0b7 Keep the Instructions for Use so that you can refer to them later during the use of Xarelto. \n \nUsing Xarelto  \n \n\uf0b7 Xarelto suspension is for oral use only. \n\uf0b7 Volume and frequency of administration of Xarelto depend on your child\u2019s weight, so it \n\nwill change over time if your child will receive Xarelto for a longer time. \n\uf0a7 Your child's doctor will tell you the right dose volume . \n\uf0a7 Do not change the dose yourself. \n\uf0a7 Always use the volume prescribed by your child's doctor and have the correct dosing of \n\nadministration written on the designated field on the outside of the box. \nIf it is not written on the field, ask your child's doctor or pharmacist to provide the \nrelevant information. \n\n\uf0b7 Follow the detailed Instructions for Use given in the chapters below. \n\uf0b7 Take care to comply with the instructions concerning administration: \n \n\n\uf0a7 Intake: Three times a day \n\uf0a7 Administration: Approximately 8 hours apart with feeding  \n\n \n1. Preparing the oral suspension  \n \nStep 1.1: Preparation \u2013 Get ready \n \nThe preparation of the suspension is done once with every new package.  \nBefore preparing the suspension: \n \n\n \n\na. Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and dry them afterwards \n \n\n \n\nb. Check the expiry date on the label provided on the box. \nDo not use the medicine if the medicine has expired. \n \n\n\n\n286 \n\n c. Obtain the following additional items: \n\uf0a7 Container with at least 150 mL of water: \n\n\uf0b7 Either fresh tap water or non-carbonated (still) mineral \nwater \n\n\uf0b7 Water should be at room temperature \n \n\n \uf0a7 Tissue for soaking up any excess water \n\n \nStep 1.2: Filling the required volume of water \n \nEvery time you start a new pack, use only the new materials contained in the new package. \n \n a. Unpack the water syringe. \n\n \n\n \n\nb. Dip the opening of the water syringe into the container with \nwater. \n\nc. Extract a volume of more than 50 mL. \nTo do this, pull the plunger rod towards you, and make sure \nthat the opening of the water syringe stays below the water \nsurface all the time. This will avoid air bubbles in the syringe. \n\nd. Take the syringe out of the water. \n \n\n e. Turn the water syringe in a way that the opening is facing \nupwards. \n\uf0e0 Any air bubbles will move to the top when holding the \n\nsyringe upwards. \nTap it with your fingers to further move any air bubble to the \ntop. \n\n \n\n \n\nf. Push the plunger rod until the upper ring of the plunger \nreaches the 50 mL mark. \n\uf0e0 When pressing the plunger, water can come out of the tip \nof the water syringe. This waste water can be soaked up with \na tissue. \n\n \n\n\n\n287 \n\n \nStep 1.3: Adding water to the granules \n \n a. If the granules in the bottle appear to be clumpy: \n\n\uf0b7 Gently tap the bottle on your hand. \n\uf0b7 Be careful since the bottle is made of glass. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCautionary Information:  \n\nThe upper ring of the black plunger must be precisely in line \nwith the 50 mL mark to be able to achieve the correct \nconcentration of the suspension. \n \n\n  \n\ng. Continue to hold the water syringe with the opening facing \nupwards and check the water in the syringe carefully: \n\n\uf0b7 for correct volume, \n\uf0b7 for air bubbles. \nSmall air bubbles are uncritical, but big air bubbles are \ncritical. See below for more explanation on what to do. \n\n \n\nh. If the syringe is not loaded correctly or contains too much \nair: \n\n\uf0b7 Empty the water syringe \n\uf0b7 Repeat steps b. to h  \n\n \n\n\n\n288 \n\n \n\nb. Unscrew the child resistant cap of the bottle (push down and \nturn counterclockwise). \n\n \n\n \n\nc. Place the filled water syringe on the upper edge of the bottle \nopening \n\n \n\nd. Hold the bottle firmly. \ne. Press the plunger rod down slowly. \n The full volume of water must be transferred to the \n\nbottle. \nf. Dispose of the water syringe in household waste. \n \n\n \nStep 1.4: Fitting the adapter and mixing the oral suspension \n \nThe adapter is used to fill the blue syringe with suspension. \n\n \n a. Unpack the bottle adapter \n\n \n\n \n\nb. Push the adapter completely into the neck of the bottle  \n \n\n\n\n289 \n\n \n\nc. Close the bottle tightly with the screw cap. \n \n\n \n\nd. Shake the bottle gently for at least 60 seconds. \n\uf0e0 This is intended to provide a well-mixed suspension. \n\n \n\n \n\ne. Check whether the suspension is thoroughly mixed: \n\uf0b7 no clumps \n\uf0b7 no deposit. \n\n \n\nCautionary Information:  \n\nTo guarantee correct dose, the suspension must not contain any \nclumps or deposit. \n \n\n f. If there are clumps or sediment repeat steps d. to f. \n \n\uf0e0 When no clumps or deposits are left, the suspension is \nready for use. \nDo not add more water to the bottle. \nThe suspension has a shelf life of 14 days at room \ntemperature.  \n\n \n\n \n\ng. Write the date of expiry of the just prepared suspension on the \nlabel of the bottle. \nDate of preparation + 14 days \nThe shown pictogram is only an example.  \n \n\n \n2. Setting the prescribed dose with every new blue syringe \n \n\n\n\n290 \n\nTo prevent overdosing or underdosing an exact dose of suspension is required. \nBefore you take the first dose out of the bottle, the enclosed blue syringe must be set up in \naccordance with the dose prescribed by your child's doctor. This information can be found on the \ndedicated area of the box. If no information has been entered here check back with the child's \ndoctor or pharmacist. \nAfter setting the dose the same blue syringe can be used for all administrations from the bottle of \nsuspension prepared in step 1. \nOnce the dose has been fixed on the blue syringe, it cannot be changed. \n \n The blue syringe features a scale (mL). \n\nThe scale of the 1 mL blue syringe starts with 0.2 mL. \nThe graduation marks are in increments of 0.1 mL. \n \nNote: \nDo not remove the peelable label until you are prompted \nin the Instructions for Use. \nThe blue syringe features a red button to adjust the volume. \nThis button is initially covered by a peelable label. \nBy pressing the red button the volume of the syringe is set, \nwhich can only be done once. Do not press the red button \nuntil the Instructions for Use tell you to do so. \nOnce the red button has been pressed, the volume can no \nlonger be adjusted. \n \n\n \n\na. Review the dose provided in the respective field on the \noutside of the box. \n \n\n b. If the information is not available: \nAsk your pharmacist or doctor to provide it. \n\n \n c. Hold the blue syringe with the opening pointing upwards \n\n \n\nd. Pull the plunger rod slowly until the upper margin reaches \nthe mark of the volume to be administered. \n\n\uf0e0 When moving the plunger rod, you can hear a \u201cClick\u201d for \neach adjustable volume step. \n\n \n\nCautionary Information:  \n\nThe upper edge of the plunger must be exactly in line with the \ncorrect mark of the volume to be administered. \n \n \n\n\n\n291 \n\n \n\nThe shown pictogram is only an example. Your volume might \nbe different. \nBe careful, do not pull the plunger past the volume to be \nadministered. \nBe careful, do not press on the label when pulling the plunger. \n \n\n  \n\ne.  Remove the label of the blue syringe completely. \n\uf0e0 You can now see the red button for setting the volume. \nf.  Check the position of the plunger again. Ensure the upper \n\nedge of the plunger is exactly in line with the correct mark \nof the volume to be administered. \n\ng.  If the position of the blue plunger does not match the \nrequired volume:  \nAdjust it accordingly  \n\n \n\n \n\nh. If the position of the blue plunger matches the required \nvolume, push the red button to fix the adjustment. \n\uf0e0 The required dose is now set. \n\uf0e0 Pressing the red button will produce another clicking sound. \n The clicking sound will not be audible afterwards. \n\n \n\nCautionary Information:  \n\nIf you notice that the wrong dose has been selected (the red \nbutton has been pushed, when the plunger was in the wrong \nposition) use the appropriate spare blue syringe. \nRepeat steps a. to h. with a new blue syringe. \n \n\n \n\ni. Push the plunger upwards in the blue syringe as far as it \ngoes. \nThe blue syringe can now be used. \n\n \n3. Administering the oral suspension  \n\n \nFollow the steps described below for each required administration. \n \nStep 3.1: Mixing the oral suspension  \n \n\n\n\n292 \n\n \n\nCautionary Information:  \n\nAllow the suspension to adjust to room temperature if it has been stored in the refrigerator. \n \n\n \n\na. Gently shake the bottle for at least 10 seconds before each \ndose. \n\uf0e0 This is intended to provide a well-mixed suspension. \n\n \n\n \n\nb. Check whether the suspension is mixed thoroughly, i.e.: \n\uf0b7 no clumps \n\uf0b7 no deposit. \n\nc. If there are clumps or deposit:  \nRepeat steps a. and b. \n\n \n\n d. Shaking can lead to formation of foam.  \nLet the bottle stand until the foam dissolves. \n \n\n \n\n \n\ne. Unscrew the bottle cap, but keep the adapter on the top of the \nbottle. \n\nNote: \nThe larger opening visible on the adapter is used to connect the \nblue syringe. \nThe surface of the bottle adapter should be free of liquid. \n\nf. If there is any liquid on the adapter:  \nRemove the liquid with a clean tissue  \n \n\n \nStep 3.2: Extracting the required dose \n \n\n\n\n293 \n\n \n\na. Keep the bottle in the upright position. Insert the tip of the \nblue syringe fully into the large opening of the adapter \n\n \n\nb. Turn the bottle upside down. \nc. Pull the blue plunger rod slowly until it stops (i.e. until the set \n\ndose is reached). \n\n \n\nd. Carefully check for air in the blue syringe.  \nSmaller air bubbles are not critical. \n\n \n\n\n\n294 \n\n \nStep 3.3: Administration of prescribed dose \n \n\n \n\ne. If there are bigger air bubbles: \n\uf0b7 Return the suspension to the bottle by pushing back the \n\nplunger rod into the blue syringe as far as possible. \n\uf0b7 Repeat steps b. to e. \n\nf. Return the bottle to the upright position. \ng. Remove the blue syringe carefully from the adapter \n \n\n  \n\nh. Hold the blue syringe upright and check: \n\uf0b7 that the tip of the blue syringe is filled \n\uf0b7 whether the right dose has been filled into the blue \n\nsyringe \n\uf0b7 that no big air bubbles are present. \n\n \n\n \n\ni. If there are bigger air bubbles or air in the tip: \n\uf0b7 Insert the tip of the blue syringe again fully into the \n\nlarge opening of the adapter \n\uf0b7 Return the suspension to the bottle by pushing back the \n\nplunger rod into the blue syringe as far as it goes. \n\uf0b7 Repeat steps b. to h. until no bigger air bubbles are \n\nvisible. \n \n\nj. Close the bottle with the screw cap. \nAdminister the suspension immediately after filling the blue \nsyringe (step 3.3) \n \n\n\n\n295 \n\n \n\na. Place the blue syringe into the mouth of the patient. \nb. Direct its tip into the cheek to allow for natural swallowing. \nc. Push the plunger rod down slowly until the plunger stops \n\n(blue syringe is completely empty). \nd. Ensure that the patient swallows the entire dose. \n\n \n\nCautionary Information:  \n\nThe patient must swallow the full dose of medicine. \nIf the dose repeatedly is not completely swallowed or if the \npatient is vomiting, consult your doctor for further instructions. \n \n\n \n\ne. Encourage the patient to drink one typical serving of liquid. \n\uf0b7 For an infant of 6 months, for example, this may be \n\n20 mL. \n\uf0b7 This can also be breast-feeding.  \n\n \n\n \n4. Cleaning and storage \n \nThe blue syringe must be cleaned following every application. \nFollow the steps listed below to clean the device. Altogether, three cycles of cleaning are necessary to \nensure proper cleaning. \n \n Before you start, you will need the following equipment for step 4.1: \n\n\uf0b7 Get two containers (such as a cup or bowl) \no one container filled with drinking water, \no the other container empty \n\n \n\n \nStep 4.1: Cleaning \n \n\n \n\na. Dip the tip of the blue syringe into the container of water. \nb. Withdraw water until plunger rod stops. \n\n \n\n\n\n296 \n\n \n\nc.

Preparing the oral suspension  \n \nStep 1.1: Preparation \u2013 Get ready \n \nThe preparation of the suspension is done once with every new package.  \nBefore preparing the suspension: \n \n\n\n\n301 \n\n \n\na. Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and dry them \nafterwards. \n \n\n \n\nb. Check the expiry date on the label provided on the box. \nDo not use the medicine if the medicine has expired. \n \n\n c. Obtain the following additional items: \n\uf0a7 Container with at least 150 mL of water: \n\n\uf0b7 Either fresh tap water or non-carbonated (still) mineral \nwater \n\n\uf0b7 Water should be at room temperature \n \n\n \uf0a7 Tissue for soaking up any excess water \n\n \nStep 1.2: Filling the required volume of water \n \nEvery time you start a new pack, use only the new materials contained in the new package. \n \n a. Unpack the water syringe. \n\n \n\n \n\nb. Dip the opening of the water syringe into the container with \nwater. \n\nc. Extract a volume of more than 100 mL. \nTo do this, pull the plunger rod towards you, and make sure \nthat the opening of the water syringe stays below the water \nsurface all the time. This will avoid air bubbles in the syringe. \n\nd. Take the syringe out of the water. \n \n\n\n\n302 \n\n e. Turn the water syringe in a way that the opening is facing \nupwards. \n\n \uf0e0 Any air bubbles will move to the top when holding the \nsyringe upwards. \n\n Tap it with your fingers to further move any air bubble to the \ntop. \n\n \n\n \n\nf. Push the plunger rod until the upper ring of the plunger \nreaches the 100 mL mark. \n\uf0e0 When pressing the plunger, water can come out of the tip \nof the water syringe. This waste water can be soaked up with a \ntissue. \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nCautionary Information:  \n\nThe upper ring of the black plunger must be precisely in line \nwith the 100 mL mark to be able to achieve the correct \nconcentration of the suspension. \n \n\n \n\ng. Continue to hold the water syringe with the opening facing \nupwards and check the water in the syringe carefully: \n\uf0b7 for correct volume, \n\uf0b7 for air bubbles. \nSmall air bubbles are uncritical, but big air bubbles are \ncritical. See below for more explanation on what to do. \n\n\n\n303 \n\n \nStep 1.3: Adding water to the granules \n \n a. If the granules in the bottle appear to be clumpy: \n\n\uf0b7 Gently tap the bottle on your hand. \n\uf0b7 Be careful since the bottle is made of glass. \n\n \n\n \n\nb. Unscrew the child resistant cap of the bottle (push down and \nturn counterclockwise). \n\n \n\n \n\nc. Place the filled water syringe on the upper edge of the bottle \nopening \n\n \n\nd. Hold the bottle firmly. \ne. Press the plunger rod down slowly. \n The full volume of water must be transferred to the \n\nbottle. \nf. Dispose of the water syringe in household waste. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nh. If the syringe is not loaded correctly or contains too much \nair: \n\uf0b7 Empty the water syringe \n\uf0b7 Repeat steps b. to h  \n\n \n\n\n\n304 \n\nStep 1.4: Fitting the adapter and mixing the oral suspension \n \nThe adapter is used to fill the blue syringe with suspension. \n\n \n a. Unpack the bottle adapter \n\n \n\n \n\nb. Push the adapter completely into the neck of the bottle  \n \n\n \n\nc. Close the bottle tightly with the screw cap. \n \n\n \n\nd. Shake the bottle gently for at least 60 seconds. \n\uf0e0 This is intended to provide a well-mixed suspension. \n\n \n\n \n\ne. Check whether the suspension is thoroughly mixed: \n\uf0b7 no clumps \n\uf0b7 no deposit. \n\n \n\nCautionary Information:  \n\nTo guarantee correct dose, the suspension must not contain any \nclumps or deposit. \n \n\n\n\n305 \n\n f. If there are clumps or sediment repeat steps d. to f. \n \n\uf0e0 When no clumps or deposits are left, the suspension is ready for \nuse. \nDo not add more water to the bottle. \nThe suspension has a shelf life of 14 days at room temperature. \n\n \n\n \n\ng. Write the date of expiry of the just prepared suspension on the label \nof the bottle. \nDate of preparation + 14 days \nThe shown pictogram is only an example.  \n \n\n \n2. Setting the prescribed dose with every new blue syringe  \n \nTo prevent overdosing or underdosing an exact dose of suspension is required. \nBefore you take the first dose out of the bottle, the enclosed blue syringe must be set up in \naccordance with the dose prescribed by your child's doctor. This information can be found on the \ndedicated area of the box. If no information has been entered here check back with the child's \ndoctor or pharmacist. \nAfter setting the dose the same blue syringe can be used for all administrations from the bottle of \nsuspension prepared in step 1. \nOnce the dose has been fixed on the blue syringe, it cannot be changed. \n \nStep 2.1: Selecting a suitable blue syringe \n\n \nDosing devices with different capacities are included in this pack: \n\n \n 5 mL blue syringes for doses from 1 mL to 5 mL \n\n \n 10 mL blue syringes for doses from 5 mL to 10 mL \n\n \n a. Select the suitable blue syringe based on the dose prescribed by \n\nyour child's doctor. \nThe other blue syringes are not needed. \n\nb. Unpack the blue syringe. \nNote: \nDo not remove the peelable label until you are prompted in \nthe Instructions for Use. \nThe blue syringe features a red button to adjust the volume. This \nbutton is initially covered by a peelable label. \nBy pressing the red button the volume of the syringe is set, which \ncan only be done once. Do not press the red button until the \nInstructions for Use tell you to do so. \nOnce the red button has been pressed, the volume can no longer \nbe adjusted. \n\n \n \nStep 2.2: Setting the required dose on new blue syringe \nThe blue syringe features a scale (mL). \n\n\n\n306 \n\nThe scale of the 5 mL blue syringe starts with 1 mL. The graduation marks are in increments of \n0.2 mL. \nThe scale of the 10 mL blue syringe starts with 2 mL. The graduation marks are in increments of \n0.5 mL. \n \n\n \n\na. Review the dose provided in the respective field on the outside of \nthe box. \nNote: \nUse the 10 mL blue syringe for prescribed doses larger than \n10 mL as follows: \nDose of 15 mL: 2 x 7.5 mL blue syringe  \nDose of 20 mL: 2 x 10 mL blue syringe \n\n \n\n b. If the information is not available: \nAsk your pharmacist or doctor to provide it. \n\n \n c. Hold the blue syringe with the opening pointing upwards \n\n \n\nd. Pull the plunger rod slowly until the upper margin reaches the \nmark of the volume to be administered. \n\n\uf0e0 When moving the plunger rod, you can hear a \u201cClick\u201d for each \nadjustable volume step. \n\n \n\nCautionary Information:  \n\nThe upper edge of the plunger must be exactly in line with the \ncorrect mark of the volume to be administered. \n \n \nThe shown pictogram is only an example. Your volume might be \ndifferent. \nBe careful, do not pull the plunger past the volume to be \nadministered. \nBe careful, do not press on the label when pulling the plunger. \n \n\n \n\n  \n\ne. Remove the label of the blue syringe completely. \n\uf0e0 You can now see the red button for setting the volume. \nf. Check the position of the plunger again. Ensure the upper edge of \n\nthe plunger is exactly in line with the correct mark of the volume \nto be administered. \n\ng.  If the position of the blue plunger does not match the required \nvolume:  \nAdjust it accordingly  \n\n \n\n\n\n307 \n\n \n\nh. If the position of the blue plunger matches the required volume, \npush the red button to fix the adjustment. \n\n\uf0e0 The required dose is now set. \n\uf0e0 Pressing the red button will produce another clicking sound. \n\uf0e0 The clicking sound will not be audible afterwards. \n\n \n\nCautionary Information:  \n\nIf you notice that the wrong dose has been selected (the red button \nhas been pushed, when the plunger was in the wrong position) use the \nappropriate spare blue syringe. \nRepeat steps a. to h. with a new blue syringe. \n \n\n \n\ni. Push the plunger upwards in the blue syringe as far as it goes. \nThe blue syringe can now be used. \n\n \n3. Administering the oral suspension  \n \nFollow the steps described below for each required administration. \n \n \nStep 3.1: Mixing the oral suspension  \n \n\n \n\nCautionary Information:  \n\nAllow the suspension to adjust to room temperature if it has been stored in the refrigerator. \n \n\n \n\na. Gently shake the bottle for at least 10 seconds before each \ndose. \n\uf0e0 This is intended to provide a well-mixed suspension. \n\n \n\n\n\n308 \n\n \n\nb. Check whether the suspension is mixed thoroughly, i.e.: \n\uf0b7 no clumps \n\uf0b7 no deposit. \nc. If there are clumps or deposit:  \nRepeat steps a. and b. \n\n \n\n d. Shaking can lead to formation of foam.  \nLet the bottle stand until the foam dissolves. \n \n\n \n\ne. Unscrew the bottle cap, but keep the adapter on the top of the \nbottle. \n\nNote: \nThe larger opening visible on the adapter is used to connect the \nblue syringe. \nThe surface of the bottle adapter should be free of liquid. \n\nf. If there is any liquid on the adapter:  \nRemove the liquid with a clean tissue  \n \n\n \nStep 3.2: Extracting the required dose \n \n\n \n\na. Keep the bottle in the upright position. Insert the tip of the \nblue syringe fully into the large opening of the adapter \n\n\n\n309 \n\n \n\nb. Turn the bottle upside down. \nc. Pull the blue plunger rod slowly until it stops (i.e. until the set \n\ndose is reached). \n\n \n\nd. Carefully check for air in the blue syringe.  \nSmaller air bubbles are not critical. \n\n \n\n \n\ne. If there are bigger air bubbles: \n\uf0b7 Return the suspension to the bottle by pushing back the \n\nplunger rod into the blue syringe as far as possible. \n\uf0b7 Repeat steps b. to e. \n\nf. Return the bottle to the upright position. \ng. Remove the blue syringe carefully from the adapter \n \n\n\n\n310 \n\n \nStep 3.3: Administration of prescribed dose \n \n\n \n\na. Place the blue syringe into the mouth of the patient. \nb. Direct its tip into the cheek to allow for natural swallowing. \nc. Push the plunger rod down slowly until the plunger stops (blue \n\nsyringe is completely empty). \nd. Ensure that the patient swallows the entire dose. \n\n \n\nCautionary Information:  \n\nThe patient must swallow the full dose of medicine. \nIf the dose repeatedly is not completely swallowed or if the patient is \nvomiting, consult your doctor for further instructions. \n \n\n \n\nh. Hold the blue syringe upright and check: \n\uf0b7 that the tip of the blue syringe is filled \n\uf0b7 whether the right dose has been filled into the blue \n\nsyringe \n\uf0b7 that no big air bubbles are present. \n\n \n\n \n\ni. If there are bigger air bubbles or air in the tip: \n\uf0b7 Insert the tip of the blue syringe again fully into the \n\nlarge opening of the adapter \n\uf0b7 Return the suspension to the bottle by pushing back the \n\nplunger rod into the blue syringe as far as it goes. \n\uf0b7 Repeat steps b. to h. until no bigger air bubbles are \n\nvisible. \n \nj. Close the bottle with the screw cap. \nAdminister the suspension immediately after filling the blue \nsyringe (step 3.3) \n \n\n\n\n311 \n\n \n\ne. Encourage the patient to drink one typical serving of liquid. \n\uf0b7 For an infant of 6 months, for example, this may be 20 mL. \n\uf0b7 This can also be breast-feeding.  \n\uf0b7 For an adolescent it may be a volume up to 240 mL \n\n \n\n \n4. Cleaning and storage \n \nThe blue syringe must be cleaned following every application. \nFollow the steps listed below to clean the device. Altogether, three cycles of cleaning are necessary to \nensure proper cleaning. \n \n Before you start, you will need the following equipment for step 4.1: \n\n\uf0b7 Get two containers (such as a cup or bowl) \no one container filled with drinking water, \no the other container empty \n\n \n\n \nStep 4.1: Cleaning \n \n\n \n\na.

xarelto around the same time every day (for example, one tablet in the morning and one in the evening). this medicine can be taken with or without food. if you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take xarelto. the tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately before you take it. if necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed xarelto tablet through a stomach tube. xarelto will not be given to you on its own. your doctor will also tell you to take acetylsalicylic acid. if you get xarelto after an acute coronary syndrome, your doctor may tell you to also take clopidogrel or ticlopidine. your doctor will tell you how much of these to take (usually between 75 to 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid daily or a daily dose of 75 to 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid plus a daily dose of either 75 mg clopidogrel or a standard daily dose of ticlopidine). when to start xarelto treatment with xarelto after an acute coronary syndrome should be started as soon as possible after stabilisation of the acute coronary syndrome, at the earliest 24 hours after admission to hospital and at the time when parenteral (via injection) anticoagulation therapy would normally be stopped. your doctor will tell you when to start treatment with xarelto if you have been diagnosed with coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. your doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment. if you take more xarelto than you should 16tcontact your doctor immediately 16t if you have taken too many xarelto tablets. taking too much xarelto increases the risk of bleeding. if you forget to take xarelto do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. if you miss a dose, take your next dose at the usual time. if you stop taking xarelto take xarelto on a regular basis and for as long as your doctor keeps prescribing it. do not stop taking xarelto without talking to your doctor first. if you stop taking this medicine, it may increase your risk of having another heart attack or stroke or dying from a disease related to your heart or your blood vessels. if you have any further questions on the use of this

bleeding may lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure (shock). in some cases the bleeding may not be obvious. tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following side effects: signs of bleeding - bleeding into the brain or inside the skull (symptoms can include headache, one-sided weakness, vomiting, seizures, decreased level of consciousness, and neck stiffness. a serious medical emergency. seek medical attention immediately!) - long or excessive bleeding - exceptional weakness, tiredness, paleness, dizziness, headache, unexplained swelling, breathlessness, chest pain or angina pectoris your doctor may decide to keep you under closer observation or change the treatment. signs of severe skin reactions - spreading intense skin rash, blisters or mucosal lesions, e.g. in the mouth or eyes (stevens-johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis). - a drug reaction that causes rash, fever, inflammation of internal organs, blood abnormalities and systemic illness (dress syndrome). the frequency of these side effects is very rare (up to 1 in 10,000 people). signs of severe allergic reactions - swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat; difficulty swallowing;
