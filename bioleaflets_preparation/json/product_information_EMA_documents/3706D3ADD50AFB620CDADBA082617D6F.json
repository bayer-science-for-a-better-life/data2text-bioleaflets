This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See \nsection 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nBrineura 150 mg solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial of Brineura contains 150 mg of cerliponase alfa* in 5 ml of solution.  \n \nEach ml of solution for infusion contains 30 mg of cerliponase alfa. \n \n*Cerliponase alfa is produced in mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n \nEach vial contains 17.4 mg of sodium in 5 ml of solution. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for infusion.  \n \nClear to slightly opalescent and colourless to pale yellow solution, that may occasionally contain thin \ntranslucent fibres or opaque particles.   \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBrineura is indicated for the treatment of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, also known \nas tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) deficiency. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nBrineura must only be administered by a trained healthcare professional knowledgeable in \nintracerebroventricular administration in a healthcare setting. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 300 mg cerliponase alfa administered once every other week by \nintracerebroventricular infusion.  \n \nIn patients less than 2 years of age, lower doses are recommended, see paediatric population section. \n \nPre-treatment of patients with antihistamines with or without antipyretics is recommended 30 to 60 minutes \nprior to the start of infusion. \n \nContinuation of long-term treatment should be subject to regular clinical evaluation whether the benefits are \nconsidered to outweigh the potential risks to individual patients. \n\n2 \n\n\n\n \nDose adjustments \n \nConsideration of dose adjustments may be necessary for patients who may not tolerate the infusion. The dose \nmay be reduced by 50% and/or the infusion rate decreased to a slower rate. \n \nIf the infusion is interrupted due to a hypersensitivity reaction, it should be restarted at approximately one-\nhalf the initial infusion rate at which the hypersensitivity reaction occurred. \n \nThe infusion should be interrupted and/or the rate slowed in patients who in the judgement of the treating \nphysician have a possible increase in intracranial pressure during the infusion as suggested by symptoms \nsuch as headache, nausea, vomiting, or decreased mental state. These precautions are of particular \nimportance in patients below 3 years of age. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Brineura in children less than 3 years of age has not yet been established. Limited \ndata are available for children aged 2 years and no clinical data is available in children below 2 years of age \n(see section 5.1). The posology proposed in children below 2 years has been estimated based on brain mass. \n \nTreatment of Brineura was initiated in children 2 to 8 years of age in clinical studies. There is limited data in \npatients older than 8 years of age. Treatment should be based on the benefits and risks to the individual \npatient as assessed by the physician. \n \nThe posology selected for patients is based on age at time of treatment and should be adjusted accordingly \n(see Table 1). In patients less than 3 years of age the recommended dose is in accordance with the posology \nused in the ongoing clinical study 190-203, see section 5.1.  \n \n\nTable 1: Dose and volume of Brineura \n \n\nAge groups Total dose administered every \nother week \n\n(mg) \n\nVolume of Brineura solution \n(ml) \n\nBirth to < 6 months 100 3.3 \n6 months to < 1 year 150 5 \n1 year to < 2 years 200 (first 4 doses) \n\n300 (subsequent doses) \n6.7 (first 4 doses) \n\n10 (subsequent doses) \n2 years and older \n\n \n300 10 \n\n \nMethod of administration \n \nIntracerebroventricular use.  \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \n \nAseptic technique must be strictly observed during preparation and administration. \n \nBrineura and the flushing solution must only be administered by the intracerebroventricular route. Each vial \nof Brineura and flushing solution are intended for single use only.  \n \nBrineura is administered to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by infusion via a surgically implanted reservoir and \ncatheter (intracerebroventricular access device). The intracerebroventricular access device must be implanted \nprior to the first infusion. The implanted intracerebroventricular access device should be appropriate for \naccessing the cerebral ventricles for therapeutic administration. \n\n3 \n\n\n\n \nFollowing Brineura infusion, a calculated amount of flushing solution must be used to flush the infusion \ncomponents including the intracerebroventricular access device in order to fully administer Brineura and to \nmaintain patency of the intracerebroventricular access device (see section 6.6). Brineura and flushing \nsolution vials should be thawed prior to administration. The infusion rate for Brineura and the flushing \nsolution is 2.5 ml/hour. The complete infusion time, including Brineura and the required flushing solution, is \napproximately 2 to 4.5 hours, depending on the dose and volume administered. \n \nIntracerebroventricular Infusion of Brineura  \n \nAdminister Brineura before the flushing solution. \n\n1. Label the infusion line for “Intracerebroventricular infusion only”. \n2. Attach the syringe containing Brineura to the extension line, if used, otherwise connect the syringe to \n\nthe infusion set. The infusion set must be equipped with a 0.2 µm inline filter. See Figure 1. \n3. Prime the infusion components with Brineura.  \n4. Inspect the scalp for signs of intracerebroventricular access device leakage or failure and for \n\npotential infections. Do not administer Brineura if there are signs and symptoms of acute \nintracerebroventricular access device leakage, device failure, or device-related infection (see section \n4.3 and 4.4). \n\n5. Prepare the scalp for intracerebroventricular infusion using aseptic technique per institution standard \nof care. \n\n6. Insert the port needle into the intracerebroventricular access device. \n7. Connect a separate empty sterile syringe (no larger than 3 ml) to the port needle. \n\nWithdraw 0.5 ml to 1 ml of CSF to check patency of the intracerebroventricular access device. \n Do not return CSF to the intracerebroventricular access device. CSF samples should \n\nroutinely be sent for infection monitoring (see section 4.4). \n8. Attach the infusion set to the port needle (see Figure 1).  \n\n Secure the components per institution standard of care. \n9. Place the syringe containing Brineura into the syringe pump and program the pump to deliver at an \n\ninfusion rate of 2.5 ml per hour.  \n Program the pump alarms to sound at the most sensitive settings for pressure, rate, and volume \n\nlimits. See the syringe pump manufacturer’s operating manual for details.  \n Do not deliver as a bolus or manually.  \n\n10. Initiate infusion of Brineura at a rate of 2.5 ml per hour. \n11. Periodically inspect the infusion system during the infusion for signs of leakage or delivery failure. \n12. Verify that the “Brineura” syringe in the syringe pump is empty after the infusion is complete. \n\nDetach and remove the empty syringe from the pump and disconnect from the tubing.  Discard the \nempty syringe in accordance with local requirements. \n\n4 \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1: Infusion System Set Up \n \nIntracerebroventricular infusion of the flushing solution  \n \nAdminister the flushing solution provided after the Brineura infusion is complete.  \n\n1. Attach the syringe containing the calculated volume of flushing solution to the infusion components \n(see section 6.6). \n\n2. Place the syringe containing the flushing solution into the syringe pump and program the pump to \ndeliver an infusion rate of 2.5 ml per hour.  \n Program the pump alarms to sound at the most sensitive settings for pressure, rate, and volume \n\nlimits. See the syringe pump manufacturer’s operating manual for details. \n Do not deliver as a bolus or manually. \n\n3. Initiate infusion of the flushing solution at a rate of 2.5 ml per hour.  \n4. Periodically inspect the infusion components during the infusion for signs of leakage or delivery \n\nfailure.  \n5. Verify that the “flushing solution” syringe in the syringe pump is empty after the infusion is \n\ncomplete. Detach and remove the empty syringe from the pump and disconnect from the infusion \nline.  \n\n6. Remove the port needle. Apply gentle pressure and bandage the infusion site per institution standard \nof care. \n\n7. Dispose of the infusion components, needles, unused solutions and other waste materials in \naccordance with local requirements. \n\n \nFor instructions on preparation of Brineura and flushing solution before administration, see section 6.6.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nLife-threatening anaphylactic reaction to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, \nif re-challenge is unsuccessful (see section 4.4). \n \nCLN2 patients with ventriculo-peritoneal shunts. \n \nBrineura must not be administered as long as there are signs of acute intracerebroventricular access device \nleakage, device failure, or device-related infection (see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n\n5 \n\n\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDevice-related complications \n \nBrineura must be administered using aseptic technique to reduce the risk of infection. Intracerebroventricular \naccess device-related infections, including sub-clinical infections and meningitis, have been observed in \npatients treated with Brineura. Meningitis may present with the following symptoms: fever, headache, neck \nstiffness, light sensitivity, nausea, vomiting, and change in mental status. CSF samples should routinely be \nsent for testing to detect subclinical device infections. In clinical studies, antibiotics were administered, the \nintracerebroventricular access device was replaced, and Brineura treatment was continued. \n \nHealthcare professionals should inspect the scalp for skin integrity to ensure the intracerebroventricular \naccess device is not compromised prior to each infusion. Common signs of device leakage and device failure \ninclude swelling, erythema of the scalp, extravasation of fluid, or bulging of the scalp around or above the \nintracerebroventricular access device. However, these signs may also occur in the context of device-related \ninfections. \n \nInspection of the infusion site and a patency check must be performed to detect intracerebroventricular \naccess device leakage and/or failure prior to initiation of Brineura infusion (see section 4.2 and 4.3). The \nsigns and symptoms of device-related infections may not be apparent, therefore, CSF samples should \nroutinely be sent for testing to detect subclinical device infections. Consultation with a neurosurgeon may be \nneeded to confirm the integrity of the device. Brineura treatment should be interrupted in cases of device \nfailure and may require replacement of the access device prior to subsequent infusions.   \n \nMaterial degradation of the intracerebroventricular access device reservoir occurs after long periods of use \naccording to preliminary results of benchtop testing and as observed in clinical trials with approximately 4 \nyears of use. In two clinical cases, the ICV access devices did not show signs of failure at the time of \ninfusion; however, after removal, material degradation of the devices were apparent and consistent with data \nfrom benchtop testing of ICV access devices. The access devices were replaced and patients resumed \ntreatment with Brineura. \nAccess device replacement should be considered prior to 4 years of regular administration of Brineura, \nhowever it must always be ensured, that the intracerebroventricular access device is used in accordance with \nthe provisions of the respective medical device manufacturer. \n \nIn case of intracerebroventricular access device-related complications, refer to the manufacturer’s labelling \nfor further instruction. \n \nCaution should be taken in patients prone to complications from intracerebroventricular medicinal product \nadministration, including patients with obstructive hydrocephalus. \n \nClinical and laboratory monitoring \n \nVital signs should be monitored before infusion starts, periodically during infusion, and post-infusion in a \nhealthcare setting. Upon completion of the infusion, the patient status should be clinically assessed and \nobservation may be necessary for longer periods if clinically indicated, particularly in patients less than \n3 years. \n \nElectrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring during infusion should be performed in patients with a history of \nbradycardia, conduction disorder, or with structural heart disease, as some patients with CLN2 disease may \ndevelop conduction disorders or heart disease. In cardiac normal patients, regular 12-lead ECG evaluations \nshould be performed every 6 months. \n \nCSF samples should routinely be sent for testing to detect subclinical device infections (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \n\n6 \n\n\n\nThere were no patients with advanced disease progression at treatment initiation who were included in \nclinical trials and no clinical data is available in children < 2 years.  Patients with advanced CLN2 disease \nand newborns may have decreased integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Effects of the potentially increased \nmedicinal product exposure on the periphery are unknown.    \n \nAnaphylactic reactions \n  \nAnaphylactic reactions have been reported with Brineura. As a precautionary measure, appropriate medical \nsupport should be readily available when Brineura is administered. If anaphylactic reactions occur, \nimmediately discontinue the infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Observe patients closely \nduring and after the infusion. If anaphylaxis occurs, caution should be exercised upon re-administration. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains 17.4 mg sodium per vial of Brineura and flushing solution, equivalent to \n0.87% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  \n \nEach vial contains less than 1 mmol (39 mg) of potassium, i.e. essentially ‘potassium-free’. \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. Cerliponase alfa is a recombinant human protein and systemic \nexposure is limited due to intracerebroventricular administration, therefore interactions between cerliponase \nalfa and medicinal products metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely to occur. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data on the use of Brineura in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have not been \nconducted using Brineura. It is not known whether Brineura can cause foetal harm when administered to a \npregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Brineura should be given to a pregnant woman only if \nclearly needed.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere are no data on the presence of cerliponase alfa in human milk, the effects of cerliponase alfa on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects of cerliponase alfa on milk production. Breastfeeding should be discontinued \nduring treatment with Brineura. \n \nFertility \n \nNo fertility studies with cerliponase alfa have been conducted in animals or humans. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effect of Brineura on the ability to drive or use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \n\n7 \n\n\n\nThe adverse reactions described in this section were evaluated in 24 patients with CLN2 disease who \nreceived at least one dose of Brineura in clinical studies of up to 141 weeks or in post-marketing experience. \nThe most frequent (>20%) adverse reactions observed during Brineura clinical trials include pyrexia, low \nCSF protein, ECG abnormalities, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infections, and hypersensitivity. No \npatients had to have their treatment discontinued due to adverse events.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions observed are listed below, by system organ class and frequency, following the MedDRA \nfrequency convention defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 \nto <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data).

Overall, 23 (96%) subjects who received cerliponase alfa experienced an event that mapped to \nthe Convulsions Standardized MedDRA Query. The most commonly reported convulsion events include \nseizure, epilepsy and generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Total convulsion events with a temporal relationship \nto cerliponase alfa administration was 17% and were mild to moderate, grade 1 to 2 in severity. Overall, 6% \nof all convulsion events were considered related to cerliponase alfa and ranged from mild to severe, CTCAE \ngrade 1-4. Convulsions resolved with standard anti-convulsive therapies, and did not result in discontinuation \nof Brineura treatment.  \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions were reported in 14 out of 24 patients (58%) treated with Brineura. Severe \n(Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3) hypersensitivity reactions occurred \nin three patients and no patients discontinued treatment. The most common manifestations included pyrexia \nwith vomiting, pleocytosis, or irritability, which are inconsistent with classic immune mediated \nhypersensitivity. These adverse reactions were observed during or within 24 hours after completion of the \nBrineura infusion and did not interfere with treatment. Symptoms resolved over time or with administration \nof antipyretics, antihistamines and/or glucocorticosteroids. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAnti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were detected in both serum and CSF in 79% and 21%, respectively, of \npatients treated with cerliponase alfa for up to 107 weeks. Drug-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAb) \ncapable of inhibiting receptor-mediated cellular uptake of cerliponase alfa were not detected in the CSF. \nNo association was found between serum or CSF ADA titres and incidence or severity of hypersensitivity. \nPatients who experienced moderate hypersensitivity adverse events were tested for drug-specific IgE and \nfound to be negative. No correlations were found between higher ADA titres and reductions in efficacy \nmeasurements.  There was no apparent effect of serum or CSF ADA on the plasma or CSF \npharmacokinetics, respectively.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAn ongoing study provides experience with two patients aged 2 years of age treated with Brineura at 300 mg \nevery other week (see section 5.1). Both patients have received 8 infusions and the overall safety profile of \nBrineura in these younger patients appears consistent with the safety profile observed in older children. \nCurrently no clinical experience of Brineura in children below 2 years of age is available. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo information is available. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\n9 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: other alimentary tract and metabolism products, enzymes, ATC code: \nA16AB17. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nCerliponase alfa is a recombinant form of human tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (rhTPP1). Cerliponase alfa is a \nproteolytic inactive proenzyme (zymogen) that is activated in the lysosome. Cerliponase alfa is taken up by \ntarget cells and translocated to the lysosomes through the Cation Independent Mannose-6-Phosphate \nReceptor (CI-MPR, also known as M6P/IGF2 receptor). The glycosylation profile of cerliponase alfa results \nin consistent cellular uptake and lysosomal targeting for activation.  \n \nThe activated proteolytic enzyme (rhTPP1) cleaves tripeptides from the N-terminus of the target protein with \nno known substrate specificity. Inadequate levels of TPP1 cause CLN2 disease, resulting in \nneurodegeneration, loss of neurological function and death during childhood. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Brineura were assessed in an open label, dose escalation clinical study (190-201) \nand an ongoing long term extension study (190-202) in patients with CLN2 disease compared to untreated \npatients with CLN2 disease from a natural history database (natural history control group). These studies \nused the aggregate of the motor and language domains of a disease-specific clinical rating scale (see Table 3) \nto assess disease progression. Each domain encompasses scores of 3 (grossly normal) to 0 (profoundly \nimpaired), for a total possible score of 6, with unit decrements representing milestone events in the loss of \npreviously attained functions of ambulation and speech. \n \n\nTable 3: CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale \n \n\nDomain Score Rating \n\n3 Grossly normal gait. No prominent ataxia, no pathologic falls. \n\n2 Independent gait, as defined by ability to walk without support for 10 steps. Will have obvious instability, and may have intermittent falls. \n\n1 Requires external assistance to walk, or can crawl only. \n\nMotor \n\n0 Can no longer walk or crawl. \n\n3 Apparently normal language. Intelligible and grossly age-appropriate. No decline noted yet. \n\n2 \n\nLanguage has become recognizably abnormal: some intelligible words, may \nform short sentences to convey concepts, requests, or needs. This score \nsignifies a decline from a previous level of ability (from the individual \nmaximum reached by the child). \n\n1 Hardly understandable. Few intelligible words. \n\nLanguage \n\n0 No intelligible words or vocalizations. \n\n \n\n10 \n\n\n\nA total of 24 patients, aged 3 to 8 years, were treated with Brineura 300 mg every other week. In study 190-\n201, 23 patients were treated for 48 weeks (1 patient withdrew after week 1 due to the inability to continue \nwith study procedures). The mean baseline CLN2 score was 3.5 (standard deviation (SD) 1.20) with a range \nfrom 1 to 6; no patients with advanced disease progression were studied (inclusion criteria: mild to moderate \nprogression of CLN2 disease). All 23 patients completed study 190-201 and continued to the ongoing \nextension study 190-202 treated with Brineura at 300 mg every other week to a maximum of 124 weeks.  \n \nFindings from studies 190-201 and 190-202 were compared with a natural history control group that \nincluded patients that satisfied the inclusion criteria for studies 190-201 and 190-202. Results from the \nnatural history control group demonstrate CLN2 disease is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease \nwith predictable decline in motor and language function with an estimated mean rate of decline in the CLN2 \nscore of 2 points per 48 weeks. \n \nTreatment effect in patients receiving Brineura was assessed using the CLN2 clinical rating scale, and results \nwere compared to the 2 points per 48 weeks predicted decline in the natural history control group. In study \n190-201, 20 out of 23 (87%) patients receiving Brineura for 48 weeks did not have an unreversed 2 point \ndecline as observed in the untreated patient population (p=0.0002, binomial test assuming p0= 0.50). A total \nof 15 patients out of 23 (65%) had no overall decline in CLN2 score, irrespective of baseline score, and 2 of \nthese 15 patients increased their score by one point during the treatment period. Five patients experienced a \nsingle point decrease, and 3 patients experienced a 2 point decrease. \n \nIn study 190-201, the mean rate of decline in patients treated with Brineura at 300 mg every other week was \n0.40 points per 48 weeks. When compared to the expected rate of decline based on natural history, the study \nresults are statistically significant (p < 0.0001) (see Table 4). The observed treatment effect was considered \nclinically meaningful in light of the natural history of untreated CLN2 disease. \n \n\nTable 4:  0 to 6 Point Motor-Language CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale: Rate of Decline over 48 weeks \n(Intent to Treat (ITT) population) \n\n \nRate of Decline (points/48 weeks)a Overall (n = 23) p-valueb \nMean (SD) 0.40 (0.809)c \nMedian 0.00 \nMin, Max -0.88, 2.02 \n95% CI Limits 0.05, 0.75 \n\n<0.0001 \n \n\na Patient rate of decline per 48 weeks: (baseline CLN2 score - last CLN2 score) / (time elapsed in units of 48 weeks) \nb p-value based on 1-sample T-test comparing rate of decline to the value 2 \nc Positive estimates indicate clinical decline; negative estimates indicate clinical improvement \n \nIn the ongoing study 190-202 (as of 03 June 2016), the rate of decline in patients treated with Brineura \ncompared to the natural history control group (N=42 patients) continues to show durability of the treatment \neffect (see Figure 2).  \n \n\n11 \n\n\n\nFigure 2:  CLN2 Score Mean Change from Baseline  \n(Natural History Control Group vs Brineura treated patients, 300 mg every other week) \n\n \n\n \n   Vertical bars represent standard error of the mean \n\nSolid line: 190-201 and 190-202 clinical studies \nDash line: 190-901 Natural history control group \n\n \nVision and seizure scores when combined with CLN2 score (motor and language domains) remain stable. \nMRI volumetry measurements show attenuated rate of loss.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIt is important to initiate treatment in children as young as possible, although patients less than 3 years of age \nwere not included in the pivotal study. \n \nStudy 190-203 is an ongoing open label clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy in patients from \nbirth to 18 years of age. Posology was based upon analysis of differences in brain mass values for children \nless than 3 years of age. So far safety results in younger patients appears consistent with the safety profile \nobserved in older children. Currently no clinical experience of Brineura in children below 2 years of age is \navailable (see section 4.8). \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Brineura in \none or more subsets of the paediatric population in CLN2 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’. This means that due to the \nrarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every year \nand this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of cerliponase alfa were evaluated in patients with CLN2 disease who received \nintracerebroventricular infusions of 300 mg over approximately 4.5 hours once every other week.    \n \nAll pharmacokinetic parameters were similar following the initial infusion on Day 1 and following infusions \nat Week 5 and Week 13, indicating no apparent accumulation or time dependent PK of cerliponase alfa in \n\n12 \n\n\n\nCSF or plasma when administered at of dose of 300 mg once every other week. The pharmacokinetic \nparameters in CSF were assessed in 17 patients and are summarized in Table 5 below. Cerliponase alfa \nplasma pharmacokinetics were assessed in 13 patients, and a median Tmax of 12.0 hours (since start of \ninfusion), a mean Cmax of 1.39 µg/ml, and mean AUC0-t of 24.1 µg-hour/ml were characterized. There was no \napparent effect of serum or CSF ADA on the plasma or CSF pharmacokinetics, respectively.  \n \nTable 5: Pharmacokinetic properties following first Intracerebroventricular infusion (approximately 4 \n\nhours in duration) of 300 mg cerliponase alfa in CSF \n \n\nParameter CSF (N=17) \nMean (SD) \n\nTmax*, hr 4.50 [4.25, 5.75]  \nCmax, µg/ml 1490 (942) \nAUC0-t, µg-hr/ml 9510 (4130) \nVz, ml 435 (412) \nCL, ml/hr 38.7 (19.8) \nt1/2, hr 7.35 (2.90) \n*Tmax expressed as time since start of ~4 hour infusion and presented as median [min, max], and occurred at the first sampling \n\ntimepoint post infusion \n \nDistribution \n \nThe estimated volume of distribution of cerliponase alfa following intracerebroventricular infusion of \n300 mg (Vz = 435 ml) exceeds the typical CSF volume (100 ml), suggesting distribution to tissues outside \nthe CSF.  The large CSF to plasma ratios in Cmax and AUC0-t (approximately 1000 and 400, respectively) \nsuggest that the majority of administered cerliponase alfa remains localized within the CNS. \nIntracerebroventricular administration of cerliponase alfa is not expected to result in therapeutic \nconcentrations in the eye due to the limited access from the CSF to the affected cells of the retina and the \npresence of the blood-retinal barrier. \n \nElimination \n \nCerliponase alfa is a protein and is expected to be metabolically degraded through peptide hydrolysis. \nConsequently, impaired liver function is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of cerliponase alfa. \n \n \nRenal elimination of cerliponase alfa is considered a minor pathway for clearance. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nLimited preclinical safety data of cerliponase alfa were generated from single dose toxicity studies in \nmonkeys and repeated-dose studies in a dachshund dog model of classic late infantile neuronal ceroid \nlipofuscinosis type 2. This disease model primarily served to investigate the pharmacodynamic and \npharmacokinetic properties of cerliponase alfa, but also aimed to evaluate the toxicity of the substance. \nHowever, the results of these studies in dachshund dogs cannot reliably predict human safety, because the \nregimen of cerliponase alfa infusions was different and highly variable even within the same study due to \ndifficulties with the indwelling catheter system and prominent hypersensitivity reactions. In addition, these \ninvestigations included very small animal numbers, mostly tested single dose groups and lacked appropriate \ncontrols. Thus, the non-clinical development is inconclusive with respect to the clinical safety of cerliponase \nalfa. Genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity investigations have not been performed. \n \n\n13 \n\n\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n27 \n\n\n\n   Package leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nBrineura 150 mg solution for infusion  \ncerliponase alfa \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \n\ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to \nreport side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you or your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor.  \n- This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Brineura is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you or your child is given Brineura \n3. How Brineura is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Brineura \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n1. What Brineura is and what it is used for \n \nBrineura contains the active substance cerliponase alfa, which belongs to a group of medicines known as \nenzyme replacement therapies. It is used to treat patients with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) \ndisease, also known as tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (TPP1) deficiency. \n \nPeople with CLN2 disease do not have any enzyme called TPP1 or they have too little of it and this causes a \nbuild-up of substances called lysosomal storage materials. In people with CLN2 disease, these materials \nbuild-up in certain parts of the body, mainly the brain. \n \nHow Brineura works \nThis medicine replaces the missing enzyme, TPP1, which minimises the build-up of the lysosomal storage \nmaterials. This medicine works to slow the progression of the disease.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you or your child is given Brineura \n \nYou must not receive Brineura \n- If you or your child has had life-threatening allergic reactions to cerliponase alfa or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6), and the reactions continue to happen when cerliponse \nalfa is given again. \n\n- If you or your child has a device implanted to drain extra fluid from the brain. \n- If you or your child currently has signs of a device infection or problems with the device. Your doctor \n\nmay decide to continue treatment once the device infection or problems are resolved.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before you or your child is given Brineura. \n- You or your child may get problems with the implanted device used during treatment with Brineura \n\n(see section 4 “Possible side effects”), including infection or a fault in the device. Signs that you or \nyour child may have an infection include fever, headache, neck stiffness, light sensitivity, nausea, \nvomiting, and change in mental status.  Signs of problems with the device include swelling, redness \nof the scalp, fluid leaking from device and bulging of the scalp. Treatment may be interrupted if the \n\n28 \n\n\n\n- Life-threatening allergic reactions are possible with Brineura. Your doctor will monitor you or your \nchild for symptoms of life threatening allergic reactions, such as hives, itching or flushing, swollen \nlips, tongue, and/or throat, chills, accelerated heart rhythm, shortness of breath, hoarseness, turning \nblue around finger tips or lips, low muscle tone, fainting, diarrhoea or incontinence. Seek immediate \nmedical care should these symptoms occur. \n\n- Your doctor will check your or your child’s heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and \ntemperature before, during, and after treatment.  The doctor may decide on additional monitoring if it \nis needed. \n\n- Your doctor will check for abnormal heart electrical activities (ECG) every 6 months. If you or your \nchild has a history of heart problems, your doctor or nurse will monitor your heart activity during \neach infusion. \n\n- Your doctor may send samples of brain fluid to check for signs of infection. \n- Brineura has not been given to patients with advanced disease at the start of treatment or in children \n\nyounger than 2 years of age.  Your doctor will discuss whether Brineura treatment is right for you or \nyour child. \n\n \nOther medicines and Brineura \nTell your doctor if you or your child is taking, has recently taken, or might take any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor for advice before treatment with this medicine. \nYou should not receive Brineura treatment during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. It is not known \nwhether Brineura is excreted in human breast milk. Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment \nwith Brineura. It is not known if Brineura impacts human fertility. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is not known if Brineura will impact the ability to drive or use machines. Please consult your doctor. \n \nBrineura contains sodium and potassium \n \nThis medicine contains 17.4 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is \nequivalent to 0.87% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \nThis medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially ‘potassium-free’. \n \n3. How Brineura is given \n \nYou or your child will need to have surgery to implant the device for giving Brineura. The device helps the \nmedicine to reach a specific part of the brain. \n \nBrineura will be given by a doctor with knowledge of giving medicines by intracerebroventricular use \n(infusion into the fluid of the brain) in a hospital or clinic. \n \nBrineura has not been given to patients younger than 2 years of age or older than 8 years of age (at the start \nof the clinical trial). There is limited experience in a few patients aged 2 years old. \n \nThe recommended dose of Brineura is based upon your or your child’s age, and is given once every other \nweek as follows: \n \n- birth to < 6 months: 100 mg \n- 6 months to < 1 year: 150 mg \n- 1 year to < 2 years: 200 mg (first 4 doses), 300 mg (all other doses) \n- ≥ 2 years: 300 mg \n\n29 \n\n\n\n \nYour doctor may adjust you or your child’s dose or the amount of time the medicine is given if the infusion \nis not tolerated, there is an allergic reaction or there is a possible increase of pressure in the brain. \n   \nThe medicine is slowly pumped through the implanted device. After the medicine has been given, a shorter \ninfusion of a solution is given to flush Brineura out of the infusion equipment so that the full dose reaches \nthe brain. The medicine and solution will be given over about 2 to 4 hours and 30 minutes according to your \nor your child’s dose. Your doctor may lower the dose or the speed of the infusion based on your response \nduring the treatment. \n \nYour doctor may give you or your child medicines, such as antipyretics to reduce fever or antihistamines to \ntreat allergic reactions before each treatment with Brineura to reduce side effects that can occur during or \nshortly after treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience any of the following: \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n- fever \n- vomiting \n- feeling irritable  \n- convulsions (seizures) \n- reactions during or shortly after being given the medicine, such as hives, itching or flushing, swollen \n\nlips, tongue and/or throat, shortness of breath, hoarseness, turning blue around finger tips or lips, low \nmuscle tone, fainting or incontinence \n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- device-related bacterial infections  \n- slower heart beat  \n- device does not function correctly due to a blockage detected during preparation for infusion \n- severe allergic reaction \n\n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data) \n- device is displaced and does not function correctly when preparing for infusion \n- inflammation of the brain due to device-related infection \n \nThis medicine may cause other side effects: \n \nVery common side effects: \n- headache \n- increased or decreased protein in the brain fluid \n- abnormal results of heart electrical activity (ECG) \n- increased cells in the spinal fluid detected by laboratory monitoring \n- infection of your nose or throat (cold) \n- needle issue (infusion needle falls out of implanted device) \n \nCommon side effects: \n- pain \n- rash \n- hives \n- head dropping (so that the chin drops towards the chest) \n\n30 \n\n\n\n- stomach pain  \n- leakage of the device \n- mouth or tongue blisters \n- swelling or redness of the eyelid and the white part of the eye \n- feeling nervous \n- disorder of the stomach or intestines \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you or your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V.
