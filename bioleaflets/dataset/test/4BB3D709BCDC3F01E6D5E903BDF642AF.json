NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPumarix suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection \nPandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nAfter mixing, 1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: \n \nSplit influenza virus, inactivated, containing antigen* equivalent to: \n \nA/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) like strain used (PR8-IBCDC-RG2) 3.75 micrograms** \n \n* propagated in eggs \n** haemagglutinin \n \nThis vaccine complies with the WHO recommendation and EU decision for the pandemic. \n \nAS03 adjuvant composed of squalene (10.69 milligrams), DL-\u03b1-tocopherol (11.86 milligrams) and \npolysorbate 80 (4.86 milligrams) \n \nThe suspension and emulsion, once mixed, form a multidose vaccine in a vial. See section 6.5 for the \nnumber of doses per vial. \n \nExcipient with known effect: the vaccine contains 5 micrograms thiomersal \n \nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection. \nThe suspension is a translucent to off white opalescent suspension, which may sediment slightly. \nThe emulsion is a whitish homogeneous liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).  \n \nPandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with official guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults from the age of 18 years onwards: \n \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n \n\n  3 \n\nPersons previously vaccinated with one or two doses of AS03-containing vaccine containing HA \nderived from a different clade of the same subtype \n \nAdults from the age of 18 years onwards: one dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere are very limited safety and immunogenicity data available on the administration of an AS03-\nadjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 \u00b5g HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) manufactured \nusing a different process and on administration of half a dose of the same vaccine (i.e. 1.875 \u00b5g HA \nand half the amount of AS03 adjuvant) at 0 and 21 days in children aged 3 to 9 years.  See sections 4.8 \nand 5.1. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Pumarix in children aged less than 3 years and in children and adolescents \naged 10 to 17 years have not been established. No data are available. \n \nFor further information, see section 5.1. \n \nIt is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Pumarix, complete the vaccination course \nwith Pumarix. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or \nanterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \nFor instructions on mixing of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde and sodium deoxycholate) of this vaccine.  \nHowever, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine provided that facilities for \nresuscitation should be immediately available in case of need. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to \nthiomersal and to residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde and sodium \ndeoxycholate). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIf the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile \nillness or acute infection. \n \nPumarix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. There are no data with \nPumarix using the subcutaneous route.  Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and \npotential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding \ndisorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the \nrisk of bleedings. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n \n\n  4 \n\nThere are no data on administration of AS03-adjuvanted vaccines before or following other types of \ninfluenza vaccines intended for pre-pandemic or pandemic use. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \nthe needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nClinical data in children less than 6 years of age who received two doses of another Pandemic \ninfluenza vaccine (H5N1 manufactured in Dresden, Germany) indicate an increase in frequency of \nfever (axillary\u226538\u00b0C) after the administration of the second dose. Therefore, monitoring of \ntemperature and measures to lower the fever (such as antipyretic medication as seems clinically \nnecessary) are recommended in young children (e.g. up to approximately 6 years of age) post-\nvaccination. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Pumarix with other vaccines. If co-administration with \nanother vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be \nnoted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative.  These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are currently no data available on the use of Pumarix in pregnancy.  \n \nAn AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v has been administered to women in each \ntrimester of pregnancy.  Information on outcomes from estimated more than 200,000 women who \nhave been vaccinated during pregnancy is currently limited. There was no evidence of an increased \nrisk of adverse outcomes in over 100 pregnancies that were followed in a prospective clinical study. \n \nAnimal studies with Pumarix do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nData from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do \nnot suggest malformations or fetal or neonatal toxicity. \n \nThe use of Pumarix may be considered during pregnancy if this is thought to be necessary, taking into \naccount official recommendations. \n \nBreast-feeding \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n \n\n  5 \n\n \nPumarix may be used in lactating women. \n \nFertility \n \nNo fertility data are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 \u201cUndesirable Effects\u201d may affect the ability to drive \nor use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nClinical studies have evaluated the incidence of adverse reactions in approximately 4,500 subjects 18 \nyears old and above who received Pumarix or placebo. \n \nIn adults 18 to 64 years of age, the most frequently reported adverse reactions after vaccination were \ninjection site pain (80.5%), muscle aches (37.2%), fatigue (25.2%), headache (25.1%), joint pain \n(17.7%) and shivering (11.1%). \n \nIn subjects > 64 years of age, the most frequently reported adverse reactions after vaccination were \ninjection site pain (58.0%), muscle aches (19.7%), fatigue (13.5%), headache (12.4%) and joint pain \n(10.3%). \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: \n \nVery common (\u22651/10) \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials with the mock-up vaccine are listed here below (see section 5.1 \nfor more information on mock-up vaccines). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon: lymphadenopathy \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: insomnia  \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: headache \nUncommon: dizziness, paraesthesia \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nUncommon: vertigo \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n \n\n  6 \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: dyspnoea \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: nausea, diarrhoea \nUncommon: abdominal pain, vomiting, dyspepsia, stomach discomfort \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: sweating \nUncommon: pruritus, rash \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common: joint pain, muscle aches \nUncommon: back pain, musculoskeletal stiffness, neck pain, muscle spasms, pain in extremity \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: pain at the injection site, fatigue \nCommon: redness at the injection site, swelling at the injection site, fever, shivering \nUncommon: injection site reactions (such as bruising, induration, pruritus, warmth), asthenia, chest \npain, malaise \n \nNo post-marketing surveillance data are available following Pumarix administration. \n \nFrom post-marketing experience with AS03-containing vaccines containing 3.75 \u00b5g HA derived from \nA/California/7/2009 (H1N1), the following adverse reactions have been reported: \n \nImmune system disorders \nAnaphylaxis, allergic reactions \n \nNervous system disorders \nFebrile convulsions \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nAngioedema, generalised skin reactions, urticaria \n \nIn addition, from post-marketing surveillance with interpandemic trivalent vaccines, the following \nadverse reactions have been reported: \n \nRare:  \nNeuralgia, transient thrombocytopenia. \n \nVery rare: \nVasculitis with transient renal involvement. \nNeurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nA clinical study (D-H5N1-009), evaluated the reactogenicity in children 3 to 5 and 6 to 9 years of age \nwho received either two adult (i.e. 0.5 ml) doses or two half adult (i.e. 0.25 ml) doses (21 days apart) \nof another Pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 manufactured in Dresden, \nGermany).  \n \nThe per-dose frequency of local and general solicited adverse reactions observed in the groups of \nchildren who received two adult (0.5 ml) doses was higher than that observed in the groups of children \nwho received two half adult (i.e. 0.25 ml) doses, except for redness in the 6-9 years of age group.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, ATC Code J07BB02. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nThis section describes the clinical experience with the mock-up vaccines following a two-dose \nadministration.  \n \nMock-up vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the currently circulating \ninfluenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as \u201cnovel\u201d antigens and simulate a situation where \nthe target population for vaccination is immunologically na\u00efve. Data obtained with the mock-up \nvaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical \nimmunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity data obtained with mock-up vaccines are relevant for the \npandemic vaccines. \n \nImmune response against A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n \n\n  8 \n\n \nAdults \n \nClinical studies have evaluated the immunogenicity of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 \u00b5g \nHA derived from A/Indonesia/5/2005 in subjects from the age of 18 years onwards following a 0, 21 \ndays schedule. \n \nIn a consistency study (Q-Pan-H5N1-002), the anti-haemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibody responses \ntwenty-one days and six months after the second dose were as follows: \n \nanti-HA antibody Immune response to A/Indonesia/5/2005 \n 18-60 years >60 years \n Day 42 \n\nN=1,488 \nDay 180 \nN=353 \n\nDay 42 \nN=479 \n\nDay 180 \nN=104 \n\nSeroprotection rate1 91% 62% 76.8% 63.5% \nSeroconversion rate2 91% 62% 76.4% 62.5% \nSeroconversion factor3 51.4 7.4 17.2 7.8 \n1seroprotection rate (i.e. proportion of subjects with HI titre \u2265 1:40); \n2seroconversion rate (i.e. proportion of subjects who were either seronegative at pre-vaccination and \nhave a protective post-vaccination titre of \u2265 1:40, or who were seropositive at pre-vaccination and \nhave a 4-fold increase in titre); \n3seroconversion factor (i.e. ratio of the post-vaccination GMT and the pre-vaccination GMT) \n \nTwenty-one days after the second dose, a 4-fold increase in serum neutralising antibody against \nA/Indonesia/5/2005 was achieved in 94.4% of subjects aged 18-60 years and in 80.4% of subjects over \n60 years of age.

Ten days \nafter the booster dose, the seroprotection rate against A/Turkey/Turkey/1/2005 and \nA/Indonesia/5/2005 was 99.2%. Forty-two days after the booster dose, the seroprotection rate against \nboth strains was 98.4%. \n \nInformation from non-clinical studies \n \nThe ability to induce protection against homologous and heterologous vaccine strains was assessed \nnon-clinically with A/Indonesia/05/05 (H5N1) using ferret challenge models. \n \n- Challenge with a homologous pandemic H5N1 strain (A/Indonesia/5/05) \n\nIn this protection experiment, the ferrets (six ferrets/group) were immunized intramuscularly with \nvaccine candidate containing three different doses of H5N1 antigen (7.5, 3.8 and 1.9 \u00b5g of HA \nantigen) adjuvanted with the standard dose or half dose of AS03. Control groups included ferrets \nimmunized with adjuvant alone and non-adjuvanted vaccine (7.5 micrograms HA). Ferrets immunized \nwith the non adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine were not protected from death and showed similar \nlung viral loads and degree of viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract as those exhibited by ferrets \nimmunized with the adjuvant alone. Conversely the combination of a range of doses of H5N1 antigen \nwith AS03 adjuvant was able to protect against mortality and to reduce lung virus loads and viral \nshedding after intra-tracheal challenge with a homologous wild type H5N1 virus.  Serological testing \nindicated a direct correlation between vaccines induced HI and neutralising antibody titres in protected \nanimals compared to antigen and adjuvant controls. \n \n- Challenge with a heterologous pandemic H5N1 strain (A/Hong Kong/156/97) \n\nIn this protection experiment, the ferrets (six ferrets/group) were immunized intramuscularly with \nvaccine candidate containing four different doses of H5N1 antigen (3.75, 1.5, 0.6 and 0.24 \u00b5g of HA \nantigen) adjuvanted with half dose of AS03. In addition, one group of six ferrets were immunized with \nvaccine candidate containing 3.75 \u00b5g H5N1 + full dose of AS03 and one control group included \nferrets immunized with non-adjuvanted vaccine (3.75 micrograms HA). The results of this \nheterologous challenge study indicate 80.7%-100% protection in all adjuvanted candidate vaccines \ncompared to 43% protection with the non adjuvanted vaccine, showing the benefit of AS03 \nadjuvantation. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under \u2019exceptional circumstances\u2019. \nThis means that for scientific reasons it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this \nmedicinal product.  \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n \n\n  12 \n\n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data obtained with Pumarix reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional \nstudies of safety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, \nembryo-fetal and postnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period). \n \n \n6.

Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be \n\nbrought to room temperature (allow a minimum of 15 minutes).  Whitish sediments may be \nobserved in the suspension vial; these sediments are part of the normal physical appearance of \nthe suspension.  The emulsion presents as a whitish appearance. \n\n2. Each vial should be shaken and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter (other than \nthe white sediments described above) and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of \neither being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n3. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by \nmeans of a 5 ml syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen. It is recommended \nto equip the syringe with a 23-G needle.  However, in the case this needle size would not be \navailable, a 21-G needle might be used.  The vial containing the adjuvant should be maintained \nin upside down position to facilitate the withdrawal of the full content. \n\n4. After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed \nvaccine is a whitish emulsion.  In the event of other variation being observed, discard the \nvaccine. \n\n5. The volume of the Pumarix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml. The vaccine should be \nadministered in accordance with the recommended posology (see section 4.2). \n\n6. The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign \nparticulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance.  In the event of either being observed \n(including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n7. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml is withdrawn into a 1 ml syringe for injection and administered \nintramuscularly. It is recommended to equip the syringe with a needle gauge not larger than 23-\nG. \n\n8. After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours.  The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a \nrefrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C) or at room temperature (25\u00b0C \u2013 30\u00b0C).  If the mixed vaccine is stored \nin a refrigerator, it should be brought to room temperature (allow a minimum of 15 minutes) \nbefore each withdrawal. \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

OTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING \n\nAUTHORISATION \n \nPharmacovigilance system \nThe MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1 of the \nMarketing Authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the medicinal product is on the \nmarket. \n \nThe MAH shall perform the studies and pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the \nPharmacovigilance Plan and requested as specific obligations. \n \nRisk Management plan (RMP) \nThe MAH shall perform the pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as \nagreed in the RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any subsequent \nupdates of the RMP agreed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). \n \nAs per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the \nupdated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report \n(PSUR). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n \n\n  17 \n\nIn addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: \n \n\n\u2022 When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, \nPharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities \n\n\u2022 Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being \nreached  \n\n\u2022 At the request of the European Medicines Agency \n \n\nPSURs  \nOutside of the pandemic period, the normal PSUR periodicity and format will be maintained, with a \nspecific review of AESI and possible adverse events related to adjuvants. This should include data \nfrom ongoing studies, or actual use if applicable, of the \u2018mock-up\u2019 strains and any safety data relevant \nto the adjuvant system. \n \nDuring a pandemic situation (Phase 6 of the WHO global Influenza preparedness plan), bi-weekly \n\"simplified PSUR\" accompanied by a summary of vaccine distribution will be provided according to \nthe cRMP guidance (Doc. Ref. EMEA/32706/2007 for pandemic):  \n \n\nDuring a pandemic situation, the frequency of submission of periodic safety update reports \nspecified in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 will not be adequate for the safety \nmonitoring of a pandemic vaccine for which high levels of exposure are expected within a \nshort period of time.  Such situation requires rapid notification of safety information that may \nhave the greatest implications for risk-benefit balance in a pandemic.  Prompt analysis of \ncumulative safety information, in light of extent of exposure, will be crucial for regulatory \ndecisions and protection of the population to be vaccinated.  In addition, duration a pandemic, \nresources needed for an in-depth evaluation of Periodic Safety Update Reports in the format as \ndefined in Volume 9a of the Rules Governing Medicinal Product in the European Union may \nnot be adequate for a rapid identification of a new safety issue.  \nIn consequence, as soon as the pandemic is declared (Phase 6 of the WHO global Influenza \npreparedness plan) and the pandemic vaccine is used, the MAH shall submit periodic safety \nupdate reports with periodicity and format defined as follows:  \n\n \nFrequency of submission \n-   The clock will start from the first Monday after shipment of the first batch of vaccine. \n-   First data-lock point is 14 days later. \n-   Report submission is no later than day 22 (i.e. the following Monday). \n-   Reporting to be fortnightly for the first 3 months of the pandemic. \n-   Periodicity will be reviewed by the MAH and the (Co)Rapporteur at 3 monthly intervals.   \n \nWhen it has been agreed by the CHMP that the S-PSUR is no longer necessary, a full PSUR covering \nthe period since the data lock point of the last routine PSUR will be submitted within a time frame to \nbe agreed with the Rapporteur. \n \nFormat  \nThe report shall include the following tables of aggregate data using the agreed templates: \n \n\n1. Fatal and/or life-threatening reactions \u2013 for each Preferred Term (PT), including the \nproportion of fatal reports  \n\n2. Adverse Events of Special Interest (PTs)  \n3.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Pumarix is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Pumarix \n3. How Pumarix is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Pumarix \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Pumarix is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Pumarix is and what it is used for \nPumarix is a vaccine for use in adults from 18 years old to prevent pandemic flu (influenza).  \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that happens at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many \ndecades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The signs of pandemic flu are similar to those of \nordinary flu but may be more serious. \n \nHow Pumarix works \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the body\u2019s natural defence system (immune system) produces its \nown protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Pumarix may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Pumarix \n \nPumarix should not be given: \n \n\u2022 if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of this \n\nvaccine (listed in section 6) or to anything else that may be present in very small amounts, such \nas: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde or sodium deoxycholate.  \n- Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling \n\nof the face or tongue.  \n- However, in a pandemic situation, you may still be given the vaccine. This is as long as \n\nmedical treatment is available straight away, in case you have an allergic reaction. \n \nDo not have Pumarix if any of the above apply to you.   \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n \n\n  33 \n\n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Pumarix: \n\u2022 if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any  \n\ningredient contained in this vaccine (listed in section 6) or to thiomersal, to egg and chicken \nprotein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde or to sodium deoxycholate. \n\n\u2022 if you have a serious infection with a high temperature (over 38\u00b0C). If this applies to you then \nyour vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such \nas a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor will advise whether you could still be \nvaccinated with Pumarix. \n\n\u2022 if you have problems with your immune system, since your response to the vaccine may then be \npoor. \n\n\u2022 if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first \nfew weeks after vaccination with Pumarix the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell the \ndoctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given Pumarix. \n\n\u2022 if you have a bleeding problem or you bruise easily. \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having \nPumarix.  This is because the vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed. \n \nFainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if \nyou fainted with a previous injection. \n \nChildren: \nIf your child receives the vaccine, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense after \nthe second dose, especially temperature over 38\u00b0C. Therefore monitoring of temperature and measures \nto lower the temperature (such as giving paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever) after each \ndose are recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Pumarix \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or \nhave recently received any other vaccine. \n \nIn particular, please tell your doctor or nurse if you are having any treatments (such as corticosteroid \ntreatments or chemotherapy for cancer) that affect the immune system.  Pumarix can still be given but \nyour response to the vaccine may be poor. \n \nPumarix is not intended to be given at the same time as some other vaccines. However, if this needs to \nhappen, the other vaccine will be injected into the other arm.  Any side effects that happen may be \nmore serious.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before you receive this vaccine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome effects listed in Section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d may affect your ability to drive or use tools or \nmachines. It is best to see how Pumarix affects you before you try these activities. \n \nPumarix contains thiomersal  \nPumarix contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you may experience an allergic \nreaction. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies. \n \nPumarix contains sodium and potassium  \nPumarix contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) per \ndose. It is essentially sodium- and potassium-free. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n \n\n  34 \n\n \n \n3. How Pumarix is given \n \n\u2022 Adults from 18 years onwards: you will receive two doses of Pumarix. The second dose should \n\nbe given after an interval of at least three weeks after the first dose. \n \nIf you have previously received one or two doses of a similar H5N1 AS03-containing vaccine \n \n\u2022 Adults from 18 years onwards: you will receive one dose of Pumarix.  \n \nUse in children \nThere is limited information available on the use of vaccine very similar to Pumarix (but manufactured \nin a different facility) to children aged from 3-9 years who received either two adult doses or two half \nadult doses given three weeks apart. There is no information available on use in children aged less \nthan 3 years or aged from 10-17 years. \n \nYour doctor or nurse will give you Pumarix. \n\u2022 They will give Pumarix as an injection into a muscle \n\u2022 This will usually be in the upper arm. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions \nAllergic reactions which may cause you to have dangerously low blood pressure.  If this is not treated \nit may lead to shock. Your doctors know that this might happen and will have emergency treatment \nready to use. \n \nOther side effects: \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\u2022 Pain where the injection was given \n\u2022 Headache \n\u2022 Feeling tired \n\u2022 Aching muscles, joint pain \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\u2022 Redness and swelling where the injection was given \n\u2022 Fever \n\u2022 Sweating \n\u2022 Shivering \n\u2022 Diarrhoea, feeling sick \n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\u2022 Reactions where the injection was given such as bruising, a hard lump, itching, warmth \n\u2022 Swollen glands in your neck \n\u2022 Feeling dizzy \n\u2022 Generally feeling unwell \n\u2022 Unusual weakness  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n \n\n  35 \n\n\u2022 Being sick, stomach pain, acid indigestion \n\u2022 Not being able to sleep \n\u2022 Tingling or numbness of the hands or feet \n\u2022 Shortness of breath \n\u2022 Pain in the chest \n\u2022 Itching, rash \n\u2022 Pain in the back or neck, stiff muscles, muscle spasms, pain in your leg or hand \n \nAdditional side effects in children \n \nWhen a dose of 0.5 ml of a similar vaccine was given to children aged 3-9 years, fever occurred more \noften than when half of this dose (0.25 ml of vaccine) was given. Also fever occurred more often in \nchildren aged 6-9 years compared to the children aged 3-5 years. There was no increase after the \nsecond dose whether the children received half of the adult or the adult dose, except for some side \neffects which were higher after the second dose, particularly for rates of fever in < 6 years old \nchildren. \n \nIn other clinical studies where children 6 months to 17 years received a similar vaccine containing \nA/Indonesia/05/2005, increases in the frequency of some side effects (including injection site pain, \nredness and fever) were seen after the second dose in children aged less than 6 years. \n\n \nThe side effects listed below have happened with H1N1 AS03-containing vaccines. They may also \nhappen with Pumarix. If any of the side effects below occur, please tell your doctor or nurse \nimmediately: \n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions leading to a dangerously low blood pressure. If this is not treated, it may lead \n\nto shock.  Your doctors will know that this might happen and will have emergency treatment \nready to use \n\n\u2022 Fits \n\u2022 Generalised skin reactions including urticaria (hives) \n \nThe side effects listed below have happened in the days or weeks after vaccination with vaccines given \nroutinely every year to prevent flu.  They may also happen with Pumarix. If any of the side effects \nbelow occur, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately: \n \nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people \n\u2022 Serious stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more of your nerves \n\u2022 Low blood platelet count. This can cause bleeding or bruising.  \n \nVery rare: may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people \n\u2022 Inflammation of your blood vessels (vasculitis). This can cause skin rashes, joint pain and \n\nkidney problems \n\u2022 Problems with your brain and nerves such as inflammation of the central nervous system \n\n(encephalomyelitis), inflammation of nerves (neuritis) or a type of paralysis known as \u2018Guillain-\nBarr\u00e9 Syndrome\u2019. \n\n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. \n \n \n5.

As an identified \nrisk, an appropriate warning should be included in section 4.4.

signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. - however, in a pandemic situation, you may still be given the vaccine. this is as long as medical treatment is available straight away, in case you have an allergic reaction. do not have pumarix if any of the above apply to you. if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. warnings and precautions 33 talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given pumarix: if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient contained in this vaccine (listed in section 6) or to thiomersal, to egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde or to sodium deoxycholate. if you have a serious infection with a high temperature (over 38). if this applies to you then your vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. a minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor will advise whether you could still be vaccinated with pumarix. if you have problems with your immune system, since your response to the vaccine may then be poor. if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. in the first few weeks after vaccination with pumarix the results of these tests may not be correct. tell the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given pumarix. if you have a bleeding problem or you bruise easily. if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having pumarix. this is because the vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed. fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection. children: if your child receives the vaccine, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense after the second dose, especially temperature over 38. therefore monitoring of temperature and measures to lower the temperature (such as giving paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever) after each dose are recommended. other medicines and pumarix tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine. in particular, please tell your doctor or nurse if you are having any treatments (such as corticosteroid treatments or chemotherapy for cancer) that affect the immune system. pumarix can still be given but your response to the vaccine may be poor. pumarix is not intended to be given at the same time as some other vaccines. however, if this needs to happen, the other vaccine will be injected into the other arm. any side effects that happen may be more serious. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before you receive this vaccine. driving and using machines some effects listed in section 4 \"possible side effects\" may affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. it is best to see how pumarix
