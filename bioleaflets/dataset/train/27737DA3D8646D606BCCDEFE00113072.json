NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZyclara 3.75% cream \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach sachet contains 9.375 mg of imiquimod in 250 mg cream (3.75%). \nEach gram of cream contains 37.5 mg of imiquimod. \n \nExcipients with known effects: \nMethyl parahydroxybenzoate (E 218) 2.0 mg/g cream \nPropyl parahydroxybenzoate (E 216) 0.2 mg/g cream \nCetyl alcohol 22.0 mg/g cream \nStearyl alcohol 31.0 mg/g cream \nBenzyl alcohol 20.0 mg/g cream \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nCream. \nWhite to faintly yellow cream with a uniform appearance. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nZyclara is indicated for the topical treatment of clinically typical, nonhyperkeratotic, nonhypertrophic, \nvisible or palpable actinic keratosis (AK) of the full face or balding scalp in immunocompetent adults \nwhen other topical treatment options are contraindicated or less appropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology  \n \nZyclara (per application: up to 2 sachets, 250 mg imiquimod cream per sachet) should be applied once \ndaily before bedtime to the skin of the affected treatment field (area) for two treatment cycles of 2 \nweeks each separated by a 2-week no-treatment cycle or as directed by the physician.  \n \nThe treatment area is the full face or balding scalp. \n \nLocal skin reactions in the treatment area are in part anticipated and common due to its mode of \naction (see section 4.4). A rest period of several days may be taken if required by the patient\u2019s \ndiscomfort or severity of the local skin reaction. However, neither 2-week treatment cycle should be \nextended due to missed doses or rest periods.  \n \nA transient increase in actinic keratosis counts may be observed during treatment due to the likely \neffect of imiquimod to reveal and treat subclinical lesions. Response to treatment cannot be \nadequately assessed until resolution of local skin reactions. Patients should continue treatment as \nprescribed. Treatment should be continued for the full treatment course even if all actinic keratosis \nappear to be gone. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe clinical outcome of therapy has to be determined after regeneration of the treated skin, \napproximately 8 weeks after the end of treatment and on appropriate intervals thereafter based on \nclinical judgment. Lesions that do not respond completely to treatment at 8 weeks after the second \ntreatment cycle should be carefully re-evaluated and one additional 2-week treatment of Zyclara may \nbe considered. \nA different therapy is recommended if the treated lesion(s) show(s) insufficient response to Zyclara. \nActinic keratosis lesions that have cleared after two Zyclara treatment cycles of 2 weeks and \nsubsequently recur can be re-treated with one or two further Zyclara treatment cycles of 2 weeks \nfollowing an at least 12 weeks treatment pause. \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n\nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment were not included in clinical trials. These patients should be \nmonitored under the close supervision of an experienced physician. \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of imiquimod in actinic keratosis in children and adolescents below the age of \n18 years have not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nZyclara is for external use only. Contact with eyes, lips, and nostrils should be avoided. \nThe treatment area should not be bandaged or otherwise occluded.  \nThe prescriber should demonstrate the proper application technique to the patient to maximise the \nbenefit of Zyclara therapy. \n \nZyclara should be applied once daily before bedtime to the skin of the affected treatment field (area) \nand remain on the skin for approximately 8 hours. During this period, showering and bathing should \nbe avoided. Before applying the cream, the patient should wash the treatment area with mild soap and \nwater and allow the area to dry thoroughly. Zyclara should be applied as a thin film to the entire \ntreatment area and rubbed in until the cream vanishes. Up to 2 sachets of Zyclara may be applied to \nthe treatment area (full face or scalp, but not both) at each daily application. Partially-used sachets \nshould be discarded and not reused. Zyclara should be left on the skin for approximately 8 hours; after \nthis time it is essential that the cream is removed by washing the area and the hands with mild soap \nand water.  \n \nHands should be washed carefully before and after application of cream. \n \nMissed dose \nIn case a dose is missed, patients should wait until the forthcoming night to apply Zyclara and then \ncontinue with the regular schedule. The cream should not be applied more than once daily. Each \ntreatment cycle should not be extended beyond 2 weeks due to missed doses or rest periods. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral instructions for treatment \nLesions clinically atypical for AK or suspicious for malignancy should be biopsied to determine \nappropriate treatment. \nContact with eyes, lips and nostrils should be avoided as imiquimod has not been evaluated for the \ntreatment of actinic keratosis on the eyelids, the inside of the nostrils or ears, or the lip area inside the \nvermilion border. \n\n\n\n4 \n\nImiquimod cream therapy is not recommended until the skin has healed after any previous medicinal \nproducts or surgical treatment. Application to broken skin could result in increased systemic \nabsorption of imiquimod leading to a greater risk of adverse events (see section 4.8 and 4.9). \nBecause of concern for heightened sunburn susceptibility, use of sunscreen is encouraged, and \npatients should minimise or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B \ntreatment) while using Zyclara. The skin surface area treated should be protected from solar exposure. \nImiquimod is not recommended for the treatment of AK lesions with marked hyperkeratosis or \nhypertrophy as seen in cutaneous horns. \n \nLocal skin reactions \nDuring therapy and until healed, affected skin is likely to appear noticeably different from normal \nskin. Local skin reactions are common but these reactions generally decrease in intensity during \ntherapy or resolve after cessation of imiquimod cream therapy. Rarely, intense local inflammatory \nreactions including skin weeping or erosion can occur after only a few applications of imiquimod \ncream.  \nThere is an association between the complete clearance rate and the intensity of local skin reactions \n(e.g. erythema). These local skin reactions may be related to the stimulation of local immune \nresponse. Furthermore, imiquimod has the potential to exacerbate inflammatory conditions of the \nskin. If required by the patient\u2019s discomfort or the intensity of the local skin reaction, a rest period of \nseveral days may be taken. Treatment with imiquimod cream can be resumed after the skin reaction \nhas moderated. The intensity of the local skin reactions tend to be lower in the second cycle than in \nthe first treatment cycle with Zyclara. \n \nSystemic reactions \nFlu-like systemic signs and symptoms may accompany, or even precede, intense local skin reactions \nand may include fatigue, nausea, fever, myalgias, arthralgias, and chills. An interruption of dosing or \ndose adjustment should be considered (see section 4.8). \nPatients with reduced haematologic reserve should be monitored under the close supervision of an \nexperienced physician (see section 4.8).  \n \nSpecial populations \nPatients with cardiac, hepatic or renal impairment were not included in clinical trials. These patients \nshould be monitored under the close supervision of an experienced physician. \n \nUse in immunocompromised patients and/or in patients with autoimmune conditions  \nThe safety and efficacy of Zyclara in immunocompromised patients (e.g. organ transplant patients) \nand/or patients with autoimmune conditions have not been established. Therefore, imiquimod cream \nshould be used with caution in these patients (see section 4.5). Consideration should be given to \nbalancing the benefit of imiquimod treatment for these patients with the risk associated either with the \npossibility of organ rejection or graft-versus-host disease or a possible worsening of their autoimmune \ncondition.  \n \nRe-treatment \nInformation on re-treating actinic keratosis lesions that have cleared after two Zyclara treatment \ncycles of 2 weeks and subsequently recur is given in section 4.2 and 5.1. \n \nExcipients \nStearyl alcohol and cetyl alcohol may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis). Benzyl \nalcohol may cause allergic reactions and mild local irritation. \nMethyl parahydroxybenzoate (E 218), and propyl parahydroxybenzoate (E 216) may cause allergic \nreactions (possibly delayed).  \n \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. This includes studies with immunosuppressive medicinal \nproducts. Interactions with systemic medicinal products would be limited by the minimal \npercutaneous absorption of imiquimod cream. \n \nDue to its immunostimulating properties, imiquimod cream should be used with caution in patients \nwho are receiving immunosuppressive medicinal products (see section 4.4). \n \nConcomitant use of Zyclara and any other imiquimod creams in the same treatment area should be \navoided since they contain the same active ingredient (imiquimod) and may increase the risk for and \nseverity of local skin reactions. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nPregnancy \nFor imiquimod no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/fetal development, parturition \nor postnatal development (see section 5.3). \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing Zyclara to pregnant women. Zyclara should be used \nduring pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether imiquimod/metabolites are excreted in human milk. \nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Zyclara \ntherapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the \nwoman. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical data are available, potential risk for human is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nZyclara has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile: \nThe data described below reflect exposure to Zyclara or vehicle in 319 subjects enrolled in two \ndouble-blind studies. Subjects applied up to two sachets of Zyclara 3.75% cream or vehicle daily to \nthe skin of the affected area (either entire face or balding scalp, but not both) for two 2-week \ntreatment cycles separated by a 2-week no-treatment cycle. \n \nIn clinical trials most patients (159/160) using Zyclara for the treatment of AK experience local skin \nreactions (most frequently erythema, scab, and exfoliation/application site dryness) at the application \nsite. However, only 11% (17/160) of patients in clinical trials with Zyclara required rest periods \n(treatment interruption) due to local adverse reactions. Some systemic adverse reactions, including \nheadache 6% (10/160), fatigue 4% (7/160), were reported by Zyclara treated patients in clinical trials. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nData presented in the table below reflects:  \n- exposure to Zyclara or vehicle in above mentioned studies (frequencies very common to \n\nuncommon and at greater frequency after vehicle). \n- experience with imiquimod 5% cream  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nFrequencies are defined as: \n \nVery common (\u2265 1/10);  \nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10);  \nUncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100);  \nRare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000);  \nVery rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n \nSystem organ class \n \n\nFrequency Adverse reactions \n\nInfections and infestations Common Herpes simplex \nUncommon \n \n\nInfection \nPustules \n\nFrequency not \nknown \n\nSkin infection \n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nCommon Lymphadenopathy \nFrequency not \nknown \n \n\nHaemoglobin decreased \nWhite blood cell count decreased \nNeutrophil count decreased \nPlatelet count decreased \n\nImmune system disorders Rare Exacerbation of autoimmune conditions \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Common Anorexia \n\nBlood glucose increased \nPsychiatric disorders Common Insomnia  \n\nUncommon Depression \nIrritability \n\nNervous system disorders Common Headache \nDizziness \n\nEye disorders Uncommon Conjunctival irritation \nEyelid oedema \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Nasal congestion \nPharyngo laryngeal pain \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Frequency not \nknown \n\nHepatic enzyme increased \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Nausea \nDiarrhoea \nVomiting \n\nUncommon Dry mouth \nAbdominal pain \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nVery common Erythema \nScab \nSkin exfoliation \nSkin oedema \nSkin ulcer \nSkin hypopigmentation \n\nCommon Dermatitis \nUncommon Face oedema \nRare Remote site dermatologic reaction \n\n \nFrequency not \nknown \n\nAlopecia \n \nErythema multiforme \nStevens Johnson syndrome \nCutaneous lupus erythematosus \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSkin hyperpigmentation \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon Myalgia \nArthralgia \n\nUncommon Back pain \nPain in extremity \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nVery common Application site erythema  \nApplication site scabbing \nApplication site exfoliation \nApplication site dryness \nApplication site oedema \nApplication site ulcer \nApplication site discharge \n\nCommon Application site reaction  \nApplication site pruritus  \nApplication site pain \nApplication site swelling \nApplication site burning \nApplication site irritation \nApplication site rash \nFatigue \nPyrexia \nInfluenza-like illness \nPain \nChest pain \n\nUncommon  Application site dermatitis \nApplication site bleeding \nApplication site papules \nApplication site paraesthesia \nApplication site hyperaesthesia \nApplication site inflammation \nApplication site scar \nApplication site skin breakdown \nApplication site vesicles \nApplication site warmth \nAsthenia \nChills \nLethargy \nDiscomfort \nInflammation \n\n \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nBlood system disorders  \n\nReductions in haemoglobin, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophils and platelets have been \nobserved in clinical trials investigating the use of imiquimod 5% cream. These reductions are not \nconsidered to be clinically significant in patients with normal haematologic reserve. Patients with \nreduced haematologic reserve have not been studied in clinical trials. Reductions in haematological \nparameters requiring clinical intervention have been reported from postmarketing experience.  \n \nSkin infections  \n\nSkin infections during treatment with imiquimod have been observed. While serious sequelae have \nnot resulted, the possibility of infection in broken skin should always be considered. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nHypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation \n\nReports have been received of localised hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation following \nimiquimod 5 % cream use. Follow-up information suggests that these skin colour changes may be \npermanent in some patients. \n \nRemote site dermatologic reactions \n\nRare cases of remote site dermatologic reactions, including erythema multiforme, have been reported \nfrom clinical trials with imiquimod 5% cream therapy.  \n \nAlopecia \n\nClinical studies investigating the use of imiquimod 5% cream for the treatment of actinic keratosis \nhave detected a 0.4% (5/1214) frequency of alopecia at the treatment site or surrounding area. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nWhen applied topically, systemic overdose with imiquimod cream is unlikely due to minimal \npercutaneous absorption. Studies in rabbits reveal a dermal lethal imiquimod dose of greater than \n5 g/kg. Persistent topical overdosing of imiquimod cream could result in severe local skin reactions \nand may increase the risk for systemic reactions.  \nFollowing accidental ingestion, nausea, emesis, headache, myalgia and fever could occur after a \nsingle dose of 200 mg imiquimod which corresponds to the content of more than 21 sachets of \nZyclara. The most clinically serious adverse event reported following multiple oral doses of \uf0b3 200 mg \nwas hypotension which resolved following oral or intravenous fluid administration. \n \nManagement of overdose should consist of treatment of clinical symptoms. \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibiotics and chemotherapeutics for dermatological use, antivirals, \nATC Code: D06BB10  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nImiquimod is an immune response modifier. It is the lead compound of the imidazoline family. \nSaturable binding studies suggest membrane receptors for imiquimod exists on responding cells; these \nare called toll-like receptor 7 and 8. Imiquimod induces the release of interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) and \nother cytokines from a variety of human and animal cells (e.g. from human monocytes/macrophages \nand keratinocytes). Topical in vivo application of imiquimod cream on mouse skin resulted in \nincreased concentrations of IFN and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) compared with skin of untreated \nmice. The panel of induced cytokines varies with the cell\u2019s tissue origin. In addition, release of \ncytokines was induced following dermal application and oral administration of imiquimod in various \nlaboratory animals and in human studies. In animal models imiquimod is effective against viral \ninfections and acts as an antitumour agent principally by inducing release of alpha interferon and \nother cytokines. \n \nIncreases in systemic levels of alpha interferon and other cytokines following topical application of \nimiquimod were also observed in human data. \n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe efficacy of Zyclara was studied in two double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled clinical \nstudies. Patients had 5-20 typical visible or palpable AK lesions in an area that exceeded 25 cm2 on \neither the face or balding scalp. 319 subjects with AK were treated with up to 2 sachets once daily of \nimiquimod 3.75% cream, or a matching vehicle cream for two treatment cycles of 2 weeks separated \nby a 2-week no-treatment cycle. For the combined trials the complete clearance rate of the full face or \nbalding scalp under imiquimod 3.75% cream was 35.6% (57/160 patients, CI 28.2%, 43.6 %) under \nvehicle 6.3% (10/159 patients, CI 3.1%, 11.3%) at the 8-week post-treatment visit. No overall \ndifferences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years or older and the \nyounger patients. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was reported in 1.3% (2/160) of patients treated \nwith imiquimod 3.75%, in 0.6% (1/159) treated with vehicle. This difference was not statistically \nsignificant. \n \nIn a follow-up study where initially cleared patients with imiquimod 3.75% were followed for at least \n14 months without any further AK-treatment, 40.5% of the patients showed sustained complete \nclearance of the whole treatment area (either full face or scalp) There are no data for imiquimod \n3.75% on long-term clearance beyond that. \n \nTwo open-label randomized, controlled studies investigated the long-term effects of imiquimod 5% \n(and not with this 3.75% product) in comparison to topical diclofenac (3% gel). In these studies, the \ntreated AK field was located on the balding scalp or face with a contiguous area of about 40 cm\u00b2 and \npresenting with a median number of 7 clinically typical AK lesions at baseline. Study treatments were \ngiven as officially recommended. These studies showed that imiquimod was better than topical \ndiclofenac in preventing the histological progression of AK lesions to in-situ or invasive squamous \ncell carcinoma (SCC). In addition, these studies supported the use of up to two additional treatment \ncycles of imiquimod when the AK lesions are not completely cleared or if the AK lesions recurred \nafter successful initial treatment with imiquimod. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nZyclara in all subsets of the paediatric population in actinic keratosis (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \nLess than 0.9% of a topically applied single dose of radiolabelled imiquimod was absorbed through \nthe skin of human subjects.  \nSystemic exposure (percutaneous penetration) was calculated from recovery of carbon-14 from [14C] \nimiquimod in urine and faeces. \nDuring a pharmacokinetic study with imiquimod 3.75% cream following application of 2 sachets once \ndaily (18.75 mg imiquimod/day) for up to three weeks to the entire face and/or scalp (approximately \n200 cm2), low systemic absorption of imiquimod was observed in patients with AK. Steady-state \nlevels were achieved in 2 weeks and time to maximal concentrations (Tmax) ranged between 6 and 9 \nhours after last application.  \n \nDistribution \nThe mean peak serum imiquimod concentration at the end of the pharmacokinetic study was \n0.323 ng/mL.  \n \nBiotransformation \nOrally administered imiquimod is rapidly and extensively metabolised into two main metabolites.  \n \nElimination \nThe small amount of medicinal product which was absorbed into the systemic circulation was \npromptly excreted by both urinary and faecal routes at a mean ratio of approximately 3 to 1. \n\n\n\n10 \n\nThe apparent half-life following topical dosing of 3.75% imiquimod cream in the pharmacokinetic \nstudy was calculated as approximately 29 hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, mutagenicity and teratogenicity.  \n \nIn a four-month rat dermal toxicity study, significantly decreased body weight and increased spleen \nweight were observed at 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg; similar effects were not seen in a four-month mouse \ndermal study. Local dermal irritation, especially at higher doses, was observed in both species.  \n \nA 18-month mouse carcinogenicity study by dermal administration on three days a week did not \ninduce tumours at the application site. Only in female mice, the incidences of hepatocellular \nadenomas were slightly greater than those for controls. The incidence corresponds well with the \nspectrum of spontaneous tumours, as is known in mice in correspondence with their age. Therefore, \nthese findings are considered to be incidental. As imiquimod has low systemic absorption from human \nskin, and is not mutagenic, any risk to humans from systemic exposure is likely to be low. \nFurthermore, tumours were not seen at any site in a 2-year oral carcinogenicity study in rats. \n \nImiquimod cream was evaluated in a photocarcinogenicity bioassay in albino hairless mice exposed to \nsimulated solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Animals were administered imiquimod cream three times \nper week and were irradiated 5 days per week for 40 weeks. Mice were maintained for an additional \n12 weeks. Tumours occurred earlier and in greater number in the group of mice administered the \nvehicle cream in comparison with the low UVR control group. The significance for man is unknown. \nTopical administration of imiquimod cream resulted in no tumour enhancement at any dose, in \ncomparison with the vehicle cream group. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n\n1.   What Zyclara is and what it is used for \n2.   What you need to know before you use Zyclara \n3.   How to use Zyclara \n4.   Possible side effects \n5.   How to store Zyclara  \n6.   Content of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n1. What Zyclara is and what it is used for \n \nZyclara 3.75% cream contains the active substance imiquimod, which is an Immune Response \nModifier (to stimulate the human immune system). \n \nThis medicine is prescribed for the treatment of actinic keratosis in adults. \n \nThis medicine stimulates your body\u2019s own immune system to produce natural substances which help \nfight your actinic keratosis.  \n \nActinic keratosis appears as rough areas of skin found in people who have been exposed to a lot of \nsunshine over the course of their lifetime. These areas can be the same colour as your skin or are \ngreyish, pink, red or brown. They can be flat and scaly, or raised, rough, hard and warty. \n \nThis medicine should only be used for actinic keratosis on the face or scalp if your doctor has decided \nthat it is the most appropriate treatment for you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Zyclara \n \nDo not use Zyclara.  \n \n- if you are allergic to imiquimod or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Zyclara: \n\n\u2022 if you have previously used this medicine or other similar preparations in a different \nconcentration.  \n\n\u2022 if you have problems with your immune system or if you take medicine to suppress your \nimmune system (e.g. after an organ transplant). \n\n\n\n22 \n\n\u2022 if you have an abnormal blood count. \n \n \n\nGeneral instructions during treatment \n \n\n\u2022 If you have recently had surgery or medicinal treatment, wait until the area to be treated has \nhealed before using this medicine. \n\n\u2022 Avoid contact with the eyes, lips and nostrils. In the event of accidental contact, remove \ncream by rinsing with water. \n\n\u2022 Only use the cream externally (on the skin of face or scalp). \n\u2022 Do not use more cream than your doctor has advised. \n\u2022 Do not cover the treated area with bandages or other dressings after you have applied this \n\nmedicine. \n\u2022 If the treated site becomes too uncomfortable, wash the cream off with mild soap and water. \n\nOnce the discomfort stops you can resume your treatment schedule as recommended. The \ncream should not be applied more than once daily. \n\n\u2022 Do not use sunlamps or tanning-beds, and avoid exposure to sunlight as much as possible \nduring treatment with this medicine. If you go outside during the day use sunscreen and wear \nprotective clothing and a wide-brimmed hat. \n\n \nLocal skin reactions \n \nWhile using Zyclara, you may experience local skin reactions because of the way it acts on your skin. \nThese reactions can be a sign that the medicine is working as intended. \n \nWhilst using Zyclara and until healed, the treatment area is likely to appear noticeably different from \nnormal skin. There is also a possibility that existing inflammation may temporarily worsen. \nThis medicine may also cause flu-like symptoms (including tiredness, nausea, fever, muscle and joint \npain, and shivering) before or during the occurrence of local skin reactions.  \nIf flu-like symptoms or feeling discomfort or intense local skin reactions occur, a rest period of \nseveral days may be taken. You could resume treatment with imiquimod cream after the skin reaction \nhas moderated. However, neither 2-week treatment cycle should be extended due to missed doses or \nrest periods.  \nThe intensity of the local skin reactions tend to be lower in the second cycle than in the first treatment \ncycle with Zyclara. \n \nResponse to treatment cannot be adequately assessed until resolution of local skin reactions. You \nshould continue treatment as prescribed. \nThis medicine may reveal and treat actinic keratosis that have not be seen or felt before, and these \nmay later go away. You should continue application for the full treatment course even if all actinic \nkeratosis appear to be gone. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThis medicine should not be given to children below the age of 18 years because the safety and \nefficacy in patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. There are no data available \nof the use of imiquimod in children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Zyclara \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIf you receive immunosuppressive medicinal products which inhibit the immune system, tell your \ndoctor before starting the treatment. \n\n\n\n23 \n\nAvoid the concomitant use of Zyclara and any other imiquimod cream in the same treatment area. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine.  \n \nYour doctor will discuss the risks and benefits of using Zyclara during pregnancy. Studies in animals \ndo not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects in pregnancy.  \n \nIt is not known whether imiquimod passes into breast milk. You should not use Zyclara if you are \nbreast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. Your doctor will discuss if you should discontinue breast-\nfeeding or discontinue Zyclara treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThis medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nZyclara contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate, propyl parahydroxybenzoate, cetyl alcohol, \nstearyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol \n \nMethyl parahydroxybenzoate (E 218), and propyl parahydroxybenzoate (E 216), may cause allergic \nreactions (possibly delayed). Cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol may cause local skin reactions (e.g. \ncontact dermatitis).  \nThis medicine contains 5 mg benzyl alcohol in each sachet. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic \nreactions and mild local irritation. \n \n \n3. How to use Zyclara  \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. Do not use this medicine until your doctor has shown you the right way to use it. \n \nThis medicine should only be used for actinic keratosis on the face and scalp. \n \nDosage \nApply this medicine to the affected area once a day just before bedtime. \nMaximum daily dose is 2 sachets (500 mg = 2 sachets of 250 mg each). \nThis medicine should not be applied to areas larger than either the full face or balding scalp.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \n\n \n\n1. Before going to bed, wash your hands and the \ntreatment area carefully with mild soap and water. Dry hands \nthoroughly and allow the area to dry. \n \n\n \n\n2.  Open a new sachet of Zyclara just before use and \nsqueeze some cream onto your fingertip. No more than 2 \nsachets should be used per application. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n3. Apply a thin layer of Zyclara to the affected area. Rub \ngently into the area until the cream vanishes. Avoid contact \nwith the eyes, lips and nostrils. \n \n\n \n\n4. After application of the cream, throw away the opened \nsachet. Wash hands well with soap and water. \n \n\n \n\n5. Leave Zyclara on the skin for about 8 hours. Do not \nshower or bathe the area during this time. Do not cover the \ntreated area with bandages or other dressings. \n \n\n \n\n6. After about 8 hours, wash the area where Zyclara was \napplied with mild soap and water. \n \n\n \n \nDuration of treatment \nThe treatment starts with a daily application for two weeks, followed by a break without any \napplication for two weeks, and then ends with a daily application again for two weeks. \n \nIf you use more Zyclara than you should \n \nIf you have applied too much cream, wash the extra away with mild soap and water. \nWhen any skin reaction has gone you may then continue with your treatment in the recommended \nregular schedule. The cream should not be applied more than once daily. \n \nIf you accidentally swallow this medicine please contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Zyclara \n \nIf you miss a dose of Zyclara, wait until the next night to apply it and then continue with the regular \nschedule. The cream should not be applied more than once daily. Each treatment cycle should last no \nlonger than two weeks, even if you have missed doses. \n \nIf you stop using Zyclara \n \nTalk to your doctor before you stop treatment with Zyclara. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
