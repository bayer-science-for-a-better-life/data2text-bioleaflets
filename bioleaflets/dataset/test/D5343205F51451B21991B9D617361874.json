NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRasagiline Mylan 1 mg tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach tablet contains rasagiline tartrate corresponding to 1 mg rasagiline. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nTablet \n\n \n\nWhite to off-white, oblong (approximately 11.5 mm x 6 mm) biconvex tablets, debossed with \u2018R9SE\u2019 \n\non one side and \u20181\u2019 on the other side.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRasagiline Mylan is indicated for the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) as monotherapy \n\n(without levodopa) or as adjunct therapy (with levodopa) in patients with end of dose fluctuations. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nRasagiline is administered orally, at a dose of 1 mg once daily with or without levodopa. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo change in dose is required for elderly patients. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment  \n\nRasagiline use in patients with severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\nRasagiline use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be avoided. Caution should be \n\nused when initiating treatment with rasagiline in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In case \n\npatients progress from mild to moderate hepatic impairment rasagiline should be stopped (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo change in dose is required for renal impairment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nRasagiline is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to lack of data on safety and \n\nefficacy. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor oral use. \n\n \n\nRasagiline may be taken with or without food. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (listed in section 6.1). \n\n \n\nConcomitant treatment with other monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (including medicinal and \n\nnatural products without prescription e.g. St. John's Wort) or pethidine (see section 4.5). At least \n\n14 days must elapse between discontinuation of rasagiline and initiation of treatment with MAO \n\ninhibitors or pethidine. \n\n \n\nSevere hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nThe concomitant use of rasagiline and fluoxetine or fluvoxamine should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n\nAt least five weeks should elapse between discontinuation of fluoxetine and initiation of treatment \n\nwith rasagiline. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of rasagiline and initiation of \n\ntreatment with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine. \n\n \n\nImpulse control disorders (ICDs) can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or \n\ndopaminergic treatments. Similar reports of ICDs have also been received post-marketing with \n\nrasagiline. Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. \n\nPatients and carers should be made aware of the behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders \n\nthat were observed in patients treated with rasagiline, including cases of compulsions, obsessive \n\nthoughts, pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, impulsive behaviour and \n\ncompulsive spending or buying. \n\n \n\nSince rasagiline potentiates the effects of levodopa, the adverse effects of levodopa may be increased \n\nand pre-existing dyskinesia exacerbated. Decreasing the dose of levodopa may ameliorate this side \n\neffect. \n\n \n\nThere have been reports of hypotensive effects when rasagiline is taken concomitantly with levodopa. \n\nPatients with Parkinson\u2019s disease are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of hypotension due \n\nto existing gait issues. \n\n \n\nThe concomitant use of rasagiline and dextromethorphan or sympathomimetics such as those present \n\nin nasal and oral decongestants or cold medicinal product containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine is \n\nnot recommended (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nDuring the clinical development program, the occurrence of cases of melanoma prompted the \n\nconsideration of a possible association with rasagiline. The data collected suggests that Parkinson\u2019s \n\ndisease, and not any medicinal products in particular, is associated with a higher risk of skin cancer \n\n(not exclusively melanoma). Any suspicious skin lesion should be evaluated by a specialist. \n\n \n\nCaution should be used when initiating treatment with rasagiline in patients with mild hepatic \n\nimpairment. Rasagiline use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be avoided. In case \n\npatients progress from mild to moderate hepatic impairment, rasagiline should be stopped (see section \n\n5.2). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nThere are a number of known interactions between non-selective MAO inhibitors and other medicinal \n\nproducts. \n\n \n\nRasagiline must not be administered along with other MAO inhibitors (including medicinal and \n\nnatural products without prescription e.g. St. John's Wort) as there may be a risk of non-selective \n\nMAO inhibition that may lead to hypertensive crises (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSerious adverse reactions have been reported with the concomitant use of pethidine and MAO \n\ninhibitors including another selective MAO-B inhibitor. The concomitant administration of rasagiline \n\nand pethidine is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nWith MAO inhibitors there have been reports of medicinal product interactions with the concomitant \n\nuse of sympathomimetic medicinal products. Therefore, in view of the MAO inhibitory activity of \n\nrasagiline, concomitant administration of rasagiline and sympathomimetics such as those present in \n\nnasal and oral decongestants or cold medicinal products, containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, is \n\nnot recommended (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThere have been reports of medicinal product interactions with the concomitant use of \n\ndextromethorphan and non-selective MAO inhibitors. Therefore, in view of the MAO inhibitory \n\nactivity of rasagiline, the concomitant administration of rasagiline and dextromethorphan is not \n\nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe concomitant use of rasagiline and fluoxetine or fluvoxamine should be avoided (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFor concomitant use of rasagiline with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/selective \n\nserotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in clinical trials, see section 4.8. \n\n \n\nSerious adverse reactions have been reported with the concomitant use of SSRIs, SNRIs, \n\ntricyclic/tetracyclic antidepressants and MAO inhibitors. Therefore, in view of the MAO inhibitory \n\nactivity of rasagiline, antidepressants should be administered with caution. \n\n \n\nIn Parkinson's disease patients receiving chronic levodopa treatment as adjunct therapy, there was no \n\nclinically significant effect of levodopa treatment on rasagiline clearance. \n\n \n\nIn vitro metabolism studies have indicated that cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is the major enzyme \n\nresponsible for the metabolism of rasagiline. Co-administration of rasagiline and ciprofloxacin (an \n\ninhibitor of CYP1A2) increased the AUC of rasagiline by 83%. Co-administration of rasagiline and \n\ntheophylline (a substrate of CYP1A2) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either product. Thus, \n\npotent CYP1A2 inhibitors may alter rasagiline plasma levels and should be administered with caution. \n\n \n\nThere is a risk that the plasma levels of rasagiline in smoking patients could be decreased, due to \n\ninduction of the metabolising enzyme CYP1A2. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies showed that rasagiline at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml (equivalent to a level that is \n\n160 times the average Cmax ~ 5.9-8.5 ng/ml in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients after 1 mg rasagiline \n\nmultiple dosing), did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, \n\nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4 and CYP4A. These results indicate that rasagiline\u2019s \n\ntherapeutic concentrations are unlikely to cause any clinically significant interference with substrates \n\nof these enzymes. \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of rasagiline and entacapone increased rasagiline oral clearance by 28%. \n\n \n\nTyramine/rasagiline interaction: Results of five tyramine challenge studies (in volunteers and PD \n\npatients), together with results of home monitoring of blood pressure after meals (of 464 patients \n\ntreated with 0.5 or 1 mg/day of rasagiline or placebo as adjunct therapy to levodopa for six months \n\nwithout tyramine restrictions), and the fact that there were no reports of tyramine/rasagiline interaction \n\nin clinical studies conducted without tyramine restriction, indicate that rasagiline can be used safely \n\nwithout dietary tyramine restrictions. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nFor rasagiline no clinical data on exposed pregnancies is available. Animals studies do not indicate \n\ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition \n\nor postnatal development (see section 5.3). Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant \n\nwomen. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nExperimental data indicated that rasagiline inhibits prolactin secretion and thus, may inhibit lactation. \n\nIt is not known whether rasagiline is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when \n\nrasagiline is administered to a breast-feeding mother. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n \n\nPatients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they \n\nare reasonably certain that Rasagiline does not affect them adversely. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nIn the rasagiline clinical program overall, 1,361 patients were treated with rasagiline for \n\n3,076.4 patient years. In the double blind placebo-controlled studies, 529 patients were treated with \n\nrasagiline 1 mg/day for 212 patient years and 539 patients received placebo for 213 patient years. \n\n \n\nMonotherapy \n\nThe list below includes adverse reactions which were reported with a higher incidence in placebo \n\ncontrolled studies, in patients receiving 1 mg/day rasagiline (rasagiline group n=149, placebo group \n\nn=151). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions with at least 2% difference over placebo are marked in italics.  \n\nIn parentheses is the adverse reaction incidence (% of patients) in rasagiline vs. placebo, respectively. \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency using the following conventions: very \n\ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n\n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000). \n\n \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nCommon: influenza (4.7% vs. 0.7%) \n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) \n\nCommon: skin carcinoma (1.3% vs. 0.7%) \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nCommon: leucopenia (1.3% vs. 0%) \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nCommon: allergy (1.3% vs. 0.7%) \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nUncommon: decreased appetite (0.7% vs. 0%) \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nCommon: depression (5.4% vs. 2%), hallucinations (1.3% vs. 0.7%) \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nVery common: headache (14.1% vs. 11.9%) \n\nUncommon: cerebrovascular accident (0.7% vs. 0%) \n\n\n\n6 \n\nEye disorders \n\nCommon: conjunctivitis (2.7% vs. 0.7%) \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\nCommon: vertigo (2.7% vs. 1.3%) \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nCommon: angina pectoris (1.3% vs. 0%); \n\nUncommon: myocardial infarction (0.7% vs. 0%) \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nCommon: rhinitis (3.4% vs. 0.7%) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon: flatulence (1.3% vs.0%) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nCommon: dermatitis (2.0% vs. 0%) \n\nUncommon: vesiculobullous rash (0.7% vs. 0%) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon: musculoskeletal pain (6.7% vs. 2.6%), neck pain (2.7% vs. 0%), arthritis (1.3% vs.0.7%) \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nCommon: urinary urgency (1.3% vs. 0.7%). \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon: fever (2.7% vs. 1.3%), malaise (2% vs. 0%) \n\n \n\nAdjunct therapy \n\nThe list below includes adverse reactions which were reported with a higher incidence in placebo \n\ncontrolled studies in patients receiving 1 mg/day rasagiline (rasagiline group n=380, placebo group \n\nn=388).

In post-marketing \n\nexperience, these symptoms have also been observed in Parkinson's disease patients treated with \n\nrasagiline. \n\n \n\nSerious adverse reactions are known to occur with the concomitant use of SSRIs, SNRIs, \n\ntricyclic/tetracyclic antidepressants and MAO inhibitors. In the post-marketing period, cases of \n\nserotonin syndrome associated with agitation, confusion, rigidity, pyrexia and myoclonus have been \n\nreported by patients treated with antidepressants/SNRI concomitantly with rasagiline. \n\n \n\nRasagiline clinical trials did not allow concomitant use of fluoxetine or fluvoxamine with rasagiline, \n\nbut the following antidepressants and doses were allowed in the rasagiline trials: amitriptyline \n\n\u2264 50 mg/daily, trazodone \u2264 100 mg/daily, citalopram \u2264 20 mg/daily, sertraline \u2264 100 mg/daily, and \n\nparoxetine \u2264 30 mg/daily. There were no cases of serotonin syndrome in the rasagiline clinical \n\nprogram in which 115 patients were exposed concomitantly to rasagiline and tricyclics and \n\n141 patients were exposed to rasagiline and SSRIs/ SNRIs. \n\n \n\nIn the post-marketing period, cases of elevated blood pressure, including rare cases of hypertensive \n\ncrisis associated with ingestion of unknown amounts of tyramine-rich foods, have been reported in \n\npatients taking rasagiline. \n\n \n\nWith MAO inhibitors, there have been reports of drug interactions with the concomitant use of \n\nsympathomimetic medicinal products. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing period, there was one case of elevated blood pressure in a patient using the \n\nophthalmic vasoconstrictor tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride while taking rasagiline. \n\n \n\nImpulse control disorders \n\nPathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating \n\nand compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic \n\ntreatments. A similar pattern of impulse control disorders has been reported post-marketing with \n\nrasagiline, which also included compulsions, obsessive thoughts and impulsive behaviour (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\n \n\nSymptoms reported following overdose of rasagiline in doses ranging from 3 mg to 100 mg included \n\ndysphoria, hypomania, hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome. \n\n \n\nOverdose can be associated with significant inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B. In a single-dose \n\nstudy healthy volunteers received 20 mg/day and in a ten-day study healthy volunteers received \n\n10  mg/day. Adverse events were mild or moderate and not related to rasagiline treatment. In a dose \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nescalation study in patients on chronic levodopa therapy treated with 10 mg/day of rasagiline, there \n\nwere reports of cardiovascular undesirable reactions (including hypertension and postural \n\nhypotension) which resolved following treatment discontinuation. These symptoms may resemble \n\nthose observed with non-selective MAO inhibitors. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\nThere is no specific antidote. In case of overdose, patients should be monitored and the appropriate \n\nsymptomatic and supportive therapy instituted. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-Parkinson drugs, Monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors, ATC code: \n\nN04BD02 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nRasagiline was shown to be a potent, irreversible MAO-B selective inhibitor, which may cause an \n\nincrease in extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum. The elevated dopamine level and \n\nsubsequent increased dopaminergic activity are likely to mediate rasagiline's beneficial effects seen in \n\nmodels of dopaminergic motor dysfunction.  \n\n \n\n1-Aminoindan is an active major metabolite and it is not a MAO-B inhibitor. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of rasagiline was established in three studies: as monotherapy treatment in study I and as \n\nadjunct therapy to levodopa in the studies II and III. \n\n \n\nMonotherapy \n\n \n\nIn study I, 404 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (138 patients), rasagiline 1 mg/day \n\n(134 patients) or rasagiline 2 mg/day (132 patients) and were treated for 26 weeks, there was no active \n\ncomparator. \n\n \n\nIn this study, the primary measure of efficacy was the change from baseline in the total score of the \n\nUnified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS, parts I-III). The difference between the mean \n\nchange from baseline to week 26/termination (LOCF, Last Observation Carried Forward) was \n\nstatistically significant (UPDRS, parts I-III: for rasagiline 1 mg compared to placebo -4.2, 95% CI \n\n[-5.7, -2.7]; p<0.0001; for rasagiline 2 mg compared to placebo -3.6, 95% CI [-5.0, -2.1]; p<0.0001, \n\nUPDRS Motor, part II: for rasagiline 1 mg compared to placebo -2.7, 95% CI [-3.87, -1.55], p<0.0001; \n\nfor rasagiline 2 mg compared to placebo -1.68, 95% CI [-2.85, -0.51], p=0.0050). The effect was \n\nevident, although its magnitude was modest in this patient population with mild disease. There was a \n\nsignificant and beneficial effect in quality of life (as assessed by PD-QUALIF scale). \n\n \n\nAdjunct therapy \n\n \n\nIn study II, patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (229 patients), or rasagiline 1 mg/day \n\n(231 patients) or the catechol-O\u2013methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor, entacapone, 200 mg taken \n\nalong with scheduled doses of levodopa (LD)/decarboxylase inhibitor (227 patients), and were treated \n\nfor 18 weeks. In study III, patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (159 patients), \n\nrasagiline 0.5 mg/day (164 patients), or rasagiline 1 mg/day (149 patients), and were treated for \n\n26 weeks. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nIn both studies, the primary measure of efficacy was the change from baseline to treatment period in \n\nthe mean number of hours that were spent in the \u201cOFF\u201d state during the day (determined from \n\n\u201c24-hour\u201d home diaries completed for 3 days prior to each of the assessment visits). \n\n \n\nIn study II, the mean difference in the number of hours spent in the \u201cOFF\u201d state compared to placebo \n\nwas -0.78h, 95% CI [-1.18, -0.39], p=0.0001. The mean total daily decrease in the OFF time was \n\nsimilar in the entacapone group (-0.80h, 95% CI [-1.20, -0.41], p<0.0001) to that observed in the \n\nrasagiline 1 mg group. In study III, the mean difference compared to placebo was -0.94h, 95% CI \n\n[-1.36, -0.51], p<0.0001. There was also a statistically significant improvement over placebo with the \n\nrasagiline 0.5 mg group, yet the magnitude of improvement was lower. The robustness of the results \n\nfor the primary efficacy end point, was confirmed in a battery of additional statistical models and was \n\ndemonstrated in three cohorts (ITT, per protocol and completers). \n\n \n\nThe secondary measures of efficacy included global assessments of improvement by the examiner, \n\nActivities of Daily Living (ADL) subscale scores when OFF and UPDRS motor while ON. Rasagiline \n\nproduced statistically significant benefit compared to placebo. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nRasagiline is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentration (Cmax) in approximately \n\n0.5 hours. The absolute bioavailability of a single rasagiline dose is about 36%. \n\n \n\nFood does not affect the Tmax of rasagiline, although Cmax and exposure (AUC) are decreased by \n\napproximately 60% and 20%, respectively, when the medicinal product is taken with a high fat meal. \n\n \n\nBecause AUC is not substantially affected, rasagiline can be administered with or without food. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe mean volume of distribution following a single intravenous dose of rasagiline is 243 l. \n\n \n\nPlasma protein binding following a single oral dose of 14C-labelled rasagiline is approximately 60 to \n\n70%. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nRasagiline undergoes almost complete biotransformation in the liver prior to excretion. The \n\nmetabolism of rasagiline proceeds through two main pathways: N-dealkylation and/or hydroxylation \n\nto yield: 1-Aminoindan, 3-hydroxy-N-propargyl-1 aminoindan and 3-hydroxy-1-aminoindan. In vitro \n\nexperiments indicate that both routes of rasagiline metabolism are dependent on cytochrome P450 \n\nsystem, with CYP1A2 being the major iso-enzyme involved in rasagiline metabolism. Conjugation of \n\nrasagiline and its metabolites was also found to be a major elimination pathway to yield glucuronides. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nAfter oral administration of 14C-labelled rasagiline, elimination occurred primarily via urine (62.6%) \n\nand secondarily via faeces (21.8%), with a total recovery of 84.4% of the dose over a period of \n\n38 days. Less than 1% of rasagiline is excreted as unchanged product in urine. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nRasagiline pharmacokinetics are linear with dose over the range of 0.5-2 mg. Its terminal half-life is \n\n0.6-2 hours. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment: In subjects with mild hepatic impairment, AUC and Cmax were increased by 80% \n\nand 38%, respectively. In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, AUC and Cmax were increased \n\nby 568% and 83%, respectively (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment: Rasagiline's pharmacokinetics characteristics in subjects with mild (CLcr \n\n50-80 ml/min) and moderate (CLcr 30-49 ml/min) renal impairment were similar to healthy subjects. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity and reproduction toxicity. \n\n \n\nRasagiline did not present genotoxic potential in vivo and in several in vitro systems using bacteria or \n\nhepatocytes. In the presence of metabolite activation rasagiline induced an increase of chromosomal \n\naberrations at concentrations with excessive cytotoxicity which are unattainable at the clinical \n\nconditions of use. \n\n \n\nRasagiline was not carcinogenic in rats at systemic exposure, 84-339 times the expected plasma \n\nexposures in humans at 1 mg/day. In mice, increased incidences of combined bronchiolar/alveolar \n\nadenoma and/or carcinoma were observed at systemic exposures, 144-213-times the expected plasma \n\nexposure in humans at 1 mg/day. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What you need to know before you take Rasagiline Mylan  \n\n3. How to take Rasagiline Mylan \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store Rasagiline Mylan \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Rasagiline Mylan is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nRasagiline Mylan is used for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease. It can be used together with or \n\nwithout levodopa (another medicine that is used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease). \n\n \n\nWith Parkinson\u2019s disease, there is a loss of cells that produce dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a \n\nchemical in the brain involved in movement control. Rasagiline Mylan helps to increase and sustain \n\nlevels of dopamine in the brain. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Rasagiline Mylan \n\n \n\nDo not take Rasagiline Mylan: \n\n- if you are allergic to rasagiline or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n- if you have severe liver problems. \n \n\nDo not take the following medicines while taking Rasagaline Mylan:  \n\n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (e.g. for treatment of depression or Parkinson\u2019s disease, \nor used for any other indication), including medicinal and natural products without prescription \n\ne.g. St. John's Wort. \n\n- pethidine (a strong pain killer). \nYou must wait at least 14 days after stopping Rasagiline Mylan treatment and starting treatment with \n\nMAO inhibitors or pethidine. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Rasagiline Mylan. \n\n- if you have mild to moderate liver problems \n- if you have any suspicious skin changes. \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nRasagiline Mylan is not recommended for use under the age of 18. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nOther medicines and Rasagiline Mylan \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without prescription or if you are smoking or intend to stop \n\nsmoking. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor for advice before taking any of the following medicines together with Rasagiline \n\nMylan: \n\nCertain antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin-norepinephrine \n\nreuptake inhibitors, tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants) \n\nthe antibiotic ciprofloxacin used against infections \n\nthe cough suppressant dextromethorphan \n\nsympathomimetics such as those present in eye drops, nasal and oral decongestants and cold medicine \n\ncontaining ephedrine or pseudoephedrine \n\n \n\nThe use of Rasagiline Mylan together with the antidepressants containing fluoxetine or fluvoxamine \n\nshould be avoided. \n\n \n\nIf you are starting treatment with Rasagiline Mylan, you should wait at least 5 weeks after stopping \n\nfluoxetine treatment. \n\n \n\nIf you are starting treatment with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine, you should wait at least 14 days after \n\nstopping Rasagiline Mylan treatment. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing unusual behaviours where \n\nyou cannot resist the impulse, urges or cravings to carry out certain harmful or detrimental activities to \n\nyourself or others. These are called impulse control disorders. In patients taking Rasagiline Mylan \n\nand/or other medications used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, behaviours such as compulsions, obsessive \n\nthoughts, addictive gambling, excessive spending, impulsive behaviour and an abnormally high sex \n\ndrive or an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings have been observed. Your doctor may need to adjust \n\nor stop your dose. \n\n \n\nRasagiline Mylan with food and drink \n\nRasagiline Mylan may be taken with or without food. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Ask your \n\ndoctor for advice prior to driving or using machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Rasagiline Mylan \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 1 tablet of 1 mg taken by mouth once daily. Rasagiline Mylan may be taken \n\nwith or without food. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Rasagiline Mylan than you should \n\nIf you think that you may have taken too many Rasagiline Mylan tablets, contact your doctor or \n\npharmacist immediately. Take the Rasagiline Mylan carton with you to show the doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Rasagiline Mylan \n\n\n\n23 \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take the next dose normally, when it is \n\ntime to take it. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Rasagiline Mylan \n\nDo not stop taking Rasagiline Mylan without first talking to your doctor. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nThe following side effects have been reported in placebo controlled clinical trials: \n\n \n\nThe frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention: \n\u2022 Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\u2022 Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) \n\u2022 Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n \nVery common  \n\n\u2022 abnormal movements (dyskinesia) \n\u2022 headache \n \n\nCommon  \n\n\u2022 abdominal pain \n\u2022 fall \n\u2022 allergy \n\u2022 fever \n\u2022 flu (influenza) \n\u2022 general feeling of being unwell (malaise) \n\u2022 neck pain \n\u2022 chest pain (angina pectoris) \n\u2022 low blood pressure when rising to a standing position with symptoms like dizziness/light \n\u2022 headedness (orthostatic hypotension)  \n\u2022 decreased appetite  \n\u2022 constipation  \n\u2022 dry mouth  \n\u2022 nausea and vomiting  \n\u2022 flatulence  \n\u2022 abnormal results of blood tests (leucopenia) \n\u2022 joint pain (arthralgia) \n\u2022 musculoskeletal pain \n\u2022 joint inflammation (arthritis) \n\u2022 numbness and muscle weakness of the hand (carpal tunnel syndrome) \n\u2022 decreased weight  \n\u2022 abnormal dreams \n\u2022 difficulty in muscular coordination (balance disorder)  \n\u2022 depression  \n\u2022 dizziness (vertigo)  \n\u2022 prolonged muscle contractions (dystonia)  \n\u2022 runny nose (rhinitis)  \n\u2022 irritation of the skin (dermatitis)  \n\u2022 rash  \n\u2022 bloodshot eyes (conjunctivitis)  \n\n\n\n24 \n\n\u2022 urinary urgency \n \n\nUncommon  \n\n\u2022 stroke (cerebrovascular accident)  \n\u2022 heart attack (myocardial infarction)  \n\u2022 blistering rash (vesiculobullous rash) \n \n\nIn addition, skin cancer was reported in around 1% of patients in the placebo controlled clinical trials. \n\nNevertheless, scientific evidence suggests that Parkinson\u2019s disease, and not any medicine in particular, \n\nis associated with a higher risk of skin cancer (not exclusively melanoma). You should speak with \n\nyour doctor about any suspicious skin changes. \n\n \n\nParkinson's disease is associated with symptoms of hallucinations and confusion. \n\nIn post-marketing experience these symptoms have also been observed in Parkinson's disease patients \n\ntreated with rasagiline. \n\n \n\nThere have been cases of patients who, while taking one or more medications for the treatment of \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease, were unable to resist the impulse, drive or temptation to perform an action that \n\ncould be harmful to themselves or others. These are called impulse control disorders. In patients taking \n\nrasagiline and/or other medications used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, the following have been \n\nobserved: \n\n- Obsessive thoughts or impulsive behaviour. \n- Strong impulse to gamble excessively despite serious personal or family consequences. \n- Altered or increased sexual interest and behaviour of significant concern to you or to others, \n\nfor example, an increased sexual drive. \n\n- Uncontrollable excessive shopping or spending. \n  \n\nTell your doctor if you experience any of these behaviours; they will discuss ways of managing or \n\nreducing the symptoms. \n\n \nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \n\nthis medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. How to store Rasagiline Mylan \n\n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton or blister after EXP.

rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) very common abnormal movements (dyskinesia)

urgency uncommon stroke (cerebrovascular accident) heart attack (myocardial infarction) blistering rash (vesiculobullous rash) in addition, skin cancer was reported in around 1% of patients in the placebo controlled clinical trials. nevertheless, scientific evidence suggests that parkinson's disease, and not any medicine in particular, is associated with a higher risk of skin cancer (not exclusively melanoma). you should speak with your doctor about any suspicious skin changes. parkinson's disease is associated with symptoms of hallucinations and confusion. in post-marketing experience these symptoms have also been observed in parkinson's disease patients treated with rasagiline. there have been cases of patients who, while taking one or more medications for the treatment of parkinson's disease, were unable to resist the impulse, drive or temptation to perform an action that could be harmful to themselves or others. these are called impulse control disorders. in patients taking rasagiline and/or other medications used to treat parkinson's disease, the following have been observed: - obsessive thoughts or impulsive behaviour. - strong impulse to gamble excessively despite serious personal or family consequences. - altered or increased sexual interest and behaviour of significant concern to you or to others, for example, an increased sexual drive. - uncontrollable excessive shopping or spending. tell your doctor if you experience any of these behaviours; they will discuss ways of managing or reducing the symptoms. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system
