This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVimizim 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of solution contains 1 mg elosulfase alfa*. Each vial of 5 ml contains 5 mg elosulfase alfa. \n \n*Elosulfase alfa is a recombinant form of human N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (rhGALNS) and \nis produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cell culture by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n \nEach 5 ml vial contains 8 mg sodium and 100 mg sorbitol (E420). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (Sterile concentrate). \nA clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to pale yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVimizim is indicated for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis, type IVA (Morquio A Syndrome, \nMPS IVA) in patients of all ages.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the management of patients with \nMPS IVA or other inherited metabolic diseases. Administration of Vimizim should be carried out by \nan appropriately trained healthcare professional with the ability to manage medical emergencies. \nHome administration under the supervision of an appropriately trained healthcare professional may be \nconsidered for patients who are tolerating their infusions well. \n \nPosology  \n \nThe recommended dose of elosulfase alfa is 2 mg/kg of body weight administered once a week. The \ntotal volume of the infusion should be delivered over approximately 4 hours (see Table 1).  \n \nBecause of the potential for hypersensitivity reactions with elosulfase alfa, patients should receive \nantihistamines with or without antipyretics 30 to 60 minutes prior to start of infusion (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years old) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Vimizim in patients older than 65 years has not been established, and no \nalternative treatment regimen can be recommended in these patients. It is not known whether elderly \npatients respond differently from younger patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe posology in the paediatric population is the same as in adults. Currently available data are \ndescribed in section 4.8 and section 5.1. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor intravenous infusion only. \n \nPatients weighing less than 25 kg should receive a total volume of 100 ml. When diluted in 100 ml, the \ninitial infusion rate should be 3 ml/hr. The infusion rate may be increased as tolerated, every \n15 minutes as follows: first increase the rate to 6 ml/hr, then increase the rate every 15 minutes by \n6 ml/hr increments until a maximum rate of 36 ml/hr is reached.  \n \nPatients weighing 25 kg or more should receive a total volume of 250 ml. When diluted in 250 ml, the \ninitial infusion rate should be 6 ml/hr. The infusion rate may be increased as tolerated, every \n15 minutes as follows: first increase the rate to 12 ml/hr, then increase the rate every 15 minutes by \n12 ml/hr increments until a maximum rate of 72 ml/hr is reached. \n \n\nTable 1: Recommended infusion volumes and rates*  \nPatient \nweight \n\n(kg) \n\nTotal \ninfusion \nvolume \n\n(ml) \n\nStep 1 \nInitial \n\ninfusion \nrate 0-15 \nminutes \n(ml/hr) \n\nStep 2 \n15-30 \n\nminutes \n(ml/hr) \n\nStep 3 \n30-45 \n\nminutes \n(ml/hr) \n\nStep 4 \n45-60 \n\nminutes \n(ml/hr) \n\nStep 5 \n60-75 \n\nminutes \n(ml/hr) \n\nStep 6 \n75-90 \n\nminutes \n(ml/hr) \n\nStep 7 \n90+ \n\nminutes\n(ml/hr) \n\n< 25 100 3 6 12 18 24 30 36\n≥ 25 250 6 12 24 36 48 60 72\n\n* Infusion rate may be increased as tolerated by patient.  \n \nFor instructions for dilution of the medicinal product prior to administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nLife-threatening hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance or to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1 (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAnaphylaxis and severe allergic reactions \n \nAnaphylaxis and severe allergic reactions have been reported in clinical studies. Therefore, appropriate \nmedical support must be readily available when elosulfase alfa is administered. If these reactions \noccur, immediately stop the infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment.  The current medical \nstandards for emergency treatment are to be followed. For patients who have experienced allergic \nreactions during infusion, caution should be exercised upon re-administration. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nInfusion reactions \n \nInfusion reactions (IRs) were the most commonly observed adverse reactions in clinical studies. IRs \nmay include allergic reactions. Patients should receive antihistamines with or without antipyretics \nprior to infusion (see section 4.2). Management of IRs should be based on the severity of the reaction \nand include slowing or temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of additional \nantihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids. If severe IRs occur, immediately stop the infusion \nand initiate appropriate treatment. Re-administration after a severe reaction should be carried out with \ncaution and close monitoring by the treating physician. \n \nSpinal/Cervical cord compression \n \nIn clinical studies, spinal/cervical cord compression (SCC) was observed both in patients receiving \nVimizim and patients receiving placebo. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of SCC \n(including back pain, paralysis of limbs below the level of compression, urinary and faecal \nincontinence) and given appropriate clinical care. \n \nSodium restricted diet \n \nThis medicinal product contains 8 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.4% of the WHO recommended \nmaximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult, and is administered in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for infusion (see section 6.6). \n \nSorbitol (E 420) \n \nThis medicinal product contains 100 mg sorbitol in each vial which is equivalent to 40 mg/kg.  \nPatients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) must not be given this medicinal product unless \nstrictly necessary. \n \nBabies and young children (below 2 years of age) may not yet be diagnosed with hereditary fructose \nintolerance (HFI).  Medicinal products containing sorbitol/fructose given intravenously may be life-\nthreatening. The treatment benefit to the child compared to the associated risks must be fully evaluated \nprior to treatment.   \n \nA detailed history with regard to HFI symptoms has to be taken for each patient prior to being given \nthis medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data on the use of Vimizim in pregnant women.  \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy or embryo-\nfoetal development (see section 5.3). These studies however, are of limited relevance. As a \nprecautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Vimizim during pregnancy, unless clearly \nnecessary.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAvailable reproductive data in animals have shown excretion of elosulfase alfa in milk. It is not known \nwhether elosulfase alfa is excreted in human breast milk, but systemic exposure via breast milk is not \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nexpected. Due to lack of human data, Vimizim should only be administered to breast-feeding woman \nif the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the potential risk to the infant. \n \nFertility \n \nNo impairment of fertility has been observed in nonclinical studies (see section 5.3) with elosulfase \nalfa. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVimizim has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness was reported during \nVimizim infusions; if dizziness occurs after the infusion, the ability to drive and use machines may be \naffected.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe assessment of adverse reactions is based on the exposure of 176 patients with MPS IVA, ages 5 to \n57 years old to 2 mg/kg elosulfase alfa once a week (n=58), 2 mg/kg elosulfase alfa once every other \nweek (n=59), or placebo (n=59) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. \n \nThe majority of adverse reactions in clinical studies were IRs, which are defined as reactions occurring \nafter initiation of infusion until the end of the day following the infusion. Serious IRs were observed in \nclinical studies and included anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity and vomiting. The most common symptoms \nof IRs (occurring in ≥ 10% of patients treated with Vimizim and ≥ 5% more when compared to \nplacebo) were headache, nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, chills and abdominal pain. IRs were generally \nmild or moderate, and the frequency was higher during the first 12 weeks of treatment and tended to \noccur less frequently with time. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe data in Table 2 below describes adverse reactions from clinical studies in patients treated with \nVimizim.  \n \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be \nestimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness.  \n \n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions in patients treated with Vimizim \n \n\nMedDRA \nSystem organ class \n\nMedDRA \nPreferred term \n\nFrequency \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylaxis Uncommon \nHypersensitivity Common \n\nNervous system disorders \n \n\nHeadache Very common \nDizziness Very common \n\nRespiratory, thoracic, and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nDyspnoea Very common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea, vomiting, \noropharyngeal pain, upper \nabdominal pain, abdominal pain, \nnausea\n\nVery common \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective Myalgia Common \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\ntissue disorders Chills Very common \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nPyrexia Very common \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAll patients developed antibodies to elosulfase alfa in clinical studies. Approximately 80% of patients \ndeveloped neutralizing antibodies capable of inhibiting the elosulfase alfa from binding to the cation-\nindependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor. Sustained improvements in efficacy measures and \nreductions in urine keratan sulphate (KS) over time were observed across studies, despite the presence \nof anti elosulfase alfa antibodies. No correlations were found between higher antibody titres or \nneutralizing antibody positivity and reductions in efficacy measurements or occurrence of anaphylaxis \nor other hypersensitivity reactions. IgE antibodies against elosulfase alfa were detected in ≤ 10% of \ntreated patients and have not consistently been related to anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity \nreactions and/or treatment withdrawal.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn patients < 5 years of age, the overall safety profile of Vimizim at 2 mg/kg/week was consistent with \nthe safety profile of Vimizim observed in older children. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical studies, doses of elosulfase alfa were explored up to 4 mg/kg per week and no specific signs \nor symptoms were identified following the higher doses. No differences in the safety profile were \nobserved. For management of adverse reactions, see sections 4.4 and 4.8.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, enzymes.  ATC code: \nA16AB12.  \n \nMechanism of action  \n \nMucopolysaccharidoses comprises a group of lysosomal storage disorders caused by the deficiency of \nspecific lysosomal enzymes required for the catabolism of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). MPS IVA is \ncharacterised by the absence or marked reduction in N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase activity. The \nsulfatase activity deficiency results in the accumulation of the GAG substrates, KS and chondroitin 6 \nsulphate (C6S), in the lysosomal compartment of cells throughout the body. The accumulation leads to \nwidespread cellular, tissue, and organ dysfunction. Elosulfase alfa is intended to provide the \nexogenous enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase that will be taken up into the lysosomes and \nincrease the catabolism of the GAGs KS and C6S. Enzyme uptake by cells into lysosomes is mediated \nby cation independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors leading to restored GALNS activity and \nclearance of KS and C6S. \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nClinical studies performed with Vimizim assessed the impact of treatment on the systemic \nmanifestations of MPS IVA in various domains including endurance, respiratory function, growth \nvelocity, and mobility, as well as urine KS. \n \nA total of 235 patients with MPS IVA were enrolled and exposed to Vimizim in six clinical studies.  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Vimizim was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, \nPhase 3 clinical study of 176 patients with MPS IVA, ranging in age from 5 to 57 years. The majority \nof the patients presented with short stature, impaired endurance, and musculoskeletal symptoms. \nPatients who could walk more than 30 meters (m) but less than 325 m in a 6 Minute Walk Test \n(MWT) at baseline were enrolled in the study. \n \nPatients received elosulfase alfa 2 mg/kg every week (n=58) or 2 mg/kg every other week (n=59), or \nplacebo (n=59) for a total of 24 weeks. All patients were treated with antihistamines prior to each \ninfusion. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the 6 MWT distance compared to \nplacebo at Week 24. The secondary endpoints were the change from baseline in the 3 Minute Stair \nClimb Test (MSCT) and urine KS levels at Week 24. A total of 173 patients subsequently enrolled in \nan extension study in which patients received 2 mg/kg of elosulfase alfa every week or 2 mg/kg every \nother week, and then all were switched to 2 mg/kg every week upon availability of the Week 24 \nresults. \n \nThe primary and secondary endpoints were evaluated at Week 24 (see Table 3). The modelled \ntreatment effect in the distance walked in 6 minutes, compared to placebo, was 22.5 m (CI95, 4.0, 40.9; \np=0.0174) for the 2 mg/kg per week regimen. The modelled treatment effect in stairs climbed per \nminute, compared to placebo, was 1.1 stairs/minute (CI95, -2.1, 4.4; p=0.4935) for the 2 mg/kg per \nweek regimen. The modelled treatment effect for the percent change in urine KS, compared to \nplacebo, was -40.7 % (CI95, -49.0, -32.4; p<0.0001) for the 2 mg/kg per week regimen. The difference \nwas greatest between the placebo group and the weekly treatment group for all endpoints. The results \nfrom the every other week regimen in the distance walked in 6 minutes or in stairs climbed per minute \nwere comparable to placebo.  \n \n\nTable 3: Results from placebo-controlled clinical study at 2 mg per kg per week \n \n\n \n \n\nVimizim Placebo Vimizim vs. \nplacebo \n\nBaselin\ne \n\nWeek \n24 \n\nChang\ne \n\nBaselin\ne \n\nWeek 24 Change\nDifference in \n\nchanges N 58 57* 57 59 59 59\n6-Minute walk test (meters) \nMean\n\n  \n SD \n\n203.9  \n±76.32 \n\n \n \n\n243.3 \n±83.53 \n\n \n \n\n36.5  \n±58.49 \n\n \n \n\n211.9  \n±69.88 \n\n \n \n\n225.4  \n±83.22 \n\n \n \n\n13.5  \n±50.63 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  Model-based mean‡\n(95%CI) \np-value \n\n22.5  \n(CI95, 4.0, 40.9) \n\n(p = 0.0174) \n3-Minute stair climb test (stairs/minute) \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nMean\n  \n SD \n\n29.6 \n ±16.44 \n \n\n34.9  \n± 18.39 \n\n \n \n\n4.8  \n± 8.06 \n\n \n \n\n30.0  \n± 14.05 \n \n\n \n\n33.6 \n ± 18.36 \n\n \n \n\n3.6  \n± 8.51 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  Model-based mean‡\n(95%CI) \np-value \n\n1.1  \n(CI95, -2.1, 4.4) \n\n(p = 0.4935)  \n* One patient in the Vimizim group dropped out after 1 infusion  \n‡ Model-based mean of Vimizim versus placebo, adjusted for baseline \n\n \nIn additional extension studies, patients receiving elosulfase alfa 2 mg/kg every week, showed \nmaintenance of initial improvement in endurance and sustained reduction of urinary KS up to \n156 weeks.  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nIt is important to initiate treatment as early as possible.   \n \nThe majority of patients who received Vimizim during clinical studies were in the paediatric and \nadolescent age range (5 to 17 years).  In an open-label study, 15 paediatric patients with MPS IVA \nunder the age of 5 years (9 months to <5 years) received 2 mg/kg of Vimizim once a week for \n52 weeks. Patients continued a long-term follow-up observational study for at least another 52 weeks, \nfor a total of 104 weeks. Safety and pharmacodynamic results in these patients are consistent with \nresults observed in the first 52 weeks (see section 4.8). The baseline mean (±SD) normalised standing \nheight z-score was - 1.6 (±1.61). After the first 52 weeks of treatment the normalised standing height \nz-score was -1.9 (±1.62). At Week 104 mean (±SD) normalised standing height z-score was -3.1 (± \n1.13). \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with  \nVimizim in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in MPS IVA. See section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use.  \n \n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of elosulfase alfa were evaluated in 23 patients with MPS IVA who \nreceived weekly intravenous infusions of 2 mg/kg of elosulfase alfa over approximately 4 hours for \n22 weeks and the parameters at Week 0 and Week 22 were compared. At Week 22, the mean AUC0-t \nand Cmax increased by 181% and 192%, respectively, when compared to Week 0 \n \n\nTable 4: Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nPharmacokinetic parameter \nWeek 0 \n\nMean (SD) \nWeek 22  \n\nMean (SD) \nAUC0-t, minute • µg/ml* 238 (100) 577 (416) \nCmax, µg/ml† 1.49 (0.534) 4.04 (3.24) \nCL, ml/minute/kg‡ 10.0 (3.73) 7.08 (13.0) \nt1/2, minute§ 7.52 (5.48) 35.9 (21.5) \nTmax, minute¶ 172 (75.3) 202 ( 90.8) \n\n* AUC0-t, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of last measurable \nconcentration;  \n\n† Cmax, observed maximum plasma concentration; \n‡ CL, total clearance of elosulfase alfa after intravenous administration;  \n§ t1/2, elimination half-life; \n¶ Tmax, time from zero to maximum plasma concentration \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nBiotransformation \n \nElosulfase alfa is a protein and is expected to be metabolically degraded through peptide hydrolysis. \nConsequently, impaired liver function is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of elosulfase alfa.  \n \nElimination \n \nRenal elimination of elosulfase alfa is considered a minor pathway for clearance. Mean half-life (t1/2) \nincreased from 7.52 minutes at Week 0 to 35.9 minutes at Week 22. Male and female patients had \ncomparable elosulfase alfa clearance, and clearance did not trend with age or weight at week 22. \nImpact of antibodies on elosulfase alfa pharmacokinetics was assessed. No association was apparent \nbetween the total antibody titre and elosulfase clearance. However, patients with positive neutralizing \nantibodies responses had decreased total clearance (CL) values and prolonged t1/2. Despite the \nalteration of the pharmacokinetics profile, presence of neutralizing antibodies did not affect \npharmacodynamics, efficacy, or safety of the patients who were treated with elosulfase alfa. No \naccumulation of elosulfase alfa in plasma was evident following weekly dosing \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology evaluating central nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular systems, single-dose and \nrepeated-dose toxicity in rats and monkeys or fertility and embryo-foetal development in rats or \nrabbits. The evaluation of the peri- and postnatal development study in rats is hampered due to \nsubsequent administration of DPH, and therefore of limited relevance. \n \nLong-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential or studies to evaluate mutagenic \npotential have not been performed with elosulfase alfa. Reproduction studies have been performed in \nrats at doses up to 10 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or \nreproductive performance. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nSodium acetate trihydrate \nSodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate \nArginine hydrochloride \nSorbitol (E 420) \nPolysorbate 20 \nWater for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n3 years \n \nAfter dilution \nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for up to 24 hours at 2C – 8C followed \nby up to 24 hours at 23C – 27C. \n \nFrom a microbiological safety point of view, the diluted solution should be used immediately. If not \nused immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user and should \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nnormally not be longer than 24 hours at 2C – 8C followed by up to 24 hours at 23C – 27C during \nadministration. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. \n \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nClear glass vial (Type I) with a butyl rubber stopper and a flip-off crimp seal (aluminium) with a \nplastic cap. \n \nPack sizes: 1 vial  \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nEach vial of Vimizim is intended for single use only. Vimizim has to be diluted with sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for infusion using aseptic technique. The diluted solution is administered to \npatients using an infusion set. An infusion set equipped with an in-line 0.2 μm filter can be used. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \nPreparation of the Vimizim infusion  \n \nAseptic technique is to be used.  \n \nVimizim must be diluted prior to administration.  \n \nThe number of vials to be diluted is based on the individual patient's weight. The recommended dose is \n2 mg per kg. \n \n\n1. The number of vials to be diluted based on the individual patient’s weight and the \nrecommended dose of 2 mg/kg is determined, using the following calculation: \n Patient weight (kg) multiplied by 2 (mg/kg) = Patient dose (mg) \n Patient dose (mg) divided by 1 (mg/ml concentrate of Vimizim) = Total number of ml of \n\nVimizim \n Total amount (ml) Vimizim divided by 5 ml per vial = Total number of vials \n\n2. The calculated total number of vials is rounded up to the next whole vial. The appropriate \nnumber of vials is removed from the refrigerator. Do not heat or microwave vials.  Do not \nshake vials. \n\n3. An infusion bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for infusion is obtained \nsuitable for intravenous administration. The total volume of the infusion is determined by the \npatient’s body weight.  \n Patients weighing less than 25 kg should receive a total volume of 100 ml.  \n Patients weighing 25 kg or more should receive a total volume of 250 ml.  \n\n4. Before withdrawing Vimizim from the vial, each vial is visually inspected for particulate \nmatter and discoloration. Because this is a protein solution, slight flocculation (thin translucent \nfibres) may occur. The Vimizim solution should be clear to slightly opalescent and colourless \nto pale yellow. Do not use if the solution is discoloured or if there is particulate matter in the \nsolution. \n\n5. A volume of the sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for infusion is to be withdrawn and \ndiscarded from the infusion bag, equal to the volume of Vimizim concentrate to be added. \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n6. The calculated volume of Vimizim from the appropriate number of vials is slowly withdrawn \nusing caution to avoid excessive agitation.  \n\n7. Vimizim is slowly added to the infusion bag using care to avoid agitation.  \n8. The infusion bag is gently rotated to ensure proper distribution of Vimizim. Do not shake the \n\nsolution. \n9. The diluted solution is administered to patients using an infusion set. An infusion set equipped \n\nwith an in-line 0.2µm filter can be used. \n \n \n\n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nVimizim 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \nelosulfase alfa \n\n \n▼This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how \nto report side effects.  \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Vimizim is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Vimizim \n3. How Vimizim is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Vimizim \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Vimizim is and what it is used for \n \nVimizim contains an enzyme called elosulfase alfa, which belongs to a group of medicines known as \nenzyme replacement therapies. It is used to treat adults and children with mucopolysaccharidosis \ntype IVA (MPS IVA disease, also known as Morquio A Syndrome).  \n \nPeople with MPS IVA disease either lack completely or do not have enough N-acetylgalactosamine-6-\nsulfatase, an enzyme which breaks down specific substances in the body such as keratan sulphate, \nwhich are found in many tissues of the body, including cartilage and bone. As a result, these \nsubstances do not get broken down and processed by the body as they should. They accumulate in the \ntissues interfering with their normal function and causing the symptoms of MPS IVA, such as \ndifficulty walking, trouble breathing, short height, and hearing loss. \n \nHow Vimizim works \nThis medicine replaces the natural enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase which is lacking in \nMPS IVA patients. Treatment has been shown to improve walking and to reduce the levels of keratan \nsulphate in the body. This medicine may improve the symptoms of MPS IVA. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Vimizim \n \nYou must not receive Vimizim \n- if you have experienced life-threatening allergic reactions to elosulfase alfa or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n- If you are treated with Vimizim, you may develop infusion reactions. An infusion reaction is any \n\nside effect, including an allergic reaction, occurring during the infusion or within a day following \ninfusion (see section 4). If you experience such a reaction, you should immediately contact your \ndoctor.  \n\n- If you have an allergic reaction during your infusion your doctor may slow down, or stop your \ninfusion. Your doctor may also give you additional medicines to manage any allergic reactions \n(e.g. antihistamines and/or corticosteroids). \n\n- If you experience back pain, numbness in your arms or legs, or lack of control over passing urine \nor stools, you should immediately contact your doctor. These problems can be a part of the \ndisease and may be caused by pressure on your spinal cord. \n\n \nOther medicines and Vimizim \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nYou should not receive Vimizim during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. It is not known whether \nVimizim is excreted in breast milk. Discuss with your doctor if the benefits of taking Vimizim are \ngreater than the potential risk to your newborn while breast-feeding. It is not known if Vimizim \nimpacts human fertility. No effect on fertility was observed in animals.   \n \nDriving and using machines \nDizziness was reported in some patients during the Vimizim infusion. Tell your doctor if you feel \ndizzy after your infusion, especially before driving or using any machine where dizziness might be \ndangerous. \n \nVimizim contains sodium and sorbitol (E 420) \nThis medicine contains 8 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 5 ml vial. This is \nequivalent to 0.4 % of the recommended daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \nThis medicine contains 100 mg sorbitol in each 5 ml vial which is equivalent to 40 mg/kg.  \nSorbitol is a source of fructose. If you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare \ngenetic disorder, you (or your child) must not receive this medicine unless discussed with your doctor. \nPatients with HFI cannot break down fructose, which may cause serious side effects.  \nYou must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have HFI or if your \nchild can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects \nsuch as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea. \n \n3. How Vimizim is given \n \nYour doctor or nurse will give Vimizim to you by an infusion into a vein. \n \nThe medicine has to be diluted before being given. Your doctor or nurse will give you some medicines \nbefore your treatment to reduce allergic reactions and you may also be given medicines to help control \nany fever. \n \nDose  \nThe dose you receive is based on your body weight.  The recommended dose regimen for adults and \nchildren is 2 mg/kg body weight given once every week through a drip into a vein (intravenous \ninfusion). Each infusion will be given over approximately 4 hours. Treatment with Vimizim may be \nstarted at as young as an age possible and is intended for long term use. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects were mainly seen while patients were being given the medicine or shortly after (“infusion \nreactions”). The most serious side effects were severe allergic reactions (seen uncommonly – may \naffect up to 1 in 100 people) and mild to moderate vomiting (seen very commonly – may affect more \nthan 1 in 10 people).  Symptoms of allergic reaction include rash, itching or hives on the skin (seen \ncommonly – may affect up to 1 in 10 people).  If you experience any difficulty swallowing, talking, \nsevere shortness of breath or wheezing, swelling of the face or lips, dizziness or weak pulse; these \nmay represent symptoms of a severe allergic reaction and you should tell your doctor \nimmediately. Based on the severity of the side effect, your doctor may slow or temporarily interrupt \nthe infusion and/ or give you additional medicines to reduce the effects of a severe allergic reaction \n(e.g. antihistamines and/or corticosteroids) or to reduce fever (antipyretics). \n \nVery common side effects include symptoms of infusion reactions such as headache, nausea, fever, \nchills and stomach ache.  Other very common adverse reactions were diarrhoea, mouth and throat pain, \ndizziness and trouble breathing.  \n \nCommon side effects observed was muscle pain. \n \nReporting of side effects  \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Vimizim \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and vial after EXP. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nUnopened vials:  \nStore in a refrigerator (2C – 8C).  \nDo not freeze. \n \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nDo not use Vimizim if the solution is discoloured or it contains visible particles.  \n \nAfter dilution: \nOnce the product has been diluted it should be used immediately.  If not used immediately, in-use \nstorage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user and should normally not be longer than \n24 hours at 2oC – 8oC followed by up to 24 hours at 23oC – 27oC during administration. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

Vimizim has to be diluted with sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Diluted Vimizim solution is to be \nadministered to patients using an infusion set. An infusion set equipped with an in-line 0.2 µm filter \ncan be used.  \n \nAny unused product or waste material is to be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nPreparation of the Vimizim infusion (Use aseptic technique) \n \n1. The number of vials to be diluted based on the individual patient's weight must be determined and \n\nremoved from the refrigerator in advance in order to allow them to reach 23C – 27C. Do not heat \nor microwave vials.  The recommended dose regimen is 2 mg/kg body weight administered once \nevery week through a drip into a vein (by intravenous infusion). Each infusion will take \napproximately 4 hours. \n Patient weight (kg) multiplied by 2 (mg/kg) = Patient dose (mg) \n Patient dose (mg) divided by 1 (mg/ml concentrate of Vimizim) = Total number of ml of \n\nVimizim \n Total amount (ml) Vimizim divided by 5 ml per vial = Total number of vials \n\n \n2. The calculated total number of vials is rounded up to next whole vial. \n3. An infusion bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for infusion is obtained \n\nsuitable for intravenous administration. The total volume of the infusion is determined by the \npatient’s body weight.  \n Patients weighing less than 25 kg should receive a total volume of 100 ml.  \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n Patients weighing 25 kg or more should receive a total volume of 250 ml.  \n \n4. Before dilution, each vial is to be inspected for particulate matter and discolouration. The clear to \n\nslightly opalescent and colourless to pale yellow solution must be free of visible particles. Do not \nshake vials. \n\n \n5. A volume of the sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for infusion is to be withdrawn and \n\ndiscarded from a 100 ml or 250 ml infusion bag equal to the total volume of Vimizim to be added. \n \n6. The calculated volume of Vimizim from the appropriate number of vials is slowly withdrawn using \n\ncaution to avoid excessive agitation. \n \n7. The volume of Vimizim is to be slowly added to the sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for \n\ninfusion. \n \n\nWhen diluted with 100 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for infusion; the initial \nrate will be 3 ml/hr. The infusion rate will be increased every 15 minutes as follows: first increase \nthe rate to 6 ml/hr, then increase the rate every 15 minutes by 6 ml/hr increments until a maximum \nrate of 36 ml/hr is reached.  \n \nWhen diluted with 250 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for infusion; the initial \nrate will be 6 ml/hr. The infusion rate will be increased every 15 minutes as follows: first increase \nthe rate to 12 ml/hr, then increase the rate every 15 minutes by 12 ml/hr increments until a \nmaximum rate of 72 ml/hr is reached. \n\n \nPatient \nweight \n\n(kg) \n\nTotal \ninfusion \nvolume \n\n(ml) \n\nStep 1 \nInitial \n\ninfusion \nrate 0-15 \nminutes \n(ml/hr) \n\nStep 2 \n15-30 \n\nminutes \n(ml/hr) \n\nStep 3 \n30-45 \n\nminutes \n(ml/hr) \n\nStep 4 \n45-60 \n\nminutes \n(ml/hr) \n\nStep 5 \n60-75 \n\nminutes \n(ml/hr) \n\nStep 6 \n75-90 \n\nminutes \n(ml/hr) \n\nStep 7 \n90+ \n\nminutes\n(ml/hr) \n\n< 25 100 3 6 12 18 24 30 36\n≥ 25 250 6 12 24 36 48 60 72\n\nInfusion rate may be increased as tolerated by patient.  \n \n8. The diluted solution is to be mixed gently prior to infusion.  \n \n9. The diluted solution is to be visually inspected for particulate matter prior to use. Do not use if the \n\nsolution is discoloured or if there is particulate matter in the solution \n \n10. The diluted solution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and \n\nconditions are the responsibility of the user and should normally not be longer than 24 hours \nat 2C – 8C followed by up to 24 hours at 23C – 27C during administration. \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
