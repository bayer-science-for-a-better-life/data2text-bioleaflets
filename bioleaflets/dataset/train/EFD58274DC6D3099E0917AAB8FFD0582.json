NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVIRACEPT 50 mg/g oral powder. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nThe bottle contains 144 g of oral powder. Each gram of oral powder contains nelfinavir mesilate \ncorresponding to 50 mg of nelfinavir. \n \nExcipients: \n- Contains sucrose palmitate: 10.0 mg per gram of oral powder. 10.0 mg of sucrose palmitate, \n\nwhich is an ester, theoretically corresponds to maximally 5.9 mg of sucrose when fully \nhydrolysed. \n\n- Contains aspartame (E951): 20.0 mg of aspartame per gram of oral powder. \n- Contains potassium: 50.0 mg of dibasic potassium phosphate corresponding to 22.5 mg of \n\npotassium per gram of oral powder. \nSee section 4.4 \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral powder. \nWhite to off-white amorphous powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVIRACEPT is indicated in antiretroviral combination treatment of human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV-1) infected adults, adolescents and children of 3 years of age and older. \n \nIn protease inhibitor (PI) experienced patients the choice of nelfinavir should be based on individual \nviral resistance testing and treatment history. \n \nSee section 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy with VIRACEPT should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV \ninfection. \n \nVIRACEPT is administered orally and should always be ingested with food (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients older than 13 years: VIRACEPT 250 mg tablets are recommended for adults and older \nchildren (see Summary of Product Characteristics for VIRACEPT 250 mg tablets). The recommended \ndose of VIRACEPT 50 mg/g oral powder is 1250 mg twice a day (BID) or 750 mg three times a day \n(TID), for patients unable to take tablets. All patients older than 13 years should take either 5 level \nscoops of the blue 5 gram spoon twice daily or 3 level scoops of the blue 5 gram spoon three times \ndaily. The efficacy of the BID (twice daily) regimen has been evaluated versus the TID (three times \ndaily) regimen primarily in patients na\u00efve to PIs (see section 5.1)  \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nPatients aged 3 to 13 years: for children, the recommended starting dose is 50-55 mg/kg BID or if \nusing a TID regimen, 25 \u2013 35 mg/kg body weight per dose. For children able to take tablets, \nVIRACEPT tablets may be administered instead of the oral powder (see Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for VIRACEPT tablets). \n \nThe recommended dose of VIRACEPT oral powder to be administered BID to children aged 3 to 13 \nyears, using a combination of both the white 1 gram and the blue 5 gram scoop is shown in the \nfollowing table.

Once mixed, the entire contents must be consumed in order to obtain \nthe full dose. If the mixture is not consumed immediately, it must be stored under refrigeration, but \nstorage must not exceed 6 hours. Acidic food or juice (e.g., orange juice, apple juice or apple sauce) \nare not recommended to be used in combination with VIRACEPT, because the combination may \nresult in a bitter taste. VIRACEPT oral powder should not be reconstituted with water in its original \ncontainer. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nRenal and hepatic impairment: there are no data specific for HIV positive patients with renal \nimpairment and therefore specific dosage recommendations cannot be made (see section 4.4). \nNelfinavir is principally metabolised and eliminated by the liver. There are not sufficient data from \npatients with liver impairment and therefore specific dose recommendations cannot be made (see \nsection 5.2). Caution should be used when administering VIRACEPT to patients with impaired renal \nor hepatic function. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n \nCo-administration with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic windows and which are substrates \nof CYP3A4 [e.g., terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, amiodarone, quinidine, pimozide, triazolam, \norally administered midazolam (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), \nergot derivatives, lovastatin and simvastatin, alfuzosin, and sildenafil when used for treatment of \npulmonary arterial hypertension,  (for the use of sildenafil and other PDE-5 inhibitors in patients with \nerectile dysfunction, see section 4.5)]. \n \nPotent inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampicin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine) reduce nelfinavir \nplasma concentrations.  \nCo- administration with rifampicin is contra-indicated due to a reduction in exposure to nelfinavir.  \nPhysicians should not use potent inducers of CYP 3A4 in combination with Viracept and should \nconsider using alternatives when a patient is taking VIRACEPT (see section 4.5). \n \nHerbal preparations containing St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) must not be used while taking \nnelfinavir due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of nelfinavir \n(see section 4.5).  \n \nVIRACEPT should not be co-administered with omeprazole due to a reduction in exposure to \nnelfinavir and its active metabolite M8 (Tert-butyl hydroxy nelfinavir). This may lead to a loss of \nvirologic response and possible resistance to VIRACEPT (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients should be instructed that VIRACEPT is not a cure for HIV infection, that they may continue \nto develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease, and that VIRACEPT has not been \nshown to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV disease through sexual contact or blood \ncontamination. \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome: In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of \ninstitution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic \nor residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of \nsymptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of \ninitiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal \nmycobacterium infections, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should \nbe evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. \n \nLiver disease: The safety and efficacy of nelfinavir has not been established in patients with \nsignificant underlying liver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with \ncombination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic \nadverse events. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the \nrelevant product information for these medicinal products. \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. The use of nelfinavir in \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\npatients with moderate hepatic impairment has not been studied. In the absence of such studies, \ncaution should be exercised, as increases in nelfinavir levels and/or increases in liver enzymes may \noccur.  \nPatients with hepatic impairment should not be given colchicine with VIRACEPT. \n \nOsteonecrosis: Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, \nalcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis \nhave been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to \ncombination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they \nexperience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nRenal impairment: Since nelfinavir is highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be \nsignificantly removed by haemodiaylisis or peritoneal dialysis. Therefore, no special precautions or \ndose adjustments are required in these patients.  \nPatients with renal impairment should not be given colchicine with VIRACEPT. \n \nDiabetes mellitus and hyperglycaemia: New onset diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or exacerbation \nof existing diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients receiving PIs. In some of these the \nhyperglycaemia was severe and in some cases also associated with ketoacidosis. Many patients had \nconfounding medical conditions, some of which required therapy with agents that have been \nassociated with the development of diabetes or hyperglycaemia. \n \nPatients with haemophilia: There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin \nhaematomas and haemarthroses, in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with PIs. In some \npatients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with PIs \nwas continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship has been \nevoked, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should \ntherefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n \nLipodystrophy: Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with the redistribution of body \nfat (acquired lipodystrophy) in HIV patients. The long-term consequences of these events are currently \nunknown. Knowledge about the mechanism is incomplete. A connection between visceral lipomatosis \nand PIs and lipoatrophy and nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) has been \nhypothesised. A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older \nage, and with drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated \nmetabolic disturbances. Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat \nredistribution. Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood \nglucose. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate (see section 4.8).  \n \nPDE5 inhibitors: particular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil \nfor the treatment of erectile dysfunction in patients receiving VIRACEPT. Co-administration of \nVIRACEPT with these medicinal products is expected to increase their concentrations and may result \nin associated adverse events such as hypotension, syncope, visual changes and prolonged erection (see \nsection 4.5). Concomitant use of sildenafil prescribed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension with VIRACEPT is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins): HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may interact with \nprotease inhibitors and increase the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use of \nprotease inhibitors with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated. Other HMG-CoA reductase \ninhibitors may also interact with protease inhibitors and should be used with caution.  \n \nExcipients: VIRACEPT oral powder contains aspartame (E951) as a sweetening agent. Aspartame \nprovides a source of phenylalanine and, therefore, may not be suitable for persons with \nphenylketonuria. \nVIRACEPT oral powder contains potassium.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nVIRACEPT oral powder also contains sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltese insufficiency should not take this \nmedicine. \nSee section 2 and 6.1 for further information on excipients. \n \nConcurrent administration of salmeterol with VIRACEPT is not recommended. The combination may \nresult in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT \nprolongation, palpitations and sinus tachycardia. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNelfinavir is primarily metabolised via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 (see \nsection 5.2). Nelfinavir is also an inhibitor of CYP 3A4. Based on in vitro data, nelfinavir is unlikely \nto inhibit other cytochrome P450 isoforms at concentrations in the therapeutic range. \n \nCombination with other medicinal products: Caution is advised whenever VIRACEPT is co-\nadministered with agents that are inducers or inhibitors and/or substrates of CYP3A4; such \ncombinations may require dose adjustment (see also sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nSubstrates for CYP3A4: Co-administration is contraindicated with the following agents that are \nsubstrates for CYP3A4 and that have narrow therapeutic windows:  \nterfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, amiodarone, quinidine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, oral \nmidazolam, triazolam, alfuzosin, and sildenafil when used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension \n(see section 4.3). \n \nCo-administration of a PI with sildenafil is expected to substantially increase sildenafil concentration \nand may result in an increase in sildenafil associated adverse events, including hypotension, visual \nchanges, and priapism. \n \nFor other substrates of CYP3A4 a dose reduction or consideration of an alternative may be required \n(Table 1).  \nCoadministration of nelfinavir with fluticasone proprionate may increase plasma concentrations of \nfluticasone propionate. Consider alternatives that are not metabolised by CYP3A4 such as \nbeclomethasone. \nConcomitant use of trazodone and nelfinavir may increase plasma concentrations of trazodone and a \nlower dose of trazodone should be considered. \n \nCoadministration of nelfinavir with simvastatin or lovastatin may result in significant increases in \nsimvastatin and lovastatin plasma concentrations and is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Consider \nalternatives that are not substrates of CYP3A4 such as pravastatin or fluvastatin.Other HMG-CoA \nreductase inhibitors may also interact with protease inhibitors and should be used with caution.  \nConcurrent administration of salmeterol with VIRACEPT is not recommended. The combination may \nresult in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT \nprolongation, palpitations and sinus tachycardia.  \nCoadministration of warfarin and VIRACEPT may affect concentrations of warfarin. It is \nrecommended that the international normalized ratio (INR) be monitored carefully during treatment \nwith VIRACEPT, especially when commencing therapy. \n \nMetabolic enzyme inducers: Potent inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, pehnobarbital and \ncarbamazepine) may reduce nelfianvir plasma concentrations and their coadministration is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). Caution should be used when co-administering other agents that \ninduce CYP3A4   Plasma concentrations of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when \nmidazolam is given orally and should therefore not be coadministered with nelfinavir.  Parenteral \nmidazolam should be coadministered with nelfinavir in an intensive care unit to ensure close clinical \nmonitoring. Dose adjustment for midazolam should be considered if more than a single dose is \nadministered (Table 1)   \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nMetabolic enzyme inhibitors:Co-administration of nelfinavir with inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., \nfluconazole, fluoxetine, paroxetine, lansoprazole, imipramine, amitriptyline and diazepam) may be \nexpected to reduce the conversion of nelfinavir to its major active metabolite M8 (tert-butyl hydroxy \nnelfinavir) with a concomitant increase in plasma nelfinavir levels (see section 5.2). Limited clinical \ntrial data from patients receiving one or more of these medicinal products with nelfinavir indicated \nthat a clinically significant effect on safety and efficacy is not expected.

As these data come from the spontaneous reporting system, the frequency of \nthe adverse reactions is not confirmed. \n \nImmune system disorders: \nUncommon (\u2265 0.1 % - \u2264 1 %): hypersensitivity including bronchospasm, pyrexia, pruritus, facial \noedema and rash maculo-papular or dermatitis bullous. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nUncommon - rare (\u2265 0.01 % - \u2264 1 %): Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with \nredistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy aquired) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and \nfacial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and \ndorsocervical fat accumulation (lipohypertrophy buffalo hump).  \nRare (\u2265 0.01 % - \u2264 0.1 %): new onset diabetes mellitus, or exacerbation of existing diabetes mellitus. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nUncommon (\u2265 0.1 % - \u2264 1 %): vomiting, pancreatitis/blood amylase increased. \nRare (\u2265 0.01 % - \u2264 0.1 %): abdominal distension,  \n \nHepatobiliary disorders: \nRare (\u2265 0.01 % - \u2264 0.1 %): hepatitis, hepatic enzymes increased and jaundice when nelfinavir is used \nin combination with other antiretroviral agents. \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nRare (\u2265 0.01 % - \u2264 0.1 %): Blood creatine phosphokinase increased, myalgia, myositis and \nrhabdomyolysis have been reported with PIs, particularly in combination with nucleoside analogues.  \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\nVascular disorders: \nRare (\u2265 0.01 % - \u2264 0.1 %): increased spontaneous haemorrhage in patients with haemophilia. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nVery rare (\u2264 0.01 %), including isolated reports: Erythema multiforme. \n \nPaediatric population: \nAdditional adverse reactions have been reported in the post-marketing experience and are listed below. \nAs these data come from the spontaneous reporting system, the frequency of the adverse reactions is \nunknown: hypertriglyceridemia, anaemia, blood lactic acid increased, and pneumonia. \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nCombination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such asblood \ntriglycerides increased, blood cholesterol increased, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia and \nhyperlactaemia. The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nHuman experience of acute overdose with VIRACEPT is limited. There is no specific antidote for \noverdose with nelfinavir. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed nelfinavir should be achieved by \nemesis or gastric lavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid removal of \nunabsorbed nelfinavir. Since nelfinavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to significantly \nremove it from blood. \n \nOverdoses of nelfinavir could theoretically be associated with prolongation of the QT-interval of the \nECG (see also section 5.3). Monitoring of overdosed patients is warranted.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group:direct acting antivirals, ATC code: J05AE04.  \n \nMechanism of action: HIV protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral \npolyprotein precursors to the individual proteins found in infectious HIV. The cleavage of these viral \npolyproteins is essential for the maturation of infectious virus. Nelfinavir reversibly binds to the active \nsite of HIV protease and prevents cleavage of the polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature \nnon-infectious viral particles.  \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro: the antiviral activity of nelfinavir in vitro has been demonstrated in both \nHIV acute and chronic infections in lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood lymphocytes and \nmonocytes/macrophages. Nelfinavir was found to be active against a broad range of laboratory strains \nand clinical isolates of HIV-1 and the HIV-2 strain ROD. The EC95 (95 % effective concentration) of \nnelfinavir ranged from 7 to 111 nM (mean of 58 nM). Nelfinavir demonstrated additive to synergistic \neffects against HIV in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine (ZDV), \nlamivudine (3TC), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC) and stavudine (d4T) without enhanced \ncytotoxicity. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n\nResistance: Viral escape from nelfinavir can occure via viral protease mutations at amino acid \npositions 30, 88 and 90. \n \nIn vitro: HIV isolates with reduced susceptibility to nelfinavir have been selected in vitro. HIV isolates \nfrom selected patients treated with nelfinavir alone or in combination with reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors were monitored for phenotypic (n=19) and genotypic (n=195, 157 of which were assessable) \nchanges in clinical trials over a period of 2 to 82 weeks. One or more viral protease mutations at amino \nacid positions 30, 35, 36, 46, 71, 77 and 88 were detected in > 10 % of patients with assessable \nisolates. Of 19 patients for whom both phenotypic and genotypic analyses were performed on clinical \nisolates, 9 patients isolates showed reduced susceptibility (5- to 93-fold) to nelfinavir in vitro. Isolates \nfrom all 9 patients possessed one or more mutations in the viral protease gene. Amino acid position 30 \nappeared to be the most frequent mutation site. \n \nCross resistance in vitro: HIV isolates obtained from 5 patients during nelfinavir therapy showed a \n5- to 93-fold decrease in nelfinavir susceptibility in vitro when compared to matched baseline isolates \nbut did not demonstrate a concordant decrease in susceptibility to indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir or \namprenavir in vitro. Conversely, following ritonavir therapy, 6 of 7 clinical isolates with decreased \nritonavir susceptibility (8- to 113-fold) in vitro compared to baseline also exhibited decreased \nsusceptibility to nelfinavir in vitro (5- to 40 fold). An HIV isolate obtained from a patient receiving \nsaquinavir therapy showed decreased susceptibility to saquinavir (7- fold) but did not demonstrate a \nconcordant decrease in susceptibility to nelfinavir. Cross-resistance between nelfinavir and reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors is unlikely because different enzyme targets are involved. Clinical isolates \n(n=5) with decreased susceptibility to zidovudine, lamivudine, or nevirapine remain fully susceptible \nto nelfinavir in vitro. \n \nIn vivo: The overall incidence of the D30N mutation in the viral protease of assessable isolates \n(n=157) from patients receiving nelfinavir monotherapy or nelfinavir in combination with zidovudine \nand lamivudine or stavudine was 54.8 %. The overall incidence of other mutations associated with \nprimary PI resistance was 9.6 % for the L90M substitution where as substitutions at 48, 82 and 84 \nwere not observed. \n \nClinical pharmacodynamic data: treatment with nelfinavir alone or in combination with other \nantiretroviral agents has been documented to reduce viral load and increase CD4 cell counts in HIV-1 \nseropositive patients. Decreases in HIV RNA observed with nelfinavir monotherapy were less \npronounced and of shorter duration. The effects of nelfinavir (alone or combined with other \nantiretroviral agents) on biological markers of disease activity, CD4 cell count and viral RNA, were \nevaluated in several studies involving HIV-1 infected patients. \n \nThe efficacy of the BID regimen has been evaluated versus the TID regimen with VIRACEPT 250 mg \ntablets primarily in patients na\u00efve to PIs. A randomised open-label study compared the HIV RNA \nsuppression of nelfinavir 1250 mg BID versus nelfinavir 750 mg TID in PI na\u00efve patients also \nreceiving stavudine (30-40 mg BID) and lamivudine (150 mg BID). \n \nProportion of patients with HIV RNA below LOQ (sensitive and ultrasensitive assays) at Week 48 \nAssay Analysis Viracept BID (%) Viracept TID (%) 95 % CI \n\nObserved data 135/164 (82 %) 146/169 (86 %) (-12, +4) \nLOCF 145/200 (73 %) 161/206 (78 %) (-14, +3) \n\n \nSensitive  \n\nITT (NC = F) 135/200 (68 %) 146/206 (71 %) (-12, +6) \nObserved data 114/164 (70 %) 125/169 (74 %) (-14, +5) \nLOCF 121/200 (61 %) 136/206 (66 %) (-15, +4) \n\n \nUltrasensitive  \n\nITT (NC = F) 114/200 (57 %) 125/206 (61 %) (-13, +6) \nLOCF= Last observation carried forward \nITT = Intention to Treat \nNC = F: non-completers = failures \n \nThe BID regimen produced statistically significantly higher peak nelfinavir plasma levels versus the \nTID regimen. Small, non-statistically significant differences were observed in other pharmacokinetic \nparameters with no trend favouring one regimen over the other. Although study 542 showed no \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\nstatistically significant differences between the two regimens in efficacy in a predominantly \nantiretroviral na\u00efve patient population, the significance of these findings for antiretroviral experienced \npatients is unknown. \n \nIn a study of 297 HIV-1 seropositive patients receiving zidovudine and lamivudine plus nelfinavir \n(2 different doses) or zidovudine and lamivudine alone, the mean baseline CD4 cell count was \n288 cells/mm3 and the mean baseline plasma HIV RNA was 5.21 log10 copies/ml (160,394 copies/ml). \nThe mean decrease in plasma HIV RNA using a PCR assay (< 400 copies/ml) at 24 weeks was \n2.33 log10 in patients receiving combination therapy with nelfinavir 750 mg TID, compared to \n1.34 log10 in patients receiving zidovudine and lamivudine alone. At 24 weeks, the percentage of \npatients whose plasma HIV RNA levels had decreased to below the limit of detection of the assay \n(< 400 copies/ml) were 81 % and 8 % for the groups treated with nelfinavir 750 mg TID plus \nzidovudine and lamivudine or zidovudine and lamivudine, respectively. Mean CD4 cell counts at \n24 weeks were increased by 150 and 95 cells/mm3 for the groups treated with nelfinavir 750 mg TID \nplus zidovudine and lamivudine or zidovudine and lamivudine, respectively. At 48 weeks, \napproximately 75 % of the patients treated with nelfinavir 750 mg TID plus zidovudine and \nlamivudine remained below the level of detection of the assay (< 400 copies/ml); mean increase in \nCD4 cell counts was 198 cells/mm3 at 48 weeks in this group. \n \nNo important differences in safety or tolerability were observed between the BID and TID dosing \ngroups, with the same proportion of patients in each arm experiencing adverse events of any intensity, \nirrespective of relationship to trial medication. \n \nPlasma levels of certain HIV-1 protease inhibitors, which are metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4, \ncan be increased by the co-administration of low-dose ritonavir, which is an inhibitor of this \nmetabolism. Treatment paradigms for several protease inhibitors, which are subject to this interaction, \nrequire the co-administration of low-dose ritonavir (\u2018boosting\u2019) in order to enhance plasma levels and \noptimise antiviral efficacy. Plasma levels of nelfinavir, which is metabolised predominantly by \nCYP2C19 and only partially by CYP3A4, are not greatly increased by co-administration with \nritonavir, and therefore nelfinavir does not require co-administration with low-dose ritonavir.. Two \nstudies have compared the safety and efficacy of nelfinavir (unboosted) with ritonavir- boosted \nprotease inhibitors, each in combination with other antiretroviral agents. \n \nStudy M98-863 is a randomised, double blind trial of 653 antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients investigating \nlopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg BID n=326) compared to nelfinavir (750 mg TID n=327), each in \ncombination with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) and stavudine (40 mg twice daily). Median \nbaseline HIV-1 RNA was 4.98 log10 copies/ml and 5.01 log10 copies/ml in the nelfinavir and \nlopinavir/ritonavir treatment groups respectively. Median baseline CD4+ cell count was 232 cells/mm3 \nin both groups. At week 48, 63 % nelfinavir and 75 % lopinavir/ritonavir patients had HIV-1 RNA < \n400 copies/ml, whereas 52 % nelfinavir and 67 % lopinavir/ritonavir patients had HIV-1 RNA <50 \ncopies/ml (intent-to-treat, missing = failure). The mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count at \nweek 48 was 195 cells/mm3 and 207 cells/mm3 in the nelfinavir and lopinavir/ritonavir groups \nrespectively. Through 48 weeks of therapy, a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients in \nthe lopinavir/ritonavir arm had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml compared to the nelfinavir arm.  \n \nStudy APV30002 is a randomised, open-label trial of 649 antiretroviral treatment na\u00efve patients with \nadvanced HIV-disease, investigating fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400 mg/200 mg QD n=322) compared \nto nelfinavir (1250 mg BID n=327), each in combination with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) and \nabacavir (300 mg twice daily). Median baseline HIV-1 RNA was 4.8 log10 copies/ml in both treatment \ngroups. Median baseline CD4+ cell counts were 177 and 166 x106 cells/l for the nelfinavir and \nfosamprenavir/ritonavir groups respectively. At week 48, non-inferiority was shown with 68 % of \npatients in the group treated with nelfinavir and 69 % patients treated with fosamprenavir/ritonavir \nhaving plasma HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/ml whereas 53 % in the nelfinavir and 55 % in the \nfosamprenavir/ritonavir patients had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml (intent-to-treat, \nrebound/discontinuation = failure). The median increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count over 48 \nweeks was 207 cells/mm3 and 203 cells/mm3 in the nelfinavir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir groups \nrespectively. The virological failure was greater in the nelfinavir group (17 %) than in the \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nfosamprenavir/ritonavir group (7 %). Treatment emergent NRTI resistance was significantly less \nfrequent with fosamprenavir/ritonavir compared to nelfinavir (13 % versus 57 %; p<0.001). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of nelfinavir have been evaluated in healthy volunteers and \nHIV-infected patients. No substantial differences have been observed between healthy volunteers and \nHIV-infected patients. \n \nAbsorption: after single or multiple oral doses of 500 to 750 mg (two to three 250 mg tablets) with \nfood, peak nelfinavir plasma concentrations were typically achieved in 2 to 4 hours. \n \nAfter multiple dosing with 750 mg every 8 hours for 28 days (steady-state), peak plasma \nconcentrations (Cmax) averaged 3-4 \u00b5g/ml and plasma concentrations prior to the next dose (trough) \nwere 1-3 \u00b5g/ml. A greater than dose-proportional increase in nelfinavir plasma concentrations was \nobserved after single doses; however, this was not observed after multiple dosing. \n \nA pharmacokinetic study in HIV-positive patients compared multiple doses of 1250 mg twice daily \n(BID) with multiple doses of 750 mg three times daily (TID) for 28 days. Patients receiving \nVIRACEPT BID (n=10) achieved nelfinavir Cmax of 4.0 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5g/ml and morning and evening trough \nconcentrations of 2.2 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b5g/ml and 0.7 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. Patients receiving VIRACEPT \nTID (n=11) achieved nelfinavir peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 3.0 \u00b1 1.6 \u00b5g/ml and morning and \nevening trough concentrations of 1.4 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b5g/ml and 1.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. The difference \nbetween morning and afternoon or evening trough concentrations for the TID and BID regimens was \nalso observed in healthy volunteers who were dosed at precise 8- or 12-hour intervals. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir are similar during BID and TID administration. In patients, the \nnelfinavir AUC0-24 with 1250 mg BID administration was 52.8 \u00b1 15.7 \u00b5g\u22c5h/ml (n=10) and with 750 mg \nTID administration was 43.6 \u00b1 17.8 \u00b5g\u22c5h/ml (n=11). Trough drug exposures remain at least twenty \nfold greater than the mean IC95 throughout the dosing interval for both regimens. The clinical \nrelevance of relating in vitro measures to drug potency and clinical outcome has not been established. \nA greater than dose-proportional increase in nelfinavir plasma concentrations was observed after \nsingle doses; however, this was not observed after multiple dosing. \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of VIRACEPT has not been determined. \n \nEffect of Food on Oral Absorption \nFood increases nelfinavir exposure and decreases nelfinavir pharmacokinetic variability relative to the \nfasted state. In one study, healthy volunteers received a single dose of 1250 mg of VIRACEPT (5x \n250 mg tablets) under fasted or fed conditions (three meals with different caloric and fat contents). In a \nsecond study, healthy volunteers received single doses of 1250 mg VIRACEPT (5 x 250 mg tablets) \nunder fasted or fed conditions (two meals with different fat content). The results from the two studies \nare summarized below. \n \nIncrease in AUC, Cmax and Tmax for Nelfinavir in Fed State Relative to Fasted State Following \n1250 mg VIRACEPT (5 x 250 mg tablets) \nNumber of \nKcal \n\n% Fat Number of \nsubjects \n\nAUC fold \nincrease \n\nCmax fold increase Increase in Tmax (hr) \n\n125 20 n=21 2.2 2.0 1.00 \n500 20 n=22 3.1 2.3 2.00 \n1000 50 n=23 5.2 3.3 2.00 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\nIncrease in Nelfinavir AUC, Cmax and Tmax in Fed Low Fat (20%) versus High fat (50%) State \nRelative to Fasted State Following 1250 mg VIRACEPT (5 x 250 mg tablets) \nNumber of \nKcal \n\n% Fat Number of \nSubjects \n\nAUC fold \nincrease \n\nCmax fold increase Increase in Tmax (hr) \n\n500 20 n=22 3.1 2.5 1.8 \n500 50 n=22 5.1 3.8 2.1 \n \nNelfinavir exposure increases with increasing calorie or fat content of meals taken with VIRACEPT. \n \nDistribution: Nelfinavir in serum is extensively protein-bound (\u2265 98 %). The estimated volumes of \ndistribution in both animals and humans is 2-7 l/kg which exceeded total body water and suggests \nextensive penetration of nelfinavir into tissues. \n \nMetabolism: In vitro studies demonstrated that multiple cytochrome P-450 isoforms including \nCYP3A, CYP2C19/C9 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the metabolism of nelfinavir. One major and \nseveral minor oxidative metabolites were found in plasma. The major oxidative metabolite, M8 (tert-\nbutyl hydroxy nelfinavir), has in vitro antiviral activity equal to the parent drug and its formation is \ncatalysed by the polymorphic cytochrome CYP2C19. The further degradation of M8 appears to be \ncatalysed by CYP3A4. In subjects with normal CYP2C19 activity, plasma levels of this metabolite are \napproximately 25 % of the total plasma nelfinavir-related concentration. It is expected that in \nCYP2C19 poor metabolisers or in patients receiving concomitantly strong CYP2C19 inhibitors (see \nsection 4.5), nelfinavir plasma levels would be elevated whereas levels of tert-butyl hydroxy nelfinavir \nwould be negligible or non-measurable. \n \nElimination: oral clearance estimates after single doses (24-33 l/h) and multiple doses (26-61 l/h) \nindicate that nelfinavir exhibits medium to high hepatic bioavailability. The terminal half-life in \nplasma was typically 3.5 to 5 hours. The majority (87 %) of an oral 750 mg dose containing \n14C-nelfinavir was recovered in the faeces; total faecal radioactivity consisted of nelfinavir (22 %) and \nnumerous oxidative metabolites (78 %). Only 1-2 % of the dose was recovered in urine, of which \nunchanged nelfinavir was the major component. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations: \n \nChildren: \nIn children between the ages of 2 and 13 years, the clearance of orally administered nelfinavir is \napproximately 2 to 3 times higher than in adults, with large intersubject variability. Administration of \nVIRACEPT oral powder or tablets at a dose of approximately 25-30 mg/kg TID with food achieves \nsteady-state plasma concentrations that are similar to those achieved in adult patients receiving 750 mg \nTID.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir have been investigated in 5 studies in paediatric patients from birth \nto 13 years of age. Patients received VIRACEPT either three times daily or twice daily with food or \nwith meals. The dosing regimens and associated AUC24 values are summarized below. \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\nSummary of Steady-state AUC24 of nelfinavir in Paediatric Studies \n \n\nProtocol No.  Dosing Regimen1  N2  Age  \n\n \nFood taken  \n\nwith Viracept \n\nAUC24 \n(mg.hr/L)  \n\nArithmetic mean \n\u00b1 SD  \n\nAG1343-524  20 (19-28) mg/kg TID 14  2-13 years  \n\n \nPowder with milk, \n\nformula, pudding, or \nwater, as part  \n\nof a light meal or tablet  \ntaken with a light meal \n\n56.1 \u00b1 29.8  \n\n      \n\nPACTG-725  6  3-11 years  With food 101.8 \u00b1 56.1  \n \n\n55 (48-60) mg/kg  \nBID      \n\nPENTA 7  4  2-9 months  With milk 33.8 \u00b1 8.9  \n \n\n40 (34-43) mg/kg  \nTID      \n\nPENTA 7  12  2-9 months  With milk 37.2 \u00b1 19.2  \n \n\n75 (55-83) mg/kg  \nBID      \n\nPACTG-353  40 (14-56) mg/kg BID 10  6 weeks  \nPowder with water, \nmilk, formula, soy \n\nformula, soy milk, or \ndietary supplements \n\n44.1 \u00b1 27.4  \n\n   1 week  45.8 \u00b1 32.1 \n1 Protocol specified dose (actual dose range) \n2  N: number of subjects with evaluable pharmacokinetic results \nCtrough values are not presented in the table because they are not available from all studies \n \nPharmacokinetic data are also available for 86 patients (age 2 to 12 years) who received VIRACEPT \n25-35 mg/kg TID in Study AG1343-556. The pharmacokinetic data from Study AG1343-556 were \nmore variable than data from other studies conducted in the paediatric population; the 95% confidence \ninterval for AUC24 was 9 to 121 mg.hr/L. \n \nOverall, use of VIRACEPT in the paediatric population is associated with highly variable drug \nexposure. The reason for this high variability is not known but may be due to inconsistent food intake \nin paediatric patients. \n \nElderly: \nThere are no data available in the elderly. \n \nHepatic impairment: \nThe multi-dose pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir have not been studied in HIV-positive patients with \nhepatic insufficiency. \nPharmacokinetics of nelfinavir after a single dose of 750 mg was studied in patients with liver \nimpairment and healthy volunteers. A 49 %-69 % increase was observed in AUC of nelfinavir in the \nhepatically impaired groups with impairment (Child-Turcotte Classes A to C) compared to the healthy \ngroup. Specific dose recommendations for nelfinavir cannot be made based on the results of this study. \nA second study evaluated the steady state pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily for 2 \nweeks) in adult HIV-seronegative subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A; n=6) or moderate (Child-Pugh B; \nn=6) hepatic impairment. Compared to control subjects with normal hepatic function, the AUC and \nCmax of nelfinavir were not significantly different in subjects with mild impairment but were increased \nby 62% and 22%, respectively, in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDuring in vitro studies, cloned human cardiac potassium channels (hERG) were inhibited by high \nconcentrations of nelfinavir and its active metabolite M8. hERG potassium channels were inhibited by \n20 % at nelfinavir and M8 concentrations that are about four- to five-fold and seventy-fold, \nrespectively, above the average free therapeutic levels in humans. By contrast, no effects suggesting \nprolongation of the QT-interval of the ECG were observed at similar doses in dogs or in isolated \ncardiac tissue. The clinical relevance of these in vitro data is unknown. However, based on data from \nproducts known to prolong the QT-interval, a block of hERG potassium channels of > 20 % may be \nclinically relevant. Therefore the potential for QT prolongation should be considered in cases of \noverdose (see section 4.9).  \n \nAcute and chronic toxicity: oral acute and chronic toxicity studies were conducted in the mouse \n(500 mg/kg/day), rat (up to 1,000 mg/kg/day) and monkey (up to 800 mg/kg/day). There were \nincreased liver weights and dose-related thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy in rats. Weight loss and \ngeneral physical decline was observed in monkeys together with general evidence of gastrointestinal \ntoxicity.  \n \nMutagenicity: in vitro and in vivo studies with and without metabolic activation have shown that \nnelfinavir has no mutagenic or genotoxic activity. \n \nCarcinogenicity: Two year oral carcinogenicity studies with nelfinavir mesilate were conducted in \nmice and rats. In mice, administration of up to 1000 mg/kg/day did not result in any evidence for an \noncogenic effect. In rats administration of 1000 mg/kg/day resulted in increased incidences of thyroid \nfollicular cell adenoma and carcinoma, relative to those for controls. Systemic exposures were 3 to 4 \ntimes those for humans given therapeutic doses. Administration of 300 mg/kg/day resulted in an \nincreased incidence of thyroid follicular cell adenoma. Chronic nelfinavir treatment of rats has been \ndemonstrated to produce effects consistent with enzyme induction, which predisposed rats, but not \nhumans, to thyroid neoplasms. The weight of evidence indicates that nelfinavir is unlikely to be a \ncarcinogen in humans. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nBlue, oblong biconvex film-coated tablets. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVIRACEPT is indicated in antiretroviral combination treatment of human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV-1) infected adults, adolescents and children of 3 years of age and older.  \n \nIn protease inhibitor (PI) experienced patients the choice of nelfinavir should be based on individual \nviral resistance testing and treatment history. \n \nSee section 5.1.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy with VIRACEPT should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV \ninfection. \n \nVIRACEPT is administered orally and should always be ingested with food (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients older than 13 years: the recommended dose of VIRACEPT 250 mg film-coated tablets is \n1250 mg (five tablets) twice a day (BID) or 750 mg (three tablets) three times a day (TID) by \nmouth. \nThe efficacy of the BID (twice daily) regimen has been evaluated versus the TID (three times daily) \nregimen primarily in patients na\u00efve to PIs (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients aged 3 to 13 years: for children, the recommended starting dose is 50-55 mg/kg BID or, if \nusing a TID regimen, 25 \u2013 35 mg/kg body weight per dose.  \n \nThe recommended dose of VIRACEPT film-coated tablets to be administered BID to children aged 3 \nto 13 years is as follows: \n \n\nDose to be administered two times a day to children aged 3 to 13 \nBody weight of the patient Number of VIRACEPT 250 mg \n\nin kg film-coated tablets per dose* \n18 to 22 kg  4 \nover 22 kg 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nThe recommended dose of VIRACEPT film-coated tablets to be administered TID to children aged 3 \nto 13 years is shown in the table below. Children with weights between 10.5\u201312 kg, 12\u201314 kg and \n18\u201322 kg will receive a different number of tablets with each meal.  The table provides a schedule \nassuring that the appropriate total daily dose of Viracept is taken each day based on the child\u2019s weight. \n \nThe prescriber should advise the caregiver to carefully monitor increases in weight of the child to \nensure that the appropriate total daily dose is taken. The prescriber should also advise the caregiver \nabout the importance of adhering to the dosing instructions and that the appropriate number of tablets \nshould be taken at each dose with a meal. \n \n\nDose to be administered three times a day to children aged 3 to 13 \nRecommended number of tablets at each \n\nmeal \nBody weight of \nthe patient in \n\nkg Number of \ntablets at \nbreakfast \n\nNumber of \ntablets at \n\nlunch \n\nNumber of \ntablets at \n\ndinner \n\nTotal number \nof tablets per \n\nday \n\n  7.5 to 8.5 kg 1 1 1 3 \n  8.5 to 10.5 kg 1 1 1 3 \n10.5 to 12 kg* 2 1 1 4 \n12    to 14 kg* 2 1 2 5 \n14    to 16 kg 2 2 2 6 \n16    to 18 kg 2 2 2 6 \n18    to 22 kg* 3 2 2 7 \n    over 22 kg 3 3 3 9 \n* Children with these weights will be given an uneven number of tablets during the \n    day. The virologic and immunologic responses should be monitored to assure \n    these children achieve response to therapy. \n \nFor patients unable to swallow the tablets, VIRACEPT tablets may be dispersed in a half cup of water \nwhile thoroughly stirring with a spoon. Once dispersed, the cloudy bluish liquid should be thoroughly \nmixed and consumed immediately. The glass should be rinsed with a half cup of water and the rinse \nshould be swallowed to ensure that the entire dose is consumed.  \n \nAcidic food or juice (e.g. orange juice, apple juice or apple sauce) are not recommended to be used in \ncombination with VIRACEPT, because the combination may result in a bitter taste. The VIRACEPT \nsuspension should be taken with a meal.  \n \nThe prescriber should assure that the caregiver understands the importance of monitoring adherence \nand the appropriate method to prepare and administer Viracept tablets to children in each weight band. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment: there are no data specific for HIV positive patients with renal \nimpairment and therefore specific dosage recommendations cannot be made (see section 4.4). \nNelfinavir is principally metabolised and eliminated by the liver. There are not sufficient data from \npatients with liver impairment and therefore specific dose recommendations cannot be made (see \nsection 5.2). Caution should be used when administering VIRACEPT to patients with impaired renal \nor hepatic function. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n \nCo-administration with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic windows and which are substrates \nof CYP3A4 [e.g., terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, amiodarone, quinidine, pimozide, triazolam, \norally administered midazolam (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), \nergot derivatives, lovastatin and simvastatin, alfuzosin, and sildenafil when used for treatment of \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\npulmonary arterial hypertension hypertension (for the use of sildenafil and other PDE-5 inhibitors in \npatients with erectile dysfunction, see section 4.5)]. \n \nPotent inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampicin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine) reduce nelfinavir \nplasma concentrations.  \nCo- administration with rifampicin is contra-indicated due to a reduction in exposure to nelfinavir.  \nPhysicians should not use potent inducers of CYP 3A4 in combination with Viracept and should \nconsider using alternatives when a patient is taking VIRACEPT (see section 4.5). \n \nHerbal preparations containing St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) must not be used while taking \nnelfinavir due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of nelfinavir \n(see section 4.5).  \n \nVIRACEPT should not be co-administered with omeprazole due to a reduction in exposure to \nnelfinavir and its active metabolite M8 (Tert-butyl hydroxy nelfinavir). This may lead to a loss of \nvirologic response and possible resistance to VIRACEPT (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients should be instructed that VIRACEPT is not a cure for HIV infection, that they may continue \nto develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease, and that VIRACEPT has not been \nshown to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV disease through sexual contact or blood \ncontamination. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time \nof institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to \nasymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or \naggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or \nmonths of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or \nfocal mycobacterium infections, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms \nshould be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. \n \nLiver Disease: The safety and efficacy of nelfinavir has not been established in patients with \nsignificant underlying liver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with \ncombination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic \nadverse events. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the \nrelevant product information for these medicinal products. \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. The use of nelfinavir in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment has not been studied. In the absence of such studies, \ncaution should be exercised, as increases in nelfinavir levels and/or increases in liver enzymes may \noccur. \nPatients with hepatic impairment should not be given colchicine with VIRACEPT. \n \nOsteonecrosis: Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, \nalcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis \nhave been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to \ncombination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they \nexperience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nRenal Impairment: Since nelfinavir is highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be \nsignificantly removed by haemodiaylisis or peritoneal dialysis. Therefore, no special precautions or \ndose adjustments are required in these patients. \nPatients with renal impairment should not be given colchicine with VIRACEPT. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nDiabetes mellitus and hyperglycaemia: New onset diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or exacerbation \nof existing diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients receiving PIs. In some of these the \nhyperglycaemia was severe and in some cases also associated with ketoacidosis. Many patients had \nconfounding medical conditions, some of which required therapy with agents that have been \nassociated with the development of diabetes or hyperglycaemia. \n \nPatients with haemophilia: There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin \nhaematomas and haemarthroses, in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with PIs. In some \npatients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with PIs \nwas continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship has been \nevoked, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should \ntherefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n \nLipodystrophy: Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with the redistribution of body \nfat (acquired lipodystrophy) in HIV patients. The long-term consequences of these events are currently \nunknown. Knowledge about the mechanism is incomplete. A connection between visceral lipomatosis \nand PIs and lipoatrophy and nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) has been \nhypothesised. A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older \nage, and with drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated \nmetabolic disturbances. Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat \nredistribution. Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood \nglucose. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate (see section 4.8). \n \nPDE5 inhibitors: particular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil \nfor the treatment of erectile dysfunction in patients receiving VIRACEPT.  Co-administration of \nVIRACEPT with these medicinal products is expected to increase their concentrations and may result \nin associated adverse events such as hypotension, syncope, visual changes and prolonged erection (see \nsection 4.5). Concomitant use of sildenafil prescribed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension with VIRACEPT is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins): HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may interact with \nprotease inhibitors and increase the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use of \nprotease inhibitors with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated. Other HMG-CoA reductase \ninhibitors may also interact with protease inhibitors and should be used with caution.  \n \nConcurrent administration of salmeterol with VIRACEPT is not recommended. The combination may \nresult in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT \nprolongation, palpitations and sinus tachycardia.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNelfinavir is primarily metabolised via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 (see \nsection 5.2). Nelfinavir is also an inhibitor of CYP 3A4. Based on in vitro data, nelfinavir is unlikely \nto inhibit other cytochrome P450 isoforms at concentrations in the therapeutic range. \n \nCombination with other medicinal products: Caution is advised whenever VIRACEPT is co-\nadministered with agents that are inducers or inhibitors and/or substrates of CYP3A4; such \ncombinations may require dose adjustment (see also sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nSubstrates for CYP3A: Co-administration is contraindicated with the following agents that are \nsubstrates for CYP3A4 and that have narrow therapeutic windows terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, \namiodarone, quinidine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, oral midazolam, triazolam, alfuzosin, and \nsildenafil when used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (see section 4.3). \n \nCo-administration of a PI with sildenafil is expected to substantially increase sildenafil concentration \nand may result in an increase in sildenafil associated adverse events, including hypotension, visual \nchanges, and priapism. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\n \nFor other substrates of CYP3A4 a dose reduction or consideration of an alternative may be required \n(Table 1).  \nCoadministration of nelfinavir with fluticasone proprionate may increase plasma concentrations of \nfluticasone propionate. Consider alternatives that are not metabolised by CYP3A4 such as \nbeclomethasone. \nConcomitant use of trazodone and nelfinavir may increase plasma concentrations of trazodone and a \nlower dose of trazodone should be considered. \n \nCoadministration of nelfinavir with simvastatin or lovastatin may result in significant increases in \nsimvastatin and lovastatin plasma concentrations and is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Consider \nalternatives that are not substrates of CYP3A4 such as pravastatin or fluvastatin. Other HMG-CoA \nreductase inhibitors may also interact with protease inhibitors and should be used with caution .  \n \nConcurrent administration of salmeterol with VIRACEPT is not recommended. The combination may \nresult in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT \nprolongation, palpitations and sinus tachycardia.  \nCoadministration of warfarin and VIRACEPT may affect concentrations of warfarin. It is \nrecommended that the international normalized ratio (INR) be monitored carefully during treatment \nwith VIRACEPT, especially when commencing therapy. \n \nMetabolic enzyme inducers: Potent inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, pehnobarbital and \ncarbamazepine) may reduce nelfianvir plasma concentrations and their coadministration is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). Caution should be used when co-administering other agents that \ninduce CYP3A4.  \nPlasma concentrations of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given \norally and should therefore not be coadministered with nelfinavir.  Parenteral midazolam should be \ncoadministered with nelfinavir in an intensive care unit to ensure close clinical monitoring. Dose \nadjustment for midazolam should be considered if more than a single dose is administered (Table 1) \n \nMetabolic enzyme inhibitors: Co-administration of nelfinavir with inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., \nfluconazole, fluoxetine, paroxetine, lansoprazole, imipramine, amitriptyline and diazepam) may be \nexpected to reduce the conversion of nelfinavir to its major active metabolite M8 (tert-butyl hydroxy \nnelfinavir) with a concomitant increase in plasma nelfinavir levels (see section 5.2). Limited clinical \ntrial data from patients receiving one or more of these medicinal products with nelfinavir indicated \nthat a clinically significant effect on safety and efficacy is not expected. However, such an effect \ncannot be ruled out.  \n \nInteractions of nelfinavir with selected agents that describe the impact of nelfinavir on the \npharmacokinetics of the co-administered compound and the impact of other drugs on \npharmacokinetics of nelfinavir are listed in Table 1. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\nTable 1: Interactions and dose recommendations with other medical products \nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas \n(dose of nelfinavir \nused in study) \n\n \nEffects on drug levels \n% Change \n\n \nRecommendations concerning \ncoadministration \n\n \nNRTIs \n  Clinically significant interactions \n\nhave not been observed between \nnelfinavir and nucleoside \nanalogues.

Clinical \nexperience in pregnant women is limited. VIRACEPT should be given during pregnancy only if the \nexpected benefit justifies the possible risk to the foetus. \n \nIt is recommended that HIV-infected women must not breast-feed their infants under any \ncircumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV. Studies in lactating rats showed that nelfinavir is \nexcreted in breast milk. There is no data available on nelfinavir excretion into human breast milk. \nMothers must be instructed to discontinue breast-feeding if they are receiving VIRACEPT. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVIRACEPT has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe safety of the VIRACEPT 250 mg tablet was studied in controlled clinical trials with over 1300 \npatients. The majority of patients in these studies received either 750 mg TID either alone or in \ncombination with nucleoside analogues or 1250 mg BID in combination with nucleoside analogues. \nThe following adverse events with an at least possible relationship to nelfinavir (i.e. adverse reactions) \nwere reported most frequently: diarrhoea, nausea, and rash. Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials with nelfinavir \n \nAdverse reactions in clinical studies are summarised in Table 2.

The adverse reaction profile seen during \npaediatric clinical trials was similar to that for adults. Diarrhoea was the most commonly reported \nadverse event in children. Neutropenia/leukopenia was the most frequently observed laboratory \nabnormality. During these trials less than 13% of patients in total discontinued treatment due to \nadverse events.  \n \nPost-marketing experience with nelfinavir \nSerious and non-serious adverse reactions from post-marketing spontaneous reports (where nelfinavir \nwas taken as the sole protease inhibitor or in combination with other antiretroviral therapy), not \nmentioned previously in section 4.8, for which a causal relationship to nelfinavir cannot be excluded, \nare summarised below. As these data come from the spontaneous reporting system, the frequency of \nthe adverse reactions is not confirmed. \n \nImmune system disorders: \nUncommon (\u2265 0.1 % - \u2264 1 %): hypersensitivity including bronchospasm, pyrexia, pruritus, facial \noedema and rash maculo-papular or dermatitis bullous. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nUncommon - rare (\u2265 0.01 % - \u2264 1 %): Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with \nredistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy acquired) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral \nand facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and \ndorsocervical fat accumulation (lypohypertrophy buffalo hump).  \nRare (\u2265 0.01 % - \u2264 0.1 %): new onset diabetes mellitus, or exacerbation of existing diabetes mellitus. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nUncommon (\u2265 0.1 % - \u2264 1 %): vomiting, pancreatitis/blood amylase increased. \nRare (\u2265 0.01 % - \u2264 0.1 %): abdominal distension,  \n \nHepatobiliary disorders: \nRare (\u2265 0.01 % - \u2264 0.1 %): hepatitis, hepatic enzymes increased and jaundice when nelfinavir is used \nin combination with other antiretroviral agents. \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nRare (\u2265 0.01 % - \u2264 0.1 %): Blood creatine phosphokinase increased, myalgia, myositis and \nrhabdomyolysis have been reported with PIs, particularly in combination with nucleoside analogues.  \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n34 \n\nVascular disorders: \nRare (\u2265 0.01 % - \u2264 0.1 %): increased spontaneous haemorrhage bleeding in patients with haemophilia. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nVery rare (\u2264 0.01 %), including isolated reports: Erythema multiforme. \n \nPaediatric population: \nAdditional adverse reactions have been reported in the post-marketing experience and are listed below. \nAs these data come from the spontaneous reporting system, the frequency of the adverse reactions is \nunknown: hypertriglyceridemia, anaemia, blood lactic acid increased, and pneumonia. \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nCombination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such asblood \ntriglycerides increased, blood cholesterol increased, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia and \nhyperlactaemia. The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nHuman experience of acute overdose with VIRACEPT is limited. There is no specific antidote for \noverdose with nelfinavir. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed nelfinavir should be achieved by \nemesis or gastric lavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid removal of \nunabsorbed nelfinavir. Since nelfinavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to significantly \nremove it from blood. \n \nOverdoses of nelfinavir could theoretically be associated with prolongation of the QT-interval of the \nECG (see also section 5.3). Monitoring of overdosed patients is warranted.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: direct acting antivirals, ATC code: J05AE04  \n \nMechanism of action: HIV protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral \npolyprotein precursors to the individual proteins found in infectious HIV. The cleavage of these viral \npolyproteins is essential for the maturation of infectious virus. Nelfinavir reversibly binds to the active \nsite of HIV protease and prevents cleavage of the polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature \nnon-infectious viral particles.  \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro: the antiviral activity of nelfinavir in vitro has been demonstrated in both \nHIV acute and chronic infections in lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood lymphocytes and \nmonocytes/macrophages. Nelfinavir was found to be active against a broad range of laboratory strains \nand clinical isolates of HIV-1 and the HIV-2 strain ROD. The EC95 (95 % effective concentration) of \nnelfinavir ranged from 7 to 111 nM (mean of 58 nM). Nelfinavir demonstrated additive to synergistic \neffects against HIV in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine (ZDV), \nlamivudine (3TC), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC) and stavudine (d4T) without enhanced \ncytotoxicity. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n35 \n\nResistance: Viral escape from nelfinavir can occur via viral protease mutations at amino acid positions \n30, 88 and 90. \n \nIn vitro: HIV isolates with reduced susceptibility to nelfinavir have been selected in vitro. HIV isolates \nfrom selected patients treated with nelfinavir alone or in combination with reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors were monitored for phenotypic (n=19) and genotypic (n=195, 157 of which were assessable) \nchanges in clinical trials over a period of 2 to 82 weeks. One or more viral protease mutations at amino \nacid positions 30, 35, 36, 46, 71, 77 and 88 were detected in > 10 % of patients with assessable \nisolates. Of 19 patients for whom both phenotypic and genotypic analyses were performed on clinical \nisolates, 9 patients isolates showed reduced susceptibility (5- to 93-fold) to nelfinavir in vitro. Isolates \nfrom all 9 patients possessed one or more mutations in the viral protease gene. Amino acid position 30 \nappeared to be the most frequent mutation site. \n \nCross resistance in vitro: HIV isolates obtained from 5 patients during nelfinavir therapy showed a \n5- to 93-fold decrease in nelfinavir susceptibility in vitro when compared to matched baseline isolates \nbut did not demonstrate a concordant decrease in susceptibility to indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir or \namprenavir in vitro. Conversely, following ritonavir therapy, 6 of 7 clinical isolates with decreased \nritonavir susceptibility (8- to 113-fold) in vitro compared to baseline also exhibited decreased \nsusceptibility to nelfinavir in vitro (5- to 40 fold). An HIV isolate obtained from a patient receiving \nsaquinavir therapy showed decreased susceptibility to saquinavir (7- fold) but did not demonstrate a \nconcordant decrease in susceptibility to nelfinavir. Cross-resistance between nelfinavir and reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors is unlikely because different enzyme targets are involved. Clinical isolates \n(n=5) with decreased susceptibility to zidovudine, lamivudine, or nevirapine remain fully susceptible \nto nelfinavir in vitro. \n \nIn vivo: The overall incidence of the D30N mutation in the viral protease of assessable isolates \n(n=157) from patients receiving nelfinavir monotherapy or nelfinavir in combination with zidovudine \nand lamivudine or stavudine was 54.8 %. The overall incidence of other mutations associated with \nprimary PI resistance was 9.6 % for the L90M substitution where as substitutions at 48, 82 and 84 \nwere not observed. \n \nClinical pharmacodynamic data: treatment with nelfinavir alone or in combination with other \nantiretroviral agents has been documented to reduce viral load and increase CD4 cell counts in HIV-1 \nseropositive patients. Decreases in HIV RNA observed with nelfinavir monotherapy were less \npronounced and of shorter duration. The effects of nelfinavir (alone or combined with other \nantiretroviral agents) on biological markers of disease activity, CD4 cell count and viral RNA, were \nevaluated in several studies involving HIV-1 infected patients. \n \nThe efficacy of the BID regimen has been evaluated versus the TID regimen with VIRACEPT 250 mg \ntablets primarily in patients na\u00efve to PIs. A randomised open-label study compared the HIV RNA \nsuppression of nelfinavir 1250 mg BID versus nelfinavir 750 mg TID in PI na\u00efve patients also \nreceiving stavudine (30-40 mg BID) and lamivudine (150 mg BID). \n \nProportion of patients with HIV RNA below LOQ (sensitive and ultrasensitive assays) at Week 48 \nAssay Analysis Viracept BID (%) Viracept TID (%) 95 % CI \n\nObserved data 135/164 (82 %) 146/169 (86 %) (-12, +4) \nLOCF 145/200 (73 %) 161/206 (78 %) (-14, +3) \n\n \nSensitive  \n\nITT (NC = F) 135/200 (68 %) 146/206 (71 %) (-12, +6) \nObserved data 114/164 (70 %) 125/169 (74 %) (-14, +5) \nLOCF 121/200 (61 %) 136/206 (66 %) (-15, +4) \n\n \nUltrasensitive  \n\nITT (NC = F) 114/200 (57 %) 125/206 (61 %) (-13, +6) \nLOCF= Last observation carried forward \nITT = Intention to Treat \nNC = F: non-completers = failures \n \nThe BID regimen produced statistically significantly higher peak nelfinavir plasma levels versus the \nTID regimen. Small, non-statistically significant differences were observed in other pharmacokinetic \nparameters with no trend favouring one regimen over the other.

At 24 weeks, the percentage of \npatients whose plasma HIV RNA levels had decreased to below the limit of detection of the assay \n(< 400 copies/ml) were 81 % and 8 % for the groups treated with nelfinavir 750 mg TID plus \nzidovudine and lamivudine or zidovudine and lamivudine, respectively. Mean CD4 cell counts at \n24 weeks were increased by 150 and 95 cells/mm3 for the groups treated with nelfinavir 750 mg TID \nplus zidovudine and lamivudine or zidovudine and lamivudine, respectively. At 48 weeks, \napproximately 75 % of the patients treated with nelfinavir 750 mg TID plus zidovudine and \nlamivudine remained below the level of detection of the assay (< 400 copies/ml); mean increase in \nCD4 cell counts was 198 cells/mm3 at 48 weeks in this group. \n \nNo important differences in safety or tolerability were observed between the BID and TID dosing \ngroups, with the same proportion of patients in each arm experiencing adverse events of any intensity, \nirrespective of relationship to trial medication.  \n \nPlasma levels of certain HIV-1 protease inhibitors, which are metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4, \ncan be increased by the co-administration of low-dose ritonavir, which is an inhibitor of this \nmetabolism. Treatment paradigms for several protease inhibitors, which are subject to this interaction, \nrequire the co-administration of low-dose ritonavir (\u2018boosting\u2019) in order to enhance plasma levels and \noptimise antiviral efficacy. Plasma levels of nelfinavir, which is metabolised predominantly by \nCYP2C19 and only partially by CYP3A4, are not greatly increased by co-administration with \nritonavir, and therefore nelfinavir does not require co-administration with low-dose ritonavir . Two \nstudies have compared the safety and efficacy of nelfinavir (unboosted) with ritonavir- boosted \nprotease inhibitors, each in combination with other antiretroviral agents. \n \nStudy M98-863 is a randomised, double blind trial of 653 antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients investigating \nlopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg BID n=326) compared to nelfinavir (750 mg TID n=327), each in \ncombination with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) and stavudine (40 mg twice daily). Median \nbaseline HIV-1 RNA was 4.98 log10 copies/ml and 5.01 log10 copies/ml in the nelfinavir and \nlopinavir/ritonavir treatment groups respectively. Median baseline CD4+ cell count was 232 cells/mm3 \nin both groups. At week 48, 63 % nelfinavir and 75 % lopinavir/ritonavir patients had HIV-1 RNA < \n400 copies/ml, whereas 52 % nelfinavir and 67 % lopinavir/ritonavir patients had HIV-1 RNA <50 \ncopies/ml (intent-to-treat, missing = failure). The mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count at \nweek 48 was 195 cells/mm3 and 207 cells/mm3 in the nelfinavir and lopinavir/ritonavir groups \nrespectively. Through 48 weeks of therapy, a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients in \nthe lopinavir/ritonavir arm had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml compared to the nelfinavir arm.  \n \nStudy APV30002 is a randomised, open-label trial of 649 antiretroviral treatment na\u00efve patients with \nadvanced HIV-disease, investigating fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400 mg/200 mg QD n=322) compared \nto nelfinavir (1250 mg BID n=327), each in combination with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) and \nabacavir (300 mg twice daily). Median baseline HIV-1 RNA was 4.8 log10 copies/ml in both treatment \ngroups. Median baseline CD4+ cell counts were 177 and 166 x106 cells/l for the nelfinavir and \nfosamprenavir/ritonavir groups respectively. At week 48, non-inferiority was shown with 68 % of \npatients in the group treated with nelfinavir and 69 % patients treated with fosamprenavir/ritonavir \nhaving plasma HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/ml whereas 53 % in the nelfinavir and 55 % in the \nfosamprenavir/ritonavir patients had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml (intent-to-treat, \nrebound/discontinuation = failure). The median increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count over 48 \nweeks was 207 cells/mm3 and 203 cells/mm3 in the nelfinavir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir groups \nrespectively. The virological failure was greater in the nelfinavir group (17 %) than in the \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n37 \n\nfosamprenavir/ritonavir group (7 %). Treatment emergent NRTI resistance was significantly less \nfrequent with fosamprenavir/ritonavir compared to nelfinavir (13 % versus 57 %; p<0.001). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of nelfinavir have been evaluated in healthy volunteers and \nHIV-infected patients. No substantial differences have been observed between healthy volunteers and \nHIV-infected patients. \n \nAbsorption: after single or multiple oral doses of 500 to 750 mg (two to three 250 mg tablets) with \nfood, peak nelfinavir plasma concentrations were typically achieved in 2 to 4 hours. \n \nAfter multiple dosing with 750 mg every 8 hours for 28 days (steady-state), peak plasma \nconcentrations (Cmax) averaged 3-4 \u00b5g/ml and plasma concentrations prior to the next dose (trough) \nwere 1-3 \u00b5g/ml. A greater than dose-proportional increase in nelfinavir plasma concentrations was \nobserved after single doses; however, this was not observed after multiple dosing. \n \nA pharmacokinetic study in HIV-positive patients compared multiple doses of 1250 mg twice daily \n(BID) with multiple doses of 750 mg three times daily (TID) for 28 days. Patients receiving \nVIRACEPT BID (n=10) achieved nelfinavir Cmax of 4.0 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5g/ml and morning and evening trough \nconcentrations of 2.2 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b5g/ml and 0.7 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. Patients receiving VIRACEPT \nTID (n=11) achieved nelfinavir peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 3.0 \u00b1 1.6 \u00b5g/ml and morning and \nevening trough concentrations of 1.4 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b5g/ml and 1.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. The difference \nbetween morning and afternoon or evening trough concentrations for the TID and BID regimens was \nalso observed in healthy volunteers who were dosed at precise 8- or 12-hour intervals. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir are similar during BID and TID administration. In patients, the \nnelfinavir AUC0-24 with 1250 mg BID administration was 52.8 \u00b1 15.7 \u00b5g\u22c5h/ml (n=10) and with 750 mg \nTID administration was 43.6 \u00b1 17.8 \u00b5g\u22c5h/ml (n=11). Trough drug exposures remain at least twenty \nfold greater than the mean IC95 throughout the dosing interval for both regimens. The clinical \nrelevance of relating in vitro measures to drug potency and clinical outcome has not been established. \nA greater than dose-proportional increase in nelfinavir plasma concentrations was observed after \nsingle doses; however, this was not observed after multiple dosing. \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of VIRACEPT has not been determined. \n \nEffect of Food on Oral Absorption \nFood increases nelfinavir exposure and decreases nelfinavir pharmacokinetic variability relative to the \nfasted state. In one study, healthy volunteers received a single dose of 1250 mg of VIRACEPT (5x \n250 mg tablets) under fasted or fed conditions (three meals with different caloric and fat contents). In a \nsecond study, healthy volunteers received single doses of 1250 mg VIRACEPT (5 x 250 mg tablets) \nunder fasted or fed conditions (two meals with different fat content). The results from the two studies \nare summarized below. \n \nIncrease in AUC, Cmax and Tmax for Nelfinavir in Fed State Relative to Fasted State Following \n1250 mg VIRACEPT (5 x 250 mg tablets) \nNumber of \nKcal \n\n% Fat Number of \nsubjects \n\nAUC fold \nincrease \n\nCmax fold increase Increase in Tmax (hr) \n\n125 20 n=21 2.2 2.0 1.00 \n500 20 n=22 3.1 2.3 2.00 \n1000 50 n=23 5.2 3.3 2.00 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n38 \n\nIncrease in Nelfinavir AUC, Cmax and Tmax in Fed Low Fat (20%) versus High fat (50%) State \nRelative to Fasted State Following 1250 mg VIRACEPT (5 x 250 mg tablets) \nNumber of \nKcal \n\n% Fat Number of \nSubjects \n\nAUC fold \nincrease \n\nCmax fold increase Increase in Tmax (hr) \n\n500 20 n=22 3.1 2.5 1.8 \n500 50 n=22 5.1 3.8 2.1 \n \nNelfinavir exposure increases with increasing calorie or fat content of meals taken with VIRACEPT. \n \nDistribution: Nelfinavir in serum is extensively protein-bound (\u2265 98 %). The estimated volumes of \ndistribution in both animals and humans is 2-7 l/kg which exceeded total body water and suggests \nextensive penetration of nelfinavir into tissues. \n \nMetabolism: In vitro studies demonstrated that multiple cytochrome P-450 isoforms including \nCYP3A, CYP2C19/C9 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the metabolism of nelfinavir. One major and \nseveral minor oxidative metabolites were found in plasma. The major oxidative metabolite, M8 (tert-\nbutyl hydroxy nelfinavir), has in vitro antiviral activity equal to the parent drug and its formation is \ncatalysed by the polymorphic cytochrome CYP2C19. The further degradation of M8 appears to be \ncatalysed by CYP3A4. In subjects with normal CYP2C19 activity, plasma levels of this metabolite are \napproximately 25 % of the total plasma nelfinavir-related concentration. It is expected that in \nCYP2C19 poor metabolisers or in patients receiving concomitantly strong CYP2C19 inhibitors (see \nsection 4.5), nelfinavir plasma levels would be elevated whereas levels of tert-butyl hydroxy nelfinavir \nwould be negligible or non-measurable. \n \nElimination: oral clearance estimates after single doses (24-33 l/h) and multiple doses (26-61 l/h) \nindicate that nelfinavir exhibits medium to high hepatic bioavailability. The terminal half-life in \nplasma was typically 3.5 to 5 hours. The majority (87 %) of an oral 750 mg dose containing \n14C-nelfinavir was recovered in the faeces; total faecal radioactivity consisted of nelfinavir (22 %) and \nnumerous oxidative metabolites (78 %). Only 1-2 % of the dose was recovered in urine, of which \nunchanged nelfinavir was the major component. \n \nPharmacokinetics in specialpopulations: \n \nChildren: \nIn children between the ages of 2 and 13 years, the clearance of orally administered nelfinavir is \napproximately 2 to 3 times higher than in adults, with large intersubject variability. Administration of \nVIRACEPT oral powder or tablets at a dose of approximately 25-30 mg/kg TID with food achieves \nsteady-state plasma concentrations that are similar to those achieved in adult patients receiving 750 mg \nTID.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir have been investigated in 5 studies in paediatric patients from birth \nto 13 years of age. Patients received VIRACEPT either three times daily or twice daily with food or \nwith meals.

The pharmacokinetic data from Study AG1343-556 were \nmore variable than data from other studies conducted in the paediatric population; the 95% confidence \ninterval for AUC24 was 9 to 121 mg.hr/L. \n \nOverall, use of VIRACEPT in the paediatric population is associated with highly variable drug \nexposure. The reason for this high variability is not known but may be due to inconsistent food intake \nin paediatric patients. \n \nElderly: \nThere are no data available in the elderly. \n \nHepatic impairment: \nThe multi-dose pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir have not been studied in HIV-positive patients with \nhepatic insufficiency. \nPharmacokinetics of nelfinavir after a single dose of 750 mg was studied in patients with liver \nimpairment and healthy volunteers. A 49 %-69 % increase was observed in AUC of nelfinavir in the \nhepatically impaired group (Child-Turcotte Classes A to C) compared to the healthy group. Specific \ndose recommendations for nelfinavir cannot be made based on the results of this study. \nA second study evaluated the steady state pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily for 2 \nweeks) in adult HIV-seronegative subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A; n=6) or moderate (Child-Pugh B; \nn=6) hepatic impairment. Compared to control subjects with normal hepatic function, the AUC and \nCmax of nelfinavir were not significantly different in subjects with mild impairment but were increased \nby 62% and 22%, respectively in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDuring in vitro studies, cloned human cardiac potassium channels (hERG) were inhibited by high \nconcentrations of nelfinavir and its active metabolite M8. hERG potassium channels were inhibited by \n20 % at nelfinavir and M8 concentrations that are about four- to five-fold and seventy-fold, \nrespectively, above the average free therapeutic levels in humans. By contrast, no effects suggesting \nprolongation of the QT-interval of the ECG were observed at similar doses in dogs or in isolated \ncardiac tissue. The clinical relevance of these in vitro data is unknown. However, based on data from \nproducts known to prolong the QT-interval, a block of hERG potassium channels of > 20 % may be \nclinically relevant. Therefore the potential for QT prolongation should be considered in cases of \noverdose (see section 4.9). \n \nAcute and chronic toxicity: oral acute and chronic toxicity studies were conducted in the mouse \n(500 mg/kg/day), rat (up to 1,000 mg/kg/day) and monkey (up to 800 mg/kg/day). There were \nincreased liver weights and dose-related thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy in rats. Weight loss and \ngeneral physical decline was observed in monkeys together with general evidence of gastrointestinal \ntoxicity.  \n \nMutagenicity: in vitro and in vivo studies with and without metabolic activation have shown that \nnelfinavir has no mutagenic or genotoxic activity. \n \nCarcinogenicity: Two year oral carcinogenicity studies with nelfinavir mesilate were conducted in \nmice and rats. In mice, administration of up to 1000 mg/kg/day did not result in any evidence for an \noncogenic effect. In rats administration of 1000 mg/kg/day resulted in increased incidences of thyroid \nfollicular cell adenoma and carcinoma, relative to those for controls. Systemic exposures were 3 to 4 \ntimes those for humans given therapeutic doses. Administration of 300 mg/kg/day resulted in an \nincreased incidence of thyroid follicular cell adenoma. Chronic nelfinavir treatment of rats has been \ndemonstrated to produce effects consistent with enzyme induction, which predisposed rats, but not \nhumans, to thyroid neoplasms. The weight of evidence indicates that nelfinavir is unlikely to be a \ncarcinogen in humans. \n \n \n6.

This belongs to a group \nof medicines called \u2018anti-retrovirals\u2019.  \n \nWhat Viracept is used for \nViracept is used with other \u2018anti-retroviral\u2019 medicines to: \n\u2022 Work against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It helps to reduce the number of HIV \n\nparticles in your blood. \n\u2022 Increase the number of some cells in your blood that help fight infection. These are called CD4 \n\nwhite blood cells. They are particularly reduced in numbers when you have HIV infection. This \ncan lead to an increased risk of many types of infections. \n\n \nViracept is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to get infections or other illnesses due to \nyour HIV. Treatment with Viracept does not stop you giving HIV to others through contact with blood \nor sexual contact. Therefore you must keep taking appropriate precautions to avoid giving the virus to \nothers when you are taking Viracept. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE VIRACEPT \n \nDo not take Viracept if: \n\u2022 You are allergic to nelfinavir or to any of the other ingredients (listed in Section 6 \u2018Further \n\ninformation\u2019). \n\u2022 You are taking any of the medicines listed in the first part of Section 2 \u2018Taking other \n\nmedicines\u2019, \u2018Do not take Viracept\u2019. \nDo not take Viracept if any of the above apply to you.  \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n60 \n\nTake special care with Viracept \nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist before taking Viracept if: \n\u2022 You have kidney problems. \n\u2022 You have high blood sugar (diabetes). \n\u2022 You have a rare blood problem which runs in families called \u2018haemophilia\u2019. \n\u2022 You have liver disease caused by hepatitis B or C. Your doctor may wish to carry out regular \n\nblood tests.  \nIf any of the above apply to you, or if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you \ntake Viracept. \n \nPatients with liver disease \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti-retroviral agents are at increased risk for \nsevere and potentially fatal liver adverse events and may require blood tests for control of liver \nfunction. Speak with your doctor if you have a history of liver disease. \n \nBody fat \nCombination anti-retroviral therapy may cause changes in body shape due to changes in fat \ndistribution. These may include loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the abdomen \n(belly) and other internal organs, breast enlargement and fatty lumps on the back of the neck (\u2018buffalo \nhump\u2019). The cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time. Contact \nyour doctor if you notice changes in body fat. \n \nSigns of previous infections \nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and \nsymptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \nstarted. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body\u2019s immune response, \nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately.  \n \nBone disease (osteonecrosis) \nSome patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor immediately. \n \nTaking other medicines \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This \nincludes medicines that you buy without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is because Viracept \ncan affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect the way Viracept \nworks. \n \nDo not take Viracept and tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following \nmedicines: \n\u2022 Medicines made from ergot such as cabergoline, ergotamine or lisuride (for Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\nor migraine) \n\u2022 Herbal preparations containing St. John\u2019s Wort (for depression or improving your mood)  \n\u2022 Rifampicin (for tuberculosis (TB)) \n\u2022 Terfenadine or astemizole (for allergy) \n\u2022 Pimozide (used for mental health problems) \n\u2022 Amiodarone or quinidine (for an uneven heart beat) \n\u2022 Phenobarbital or carbamazepine (for fits or epilepsy) \n\u2022 Triazolam or oral midazolam taken by mouth (for anxiety or to help you sleep) \n\u2022 Cisapride (for heart burn or problems with your digestive system) \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n61 \n\n\u2022 Omeprazole (for ulcers in your stomach or gut) \n\u2022 Alfuzosin (for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)) \n\u2022 Sildenafil (for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)) \n\u2022 Simvastatin or lovastatin (for lowering blood cholesterol) \n \nDo not take Viracept and tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of these apply to you. If you are not \nsure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Viracept. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\u2022 Any other medicines for HIV infection such as ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir and delavirdine, \n\namprenavir, efavirenz or nevirapine \n\u2022 Oral contraceptives (the pill). Viracept can stop the pill from working, so you should use other \n\ncontraception methods (such as condoms) while you are taking Viracept. \n\u2022 Calcium channel blockers such as bepridil (for heart problems)  \n\u2022 Immunosuppressant medicines such as tacrolimus or ciclosporin \n\u2022 Medicines that lower stomach acid such as lansoprazole \n\u2022 Fluticasone (for hay fever) \n\u2022 Phenytoin (for fits or epilepsy) \n\u2022 Methadone (for drug dependence) \n\u2022 Sildenafil (for getting or keeping an erection) \n\u2022 Tadalafil (for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), or for getting or keeping an erection) \n\u2022 Vardenafil (for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), or for getting or keeping an erection) \n\u2022 Ketoconazole, itraconazole or fluconazole (for fungal infections) \n\u2022 Rifabutin, erythromycin or clarithromycin (for bacterial infections) \n\u2022 Midazolam given by injection or diazepam (for anxiety or to help you sleep) \n\u2022 Fluoxetine, paroxetine, imipramine, amitriptyline or trazodone (for depression) \n\u2022 Atorvastatinor other statins(for lowering blood cholesterol) \n\n\u2022 Salmeterol (for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) \n\u2022 Warfarin (for lowering the chance of blood clots in your body) \n\u2022 Colchicine (for gout-flares or Mediterranean fever) \n\u2022 Bosentan (for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) \n) \nIf any of the above apply to you, or if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you \ntake Viracept.  \n \nTaking Viracept with food and drink \nTake Viracept with a meal. This helps your body to get the full benefit from your medicine. \n \nPregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor before you take Viracept if you are pregnant or planning to become \n\npregnant. \n\u2022 Do not breast-feed while taking Viracept because HIV may be passed to the baby. \n\u2022 Viracept can stop oral contraceptives (the pill) from working, so you should use other  \n\ncontraception methods (such as condoms) while you are taking Viracept. \n\u2022 Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nViracept is not likely to affect you being able to drive or use any tools or machines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Viracept \n\u2022 This medicine contains sucrose, which is a type of sugar. If you have been told by your doctor \n\nthat you cannot tolerate or digest some sugars (have an intolerance to some sugars), talk to your \ndoctor before taking this medicine. Each dose contains up to 5.9 milligrams of sucrose, which \nshould be taken into account in patients with diabetes mellitus. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n62 \n\n\u2022 This medicine contains aspartame, which is a source of phenylalanine.

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Viracept can have side effects, although not everybody gets them. The following \nside effects may happen with this medicine. \n \nContact your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following side effects: \n\u2022 Allergic reactions. The signs may include difficulty in breathing, fever, itching, swelling of the \n\nface and skin rashes that can sometimes form blisters. \n\u2022 Increased bleeding if you have haemophilia. If you have haemophilia type A or B, in rare \n\ncases your bleeding may increase.  \n\u2022 Bone disease (osteonecrosis). The signs may include joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially \n\nof the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. Some patients taking combination \nanti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue \ncaused by loss of blood supply to the bone).  \n\n\u2022 Infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic \ninfection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after \nanti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in \nthe body\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present \nwith no obvious symptoms.  \n\n \nIf you notice any of the above, contact your doctor straight away. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n65 \n\nOther possible side effects, where you should talk to your doctor \nIf you get any of the side effects on this list, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \nplease tell your doctor. \n \nVery common (affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Diarrhoea. \n \nCommon (affect less than 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Rash. \n\u2022 Wind. \n\u2022 Feeling sick.  \n\u2022 Low numbers of a type of white blood cell that fights infections (neutrophils). \n\u2022 Abnormal results from blood tests that measure how well your liver or muscles are working. \n \nUncommon (affect less than 1 in 100 people): \n\u2022 Being sick. \n\u2022 Pancreatitis. The signs include severe pains in your stomach that spread to your back. \n\u2022 Combination anti-retroviral therapy may cause changes in body shape due to changes in fat \n\ndistribution. These may include loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the \nabdomen (belly) and other internal organs, breast enlargement and fatty lumps on the back of \nthe neck (\u2018buffalo hump\u2019). The cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not \nknown at this time.  \n\n \nRare (affect less than 1 in 1000 people): \n\u2022 Yellow skin or eyes. This could be a sign of a liver problem such as hepatitis or jaundice. \n\u2022 A severe form of rash (erythema multiforme). \n\u2022 Swelling of your belly (abdomen). \n\u2022 High blood sugar (diabetes) or diabetes get worse. \n\u2022 There have been rare reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly with \n\ncombination anti-retroviral therapy including protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues. On \nrare occasions these muscle problems have been serious causing muscle degeneration \n(rhabdomyolysis). \n\n \nOther side effects which have also been reported: \n\u2022 Combination anti-retroviral therapy may also cause raised lactic acid and sugar in the blood, \n\nhyperlipaemia (increased fats in the blood) and resistance to insulin. \n\u2022 Low numbers of red blood cells (anaemia). \n\u2022 Lung disease (pneumonia). \n\u2022 Cases of diabetes mellitus or increased blood sugar levels have been reported in patients \n\nreceiving this treatment or another protease inhibitor. \n \nSide effects in children \nAbout 400 children (aged from 0 to 13 years) received Viracept in clinical trials. The side effects seen \nin children are similar to those seen in adults. The most commonly reported side effect in children is \ndiarrhoea. The side effects only rarely resulted into having to stop taking Viracept. \n \n \n5.

WHAT VIRACEPT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nWhat Viracept is \nViracept contains a medicine called nelfinavir, which is a \u2018protease inhibitor\u2019.  This belongs to a group \nof medicines called \u2018anti-retrovirals\u2019.  \n \nWhat Viracept is used for \nViracept is used with other \u2018anti-retroviral\u2019 medicines to: \n\u2022 Work against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It helps to reduce the number of HIV \n\nparticles in your blood. \n\u2022 Increase the number of some cells in your blood that help fight infection. These are called CD4 \n\nwhite blood cells. They are particularly reduced in numbers when you have HIV infection. This \ncan lead to an increased risk of many types of infections. \n\n \nViracept is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to get infections or other illnesses due to \nyour HIV. Treatment with Viracept does not stop you giving HIV to others through contact with blood \nor sexual contact. Therefore you must keep taking appropriate precautions to avoid giving the virus to \nothers when you are taking Viracept. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE VIRACEPT \n \nDo not take Viracept if: \n\u2022 You are allergic to nelfinavir or to any of the other ingredients (listed in Section 6 \u2018Further \n\ninformation\u2019). \n\u2022 You are taking any of the medicines listed in the first part of Section 2 \u2018Taking other \n\nmedicines\u2019, \u2018Do not take Viracept\u2019. \nDo not take Viracept if any of the above apply to you.  \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n69 \n\nTake special care with Viracept \nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist before taking Viracept if: \n\u2022 You have kidney problems. \n\u2022 You have high blood sugar (diabetes). \n\u2022 You have a rare blood problem which runs in families called \u2018haemophilia\u2019. \n\u2022 You have liver disease caused by hepatitis B or C. Your doctor may wish to carry out regular \n\nblood tests.  \nIf any of the above apply to you, or if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you \ntake Viracept. \n \nPatients with liver disease \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti-retroviral agents are at increased risk for \nsevere and potentially fatal liver adverse events and may require blood tests for control of liver \nfunction. Speak with your doctor if you have a history of liver disease. \n \nBody fat \nCombination anti-retroviral therapy may cause changes in body shape due to changes in fat \ndistribution. These may include loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the abdomen \n(belly) and other internal organs, breast enlargement and fatty lumps on the back of the neck (\u2018buffalo \nhump\u2019). The cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time. Contact \nyour doctor if you notice changes in body fat. \n \nSigns of previous infections \nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and \nsymptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \nstarted. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body\u2019s immune response, \nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately.  \n \nBone disease (osteonecrosis) \nSome patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor immediately. \n \nTaking other medicines \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This \nincludes medicines that you buy without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is because Viracept \ncan affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect the way Viracept \nworks. \n \nDo not take Viracept and tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following \nmedicines: \n\u2022 Medicines made from ergot such as cabergoline, ergotamine or lisuride (for Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\nor migraine) \n\u2022 Herbal preparations containing St. John\u2019s Wort (for depression or improving your mood)  \n\u2022 Rifampicin (for tuberculosis (TB)) \n\u2022 Terfenadine or astemizole (for allergy) \n\u2022 Pimozide (used for mental health problems) \n\u2022 Amiodarone or quinidine (for an uneven heart beat) \n\u2022 Phenobarbital or carbamazepine (for fits or epilepsy) \n\u2022 Triazolam or oral midazolam taken by mouth (for anxiety or to help you sleep) \n\u2022 Cisapride (for heart burn or problems with your digestive system) \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n70 \n\n\u2022 Omeprazole (for ulcers in your stomach or gut) \n\u2022 Alfuzosin (for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)) \n\u2022 Sildenafil (for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)) \n\u2022 Simvastatin or lovastatin (for lowering blood cholesterol) \n \nDo not take Viracept and tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of these apply to you. If you are not \nsure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Viracept. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\u2022 Any other medicines for HIV infection such as ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir and delavirdine, \n\namprenavir, efavirenz or nevirapine \n\u2022 Oral contraceptives (the pill). Viracept can stop the pill from working, so you should use other \n\ncontraception methods (such as condoms) while you are taking Viracept. \n\u2022 Calcium channel blockers such as bepridil (for heart problems)  \n\u2022 Immunosuppressant medicines such as tacrolimus or ciclosporin \n\u2022 Medicines that lower stomach acid such as lansoprazole \n\u2022 Fluticasone (for hay fever) \n\u2022 Phenytoin (for fits or epilepsy) \n\u2022 Methadone (for drug dependence) \n\u2022 Sildenafil (for getting or keeping an erection) \n\u2022 Tadalafil (for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), or for getting or keeping an erection) \n\u2022 Vardenafil (for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), or for getting or keeping an erection) \n\u2022 Ketoconazole, itraconazole or fluconazole (for fungal infections) \n\u2022 Rifabutin, erythromycin or clarithromycin (for bacterial infections) \n\u2022 Midazolam given by injection or diazepam (for anxiety or to help you sleep) \n\u2022 Fluoxetine, paroxetine, imipramine, amitriptyline or trazodone (for depression) \n\u2022 Atorvastatin or other statins (for lowering blood cholesterol) \n\u2022 Salmeterol (for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \n\u2022 Warfarin (for lowering the chance of blood clots in your body) \n\u2022 Colchicine (for gout-flares or Mediterranean fever) \n\u2022 Bosentan (for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)) \nIf any of the above apply to you, or if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you \ntake Viracept.  \n \nTaking Viracept with food and drink \nTake Viracept with a meal. This helps your body to get the full benefit from your medicine. \n \nPregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor before you take Viracept if you are pregnant or planning to become \n\npregnant. \n\u2022 Do not breast-feed while taking Viracept because HIV may be passed to the baby. \n\u2022 Viracept can stop oral contraceptives (the pill) from working, so you should use other  \n\ncontraception methods (such as condoms) while you are taking Viracept. \n\u2022 Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nViracept is not likely to affect you being able to drive or use any tools or machines. \n \n \n3. HOW TO TAKE VIRACEPT \n \nAlways take Viracept exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are unsure. The usual doses are described below.

They should be swallowed whole and taken with a meal. \nFor adults or children unable to take tablets, Viracept tablets may be put into water and taken as \nfollows: \n\n\u2022 Put the tablets in a half cup of water and stir with a spoon.  \n\u2022 Once the tablet is dispersed, mix the cloudy bluish liquid thoroughly and take immediately.  \n\u2022 Rinse the glass with a half cup of water and swallow the rinse to ensure all of the dose is \n\ntaken.  \n \nAcidic food or juice (such as orange juice, apple juice or apple sauce) are not recommended to be \ntaken with Viracept because together they may have a bitter taste. \n \nAlternatively, Viracept 50 mg/g oral powder may be taken instead. If you want to take the powder \ninstead please see the Package Leaflet for Viracept 50 mg/g oral powder. \n \nTaking this medicine \n\u2022 Take Viracept with a meal.

inhibitor'. this belongs to a group of medicines called 'anti-retrovirals'. what viracept is used for viracept is used with other 'anti-retroviral' medicines to: work against the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). it helps to reduce the number of hiv particles in your blood. increase the number of some cells in your blood that help fight infection. these are called cd4 white blood cells. they are particularly reduced in numbers when you have hiv infection. this can lead to an increased risk of many types of infections. viracept is not a cure for hiv infection. you may continue to get infections or other illnesses due to your hiv. treatment with viracept does not stop you giving hiv to others through contact with blood or sexual contact. therefore you must keep taking appropriate precautions to avoid giving the virus to others when you are taking viracept.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "viracept", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0},

include loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the abdomen (belly) and other internal organs, breast enlargement and fatty lumps on the back of the neck ('buffalo hump'). the cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time. contact your doctor if you notice changes in body fat. signs of previous infections in some patients with advanced hiv infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-hiv treatment is started. it is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. if you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. bone disease (osteonecrosis) some patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). the length of combination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. if you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor immediately. taking other medicines tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. this includes

possible side effects", "Section_Content": "like all medicines, viracept can have side effects, although not everybody gets them. the following side effects may happen with this medicine. contact your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following side effects: allergic reactions. the signs may include difficulty in breathing, fever, itching, swelling of the face and skin rashes that can sometimes form blisters. increased bleeding if you have haemophilia. if you have haemophilia type a or b, in rare cases your bleeding may increase. bone disease (osteonecrosis). the signs may include joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. some patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). infection. in some patients with advanced hiv infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-hiv treatment is started. it is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. if you notice any of the above, contact your doctor straight away. other possible side effects, where you should talk to your doctor if you get any of the side effects on this list, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor. very common (affect more than 1 in 10 people): diarrhoea. common (affect less than 1 in 10 people): rash. wind. feeling sick. low numbers of a type of white blood cell that fights infections (neutrophils). abnormal results from blood tests that measure how well your liver or muscles are working. uncommon (affect less than 1 in 100 people): being sick. pancreatitis. the signs include severe pains in your stomach that spread to your back. combination anti-retroviral therapy may cause changes in body shape due to changes in fat distribution. these may include loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the abdomen (belly) and other internal organs, breast enlargement and fatty lumps on the back of the neck ('buffalo hump'). the cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time. rare (affect less than 1 in 1000 people): yellow skin or eyes. this could be a sign of a liver problem such as hepatitis or jaundice. a severe form of rash (erythema multiforme). swelling of your belly (abdomen). high blood sugar (diabetes) or diabetes get worse. there have been rare reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly with combination anti-retroviral therapy including protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues. on rare occasions these muscle problems have been serious causing muscle degeneration (rhabdomyolysis). other side effects which have also been reported: combination anti-retroviral therapy may also cause raised lactic acid and sugar in the blood, hyperlipaemia (increased fats in the blood) and resistance to insulin. low numbers of red blood cells (anaemia). lung disease (pneumonia). cases of diabetes mellitus or increased blood sugar levels have been reported in patients receiving this treatment or another protease inhibitor. side effects in children about 400 children (aged from 0 to 13 years) received viracept in clinical trials. the side effects seen in children are similar to those seen in adults. the most commonly reported side effect in children is diarrhoea. the side effects only rarely resulted into having to stop taking viracept.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "viracept", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0},
