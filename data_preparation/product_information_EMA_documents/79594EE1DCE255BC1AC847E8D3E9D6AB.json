NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nOrgalutran 0.25 mg/0.5 mL solution for injection\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 0.25 mg of ganirelix in 0.5 mL aqueous solution. The active substance \nganirelix (INN) is a synthetic decapeptide with high antagonistic activity to the naturally occurring \ngonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH). The amino acids at positions 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 and 10 of the \nnatural GnRH decapeptide have been substituted resulting in N-Ac-D-Nal(2)1, D-pClPhe2, D-Pal(3)3, \nD-hArg(Et2)6, L-hArg(Et2)8, D-Ala10]-GnRH with a molecular weight of 1570.4.\n\nExcipient with known effect:\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection.\n\nClear and colourless aqueous solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nOrgalutran is indicated for the prevention of premature luteinising hormone (LH) surges in women \nundergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for assisted reproduction techniques (ART).\n\nIn clinical studies Orgalutran was used with recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) \nor corifollitropin alfa, the sustained follicle stimulant.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nOrgalutran should only be prescribed by a specialist experienced in the treatment of infertility.\n\nPosology\n\nOrgalutran is used to prevent premature LH surges in women undergoing COH. Controlled ovarian \nhyperstimulation with FSH or corifollitropin alfa may start at day 2 or 3 of menses. Orgalutran \n(0.25 mg) should be injected subcutaneously once daily, starting on day 5 or day 6 of FSH \nadministration or on day 5 or day 6 following the administration of corifollitropin alfa. The starting \nday of Orgalutran is depending on the ovarian response, i.e. the number and size of growing follicles \nand/or the amount of circulating oestradiol. The start of Orgalutran may be delayed in absence of \nfollicular growth, although clinical experience is based on starting Orgalutran on day 5 or day 6 of \nstimulation.\n\nOrgalutran and FSH should be administered approximately at the same time. However, the\npreparations should not be mixed and different injection sites are to be used.\nFSH dose adjustments should be based on the number and size of growing follicles, rather than on the \namount of circulating oestradiol (see section 5.1).\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nDaily treatment with Orgalutran should be continued up to the day that sufficient follicles of adequate \nsize are present. Final maturation of follicles can be induced by administering human chorionic \ngonadotrophin (hCG). \n\nTiming of last injection\nBecause of the half-life of ganirelix, the time between two Orgalutran injections as well as the time \nbetween the last Orgalutran injection and the hCG injection should not exceed 30 hours, as otherwise a \npremature LH surge may occur. Therefore, when injecting Orgalutran in the morning, treatment with \nOrgalutran should be continued throughout the gonadotrophin treatment period including the day of \ntriggering ovulation. When injecting Orgalutran in the afternoon the last Orgalutran injection should \nbe given in the afternoon prior to the day of triggering ovulation.\n\nOrgalutran has shown to be safe and effective in women undergoing multiple treatment cycles.\n\nThe need for luteal phase support in cycles using Orgalutran has not been studied. In clinical studies, \nluteal phase support was given according to study centres’ practice or according to the clinical \nprotocol.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nThere is no experience on the use of Orgalutran in subjects with renal impairment, as they were \nexcluded from clinical studies. Therefore, the use of Orgalutran is contraindicated in patients with \nmoderate or severe renal impairment (see section 4.3).\n\nHepatic impairment \nThere is no experience on the use of Orgalutran in subjects with hepatic impairment, as they were \nexcluded from clinical studies. Therefore, the use of Orgalutran is contraindicated in patients with \nmoderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of Orgalutran in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOrgalutran should be administered subcutaneously, preferably in the upper leg. The injection site \nshould be varied to prevent lipoatrophy. The patient or her partner may perform the injections of \nOrgalutran themselves, provided that they are adequately instructed and have access to expert advice. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n Hypersensitivity to gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or any other GnRH analogue.\n Moderate or severe impairment of renal or hepatic function.\n Pregnancy or breast-feeding.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypersensitivity reaction\n\nSpecial care should be taken in women with signs and symptoms of active allergic conditions. Cases \nof hypersensitivity reactions (both generalised and local), have been reported with Orgalutran, as early \nas with the first dose, during post-marketing surveillance. These events have included anaphylaxis \n(including anaphylactic shock), angioedema and urticaria (see section 4.8). If a hypersensitivity \nreaction is suspected, Orgalutran should be discontinued and appropriate treatment administered. In \n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nthe absence of clinical experience, Orgalutran treatment is not advised in women with severe allergic \nconditions.\n\nLatex allergy\n\nThe needle cover contains dry natural rubber/latex which comes into contact with the needle and may \ncause allergic reactions (see section 6.5).\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) may occur during or following ovarian stimulation. \nOHSS must be considered an intrinsic risk of gonadotrophin stimulation. OHSS should be treated \nsymptomatically, e.g. with rest, intravenous infusion of electrolyte solutions or colloids and heparin.\n\nEctopic pregnancy\n\nSince infertile women undergoing assisted reproduction, and particularly in vitro fertilisation (IVF), \noften have tubal abnormalities the incidence of ectopic pregnancies might be increased. Early \nultrasound confirmation that a pregnancy is intrauterine is therefore important.\n\nCongenital malformations\n\nThe incidence of congenital malformations after Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) may be \nhigher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental \ncharacteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and an increased incidence of multiple \ngestations. In clinical studies investigating more than 1,000 newborns it has been demonstrated that \nthe incidence of congenital malformations in children born after COH treatment using Orgalutran is \ncomparable with that reported after COH treatment using a GnRH agonist.\n\nWomen weighing less than 50 kg or more than 90 kg\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Orgalutran have not been established in women weighing less than 50 kg or \nmore than 90 kg (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).\n\nSodium\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed.\n\nThe possibility of interactions with commonly used medicinal products, including histamine liberating \nmedicinal products, cannot be excluded.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of ganirelix in pregnant women.\nIn animals, exposure to ganirelix at the time of implantation resulted in litter resorption (see \nsection 5.3). The relevance of these data for humans is unknown. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether ganirelix is excreted in breast milk.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nThe use of Orgalutran is contraindicated during pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.3).\n\nFertility\n\nGanirelix is used in the treatment of women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in \nassisted reproduction programmes. Ganirelix is used to prevent premature LH surges that might \notherwise occur in these women during the ovarian stimulation.\nFor posology and method of administration, see section 4.2.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe table below shows all adverse reactions in women treated with Orgalutran in clinical studies using \nrecFSH for ovarian stimulation. The adverse reactions with Orgalutran using corifollitropin alfa for \novarian stimulation are expected to be similar.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe adverse reactions are classified according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency; very \ncommon (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). The frequency of \nhypersensitivity reactions (very rare, < 1/10,000) has been deduced from post-marketing surveillance.\n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction\nImmune system disorders Very rare Hypersensitivity reactions (including rash, facial \n\nswelling, dyspnoea, anaphylaxis (including \nanaphylactic shock), angioedema and urticaria)1\n\nWorsening of a pre-existing eczema2\n\nNervous system disorders Uncommon Headache\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon Nausea\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nVery common Local skin reaction at the site of injection \n(predominantly redness, with or without swelling)3\n\nUncommon Malaise\n1 Cases have been reported, as early as with the first dose, among patients administered Orgalutran.\n2 Reported in one subject after the first Orgalutran dose.\n3 In clinical studies, one hour after injection, the incidence of at least once a moderate or severe local\nskin reaction per treatment cycle, as reported by patients, was 12 % in Orgalutran treated patients and \n25 % in patients treated subcutaneously with a GnRH agonist. The local reactions generally disappear \nwithin 4 hours after administration.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nOther reported adverse reactions are related to the controlled ovarian hyperstimulation treatment for \nART, notably pelvic pain, abdominal distension, OHSS (see section 4.4), ectopic pregnancy and \nspontaneous abortion.\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nOverdose in humans may result in a prolonged duration of action. \nNo data on acute toxicity of Orgalutran in humans are available. Clinical studies with subcutaneous\nadministration of Orgalutran at single doses up to 12 mg did not show systemic adverse reactions. In \nacute toxicity studies in rats and monkeys non-specific toxic symptoms such as hypotension and \nbradycardia were only observed after intravenous administration of ganirelix over 1 and 3 mg/kg, \nrespectively.\nIn case of overdose, Orgalutran treatment should be (temporarily) discontinued.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, \nanti-gonadotrophin-releasing hormones, ATC code: H01CC01.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nOrgalutran is a GnRH antagonist, which modulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by \ncompetitive binding to the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. As a result a rapid, profound, \nreversible suppression of endogenous gonadotrophins occurs, without initial stimulation as induced by \nGnRH agonists. Following administration of multiple doses of 0.25 mg Orgalutran to female \nvolunteers serum LH, FSH and E2 concentrations were maximally decreased by 74 %, 32 % and 25 % \nat 4, 16 and 16 hours after injection, respectively. Serum hormone levels returned to pre-treatment \nvalues within two days after the last injection.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nIn patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation the median duration of Orgalutran treatment was \n5 days. During Orgalutran treatment the average incidence of LH rises (> 10 IU/L) with concomitant \nprogesterone rise (> 1 ng/mL) was 0.3 - 1.2 % compared to 0.8 % during GnRH agonist treatment. \nThere was a tendency towards an increased incidence of LH and progesterone rises in women with a \nhigher body weight (> 80 kg), but no effect on clinical outcome was observed. However, based on the \nsmall number of patients treated so far, an effect cannot be excluded. \nIn case of a high ovarian response, either as a result of a high exposure to gonadotrophins in the early \nfollicular phase or as a result of high ovarian responsiveness, premature LH rises may occur earlier \nthan day 6 of stimulation. Initiation of Orgalutran treatment on day 5 can prevent these premature LH \nrises without compromising the clinical outcome.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nIn controlled studies of Orgalutran with FSH, using a long protocol of GnRH agonist as a reference, \ntreatment with the Orgalutran regimen resulted in a faster follicular growth during the first days of \nstimulation but the final cohort of growing follicles was slightly smaller and produced on average less \noestradiol. This different pattern of follicular growth requires that FSH dose adjustments are based on \nthe number and size of growing follicles, rather than on the amount of circulating oestradiol. Similar \ncomparative studies with corifollitropin alfa using either a GnRH antagonist or long agonist protocol \nhave not been performed.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters after multiple subcutaneous dosing of Orgalutran (once daily injection) \nwere similar to those after a single subcutaneous dose. After repeated dosing 0.25 mg/day steady-state \nlevels of approximately 0.6 ng/mL were reached within 2 to 3 days.\n\nPharmacokinetic analysis indicates an inverse relationship between body weight and serum \nconcentrations of Orgalutran.\n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter a single subcutaneous administration of 0.25 mg, serum levels of ganirelix rise rapidly and reach \npeak levels (Cmax) of approximately 15 ng/mL within 1 to 2 hours (tmax). The bioavailability of \nOrgalutran following subcutaneous administration is approximately 91 %.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nThe major circulating component in plasma is ganirelix. Ganirelix is also the main compound found in \nurine. Faeces only contain metabolites. The metabolites are small peptide fragments formed by \nenzymatic hydrolysis of ganirelix at restricted sites. The metabolite profile of Orgalutran in humans \nwas similar to that found in animals.\n\nElimination\n\nThe elimination half-life (t½) is approximately 13 hours and clearance is approximately 2.4 L/h. \nExcretion occurs via faeces (approximately 75 %) and urine (approximately 22 %). \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on safety pharmacology, repeated dose \ntoxicity and genotoxicity.\n\nReproduction studies carried out with ganirelix at doses of 0.1 to 10 g/kg/day subcutaneously in the \nrat and 0.1 to 50 g/kg/day subcutaneously in the rabbit showed increased litter resorption in the \nhighest dose groups.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Orgalutran is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Orgalutran\n3. How to use Orgalutran\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Orgalutran\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Orgalutran is and what it is used for\n\nOrgalutran contains the active substance ganirelix and belongs to a group of medicines called “anti-\ngonadotrophin-releasing hormones” which act against the actions of the natural gonadotrophin \nreleasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH regulates the release of gonadotrophins (luteinising hormone (LH) \nand follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)). Gonadotrophins play an important role in human fertility and \nreproduction. In women, FSH is needed for the growth and development of follicles in the ovaries. \nFollicles are small round sacs that contain the egg cells. LH is needed to release the mature egg cells \nfrom the follicles and ovaries (i.e. ovulation). Orgalutran inhibits the action of GnRH, resulting in \nsuppression of the release of especially LH.\n\nOrgalutran is used for\n\nIn women undergoing assisted reproduction techniques, including in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and other \nmethods, occasionally ovulation may occur too early causing a significant reduction in the chance of \ngetting pregnant. Orgalutran is used to prevent the premature LH surge that might cause such a \npremature release of egg cells.\n\nIn clinical studies Orgalutran was used with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or \ncorifollitropin alfa, a follicle stimulant with a long duration of action.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Orgalutran\n\nDo not use Orgalutran\n if you are allergic to ganirelix or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6);\n if you are hypersensitive to gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) or a GnRH analogue;\n if you have a moderate or severe kidney or liver disease;\n if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\n \n\n\n\n18\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Orgalutran\n\nAllergic reactions\n\nIf you have an active allergic condition, please tell your doctor. Your doctor will decide, depending on \nthe severity, if additional monitoring is required during treatment. Cases of allergic reactions have \nbeen reported, as early as with the first dose.\n\nAllergic reactions, both generalised and local, including hives (urticaria), swelling of the face, lips \ntongue and/or throat that may cause difficulty in breathing and/or swallowing (angioedema and/or \nanaphylaxis) have been reported. (See also section 4.) If you have an allergic reaction, stop taking \nOrgalutran and seek immediate medical assistance.\n\nLatex allergy\n\nThe needle cover contains dry natural rubber/latex which comes into contact with the needle and may\ncause allergic reactions.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\n\nDuring or following hormonal stimulation of the ovaries, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome may \ndevelop. This syndrome is related to the stimulation procedure with gonadotrophins. Please refer to the \nPackage Leaflet of the gonadotrophin-containing medicine prescribed for you.\n\nMultiple births or birth defects\n\nThe incidence of congenital malformations after assisted reproduction techniques may be slightly \nhigher than after spontaneous conceptions. This slightly higher incidence is thought to be related to \ncharacteristics of the patients undergoing fertility treatment (e.g. age of the woman, sperm \ncharacteristics) and to the higher incidence of multiple gestations after assisted reproduction\ntechniques. The incidence of congenital malformations after assisted reproduction techniques using \nOrgalutran is not different from that after using other GnRH analogues in the course of assisted \nreproduction techniques.\n\nPregnancy complications\n\nThere is a slightly increased risk of pregnancy outside of the uterus (an ectopic pregnancy) in women \nwith damaged fallopian tubes.\n\nWomen weighing less than 50 kg or more than 90 kg\n\nThe efficacy and safety of Orgalutran has not been established in women weighing less than 50 kg or \nmore than 90 kg. Ask your doctor for further information.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThere is no relevant use of Orgalutran in children or adolescents.\n\nOther medicines and Orgalutran\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nOrgalutran should be used during controlled ovarian stimulation for assisted reproduction techniques \n(ART). Do not use Orgalutran during pregnancy and breast-feeding.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\n \n\n\n\n19\n\nDriving and using machines\nThe effects of Orgalutran on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied.\n\nOrgalutran contains sodium\nOrgalutran contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’.\n\n3. How to use Orgalutran\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\nOrgalutran is used as part of the treatment for assisted reproduction techniques (ART) including \nin vitro fertilisation (IVF).\nOvarian stimulation with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or corifollitropin may start at day 2 or 3 \nof your period. Orgalutran (0.25 mg) should be injected just under the skin once daily, starting on day \n5 or day 6 of stimulation. Based on your ovarian response, your doctor may decide to start on another \nday. \nOrgalutran and FSH should be administered approximately at the same time. However, the \npreparations should not be mixed and different injection sites are to be used.\n\nDaily treatment with Orgalutran should be continued up to the day that sufficient follicles of adequate \nsize are present. Final maturation of the egg cells in the follicles can be induced by administering \nhuman chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). The time between two Orgalutran injections as well as the\ntime between the last Orgalutran injection and hCG injection should not exceed 30 hours, as otherwise \na premature ovulation (i.e. release of egg cells) may occur. Therefore, when injecting Orgalutran in the \nmorning treatment with Orgalutran should be continued throughout the gonadotrophin treatment \nperiod including the day of triggering ovulation. When injecting Orgalutran in the afternoon the last \nOrgalutran injection should be given in the afternoon prior to the day of triggering ovulation. \n\nInstructions for use\n\nInjection site\nOrgalutran is supplied in pre-filled syringes and should be injected slowly, just under the skin, \npreferably in the upper leg. Inspect the solution before use. Do not use if the solution contains particles \nor is not clear. If you administer the injections yourself or have it done by your partner, follow the \ninstructions below carefully. Do not mix Orgalutran with any other medicines.\n\nPreparing the injection site\nWash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Swab the injection site with a disinfectant (for \nexample alcohol) to remove any surface bacteria. Clean about 5 cm (two inches) around the point \nwhere the needle will go in and let the disinfectant dry for at least one minute before proceeding.\n\nInserting the needle\nRemove needle cover. Pinch up a large area of skin between finger and thumb. Insert the needle at the \nbase of the pinched-up skin at an angle of 45° to the skin surface. Vary the injection site with each \ninjection.\n\nChecking the correct needle position\nGently draw back the plunger to check if the needle is positioned correctly. Any blood drawn into the \nsyringe means the needle tip has penetrated a blood vessel. If this happens, do not inject Orgalutran, \nbut remove the syringe, cover the injection site with a swab containing disinfectant and apply pressure; \nbleeding should stop in a minute or two. Do not use this syringe and dispose of it properly. Start again \nwith a new syringe.\n\n \n\n\n\n20\n\nInjecting the solution\nOnce the needle has been correctly placed, depress the plunger slowly and steadily, so the solution is \ncorrectly injected and the skin tissues are not damaged.\n\nRemoving the syringe\nPull the syringe out quickly and apply pressure to the site with a swab containing disinfectant.\nUse the pre-filled syringe only once.\n\nIf you use more Orgalutran than you should\nContact your doctor.\n\nIf you forget to use Orgalutran\nIf you realise that you forgot a dose, administer it as soon as possible.\nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\nIf you are more than 6 hours late (so the time between two injections is longer than 30 hours) \nadminister the dose as soon as possible and contact your doctor for further advice.\n\nIf you stop using Orgalutran\nDo not stop using Orgalutran unless advised to by your doctor, as this may affect the outcome of your \ntreatment.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nThe chance of having a side effect is described by the following categories:\n\nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 women\n Local skin reactions at the site of injection (predominantly redness, with or without swelling). The \n\nlocal reaction normally disappears within 4 hours of administration. \n\nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 women\n Headache\n Nausea\n Malaise \n\nVery rare: may affect up to 1 in 10,000 women\n Allergic reactions have been observed, as early as with the first dose.\n\n Rash\n Facial swelling\n Difficulty breathing (dyspnoea)\n Swelling of face, lips, tongue, and/or throat that may cause difficulty in breathing and/or \n\nswallowing (angioedema and/or anaphylaxis)\n Hives (urticaria)\n\n Worsening of a pre-existing rash (eczema) has been reported in one subject after the first \nOrgalutran dose. \n\nIn addition, side effects are reported which are known to occur with controlled ovarian \nhyperstimulation treatment (e.g. abdominal pain, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), ectopic \npregnancy (when the embryo develops outside the womb) and miscarriage (see the patient information \nleaflet of the FSH-containing preparation you are treated with)).\n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine.\n\n5. How to store Orgalutran\n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label after \n‘EXP’. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.\n\nDo not freeze.\nStore in the original package, in order to protect from light.\n\nInspect the syringe before use. Use only syringes with clear, particle-free solutions and from \nundamaged containers.\n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.\n\n6.
