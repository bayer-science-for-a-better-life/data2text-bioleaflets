Patients with little or no \ninherited TPMT activity are at increased risk for severe toxicity from conventional doses of \nmercaptopurine and generally require substantial dose reduction. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping \ncan be used to identify patients with absent or reduced TPMT activity. TPMT testing cannot substitute \nfor haematological monitoring in patients receiving Xaluprine. The optimal starting dose for \nhomozygous deficient patients has not been established (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \nNo specific studies have been carried out in the elderly. However, it is advisable to monitor renal and \nhepatic function in these patients, and if there is any impairment, consideration should be given to \nreducing the Xaluprine dose. \n\nRenal impairment \nSince 6-mercaptopurine pharmacokinetics has not been formally studied in renal impairment, no \nspecific dose recommendations can be given. Since impaired renal function may result in slower \nelimination of mercaptopurine and its metabolites and therefore a greater cumulative effect, \nconsideration should be given to reduced starting doses in patients with impaired renal function. \nPatients should be closely monitored for dose related adverse reactions. \n\nHepatic impairment \nSince 6-mercaptopurine pharmacokinetics has not been formally studied in hepatic impairment, no \nspecific dose recommendations can be given. Since there is a potential for reduced elimination of \nmercaptopurine, consideration should be given to reduced starting doses in patients with impaired \nhepatic function. Patients should be closely monitored for dose related adverse reactions (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nSwitching between tablet and oral suspension and vice versa \nA tablet form of 6-mercaptopurine is also available. The 6-mecaptopurine oral suspension and tablet \nare not bioequivalent with respect to peak plasma concentration, and therefore intensified \nhaematological monitoring of the patient is advised on switching formulations (see section 5.2). \n\nCombination with xanthine oxidase inhibitors \nAllopurinol and other xanthine oxidase inhibitors decrease the rate of catabolism of 6-mercaptopurine.  \nWhen allopurinol and 6-mercaptopurine are administered concomitantly it is essential that only a \nquarter of the usual dose of 6-mercaptopurine is given. Other xanthine oxidase inhibitors should be \navoided (see section 4.5). \n\nPatients with NUDT15 variant \nPatients with inherited mutated NUDT15 gene are at increased risk for severe 6-mercaptopurine \ntoxicity, (see 4.4). These patients generally require dose reduction; particularly those being NUDT15 \nvariant homozygotes (see 4.4). Genotypic testing of NUDT15 variants may be considered before \ninitiating 6-mercaptopurine therapy. In any case, close monitoring of blood counts is necessary. \n\nMethod of administration \nXaluprine is for oral use and requires redispersing (by shaking vigorously at least for 30 seconds) prior \nto dosing. \n\nTwo dosing syringes (a purple syringe graduated to 1 ml and a white syringe graduated to 5 ml) are \nprovided for accurate measurement of the prescribed dose of the oral suspension. It is recommended \nthat the healthcare professional advises the patient or carer which syringe to use to ensure that the \ncorrect volume is administered. \n\nXaluprine may be taken with food or on an empty stomach, but patients should standardise the method \nof administration. The dose should not be taken with milk or dairy products (see section 4.5).  \nXaluprine should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after milk or dairy products. \n\n6-mercaptopurine displays diurnal variation in pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Administration in the\nevening compared to morning administration may lower the risk of relapse. Therefore the daily dose\nof Xaluprine should be taken in the evening.\n\nTo assist accurate and consistent dose delivery to the stomach water should be taken after each dose of \nXaluprine. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nConcomitant use with yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCytotoxicity and haematological monitoring \nTreatment with 6-mercaptopurine causes bone marrow suppression leading to leucopenia and \nthrombocytopenia and, less frequently, to anaemia. Careful monitoring of haematological parameters \nshould be conducted during therapy. The leucocyte and platelet counts continue to fall after treatment \nis stopped, so at the first sign of an abnormally large fall in the counts, treatment should be interrupted \nimmediately. Bone marrow suppression is reversible if 6-mercaptopurine is withdrawn early enough. \n \nThere are individuals with an inherited deficiency of the TPMT enzyme activity who are very \nsensitive to the myelosuppresive effect of 6-mercaptopurine and prone to developing rapid bone \nmarrow depression following the initiation of treatment with 6-mercaptopurine. This problem could be \nexacerbated by coadministration with active substances that inhibit TPMT, such as olsalazine, \nmesalazine or sulfasalazine. Some laboratories offer testing for TPMT deficiency, although these tests \nhave not been shown to identify all patients at risk of severe toxicity. Therefore close monitoring of \nblood counts is necessary. Substantial dose reductions are generally required for homozygous-TPMT \ndeficiency patients to avoid the development of life threatening bone marrow suppression. \n \nA possible association between decreased TPMT activity and secondary leukaemias and \nmyelodysplasia has been reported in individuals receiving 6-mercaptopurine in combination with other \ncytotoxics (see section 4.8). \n \nImmunosuppression \nImmunisation using a live organism vaccine has the potential to cause infection in \nimmunocompromised hosts. Therefore, immunisations with live organism vaccines are not \nrecommended. \n \nHepatotoxicity \nXaluprine is hepatotoxic and liver function tests should be monitored weekly during treatment. More \nfrequent monitoring may be advisable in those with pre-existing liver disease or receiving other \npotentially hepatotoxic therapy. The patient should be instructed to discontinue Xaluprine immediately \nif jaundice becomes apparent (see section 4.8).  \n \nRenal toxicity \nDuring remission induction when rapid cell lysis is occurring, uric acid levels in blood and urine \nshould be monitored as hyperuricaemia and/or hyperuricosuria may develop, with the risk of uric acid \nnephropathy. Hydration and urine alkalinisation may minimize potential renal complications. \n \nPancreatitis in off-label treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease \nPancreatitis has been reported to occur at a frequency of ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 (“common”) in patients \ntreated for the unlicensed indication inflammatory bowel disease.  \n \nMutagenicity and carcinogenicity \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including mercaptopurine, are at an increased risk of \ndeveloping lymphoproliferative disorders and other malignancies, notably skin cancers (melanoma \nand non-melanoma), sarcomas (Kaposi's and non-Kaposi's) and uterine cervical cancer in situ. The \nincreased risk appears to be related to the degree and duration of immunosuppression. It has been \nreported that discontinuation of immunosuppression may provide partial regression of the \nlymphoproliferative disorder. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nA treatment regimen containing multiple immunosuppressants (including thiopurines) should therefore \nbe used with caution as this could lead to lymphoproliferative disorders, some with reported fatalities. \nA combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the risk of \nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. \n\nIncreases in chromosomal aberrations were observed in the peripheral lymphocytes of leukaemic \npatients, in a renal cell carcinoma patient who received an unstated dose of 6-mercaptopurine and in \npatients with chronic renal disease treated at doses of 0.4 – 1.0 mg/kg/day.  \n\nIn view of its action on cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 6-mercaptopurine is potentially \ncarcinogenic and consideration should be given to the theoretical risk of carcinogenesis with this \ntreatment.  \n\nHepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease* \ntreated with azathioprine (the prodrug to 6-mercaptopurine) or 6-mercaptopurine, either with or \nwithout concomitant treatment with anti-TNF alpha antibody. This rare type of T cell lymphoma has \nan aggressive disease course and is usually fatal (see also section 4.8). \n*inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an unlicensed indication\n\nMacrophage activation syndrome \nMacrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in \npatients with autoimmune conditions, in particular with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (unlicensed \nindication), and there could potentially be an increased susceptibility for developing the condition with \nthe use of mercaptopurine. If MAS occurs, or is suspected, evaluation and treatment should be started \nas early as possible, and treatment with mercaptopurine should be discontinued. Physicians should be \nattentive to symptoms of infection such as EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV), as these are known \ntriggers for MAS. \n\nInfections \nPatients treated with 6-mercaptopurine alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents, \nincluding corticosteroids, have shown increased susceptibility to viral, fungal and bacterial infections, \nincluding severe or atypical infection, and viral reactivation. The infectious disease and complications \nmay be more severe in these patients than in non-treated patients. \n\nPrior exposure to or infection with varicella zoster virus should be taken into consideration prior to \nstarting treatment. Local guidelines may be considered, including prophylactic therapy if necessary. \nSerologic testing prior to starting treatment should be considered with respect to hepatitis B. Local \nguidelines may be considered, including prophylactic therapy for cases which have been confirmed \npositive by serologic testing. Cases of neutropenic sepsis have been reported in patients receiving \n6-mercaptopurine for ALL.\n\nPatients with NUDT15 variant \nPatients with inherited mutated NUDT15 gene are at increased risk for severe 6-mercaptopurine \ntoxicity, such as early leukopenia and alopecia, from conventional doses of thiopurine therapy. They \ngenerally require dose reduction, particularly those being NUDT15 variant homozygotes (see 4.2). \nThe frequency of NUDT15 c.415C>T has an ethnic variability of approximately 10 % in East Asians, \n4 % in Hispanics, 0.2 % in Europeans and 0 % in Africans. In any case, close monitoring of blood \ncounts is necessary. \n\nPaediatric population \nCases of symptomatic hypoglycaemia have been reported in children with ALL receiving \n6-mercaptopurine (see section 4.8). The majority of reported cases were in children under the age of\nsix or with a low body mass index.\n\nInteractions \nWhen oral anticoagulants are coadministered with 6-mercaptopurine, a reinforced monitoring of INR \n(International Normalised Ratio) is recommended (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nExcipients  \nThis medicinal product contains aspartame (E951), a source of phenylalanine. May be harmful for \npeople with phenylketonuria. Neither non-clinical nor clinical data are available to assess aspartame \nuse in infants below 12 weeks of age. \n \nIt also contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate and sodium ethyl parahydroxybenzoate which \nmay cause allergic reaction (possibly delayed). \n \nThis medicine contains sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, \nglucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. \nLong term use increases the risk of dental caries and it is essential that adequate dental hygiene is \nmaintained. \n \nSafe handling of the suspension  \nParents and care givers should avoid Xaluprine contact with skin or mucous membrane. If the \nsuspension comes into contact with skin or mucosa, it should be washed immediately and thoroughly \nwith soap and water (see section 6.6). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe administration of 6-mercaptopurine with food may decrease systemic exposure slightly but this is \nunlikely to be of clinical significance. Therefore, Xaluprine may be taken with food or on an empty \nstomach, but patients should standardise the method of administration. The dose should not be taken \nwith milk or dairy products since they contain xanthine oxidase, an enzyme which metabolises 6–\nmercaptopurine and might therefore lead to reduced plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine. \n \nEffects of mercaptopurine on other medicinal products \nConcomitant administration of yellow fever vaccine is contraindicated, due to the risk of fatal disease \nin immunocompromised patients (see section 4.3). \n \nVaccinations with other live organism vaccines are not recommended in immunocompromised \nindividuals (see section 4.4).  \n \nInhibition of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, when given with 6-mercaptopurine, has been \nreported. Monitoring of the INR (International Normalised Ratio) value is recommended during \nconcomitant administration with oral anticoagulants. \n \nCytotoxic agents may decrease the intestinal absorption of phenytoin. Careful monitoring of the \nphenytoin serum levels is recommended. It is possible that the levels of other anti-epileptic medicinal \nproducts may also be altered. Serum antiepileptic levels should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith Xaluprine, making dose adjustments as necessary. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on mercaptopurine \nWhen allopurinol and Xaluprine are administered concomitantly it is essential that only a quarter of \nthe usual dose of Xaluprine is given since allopurinol decreases the rate of metabolism of \n6-mercaptopurine  via xanthine oxidase. Also other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as febuxostat, \nmay decrease the metabolism of mercaptopurine and concomitant administration is not recommended \nas data are insufficient to determine an adequate dose reduction. \n \nAs there is in vitro evidence that aminosalicylate derivatives (eg. olsalazine, mesalazine or \nsulfazalazine) inhibit the TPMT enzyme, which metabolises 6-mercaptopurine, they should be \nadministered with caution to patients receiving concurrent Xaluprine therapy (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \n\n\n\n8 \n\nEvidence of the teratogenicity of 6-mercaptopurine in humans is equivocal. Both sexually active men \nand women should use effective methods of contraception during treatment and for at least three \nmonths after receiving the last dose. Animal studies indicate embryotoxic and embryolethal effects \n(see section 5.3). \n \nPregnancy \nXaluprine should not be given to patients who are pregnant or likely to become pregnant without \ncareful assessment of risk versus benefit. \n \nThere have been reports of premature birth and low birth weight following maternal exposure to \n6-mercaptopurine. There have also been reports of congenital abnormalities and spontaneous abortion \nfollowing either maternal or paternal exposure. Multiple congenital abnormalities have been reported \nfollowing maternal 6-mercatopurine treatment in combination with other chemotherapy agents. \n \nA more recent epidemiological report suggests that there is no increased risk of preterm births, low \nbirth weight at term, or congenital abnormalities in women exposed to mercaptopurine during \npregnancy. \n \nIt is recommended that newborns of women exposed to mercaptopurine during pregnancy are \nmonitored for haematological and immune system disturbances. \n \nBreast-feeding \n6-mercaptopurine has been identified in the colostrum and breast-milk of women receiving \nazathioprine treatment and thus women receiving Xaluprine should not breast-feed. \n \nFertility \nThe effect of 6-mercaptopurine therapy on human fertility is unknown but there are reports of \nsuccessful fatherhood/motherhood after receiving treatment during childhood or adolescence. \nTransient profound oligospermia has been reported following exposure to 6-mercaptopurine in \ncombination with corticosteroids. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. A detrimental \neffect on these activities cannot be predicted from the pharmacology of the active substance. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe main adverse reaction of treatment with 6-mercaptopurine is bone marrow suppression leading to \nleucopenia and thrombocytopenia. \n \nFor mercaptopurine there is a lack of modern clinical documentation which can serve as support for \naccurately determining the frequency of adverse reactions. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following events have been identified as adverse reactions. The adverse reactions are displayed by \nsystem organ class and frequency: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(≥1/1000 to < 1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nInfections and infestations Uncommon Bacterial and viral infections, infections associated with \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nneutropenia \n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant \nand unspecified (including \ncysts and polyps) \n\nRare \n\nNeoplasms including \nlymphoproliferative \ndisorders, skin cancers \n(melanomas and \nnon-melanomas), sarcomas \n(Kaposi's and non-Kaposi's) \nand uterine cervical cancer in \nsitu (see section 4.4) \n\nVery rare Secondary leukaemia and myelodysplasia \n\nUnknown Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma* (see section 4.4) \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nVery common \nBone marrow suppression; \nleucopenia and \nthrombocytopenia \n\nCommon Anaemia \n\nImmune system disorders \nUncommon Arthralgia, skin rash, drug fever \nRare Facial oedema \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nCommon Anorexia \nUnknown Hypoglycaemia† \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon Stomatitis, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea  \nUncommon Pancreatitis, oral ulceration \nVery rare Intestinal ulceration \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nCommon Biliary stasis, hepatotoxicity \nUncommon Hepatic necrosis \n\nUnknown \n\nPortal hypertension*, nodular \nregenerative hyperplasia*, \nsinusoidal obstruction \nsyndrome*  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRare Alopecia \nUnknown Photosensitivity reaction \n\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders Rare Transient oligospermia \n\n* In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), an unlicensed indication. \n† In the paediatric population. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \n6-mercaptopurine is hepatotoxic in animals and man. The histological findings in man have shown \nhepatic necrosis and biliary stasis  \n \nThe incidence of hepatotoxicity varies considerably and can occur with any dose but more frequently \nwhen the recommended dose is exceeded.  \n \nMonitoring of liver function tests may allow early detection of hepatotoxicity. This is usually \nreversible if 6-mercaptopurine therapy is stopped soon enough but fatal liver damage has occurred.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n\n\n10 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nSymptoms and signs \nGastrointestinal effects, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea and anorexia may be early \nsymptoms of overdose having occurred. The principal toxic effect is on the bone marrow, resulting in \nmyelosuppression. Haematological toxicity is likely to be more profound with chronic overdose than \nwith a single ingestion of Xaluprine. Liver dysfunction and gastroenteritis may also occur.  \nThe risk of overdose is also increased when xanthine oxidase inhibitors is being given concomitantly \nwith 6-mercaptopurine (see section 4.5).  \n\nManagement \nAs there is no known antidote the blood picture should be closely monitored and general supportive \nmeasures, together with appropriate blood transfusion, instituted if necessary. Active measures (such \nas the use of activated charcoal or gastric lavage) may not be effective in the event of \n6-mercaptopurine overdose unless the procedure can be undertaken within 60 minutes of ingestion.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, purine analogues, ATC \ncode: L01BB02 \n\nMechanism of action \n6-mercaptopurine is an inactive pro-drug which acts as a purine antagonist but requires cellular uptake\nand intracellular anabolism to thioguanine nucleotides for cytotoxicity. The 6-mercaptopurine\nmetabolites inhibit de novo purine synthesis and purine nucleotide interconversions. The thioguanine\nnucleotides are also incorporated into nucleic acids and this contributes to the cytotoxic effects of the\nactive substance.\n\nCross-resistance usually exists between 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption \nThe bioavailability of oral 6-mercaptopurine shows considerable inter-individual variability, which \nprobably results from its first-pass metabolism. When administered orally at a dosage of 75 mg/m2 \nto 7 paediatric patients, the bioavailability averaged 16% of the administered dose, with a range of 5 to \n37%.  \n\nIn a comparative bioavailability study in healthy adult volunteers (n=60), 50mg of Xaluprine oral \nsuspension was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the reference 50mg tablet for AUC, but not Cmax. \nThe mean (90% CI) Cmax with the oral suspension was 39% (22% - 58%) higher than the tablet \nalthough there was less between-subject variability (%C.V) with the oral suspension (46%) than the \ntablet (69%). \n\nBiotransformation \nThe intracellular anabolism of 6-merpactopurine is catalysed by several enzymes to eventually form \n6-thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs), but a variety of intermediary TGNs are formed en route to the\nTGNs. The first step is catalysed by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase yielding\nthioinosine monophosphate (TIMP). 6-mercaptopurine  is also subject to S-methylation by the enzyme\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\nthiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), yielding methylmercaptopurine, which is inactive. However, \nTPMT also catalyses the S-methylation of the principle nucleotide metabolite, TIMP, to form \nmethylthioinosine monophosphate (mTIMP). Both TIMP and mTIMP are inhibitors of phosphoribosyl \npyrophosphate amidotransferase, an enzyme which is important in de novo purine synthesis. Xanthine \noxidase is the main catabolic enzyme and it converts the 6-mercaptopurine into the inactive \nmetabolite, 6-thiouric acid. This is excreted in the urine. Approximately 7% of an oral dose is excreted \nas unchanged 6-mercaptopurine within 12 hours after administration. \n \nElimination \nThe elimination half-life of 6-mercaptopurine is 90 ± 30 minutes, but the active metabolites have a \nlonger half-life (approximately 5 hours) than the parent compound. The apparent body clearance is \n4832 ± 2562 ml/min/m2. There is low entry of 6-mercaptopurine into the cerebrospinal fluid.  \n \nThe main route of elimination for 6-mercaptopurine is by metabolism. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nGenotoxicity \n6-mercaptopurine, in common with other antimetabolites, is mutagenic and causes chromosomal \naberrations in vitro and in vivo in mice and rats.  \n \nCarcinogenicity \nGiven its genotoxic potential, 6-mercaptopurine is potentially carcinogenic. \n \nTeratogenicity  \n6-mercaptopurine causes embryolethality and severe teratogenic effects in the mouse, rat, hamster and \nrabbit at doses that are non-toxic to the mother. In all species, the degree of embryotoxicity and the \ntype of malformations are dependent on the dose and stage of the gestation at the time of \nadministration. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Xaluprine is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Xaluprine \n3. How to take Xaluprine \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Xaluprine \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Xaluprine is and what it is used for \n \nXaluprine contains mercaptopurine. This belongs to a group of medicines called cytotoxics (also \ncalled chemotherapy). \n \nXaluprine is used for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (also called acute lymphocytic leukaemia or \nALL). This is a fast-growing disease which increases the number of new white blood cells.  These new \nwhite blood cells are immature (not fully formed) and unable to grow and work properly.  They \ntherefore cannot fight infections and may cause bleeding. \n \nAsk your doctor if you would like more explanation about this disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Xaluprine \n \n- Do not take Xaluprine if you are allergic to mercaptopurine or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n- Do not get vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine whilst you are taking Xaluprine because it \n\nmay be fatal. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Xaluprine \n- if you have been vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine \n- if you have kidney or liver problems, as your doctor will need to check that they are working \n\nproperly. \n- if you have a condition where your body produces too little of the enzyme called TPMT \n\n(thiopurine methyltransferase), as your doctor may need to adjust the dose.  \n- if you are planning to have a baby.  This applies to both men and women.  Xaluprine may harm \n\nyour sperm or eggs (see ‘Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility’ below).   \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nIf you are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, taking Xaluprine could put you at greater risk of: \n- tumours, including skin cancer. Therefore, when taking Xaluprine, avoid excessive exposure to \n\nsunlight, wear protective clothing and use protective sunscreen with a high protection factor \n- lymphoproliferative disorders \n\no treatment with Xaluprine increases your risk of getting a type of cancer called \nlymphoproliferative disorder. With treatment regimen containing multiple \nimmunosuppressants (including thiopurines), this may lead to death. \n\no A combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the \nrisk of disorders of the lymph system due to a viral infection (Epstein-Barr virus \n(EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders). \n\n \nTaking Xaluprine could put you at greater risk of: \n- developing a serious condition called Macrophage Activation Syndrome (excessive activation \n\nof white blood cells associated with inflammation), which usually occurs in people who have \ncertain types of arthritis. \n\n \nSome patients with inflammatory bowel disease who have received 6-mercaptopurine have developed \na rare and aggressive type of cancer called Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma (see section 4, Possible \nside effects).  \n \nInfections \nWhen you are treated with Xaluprine the risk of viral, fungal and bacterial infections is increased and \nthe infections may be more serious. See also section 4. \n \nTell your doctor before starting treatment whether or not you have had chickenpox, shingles or \nhepatitis B (a liver disease caused by a virus). \n \nNUDT15-gene mutation \nIf you have an inherited mutation in the NUDT15-gene (a gene which is involved in the break-down \nof Xaluprine in the body), you have a higher risk of infections and hair loss and your doctor may in \nthis case give you a lower dose. \n \nAvoid contact of Xaluprine with your skin, eyes or nose. If you accidentally get some in your eyes or \nnose, flush the area with water. \n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nXaluprine. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nLow blood sugar has sometimes been seen in children, mainly in children under the age of six or with \na low body mass index. Talk to your child´s doctor if this happens. \n \nOther medicines and Xaluprine \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: \n \n- other cytotoxic medicines (chemotherapy) - when used with Xaluprine there is a greater chance \n\nof side effects, such as anaemia \n- allopurinol or febuxostat (used to treat gout) \n- oral anticoagulants (used to thin the blood) \n- olsalazine or mesalazine (used for a bowel disorder called ulcerative colitis) \n- sulfasalazine (used for rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis). \n- anti-epileptic medicines such as phenytoin, carbamazepine. Blood levels of anti-epileptic \n\nmedicines may need to be monitored and doses adjusted if necessary. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nHaving vaccines while you are taking Xaluprine \nIf you are going to have a vaccination it is important to speak to your doctor or nurse before you have \nit.  Vaccination with live vaccines (like polio, measles, mumps and rubella) is not recommended, as \nthese vaccines may give you an infection if you have them whilst you are taking Xaluprine.  \n \nXaluprine with food and drink \nXaluprine may be taken with food or on an empty stomach. However, the choice of method should be \nconsistent from day to day.  \n \nDo not take Xaluprine at the same time as milk or dairy products, as they can make the medicine less \neffective.

This is to check the number \n\nand type of cells in your blood and to ensure your liver is working correctly. \n- Your doctor may also ask for other blood and urine tests to monitor your uric acid levels.
