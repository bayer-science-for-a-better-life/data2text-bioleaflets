CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of major depressive disorder. \n\nTreatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. \n\nTreatment of generalised anxiety disorder. \n\n \n\nDuloxetine Mylan is indicated in adults. \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nFor further information see section 5.1. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nMajor depressive disorder  \n\nThe starting and recommended maintenance dose is 60 mg once daily with or without food.  Dosages \n\nabove 60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day have been evaluated from a safety \n\nperspective in clinical trials.  However, there is no clinical evidence suggesting that patients not \n\nresponding to the initial recommended dose may benefit from dose up-titrations. \n\n \n\nTherapeutic response is usually seen after 2-4 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nAfter consolidation of the antidepressive response, it is recommended to continue treatment for several \n\nmonths, in order to avoid relapse. In patients responding to duloxetine, and with a history of repeated \n\nepisodes of major depression, further long-term treatment at a dose of 60 to 120 mg/day could be \n\nconsidered. \n\n \n\nGeneralised anxiety disorder \n\nThe recommended starting dose in patients with generalised anxiety disorder is 30 mg once daily with or \n\nwithout food.  In patients with insufficient response the dose should be increased to 60 mg, which is the \n\nusual maintenance dose in most patients. \n\n \n\nIn patients with co-morbid major depressive disorder, the starting and maintenance dose is 60 mg once \n\ndaily (please see also dosing recommendation above). \n\n \n\nDoses up to 120 mg per day have been shown to be efficacious and have been evaluated from a safety \n\nperspective in clinical trials.  In patients with insufficient response to 60 mg, escalation up to 90 mg or \n\n120 mg may therefore be considered.  Dose escalation should be based upon clinical response and \n\ntolerability. \n\n \n\nAfter consolidation of the response, it is recommended to continue treatment for several months, in order \n\nto avoid relapse. \n\n \n\nDiabetic peripheral neuropathic pain \n\nThe starting and recommended maintenance dose is 60 mg daily with or without food.  Dosages above \n\n60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day administered in evenly divided doses, have \n\nbeen evaluated from a safety perspective in clinical trials.  The plasma concentration of duloxetine \n\ndisplays large inter-individual variability (see section 5.2).  Hence, some patients that respond \n\ninsufficiently to 60 mg may benefit from a higher dose. \n\n \n\nResponse to treatment should be evaluated after 2 months.  In patients with inadequate initial response, \n\nadditional response after this time is unlikely. \n\n \n\nThe therapeutic benefit should be reassessed regularly (at least every three months) (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients solely on the basis of age.  However, as with \n\nany medicine, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly, especially with Duloxetine Mylan \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n120 mg per day for major depressive disorder or generalised anxiety disorder, for which data are limited \n\n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nDuloxetine Mylan must not be used in patients with liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see \n\nsections 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine \n\nclearance 30 to 80 ml/min).  Duloxetine Mylan must not be used in patients with severe renal impairment \n\n(creatinine clearance <30 ml/min; see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nDuloxetine should not be used in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years for the treatment of \n\nmajor depressive disorder because of safety and efficacy concerns (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of duloxetine for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder in paediatric \n\npatients aged 7-17 years have not been established. Current available data are described in sections 4.8, \n\n5.1 and 5.2. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of duloxetine for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain has not \n\nbeen studied. No data are available. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation of treatment \n\nAbrupt discontinuation should be avoided.  When stopping treatment with Duloxetine Mylan the dose \n\nshould be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of \n\nwithdrawal reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the \n\ndose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be \n\nconsidered.  Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor oral use. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of Duloxetine Mylan with nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors \n\n(MAOIs) is contraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nLiver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nDuloxetine Mylan should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin or enoxacin (i.e. \n\npotent CYP1A2 inhibitors) since the combination results in elevated plasma concentrations of duloxetine \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nSevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe initiation of treatment with Duloxetine Mylan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled \n\nhypertension that could expose patients to a potential risk of hypertensive crisis (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nMania and seizures \n\n \n\nDuloxetine Mylan should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or a diagnosis of bipolar \n\ndisorder, and/or seizures. \n\n \n\nMydriasis \n\n \n\nMydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when \n\nprescribing Duloxetine Mylan to patients with increased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute \n\nnarrow-angle glaucoma. \n\n \n\nBlood pressure and heart rate \n\n \n\nDuloxetine has been associated with an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant hypertension \n\nin some patients.  This may be due to the noradrenergic effect of duloxetine.  Cases of hypertensive crisis \n\nhave been reported with duloxetine, especially in patients with pre-existing hypertension.  Therefore, in \n\npatients with known hypertension and/or other cardiac disease, blood pressure monitoring is \n\nrecommended, especially during the first month of treatment.  Duloxetine should be used with caution in \n\npatients whose conditions could be compromised by an increased heart rate or by an increase in blood \n\npressure.  Caution should also be exercised when duloxetine is used with medicinal products that may \n\nimpair its metabolism (see section 4.5).  For patients who experience a sustained increase in blood \n\npressure while receiving duloxetine either dose reduction or gradual discontinuation should be considered \n\n(see section 4.8).  In patients with uncontrolled hypertension duloxetine should not be initiated (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on \n\nhaemodialysis (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).  For patients with severe renal impairment, see \n\nsection 4.3.  See section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction. \n\n \n\nSerotonin syndrome \n\n \n\nAs with other serotonergic agents, serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, may occur \n\nwith duloxetine treatment, particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents (including \n\nSSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants or triptans), with agents that impair metabolism of serotonin such \n\nas MAOIs, or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists that may affect the serotonergic \n\nneurotransmitter systems (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nSerotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), \n\nautonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations \n\n(e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). \n\n \n\nIf concomitant treatment with duloxetine and other serotonergic agents that may affect the serotonergic \n\nand/or dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is \n\nadvised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. \n\n \n\nSt John’s wort \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions may be more common during concomitant use of Duloxetine Mylan and herbal \n\npreparations containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n \n\nSuicide \n\n \n\nMajor depressive disorder and Generalised anxiety disorder  \n\nDepression is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suicide-related \n\nevents).  This risk persists until significant remission occurs.  As improvement may not occur during the \n\nfirst few weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such improvement occurs.  \n\nIt is general clinical experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery. \n\n \n\nOther psychiatric conditions for which Duloxetine Mylan is prescribed can also be associated with an \n\nincreased risk of suicide-related events.  In addition, these conditions may be co-morbid with major \n\ndepressive disorder.  The same precautions observed when treating patients with major depressive \n\ndisorder should therefore be observed when treating patients with other psychiatric disorders. \n\n \n\nPatients with a history of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal \n\nthoughts prior to commencement of treatment are known to be at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or \n\nsuicidal behaviour, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment.  A meta-analysis of \n\nplacebo-controlled clinical trials of antidepressant medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed an \n\nincreased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than \n\n25 years old. \n\n \n\nCases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early \n\nafter treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nClose supervision of patients and in particular those at high risk should accompany medicinal product \n\ntherapy especially in early treatment and following dose changes.  Patients (and caregivers of patients) \n\nshould be alerted about the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, suicidal behaviour or thoughts and \n\nunusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present. \n\n \n\nDiabetic peripheral neuropathic pain  \n\nAs with other medicinal products with similar pharmacological action (antidepressants), isolated cases of \n\nsuicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after \n\ntreatment discontinuation.  Concerning risk factors for suicidality in depression, see above.  Physicians \n\nshould encourage patients to report any distressing thoughts or feelings at any time. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents under 18 years of age \n\n \n\nDuloxetine Mylan should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of \n\n18 years. Suicide-related behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly \n\naggression, oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in clinical trials among \n\nchildren and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo.  If, based on \n\nclinical need, a decision to treat is nevertheless taken, the patient should be carefully monitored for the \n\nappearance of suicidal symptoms (see section 5.1). In addition, long-term safety data in children and \n\nadolescents concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural development are lacking (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\n \n\nThere have been reports of bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and gastrointestinal \n\nhaemorrhage with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake \n\ninhibitors (SNRIs), including duloxetine. Duloxetine may increase the risk of postpartum haemorrhage \n\n(see section 4.6). Caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants and/or medicinal products known to \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\naffect platelet function (e.g. NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)), and in patients with known bleeding \n\ntendencies. \n\n \n\nHyponatraemia \n\n \n\nHyponatraemia has been reported when administering Duloxetine Mylan, including cases with serum \n\nsodium lower than 110 mmol/l.  Hyponatraemia may be due to a syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic \n\nhormone secretion (SIADH).  The majority of cases of hyponatraemia were reported in the elderly, \n\nespecially when coupled with a recent history of, or condition pre-disposing to, altered fluid balance. \n\nCaution is required in patients at increased risk for hyponatraemia, such as elderly, cirrhotic, or \n\ndehydrated patients or patients treated with diuretics. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation of treatment \n\n \n\nWithdrawal symptoms when treatment is discontinued are common, particularly if discontinuation is \n\nabrupt (see section 4.8).  In clinical trials adverse events seen on abrupt treatment discontinuation occurred \n\nin approximately 45% of patients treated with duloxetine and 23% of patients taking placebo.  The risk of \n\nwithdrawal symptoms seen with SSRI’s and SNRI’s may be dependent on several factors including the \n\nduration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction.  The most commonly reported reactions are \n\nlisted in section 4.8.  Generally these symptoms are mild to moderate, however, in some patients they may \n\nbe severe in intensity. They usually occur within the first few days of discontinuing treatment, but there \n\nhave been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have inadvertently missed a dose. Generally \n\nthese symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 weeks, though in some individuals they may \n\nbe prolonged (2-3 months or more).  It is therefore advised that duloxetine should be gradually tapered \n\nwhen discontinuing treatment over a period of no less than 2 weeks, according to the patient’s needs (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nData on the use of duloxetine 120 mg in elderly patients with major depressive disorder and generalised \n\nanxiety disorder are limited.  Therefore, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly with the \n\nmaximum dosage (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nAkathisia/psychomotor restlessness \n\n \n\nThe use of duloxetine has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a \n\nsubjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability to \n\nsit or stand still.  This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. In patients who \n\ndevelop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products containing duloxetine \n\n \n\nDuloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic \n\npain, major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and stress urinary incontinence). The use of \n\nmore than one of these products concomitantly should be avoided. \n\n \n\nHepatitis/increased liver enzymes \n\n \n\nCases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver enzymes (>10 times upper limit of normal), \n\nhepatitis and jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section 4.8).  Most of them occurred during \n\nthe first months of treatment.  The pattern of liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular.  Duloxetine \n\nshould be used with caution in patients treated with other medicinal products associated with hepatic \n\ninjury. \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n \n\nSexual dysfunction \n\n \n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may \n\ncause symptoms of sexual dysfunction (see section 4.8). There have been reports of long-lasting sexual \n\ndysfunction where the symptoms have continued despite discontinuation of SSRIs/SNRIs. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nDuloxetine Mylan hard gastro-resistant capsules contain sucrose and sodium. \n\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or \n\nsucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\n‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) \n\n \n\nDue to the risk of serotonin syndrome, duloxetine should not be used in combination with non-selective \n\nirreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment \n\nwith an MAOI.  Based on the half-life of duloxetine, at least 5 days should be allowed after stopping \n\nDuloxetine Mylan before starting an MAOI (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe concomitant use of Duloxetine Mylan with selective, reversible MAOIs, like moclobemide, is not \n\nrecommended (see section 4.4).  The antibiotic linezolid is a reversible non-selective MAOI and should \n\nnot be given to patients treated with Duloxetine Mylan (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInhibitors of CYP1A2 \n\nBecause CYP1A2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of duloxetine with potent \n\ninhibitors of CYP1A2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of duloxetine.  Fluvoxamine (100 mg \n\nonce daily), a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, decreased the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine by \n\nabout 77% and increased AUCo-t 6-fold.  Therefore Duloxetine Mylan should not be administered in \n\ncombination with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 like fluvoxamine (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nCNS medicinal products \n\n \n\nThe risk of using duloxetine in combination with other CNS-active medicinal products has not been \n\nsystematically evaluated, except in the cases described in this section.  Consequently, caution is advised \n\nwhen Duloxetine Mylan is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products or \n\nsubstances, including alcohol and sedative medicinal products (e.g. benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, \n\nantipsychotics, phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines). \n\n \n\nSerotonergic agents \n\n \n\nIn rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using SSRIs/SNRIs concomitantly with \n\nserotonergic agents.  Caution is advisable if Duloxetine Mylan is used concomitantly with serotonergic \n\nagents like SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants like clomipramine or amitriptyline, MAOIs like \n\nmoclobemide or linezolid, St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or triptans, tramadol, pethidine and \n\ntryptophan (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nEffect of duloxetine on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a CYP1A2 substrate, were not significantly affected by \n\nco-administration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 \n\nDuloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. When duloxetine was administered at a dose of 60 mg \n\ntwice daily with a single dose of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased \n\n3-fold.  The co-administration of duloxetine (40 mg twice daily) increases steady state AUC of tolterodine \n\n(2 mg twice daily) by 71%, but does not affect the pharmacokinetics of its active 5-hydroxyl metabolite \n\nand no dosage adjustment is recommended.  Caution is advised if Duloxetine Mylan is co-administered \n\nwith medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 (risperidone, tricyclic \n\nantidepressants [TCAs] such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a \n\nnarrow therapeutic index (such as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol). \n\n \n\nOral contraceptives and other steroidal agents \n\nResults of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce the catalytic activity of CYP3A.  \n\nSpecific in vivo drug interaction studies have not been performed. \n\n \n\nAnticoagulants and antiplatelet agents \n\nCaution should be exercised when duloxetine is combined with oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents \n\ndue to a potential increased risk of bleeding attributable to a pharmacodynamic interaction.  Furthermore, \n\nincreases in INR values have been reported when duloxetine was co-administered to patients treated with \n\nwarfarin.  However, concomitant administration of duloxetine with warfarin under steady state conditions, \n\nin healthy volunteers, as part of a clinical pharmacology study, did not result in a clinically significant \n\nchange in INR from baseline or in the pharmacokinetics of R- or S-warfarin. \n\n \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on duloxetine \n\n \n\nAntacids and H2 antagonists \n\nCo-administration of duloxetine with aluminium- and magnesium-containing antacids or duloxetine with \n\nfamotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine absorption after administration of a \n\n40 mg oral dose. \n\n \n\nInducers of CYP1A2 \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that smokers have almost 50% lower plasma \n\nconcentrations of duloxetine compared with non-smokers. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nFertility  \n\n \n\nIn animal studies, duloxetine had no effect on male fertility, and effects in females were only evident at \n\ndoses that caused maternal toxicity. \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate data on the use of duloxetine in pregnant women.  Studies in animals have shown \n\nreproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (AUC) of duloxetine lower than the maximum clinical \n\nexposure (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nThe potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n \n\nEpidemiological data have suggested that the use of SSRIs in pregnancy, particularly in late pregnancy, \n\nmay increase the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn (PPHN).  Although no studies \n\nhave investigated the association of PPHN to SNRI treatment, this potential risk cannot be ruled out with \n\nduloxetine taking into account the related mechanism of action (inhibition of the re-uptake of serotonin). \n\n \n\nAs with other serotonergic medicinal products, discontinuation symptoms may occur in the neonate after \n\nmaternal duloxetine use near term.  Discontinuation symptoms seen with duloxetine may include \n\nhypotonia, tremor, jitteriness, feeding difficulty, respiratory distress and seizures.  The majority of cases \n\nhave occurred either at birth or within a few days of birth. \n\n \n\nObservational data have provided evidence of an increased risk (less than 2-fold) of postpartum \n\nhaemorrhage following duloxetine exposure within the month prior to birth. \n\n \n\nDuloxetine Mylan should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to \n\nthe foetus.  Women should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant, or intend to \n\nbecome pregnant, during therapy. \n\n \n\nBreast feeding \n\n \n\nDuloxetine is very weakly excreted into human milk based on a study of 6 lactating patients, who did not \n\nbreast feed their children.  The estimated daily infant dose on a mg/kg basis is approximately 0.14% of the \n\nmaternal dose (see section 5.2).  As the safety of duloxetine in infants is not known, the use of Duloxetine \n\nMylan while breast-feeding is not recommended. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  Duloxetine \n\nMylan may be associated with sedation and dizziness.  Patients should be instructed that if they experience \n\nsedation or dizziness they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating \n\nmachinery. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with duloxetine were nausea, headache, \n\ndry mouth, somnolence, and dizziness.  However, the majority of common adverse reactions were mild to \n\nmoderate, they usually started early in therapy, and most tended to subside even as therapy was continued. \n\n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \n\nclinical trials. \n\n \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions \n\nFrequency

discontinuation.  \n2 Cases of orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported especially at the initiation of treatment.  \n3 See section 4.4. \n4 Cases of aggression and anger have been reported particularly early in treatment or after treatment \n\ndiscontinuation.  \n5 Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early \n\nafter treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4).  \n6 Estimated frequency of post-marketing surveillance reported adverse reactions; not observed in \n\nplacebo-controlled clinical trials.  \n7 Not statistically significantly different from placebo.  \n8 Estimated frequency based on placebo-controlled clinical trials.  \n9 Estimated frequency based on all clinical trial data. \n10 Falls were more common in the elderly (≥65 years old). \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation of duloxetine (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms.  \n\nDizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia or electric shock like sensations, particularly in \n\nthe head), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and intense dreams), fatigue, somnolence, agitation or \n\nanxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, headache, myalgia, irritability, diarrhoea, hyperhydrosis and \n\nvertigo are the most commonly reported reactions. \n\n \n\nGenerally, for SSRIs and SNRIs, these events are mild to moderate and self-limiting, however, in some \n\npatients they may be severe and/or prolonged.  It is therefore advised that when duloxetine treatment is no \n\nlonger required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the 12 week acute phase of three clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain, \n\nsmall but statistically significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine-treated \n\npatients.  HbA1c was stable in both duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients.  In the extension \n\nphase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, there was an increase in HbA1c in both the duloxetine \n\nand routine care groups, but the mean increase was 0.3% greater in the duloxetine-treated group.  There \n\nwas also a small increase in fasting blood glucose and in total cholesterol in duloxetine-treated patients \n\nwhile those laboratory tests showed a slight decrease in the routine care group. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nThe heart rate-corrected QT interval in duloxetine-treated patients did not differ from that seen in \n\nplacebo treated patients.  No clinically significant differences were observed for QT, PR, QRS, or QTcB \n\nmeasurements between duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nA total of 509 paediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years with major depressive disorder and 241 paediatric \n\npatients aged 7 to 17 years with generalised anxiety disorder were treated with duloxetine in clinical trials.  \n\nIn general, the adverse reaction profile of duloxetine in children and adolescents was similar to that seen \n\nfor adults. \n\n \n\nA total of 467 paediatric patients initially randomized to duloxetine in clinical trials, experienced a 0.1 kg \n\nmean decrease in weight at 10-weeks compared with a 0.9 kg mean increase in 353 placebo-treated \n\npatients.  Subsequently, over the four- to six-month extension period, patients on average trended toward \n\nrecovery to their expected baseline weight percentile based on population data from age- and \n\ngender-matched peers. \n\n \n\nIn studies of up to 9 months an overall mean decrease of 1% in height percentile (decrease of 2% in \n\nchildren (7-11 years) and increase of 0.3% in adolescents (12-17 years)) was observed in duloxetine- \n\ntreated paediatric patients (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare professionals are \n\nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nCases of overdoses, alone or in combination with other medicinal products, with duloxetine doses of \n\n5400 mg were reported.  Some fatalities have occurred, primarily with mixed overdoses, but also with \n\nduloxetine alone at a dose of approximately 1000 mg.  Signs and symptoms of overdose (duloxetine alone \n\nor in combination with other medicinal products) included somnolence, coma, serotonin syndrome, \n\nseizures, vomiting and tachycardia. \n\n \n\nNo specific antidote is known for duloxetine but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment (such as \n\nwith cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered.  A free airway should be established.  \n\nMonitoring of cardiac and vital signs is recommended, along with appropriate symptomatic and \n\nsupportive measures.  Gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion or in symptomatic \n\npatients.  Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption.  Duloxetine has a large volume of \n\ndistribution and forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, and exchange perfusion are unlikely to be beneficial. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antidepressants. ATC code: N06AX21. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action  \n\n \n\nDuloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor.  It weakly inhibits \n\ndopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic and \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n \n\nadrenergic receptors.  Duloxetine dose-dependently increases extracellular levels of serotonin and \n\nnoradrenaline in various brain areas of animals. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nDuloxetine normalised pain thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain \n\nand attenuated pain behaviour in a model of persistent pain. The pain inhibitory action of duloxetine is \n\nbelieved to be a result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the central nervous \n\nsystem. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety  \n\n \n\nMajor depressive disorder \n\nDuloxetine was studied in a clinical programme involving 3,158 patients (1,285 patient-years of exposure) \n\nmeeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression.  The efficacy of duloxetine at the recommended dose of \n\n60 mg once a day was demonstrated in three out of three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, \n\nfixed dose acute studies in adult outpatients with major depressive disorder.  Overall, duloxetine’s efficacy \n\nhas been demonstrated at daily doses between 60 and 120 mg in a total of five out of seven randomised, \n\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose acute studies in adult outpatients with major depressive \n\ndisorder. \n\n \n\nDuloxetine demonstrated statistical superiority over placebo as measured by improvement in the 17-item \n\nHamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score (including both the emotional and somatic \n\nsymptoms of depression).  Response and remission rates were also statistically significantly higher with \n\nduloxetine compared with placebo.  Only a small proportion of patients included in pivotal clinical trials \n\nhad severe depression (baseline HAM-D>25). \n\n \n\nIn a relapse prevention study, patients responding to 12-weeks of acute treatment with open-label \n\nduloxetine 60 mg once daily were randomised to either duloxetine 60 mg once daily or placebo for a \n\nfurther 6-months.  Duloxetine 60 mg once daily demonstrated a statistically significant superiority \n\ncompared to placebo (p=0.004) on the primary outcome measure, the prevention of depressive relapse, as \n\nmeasured by time to relapse.  The incidence of relapse during the 6-months double-blind follow-up period \n\nwas 17% and 29% for duloxetine and placebo, respectively. \n\n \n\nDuring 52 weeks of placebo-controlled double blind treatment, duloxetine-treated patients with recurrent \n\nMDD had a significantly longer symptom free period (p<0.001) compared with patients randomised to \n\nplacebo.  All patients had previously responded to duloxetine during open-label duloxetine treatment (28 \n\nto 34 weeks) at a dose of 60 to 120 mg/day.  During the 52-week placebo-controlled double blind \n\ntreatment phase 14.4% of the duloxetine-treated patients and 33.1% of the placebo-treated patients \n\nexperience a return of their depressive symptoms (p<0.001). \n\n \n\nThe effect of duloxetine 60 mg once a day in elderly depressed patients (≥65 years) was specifically \n\nexamined in a study that showed a statistically significant difference in the reduction of the HAMD17 \n\nscore for duloxetine-treated patients compared to placebo.  Tolerability of duloxetine 60 mg once daily in \n\nelderly patients was comparable to that seen in the younger adults.  However, data on elderly patients \n\nexposed to the maximum dose (120 mg per day) are limited and thus, caution is recommended when \n\ntreating this population. \n\n \n\nGeneralised anxiety disorder \n\nDuloxetine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo in five out of five studies \n\nincluding four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled acute studies and a relapse prevention study \n\nin adult patients with generalised anxiety disorder. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nDuloxetine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo as measured by improvement in \n\nthe Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) total score and by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) global \n\nfunctional impairment score.  Response and remission rates were also higher with duloxetine compared to \n\nplacebo.  Duloxetine showed comparable efficacy results to venlafaxine in terms of improvements on the \n\nHAM-A total score. \n\n \n\nIn a relapse prevention study, patients responding to 6 months of acute treatment with open-label \n\nduloxetine were randomised to either duloxetine or placebo for a further 6-months.  Duloxetine 60 mg to \n\n120 mg once daily demonstrated statistically significant superiority compared to placebo (p<0.001) on the \n\nprevention of relapse, as measured by time to relapse.  The incidence of relapse during the 6-months \n\ndouble-blind follow-up period was 14% for duloxetine and 42% for placebo. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of duloxetine 30-120 mg (flexible dosing) once a day in elderly patients (>65 years) with \n\ngeneralised anxiety disorder was evaluated in a study that demonstrated statistically significant \n\nimprovement in the HAM-A total score for duloxetine treated patients compared to placebo treated \n\npatients.  The efficacy and safety of duloxetine 30-120 mg once daily in elderly patients with generalised \n\nanxiety disorder was similar to that seen in studies of younger adult patients.  However, data on elderly \n\npatients exposed to the maximum dose (120 mg per day) are limited and, thus, caution is recommended \n\nwhen using this dose with the elderly population. \n\n \n\nDiabetic peripheral neuropathic pain \n\nThe efficacy of duloxetine as a treatment for diabetic neuropathic pain was established in 2 randomised, \n\n12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose studies in adults (22 to 88 years) having diabetic \n\nneuropathic pain for at least 6 months.  Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder \n\nwere excluded from these trials.  The primary outcome measure was the weekly mean of 24-hour average \n\npain, which was collected in a daily diary by patients on an 11-point Likert scale. \n\n \n\nIn both studies, duloxetine 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced pain compared \n\nwith placebo.  The effect in some patients was apparent in the first week of treatment.  The difference in \n\nmean improvement between the two active treatment arms was not significant.  At least 30% reported pain \n\nreduction was recorded in approximately 65% of duloxetine treated patients versus 40% for placebo.  The \n\ncorresponding figures for at least 50% pain reduction were 50% and 26% respectively.  Clinical response \n\nrates (50% or greater improvement in pain) were analysed according to whether or not the patient \n\nexperienced somnolence during treatment.  For patients not experiencing somnolence, clinical response \n\nwas observed in 47% of patients receiving duloxetine and 27% of patients on placebo.  Clinical response \n\nrates in patients experiencing somnolence were 60% on duloxetine and 30% on placebo.  Patients not \n\ndemonstrating a pain reduction of 30% within 60 days of treatment were unlikely to reach this level during \n\nfurther treatment. \n\n \n\nIn an open label long-term uncontrolled study, the pain reduction in patients responding to 8-weeks of \n\nacute treatment of duloxetine 60 mg once daily was maintained for a further 6-months as measured by \n\nchange on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 24-hour average pain item. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nDuloxetine has not been studied in patients under the age of 7.   \n\n \n\nTwo randomized, double-blind, parallel clinical trials were performed in 800 paediatric patients aged 7 to \n\n17 years with major depressive disorder (see section 4.2).  These two studies included a 10 week placebo \n\nand active (fluoxetine) controlled acute phase followed by six months period of active controlled \n\nextension treatment.  Neither duloxetine (30-120 mg) nor the active control arm (fluoxetine 20-40 mg) \n\nstatistically separated from placebo on change from baseline to endpoint in the Children´s Depression \n\nRating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) total score.  Discontinuation due to adverse events was higher in patients \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\ntaking duloxetine compared with those treated with fluoxetine, mostly due to nausea.  During the 10-week \n\nacute treatment period, suicidal behaviours were reported (duloxetine 0/333 [0%], fluoxetine 2/225 \n\n[0.9%], placebo 1/220 [0.5%]).  Over the entire 36-week course of the study, 6 out of 333 patients initially \n\nrandomized to duloxetine and 3 out of 225 patients initially randomized to fluoxetine experienced suicidal \n\nbehaviour (exposure adjusted incidence 0.039 events per patient year for duloxetine and 0.026 for \n\nfluoxetine).  In addition, one patient who transitioned from placebo to duloxetine experienced a suicidal \n\nbehaviour while taking duloxetine. \n\n \n\nA randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in 272 patients aged 7-17 years with \n\ngeneralised anxiety disorder.  The study included a 10 week placebo-controlled acute phase, followed by \n\nan 18 week extension treatment period.  A flexible dose regimen was used in this study, to allow for slow \n\ndose escalation from 30 mg once daily to higher doses (maximum 120 mg once daily).  Treatment with \n\nduloxetine showed a statistically significantly greater improvement in GAD symptoms, as measured by \n\nPARS severity score for GAD (mean difference between duloxetine and placebo of 2.7 points [95% CI \n\n1.3-4.0]), after 10 weeks of treatment.  The maintenance of the effect has not been evaluated.  There was \n\nno statistically significant difference in discontinuation due to adverse events between duloxetine and \n\nplacebo groups during the 10 week acute treatment phase.  Two patients who transitioned from placebo to \n\nduloxetine after the acute phase experienced suicidal behaviours while taking duloxetine during the \n\nextension phase.  A conclusion on the overall benefit/risk in this age group has not been established (see \n\nalso sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nA single study has been performed in paediatric patients with juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome \n\n(JPFS) in which the duloxetine-treated group did not separate from placebo group for the primary efficacy \n\nmeasure. Therefore, there is no evidence of efficacy in this paediatric patient population. The randomised, \n\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study of duloxetine was conducted in 184 adolescents aged 13 \n\nto 18 years (mean age 15.53 years) with JPFS. The study included a 13-week double-blind period where \n\npatients were randomised to duloxetine 30 mg/60 mg, or placebo daily. Duloxetine did not show efficacy \n\nin reducing pain as measured by primary outcome measure of Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) average pain \n\nscore endpoint: least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in BPI average pain score at 13 weeks was -\n\n0.97 in the placebo group, compared with -1.62 in the duloxetine 30/60 mg group (p = 0.052). The safety \n\nresults from this study were consistent with the known safety profile of duloxetine. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nduloxetine in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of major depressive disorder, \n\ndiabetic neuropathic pain and generalised anxiety disorder. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric \n\nuse. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nDuloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer.  Duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative \n\nenzymes (CYP1A2 and the polymorphic CYP2D6), followed by conjugation.  The pharmacokinetics of \n\nduloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, \n\nsmoking status and CYP2D6 metaboliser status. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nDuloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a Cmax occurring 6 hours post dose.  The \n\nabsolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%).  Food delays the time \n\nto reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption \n\n(approximately 11%).  These changes do not have any clinical significance. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nDuloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins.  Duloxetine binds to both albumin and \n\nalpha-l acid glycoprotein.  Protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nDuloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in urine.  Both \n\ncytochromes P450-2D6 and 1A2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites glucuronide \n\nconjugate of 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulfate conjugate of 5-hydroxy 6-methoxy duloxetine.  Based upon \n\nin vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered pharmacologically inactive.  The \n\npharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2D6 has not \n\nbeen specifically investigated.  Limited data suggest that the plasma levels of duloxetine are higher in \n\nthese patients. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe elimination half-life of duloxetine ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 hours).  After an \n\nintravenous dose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/hr to 46 l/hr (mean of 36 l/hr).  After \n\nan oral dose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 l/hr (mean 101 l/hr). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nGender \n\nPharmacokinetic differences have been identified between males and females (apparent plasma clearance \n\nis approximately 50% lower in females).  Based upon the overlap in the range of clearance, gender-based \n\npharmacokinetic differences do not justify the recommendation for using a lower dose for female patients. \n\n \n\nAge \n\nPharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (≥65 years) (AUC \n\nincreases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the magnitude of these \n\nchanges is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose.  As a general recommendation, caution should \n\nbe exercised when treating the elderly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment: End stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving dialysis had 2-fold higher \n\nduloxetine Cmax and AUC values compared with healthy subjects.  Pharmacokinetic data on duloxetine is \n\nlimited in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nModerate liver disease (Child Pugh Class B) affected the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine.  Compared with \n\nhealthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% lower, the apparent terminal \n\nhalf-life was 2.3 times longer, and the AUC was 3.7 times higher in patients with moderate liver disease.  \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not been studied in patients with mild or \n\nsevere hepatic insufficiency. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding mothers \n\nThe disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at least 12-weeks postpartum.  \n\nDuloxetine is detected in breast milk, and steady-state concentrations in breast milk are about one-fourth \n\nthose in plasma.  The amount of duloxetine in breast milk is approximately 7 μg/day while on 40 mg twice \n\ndaily dosing.  Lactation did not influence duloxetine pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPharmacokinetics of duloxetine in paediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years with major depressive disorder \n\nfollowing oral administration of 20 to 120 mg once daily dosing regimen was characterized using population \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nmodelling analyses based on data from 3 studies.  The model-predicted duloxetine steady state plasma \n\nconcentrations in paediatric patients were mostly within the concentration range observed in adult patients. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nDuloxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests and was not carcinogenic in rats.  \n\nMultinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other histopathological changes in the rat \n\ncarcinogenicity study.  The underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance are unknown.  Female mice \n\nreceiving duloxetine for 2 years had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas at \n\nthe high dose only (144 mg/kg/day), but these were considered to be secondary to hepatic microsomal \n\nenzyme induction.  The relevance of this mouse data to humans is unknown.  Female rats receiving \n\nduloxetine (45 mg/kg/day) before and during mating and early pregnancy had a decrease in maternal food \n\nconsumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live birth indices and progeny \n\nsurvival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels estimated to be at the most at \n\nmaximum clinical exposure (AUC). In an embryotoxicity study in the rabbit, a higher incidence of \n\ncardiovascular and skeletal malformations was observed at systemic exposure levels below the maximum \n\nclinical exposure (AUC).  No malformations were observed in another study testing a higher dose of a \n\ndifferent salt of duloxetine.  In prenatal/postnatal toxicity studies in the rat, duloxetine induced adverse \n\nbehavioural effects in the offspring at exposures below maximum clinical exposure (AUC). \n\n \n\nStudies in juvenile rats reveal transient effects on neurobehaviour, as well as significantly decreased body \n\nweight and food consumption; hepatic enzyme induction; and hepatocellular vacuolation at 45 mg/kg/day.  \n\nThe general toxicity profile of duloxetine in juvenile rats was similar to that in adult rats. The no-adverse \n\neffect level was determined to be 20 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Duloxetine Mylan is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Duloxetine Mylan \n\n3. How to take Duloxetine Mylan \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Duloxetine Mylan \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Duloxetine Mylan is and what it is used for \n \n\nDuloxetine Mylan contains the active substance duloxetine.  Duloxetine Mylan increases the levels of \n\nserotonin and noradrenaline in the nervous system. \n\n \n\nDuloxetine Mylan is used in adults to treat: \n\n• depression \n\n• generalised anxiety disorder (chronic feeling of anxiety or nervousness) \n\n• diabetic neuropathic pain (often described as burning, stabbing, stinging, shooting or aching or like \nan electric shock. There may be loss of feeling in the affected area, or sensations such as touch, \n\nheat, cold or pressure may cause pain) \n\n \n\nDuloxetine Mylan starts to work in most people with depression or anxiety within two weeks of starting \n\ntreatment, but it may take 2-4 weeks before you feel better.  Tell your doctor if you do not start to feel \n\nbetter after this time.  Your doctor may continue to give you Duloxetine Mylan when you are feeling \n\nbetter to prevent your depression or anxiety from returning. \n\n \n\nIn people with diabetic neuropathic pain it can take some weeks before you feel better.  Talk to your \n\ndoctor if you do not feel better after 2 months. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Duloxetine Mylan \n \n\nDo not take Duloxetine Mylan if you: \n\n- are allergic to duloxetine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n- have liver disease \n- have severe kidney disease \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\n- are taking or have taken within the last 14 days, another medicine known as a monoamine oxidase \ninhibitor (MAOI) (see ‘Other medicines and Duloxetine Mylan’) \n\n- are taking fluvoxamine which is usually used to treat depression, ciprofloxacin or enoxacin which \nare used to treat some infections \n\n- are taking other medicines containing duloxetine (see ‘Other medicines and Duloxetine Mylan’) \n \n\nTalk to your doctor if you have high blood pressure or heart disease.  Your doctor will tell you if you \n\nshould be taking Duloxetine Mylan. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nThe following are reasons why Duloxetine Mylan may not be suitable for you.  Talk to your doctor before \n\nyou take Duloxetine Mylan if you: \n\n- are taking other medicines to treat depression (see ‘Other medicines and Duloxetine Mylan’) \n- are taking St. John’s Wort, a herbal treatment (Hypericum perforatum) \n- have kidney disease \n- have had seizures (fits) \n- have had mania \n- suffer from bipolar disorder \n- have eye problems, such as certain kinds of glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye) \n- have a history of bleeding disorders (tendency to develop bruises), especially if you are pregnant \n\n(see ‘Pregnancy and breast-feeding) \n\n- are at risk of low sodium levels (for example if you are taking diuretics, especially if you are \nelderly) \n\n- are currently being treated with another medicine which may cause liver damage \n- are taking other medicines containing duloxetine (see ‘Other medicines and Duloxetine Mylan’) \n \n\nDuloxetine Mylan may cause a sensation of restlessness or an inability to sit or stand still.  You should tell \n\nyour doctor if this happens to you. \n\n \n\nMedicines like Duloxetine Mylan  (so called SSRIs/SNRIs) may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction \n\n(see section 4). In some cases, these symptoms have continued after stopping treatment. \n\n \n\nThoughts of suicide and worsening of your depression or anxiety disorder \n\nIf you are depressed and/or have anxiety disorders you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or killing \n\nyourself.  These may be increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all take time \n\nto work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer. \n\nYou may be more likely to think like this if you: \n\n- have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself \n- are a young adult. Information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal behaviour \n\nin adults aged less than 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an \n\nantidepressant \n\n \n\nIf you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a \n\nhospital straight away. \n\n \n\nYou may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have an anxiety disorder, \n\nand ask them to read this leaflet.  You might ask them to tell you if they think your depression or anxiety \n\nis getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents under 18 years of age \n\nDuloxetine Mylan should normally not be used for children and adolescents under 18 years.  Also, you \n\nshould know that patients under 18 have an increased risk of side-effects such as suicide attempt, suicidal \n\nthoughts and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) when they take this \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\nclass of medicines.  Despite this, your doctor may prescribe Duloxetine Mylan for patients under 18 \n\nbecause he/she decides that this is in their best interests.  If your doctor has prescribed Duloxetine Mylan \n\nfor a patient under 18 and you want to discuss this, please go back to your doctor.  You should inform \n\nyour doctor if any of the symptoms listed above develop or worsen when patients under 18 are taking \n\nDuloxetine Mylan.  Also, the long-term safety effects concerning growth, maturation, and cognitive and \n\nbehavioural development of Duloxetine Mylan in this age group have not yet been demonstrated. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Duloxetine Mylan \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, \n\nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n \n\nThe main ingredient of Duloxetine Mylan, duloxetine, is used in other medicines for other conditions: \n\n• diabetic neuropathic pain, depression, anxiety and urinary incontinence \n \n\nUsing more than one of these medicines at the same time should be avoided.  Check with your doctor if \n\nyou are already taking other medicines containing duloxetine. \n\n \n\nYour doctor should decide whether you can take Duloxetine Mylan with other medicines.  Do not start or \n\nstop taking any medicines, including those bought without a prescription and herbal remedies, \n\nbefore checking with your doctor. \n\n \n\nYou should also tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: \n\n \n\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): You should not take Duloxetine Mylan if you are taking, or \n\nhave recently taken (within the last 14 days) another antidepressant medicine called a monoamine oxidase \n\ninhibitor (MAOI).  Examples of MAOIs include moclobemide (an antidepressant) and linezolid (an \n\nantibiotic). Taking a MAOI together with many prescription medicines, including Duloxetine Mylan, can \n\ncause serious or even life-threatening side effects.  You must wait at least 14 days after you have stopped \n\ntaking an MAOI before you can take Duloxetine Mylan.  Also, you need to wait at least 5 days after you \n\nstop taking Duloxetine Mylan before you take a MAOI. \n\n \n\nMedicines that cause sleepiness: These include medicines prescribed by your doctor including \n\nbenzodiazepines, strong painkillers, antipsychotics, phenobarbital and antihistamines. \n\n \n\nMedicines that increase the level of serotonin: Triptans, tramadol, tryptophan, SSRIs (such as paroxetine \n\nand fluoxetine), SNRIs (such as venlafaxine), tricyclic antidepressants (such as clomipramine, \n\namitriptyline), pethidine, St John’s Wort and MAOIs (such as moclobemide and linezolid).  These \n\nmedicines increase the risk of side effects; if you get any unusual symptom taking any of these medicines \n\ntogether with Duloxetine Mylan, you should see your doctor. \n\n \n\nOral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents: Medicines which thin the blood or prevent the blood from \n\nclotting.  These medicines might increase the risk of bleeding. \n\n \n\nDuloxetine Mylan with food, drink and alcohol \n\nDuloxetine Mylan may be taken with or without food.  Care should be taken if you drink alcohol while \n\nyou are being treated with Duloxetine Mylan. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \n\ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\n• Tell your doctor if you become pregnant, or you are trying to become pregnant, while you are \ntaking Duloxetine Mylan.  You should use Duloxetine Mylan only after discussing the potential \n\nbenefits and any potential risks to your unborn child with your doctor. \n\n \n\n• Make sure your midwife and/or doctor knows you are on Duloxetine Mylan.  When taken during \npregnancy, similar drugs (SSRIs) may increase the risk of a serious condition in babies, called \n\npersistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), making the baby breathe faster and \n\nappear bluish.  These symptoms usually begin during the first 24 hours after the baby is born.  If \n\nthis happens to your baby you should contact your midwife and/or doctor immediately. \n\n \n\n• If you take Duloxetine Mylan near the end of your pregnancy, your baby might have some \nsymptoms when it is born.  These usually begin at birth or within a few days of your baby being \n\nborn.  These symptoms may include floppy muscles, trembling, jitteriness, not feeding properly, \n\ntrouble with breathing and fits.  If your baby has any of these symptoms when it is born, or you are \n\nconcerned about your baby’s health, contact your doctor or midwife who will be able to advise you. \n\n \n\n• If you take Duloxetine Mylan near the end of your pregnancy there is an increased risk of excessive \n\nvaginal bleeding shortly after birth, especially if you have a history of bleeding disorders. Your \n\ndoctor or midwife should be aware that you are taking duloxetine so they can advise you. \n\n \n\n• Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding.  The use of Duloxetine Mylan while breast-feeding is not \nrecommended.  You should ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nDuloxetine Mylan may make you feel sleepy or dizzy.  Do not drive or use any tools or machines until \n\nyou know how Duloxetine Mylan affects you. \n\n \n\nDuloxetine Mylan contains sucrose and sodium \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \n\nbefore taking this medicinal product. \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\n\nfree’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Duloxetine Mylan \n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nDuloxetine Mylan is for oral use. You should swallow your capsule whole with a drink of water. \n\n \n\nFor depression and diabetic neuropathic pain: \n\nThe usual dose of Duloxetine Mylan is 60 mg once a day, but your doctor will prescribe the dose that is \n\nright for you. \n\n \n\nFor generalised anxiety disorder:  \n\nThe usual starting dose of Duloxetine Mylan is 30 mg once a day after which most patients will receive \n\n60 mg once a day, but your doctor will prescribe the dose that is right for you.  The dose may be adjusted \n\nup to 120 mg a day based on your response to Duloxetine Mylan. \n\n \n\nTo help you remember to take Duloxetine Mylan, you may find it easier to take it at the same times every \n\nday. \n\n \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\nTalk with your doctor about how long you should keep taking Duloxetine Mylan.  Do not stop taking \n\nDuloxetine Mylan, or change your dose, without talking to your doctor.  Treating your disorder properly is \n\nimportant to help you get better.  If it is not treated, your condition may not go away and may become \n\nmore serious and difficult to treat. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Duloxetine Mylan than you should \n\nCall your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you take more than the amount of Duloxetine Mylan \n\nprescribed by your doctor.  Symptoms of overdose include sleepiness, coma, serotonin syndrome (a rare \n\nreaction which may cause feelings of great happiness, drowsiness, clumsiness, restlessness, feeling of \n\nbeing drunk, fever, sweating or rigid muscles), fits, vomiting and fast heart rate. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Duloxetine Mylan \n\nIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember.  However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the \n\nmissed dose and take only a single dose as usual.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten \n\ndose.  Do not take more than the daily amount of Duloxetine Mylan that has been prescribed for you in \n\none day. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Duloxetine Mylan \n\nDO NOT stop taking your capsules without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better.  If your \n\ndoctor thinks that you no longer need Duloxetine Mylan he or she will ask you to reduce your dose over at \n\nleast 2 weeks before stopping treatment altogether. \n\n \n\nSome patients who stop taking Duloxetine Mylan suddenly have had symptoms such as: \n\n• dizziness, tingling feelings like pins and needles or electric shock like feelings (particularly in the \nhead), sleep disturbances (vivid dreams, nightmares, inability to sleep), fatigue, sleepiness, feeling \n\nrestless or agitated, feeling anxious, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting), shaking \n\n(tremor), headaches, muscle pain, feeling irritable, diarrhoea, excessive sweating or vertigo. \n\n \n\nThese symptoms are usually not serious and disappear within a few days, but if you have symptoms that \n\nare troublesome you should ask your doctor for advice. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
