NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nErivedge 150 mg hard capsules  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains 150 mg of vismodegib. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nEach hard capsule contains 71.5 mg lactose monohydrate per capsule. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule (capsule). \n \nPink coloured opaque body marked “150 mg” and a grey opaque cap marked “VISMO” with black ink. \nThe size of the capsule is ‘Size 1’ (dimensions 19.0 x 6.6 mm). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indication \n \nErivedge is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with: \n• symptomatic metastatic basal cell carcinoma \n• locally advanced basal cell carcinoma inappropriate for surgery or radiotherapy (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nErivedge should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of a specialist physician experienced \nin the management of the approved indication. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is one 150 mg capsule taken once daily. \n \nMissed doses \nIf a dose is missed, patients should be instructed not to take the missed dose but to resume with the \nnext scheduled dose. \n \nDuration of treatment \nIn clinical trials, treatment with Erivedge was continued until disease progression or until unacceptable \ntoxicity. Treatment interruptions of up to 4 weeks were allowed based on individual tolerability. \n \nBenefit of continued treatment should be regularly assessed, with the optimal duration of therapy \nvarying for each individual patient. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients ≥ 65years of age (see section 5.2). Of a total number of \n138 patients in 4 clinical trials of Erivedge in advanced basal cell carcinoma, approximately 40 % of \npatients were ≥ 65 years old and no overall differences in safety and efficacy were observed between \nthese patients and younger patients. \n \nRenal impairment \nMild and moderate renal impairment is not expected to impact the elimination of vismodegib and no \ndose adjustment is needed. Very limited data is available in patients with severe renal impairment. \nPatients with severe renal impairment should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment defined \nbased on National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI-ODWG)- criteria for \nhepatic impairment:  \n\n• mild:total bilirubin (TB) ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase \n(AST)>ULN or ULN<TB≤1.5xULN, AST any \n\n• moderate: 1.5 x ULN < TB < 3 x ULN, AST any \n• severe: 3 x ULN < TB < 10 x ULN, AST any  \n\n(see section 5.2) \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Erivedge in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been \nestablished. \nDue to safety concerns (see sections 4.4 and 5.3), this medicinal product should not be used in children \nand adolescents aged below 18 years. \n \nMethod of administration  \nErivedge is for oral use.The capsules must be swallowed whole with water, with or without food \n(see section 5.2). The capsules must not be opened, to avoid unintended exposure to patients and \nhealth care providers. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n• Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n• Women of childbearing potential who do not comply with the Erivedge Pregnancy Prevention \n\nProgramme (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n• Coadministration of St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEmbryo-foetal death or severe birth defects \nErivedge may cause embryo-foetal death or severe birth defects when administered to a pregnant \nwoman (see section 4.6). Hedgehog pathway inhibitors, (see section 5.1) such as vismodegib, have \nbeen demonstrated to be embryotoxic and/or teratogenic in multiple animal species and can cause \nsevere malformations, including craniofacial anomalies, midline defects and limb defects \n(see section 5.3). Erivedge must not be used during pregnancy. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nCriteria for a woman of childbearing potential (WCBP) \nA WCBP is defined in the Erivedge Pregnancy Prevention Programme as: \n• a sexually mature female who  \n\n• has menstruated at any time during the previous 12 consecutive months,  \n• has not undergone a hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy, or who does not have \n\nmedically-confirmed permanent premature ovarian failure,  \n• does not have a XY genotype, Turner’s syndrome, or uterine agenesis, \n• becomes amenorrhoeic following cancer therapy, including treatment with Erivedge. \n\n \nCounselling \nFor a WCBP \nErivedge is contraindicated in a WCBP who does not comply with the Erivedge Pregnancy Prevention \nProgramme.  \nA WCBP must understand that: \n• Erivedge exposes a teratogenic risk to the unborn child, \n• She must not take Erivedge if she is pregnant or plans to become pregnant, \n• She must have a negative pregnancy test, conducted by a health care provider within 7 days \n\nbefore starting Erivedge treatment,  \n• She must have a negative pregnancy test monthly during treatment, even if she has become \n\namenorrhoeic, \n• She must not become pregnant while taking Erivedge and for 24 months after her final dose, \n• She must be able to comply with effective contraceptive measures, \n• She must use 2 methods of recommended contraception (see the ‘Contraception' section below \n\nand section 4.6) while she is taking Erivedge, unless she commits to not having sexual \nintercourse (abstinence), \n\n• She must tell her healthcare provider if any of the following occur during treatment and for \n24 months after her final dose: \n• If she becomes pregnant or think for any reason that she may be pregnant, \n• If she misses her expected menstrual period, \n• If she stops using contraception unless she commits to not having sexual intercourse \n\n(abstinence), \n• If she needs to change contraception during treatment, \n\n• She must not breast-feed while taking Erivedge and for 24 months after the final dose. \n \nFor men \nVismodegib is present in semen. To avoid potential foetal exposure during pregnancy, a male patient \nmust understand that: \n• Erivedge exposes a teratogenic risk to the unborn child if he engages in unprotected sexual \n\nactivity with a pregnant woman, \n• He must always use the recommended contraception (see the ‘Contraception' section below and \n\nsection 4.6),  \n• He will tell his healthcare provider if his female partner becomes pregnant while he is taking \n\nErivedge or during the 2 months after his final dose. \n \nFor health care providers (HCP) \nHCPs must educate the patients so they understand and acknowledge all the conditions of the Erivedge \nPregnancy Prevention Programme.  \n \nContraception \nWCBP \nFemale patients must use two methods of recommended contraception including one highly effective \nmethod and a barrier method during Erivedge therapy and for 24 months after the final dose \n(see section 4.6).  \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nMen \nMale patients must always use a condom (with spermicide, if available), even after a vasectomy, when \nhaving sex with a female partner while taking Erivedge and for 2 months after the final dose \n(see section 4.6). \n \nPregnancy testing \nIn a WCBP, a medically supervised pregnancy test, conducted by a heath care provider, should be \nperformed within 7 days prior to initiating treatment and monthly during treatment. Pregnancy tests \nshould have a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL as per local availability. Patients who present with \namenorrhoea during treatment with Erivedge should continue monthly pregnancy testing while on \ntreatment.  \n \nPrescribing and dispensing restrictions for WCBP \nThe initial prescription and dispensing of Erivedge should occur within a maximum of 7 days of a \nnegative pregnancy test (day of pregnancy test = day 1). Prescriptions of Erivedge should be limited \nto 28 days of treatment and continuation of treatment requires a new prescription. \n \nEducational material \nIn order to assist health care providers and patients to avoid embryonic and foetal exposure to \nErivedge the Marketing Authorisation Holder will provide educational materials (Erivedge Pregnancy \nPrevention Programme) to reinforce the potential risks associated with the use of Erivedge.  \n \nEffects on post-natal development \nPremature fusion of the epiphyses and precocious puberty have been reported in paediatric patients \nexposed to Erivedge. Due to the long drug elimination half-life, these events may occur or progress \nafter drug discontinuation. In animal species, vismodegib has been shown to cause severe irreversible \nchanges in growing teeth (degeneration/necrosis of odontoblasts, formation of fluid-filled cysts in the \ndental pulp, ossification of the root canal, and haemorrhage) and closure of the epiphyseal growth \nplate. The findings of premature fusion of the epiphyses indicate a potential risk for short stature and \ntooth deformities to infants and children (see section 5.3). \n \nBlood donation \nPatients should not donate blood while taking Erivedge and for 24 months after the final dose. \n \nSemen donation \nMale patients should not donate semen while taking Erivedge and for 2 months after the final dose. \n \nInteractions \nConcomitant treatment with strong CYP inducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine or phenytoin) \nshould be avoided, as a risk for decreased plasma concentrations and decreased efficacy of vismodegib \ncannot be excluded (see also section 4.5).    \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions  \n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \nand acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), which can be life-threatening, have been \nreported during post-marketing use (see section 4.8). If the patient has developed any of these \nreactions with the use of vismodegib, treatment with vismodegib must not be restarted in this patient at \nany time.  \n \nCutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC)  \nPatients with advanced BCC have an increased risk of developing cuSCC. Cases of cuSCC have been \nreported in advanced BCC patients treated with Erivedge. It has not been determined whether cuSCC \nis related to Erivedge treatment. Therefore, all patients should be monitored routinely while taking \nErivedge, and cuSCC should be treated according to the standard of care. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nAdditional precautions  \nPatients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person. Any unused \ncapsules at the end of treatment should immediately be disposed of by the patient in accordance with \nlocal requirements (if applicable, e.g. by returning the capsules to their pharmacist or physician). \n \nExcipients \nErivedge capsules contain lactose monohydrate. Patients with a rare hereditary problem of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium \nfree’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of concomitant medicinal products on vismodegib \n \nClinically significant PK interactions between vismodegib and pH elevating agents are not expected. \nResults from a clinical study demonstrated a 33% decrease in vismodegib unbound drug \nconcentrations after 7 days co-treatment with 20 mg rabeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) given 2 h \nbefore each vismodegib administration. This interaction is not expected to be clinically significant.  \n \nClinically significant PK interactions between vismodegib and CYP450 inhibitors are not expected. \nResults from a clinical study demonstrated a 57% increase in vismodegib unbound drug \nconcentrations on day 7 after co-treatment with 400 mg fluconazole (a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor) \ndaily, but this interaction is not expected to be clinically significant. Itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 \ninhibitor) 200 mg daily did not influence vismodegib AUC0-24h after 7 days co-treament in healthy \nvolunteers. \n  \nClinically significant PK interactions between vismodegib and P-gp inhibitors are not expected. \nResults from a clinical study demonstrated no clinically significant PK interaction between \nvismodegib and itraconazole (a strong P-glycoprotein inhibitor) in healthy volunteers. \n \nWhen vismodegib is administered with CYP inducers (rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, \nSt. John´s wort), exposure to vismodegib may be decreased (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nEffects of vismodegib on concomitant medicinal products \n \nContraceptive steroids \nResults of a drug-drug interaction study conducted in cancer patients demonstrated that the systemic \nexposure of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone is not altered when co-administered with vismodegib. \nHowever, the interaction study was of only 7 days duration and it cannot be excluded that vismodegib \nupon longer treatment is an inducer of enzymes which metabolise contraceptive steroids. Induction \ncould lead to decreases in systemic exposure of the contraceptive steroids and thereby reduced \ncontraceptive efficacy. \n \nEffects on specific enzymes and transporters \nIn vitro studies indicate that vismodegib has the potential to act as an inhibitor of breast cancer \nresistance protein (BCRP). In vivo interaction data is not available. It may not be excluded that \nvismodegib may give rise to increased exposure of medicinal products transported by this protein, \nsuch as rosuvastatin, topotecan, and sulfasalazin. Concomitant administration should be performed \nwith caution and a dose adjustment may be necessary. \n \nClinically significant PK interactions between vismodegib and CYP450 substrates are not expected. In \nvitro, CYP2C8 was the most sensitive CYP isoform for vismodegib inhibition. However, results of a \ndrug-drug interaction study conducted in cancer patients demonstrated that the systemic exposure of \nrosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) is not altered when co-administered with vismodegib. Thus \ninhibition of CYP enzymes by vismodegib in vivo may be excluded. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nIn vitro, vismodegib is an inhibitor of OATP1B1. It cannot be excluded that vismodegib may increase \nthe exposure to substrates of OATP1B1, e.g. bosentan, ezetimibe, glibenclamide, repaglinide, \nvalsartan and statins. In particular, caution should be exercised if vismodegib is administered in \ncombination with any statin.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential (WCBP) \nDue to the risk of embryo-foetal death or severe birth defects caused by vismodegib, women taking \nErivedge must not be pregnant or become pregnant during treatment and for 24 months after the final \ndose (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \nErivedge is contraindicated in WCBP who do not comply with the Erivedge Pregnancy Prevention \nProgramme. \n \nIn case of pregnancy or missed menstrual periods \nIf the patient does become pregnant, misses a menstrual period, or suspects for any reason that she \nmay be pregnant, she must notify her treating physician immediately. \nPersistent lack of menses during treatment with Erivedge should be assumed to indicate pregnancy \nuntil medical evaluation and confirmation. \n \nContraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential (WCBP) \nWCBP must be able to comply with effective contraceptive measures. She must use two methods of \nrecommended contraception including one highly effective method and a barrier method during \nErivedge therapy and for 24 months after the final dose. WCBP, whose periods are irregular or \nstopped, must follow all the advice on effective contraception. \n \nMen \nVismodegib is present in semen. To avoid potential foetal exposure during pregnancy, male patients \nmust always use a condom (with spermicide, if available), even after a vasectomy, when having sex \nwith a female partner while taking Erivedge and for 2 months after the final dose. \n \nThe following are recommended forms of highly effective methods:  \n• Hormonal depot injection,  \n• Tubal sterilisation,  \n• Vasectomy,  \n• Intrauterine device (IUD).  \n\n \nThe following are recommended forms of barrier methods:  \n• Any male condom (with spermicide, if available), \n• Diaphragm (with spermicide, if available). \n \nPregnancy \nErivedge may cause embryo-foetal death or severe birth defects when administered to a pregnant \nwoman (see section 4.4). Hedgehog pathway inhibitors (see section 5.1) such as vismodegib, have \nbeen demonstrated to be embryotoxic and/or teratogenic in multiple animal species and can cause \nsevere malformations, including craniofacial anomalies, midline defects and limb defects \n(see section 5.3). In case of pregnancy in a woman treated with Erivedge, treatment must be stopped \nimmediately. \n \nBreast-feeding  \nThe extent to which vismodegib is excreted in breast milk is not known. Due to its potential to cause \nserious developmental defects women must not breast-feed while taking Erivedge and for 24 months \nafter the final dose (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nFertility \nHuman female fertility may be compromised by treatment with Erivedge (see section 5.3). \nReversibility of fertility impairment is unknown. Additionally, amenorrhoea has been observed in \nclinical trials in WCBP (see section 4.8). Fertility preservation strategies should be discussed with \nWCBP prior to starting treatment with Erivedge.  \n \nFertility impairment in human males is not expected (see Section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nErivedge has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most common adverse drug reactions (ADR) occurring in ≥ 30 % of patients, were muscle spasms \n(74.6 %), alopecia (65.9%), dysgeusia (58.7%), weight decreased (50.0%), fatigue (47.1%), nausea \n(34.8 %) and diarrhea (33.3%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nADRs are presented in table 1 below by system organ class (SOC) and absolute frequency.  \nFrequencies are defined as:  \nVery common ( ≥ 1/10) \nCommon ( ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \nUncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) \nRare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) \nVery rare ( < 1/10,000) \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \nWithin each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe safety of Erivedge has been evaluated in clinical trials with 138 patients treated for advanced \nbasal cell carcinoma (aBCC), which includes both metastatic BCC (mBCC) and locally advanced \nBCC (laBCC). In four open label phase 1 and 2 clinical trials patients were treated with at least one \ndose of Erivedge monotherapy at doses ≥ 150 mg. Doses > 150 mg did not result in higher plasma \nconcentrations in clinical trials and patients on doses > 150 mg have been included in the analysis. \nAdditionally, safety was assessed in a post approval study that included 1215 aBCC patients evaluable \nfor safety and treated with 150 mg. In general the safety profile observed was consistent in both \nmBCC and laBCC patients and across studies as described below. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 1  ADRs occurring in patients treated with Erivedge \n \nMedDRA SOC Very common Common Frequency not known \nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nDecreased appetite \n \n\nDehydration \n \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorder \n\nDysgeusia  \nAgeusia \n\nHypogeusia  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea \nDiarrhoea \nConstipation \nVomiting \nDyspepsia \n\nAbdominal pain upper \nAbdominal pain \n \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n \n\n Hepatic enzymes \nincreased** \n \n\nDrug induced liver \ninjury***** \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nAlopecia \nPruritus \nRash \n\nMadarosis \nAbnormal hair growth \n \n\nStevens-Johnson Syndrome \n(SJS)/Toxic Epidermal \nNecrolysis (TEN), Drug \nReaction with Eosinophilia \nand Systemic Symptoms \n(DRESS) and Acute \nGeneralised Exanthematous \nPustulosis (AGEP)****** \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nMuscle spasms \nArthralgia \nPain in extremity \n \n\nBack pain \nMusculoskeletal chest \npain \nMyalgia \nFlank pain \nMusculoskeletal pain \nBlood creatine \nphosphokinase \nincreased*** \n\nEpiphyses premature \nfusion**** \n \n\nEndocrine disorders   Precocious puberty**** \n\nReproductive system \nand breast disorders \n\nAmenorrhoea*   \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nWeight decreased \nFatigue \nPain \n\nAsthenia \n \n\n \n\nAll reporting is based on ADRs of all grades using National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for \nAdverse Events v 3.0 except where noted. \n*Of the 138 patients with advanced BCC, 10 were WCBP.

Healthcare \n\n\n\n10 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nErivedge has been administered at doses 3.6 times higher than the recommended 150 mg daily dose. \nNo increases in plasma vismodegib levels or toxicity were observed during these clinical trials. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX43. \n \nMechanism of action \nVismodegib is an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the Hedgehog pathway. Hedgehog \npathway signalling through the Smoothened transmembrane protein (SMO) leads to the activation and \nnuclear localisation of Glioma-Associated Oncogene (GLI) transcription factors and induction of \nHedgehog target genes. Many of these genes are involved in proliferation, survival, and differentiation. \nVismodegib binds to and inhibits the SMO protein thereby blocking Hedgehog signal transduction. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe pivotal trial, ERIVANCE BCC (SHH4476g), was an international, single-arm, multi-centre, \n2-cohort study. Metastatic BCC was defined as BCC that had spread beyond the skin to other parts of \nthe body, including the lymph nodes, lung, bones and/or internal organs. LaBCC patients had \ncutaneous lesions that were inappropriate for surgery (inoperable, multiply recurrent where curative \nresection deemed to be unlikely or for whom surgery would result in substantial deformity or \nmorbidity) and for which radiotherapy was unsuccessful or contraindicated or inappropriate. Prior to \nstudy enrolment, diagnosis of BCC was confirmed by histology. Patients with Gorlin syndrome who \nhad at least one aBCC lesion and met inclusion criteria were eligible to participate in the study. \nPatients were treated with oral daily dosing of Erivedge at 150 mg.  \n \nThe median age of the efficacy evaluable population was 62 years (46 % were at least 65 years old), \n61 % male and 100 % White. For the mBCC cohort, 97 % of patients had prior therapy including \nsurgery (97 %), radiotherapy (58 %), and systemic therapies (30 %). For the laBCC cohort (n = 63), \n94 % of patients had prior therapies including surgery (89 %), radiotherapy (27 %), and \nsystemic/topical therapies (11 %). The median duration of treatment was 12.9 months (range 0.7 to \n47.8 months).  \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n11 \n\nThe primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by an independent review \nfacility (IRF) as summarised in Table 2. Objective response was defined as a complete or partial \nresponse determined on two consecutive assessments separated by at least 4 weeks. In the mBCC \ncohort, tumour response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours \n(RECIST) version 1.0. In the laBCC cohort, tumour response was assessed based on visual assessment \nof external tumour and ulceration, tumour imaging (where appropriate), and tumour biopsy. A patient \nwas considered a responder in the laBCC cohort if at least one of the following criteria was met and \nthe patient did not experience progression: (1) ≥ 30 % reduction in lesion size [sum of the longest \ndiameter (SLD)], from baseline in target lesions by radiography; (2) ≥ 30 % reduction in SLD from \nbaseline in externally visible dimension of target lesions; (3) Complete resolution of ulceration in all \ntarget lesions.

According to investigator assessment, the median time to maximum tumour reduction \noccurred in 6.7 and 5.5 months for laBCC and mBCC patients respectively.  \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \nIn a thorough QTc study in 60 healthy subjects, there was no effect of therapeutic doses of Erivedge \non the QTc interval. \n \nPost approval study results \nA post-approval, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter, phase II clinical trial (MO25616) was \nconducted in 1232 patients with advanced BCC, of whom 1215 patients were evaluable for efficacy \nand safety with laBCC (n = 1119) or mBCC (n = 96). LaBCC was defined as cutaneous lesions that \nwere inappropriate for surgery (inoperable, or for whom surgery would result in substantial deformity) \nand for which radiotherapy was unsuccessful or contraindicated. Metastatic BCC was defined as \nhistologically confirmed distant metastasis. Prior to study enrollment, diagnosis of BCC was \nconfirmed by histology. Patients were treated with oral daily dosing of Erivedge at 150mg.  \nThe median age for all patients was 72 years. The majority of patients were male (57%); 8% had \nmBCC whereas 92% had laBCC. For the metastatic cohort, the majority of patients had prior therapies, \nincluding surgery (91%), radiotherapy (62%) and systemic therapy (16%). For the locally advanced \ncohort, the majority of patients had prior therapies, including surgery (85%), radiotherapy (28%) and \nsystemic therapy (7%). The median duration of treatment for all patients was 8.6 months (range 0 to \n44.1).  \nAmong patients in the efficacy-evaluable population with measurable and histologically confirmed \ndisease, 68.5% and 36.9% responded to treatment in the laBCC and mBCC cohorts, respectively, by \nRECIST v1.1. Of patients who had a confirmed response (partial or complete), the median Duration of \nResponse was 23.0 months (95% CI:  20.4, 26.7) in the laBCC cohort and 13.9 months (95% CI:  9.2, \nNE) in the mBCC cohort. Complete response was achieved in 4.8% patients in the mBCC cohort and \n33.4% in the laBCC cohort. Partial response was achieved in 32.1% patients in the mBCC cohort and \n35.1% in the laBCC cohort. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nErivedge in all subsets of the paediatric population with basal cell carcinoma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nErivedge is a highly permeable compound with low aqueous solubility (BCS Class 2). The single dose \nmean (CV %) absolute bioavailability of Erivedge is 31.8 (14.5) %. Absorption is saturable as \nevidenced by the lack of dose proportional increase in exposure after a single dose of 270 mg and \n540 mg Erivedge. Under clinically relevant conditions (steady state), the PK of vismodegib is not \naffected by food. Therefore, Erivedge may be taken without regard to meals. \n \nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution for vismodegib is low, ranging from 16.4 to 26.6 L. In vitro binding of \nvismodegib to human plasma proteins is high (97 %) at clinically relevant concentrations. Vismodegib \nbinds to both human serum albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG). In vitro binding to AAG is \nsaturable at clinically relevant concentrations. Ex vivo plasma protein binding in human patients is \n> 99 %. Vismodegib concentrations are strongly correlated with AAG levels, showing parallel \nfluctuations of AAG and total vismodegib over time and consistently low unbound vismodegib levels. \n \nBiotransformation \nVismodegib is slowly eliminated by a combination of metabolism and excretion of parent drug \nsubstance. Vismodegib is predominant in plasma, with concentrations representing greater than 98 % \n\n\n\n14 \n\nof the total circulating concentrations (including associated metabolites). Metabolic pathways of \nvismodegib in humans include oxidation, glucuronidation, and an uncommon pyridine ring cleavage. \nCYP2C9 appears to contribute in part to vismodegib metabolism in vivo. \n \nElimination \nAfter oral administration of a radiolabelled dose, vismodegib is absorbed and slowly eliminated by a \ncombination of metabolism and excretion of parent drug substance, the majority of which is recovered \nin the faeces (82 % of the administered dose), with 4.4 % of the administered dose recovered in urine. \nVismodegib and associated metabolic products are eliminated primarily by the hepatic route. \nAfter continuous once-daily dosing, the pharmacokinetics of vismodegib appears to be nonlinear due \nto saturable absorption and saturable protein binding. After a single oral dose, vismodegib has a \nterminal half-life of ca. 12 days.  \nThe apparent half-life of vismodegib at steady-state is estimated to be 4 days with continuous daily \ndosing. Upon continuous daily dosing, there is a 3 fold accumulation of vismodegib total plasma \nconcentrations. \n \nVismodegib inhibits UGT2B7 in vitro and it may not be excluded that inhibition can take place in vivo \nin the intestine. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly \nThere are limited data in older people. In clinical trials with aBCC, approximately 40 % of patients \nwere of geriatric age (≥ 65 years). Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that age did not have a \nclinically significant impact on steady-state concentration of vismodegib. \n \nGender \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis of combined data from 121 males and 104 females, \ngender did not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of vismodegib. \n \nRace \nThere are limited data in non-Caucasian patients. Since the number of subjects who were not \nCaucasian comprised only < 3% of the total population (6 Black, 219 Caucasian), race was not \nevaluated as a covariate in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal excretion of orally administered vismodegib is low. Therefore, mild and moderate renal \nimpairment is unlikely to have a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of vismodegib. \nBased on a population PK analysis in patients with mild (BSA-indexed CrCl 50 to 80 mL/min, n=58) \nand  moderate (BSA-indexed CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min, n=16) renal impairment, mild and moderate \nimpaired renal function had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of vismodegib \n(see section 4.2). Very limited data is available in patients with severe renal impairments. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe major elimination pathways of vismodegib involve hepatic metabolism and biliary/intestinal \nsecretion. In a clinical study in patients with hepatic impairment (degree of impairment based on \nsubject’s AST and total bilirubin levels) following multiple doses of vismodegib, it was shown that in \npatients with mild (NCI-ODWG criteria, n=8), moderate (NCI-ODWG criteria, n=6), and severe \n(NCI-ODWG criteria, n=3) hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetic profile of vismodegib was \ncomparable to that of subjects with normal hepatic function (n=9) (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere are insufficient pharmacokinetic data in paediatric patients.  \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe preclinical safety profile of Erivedge was assessed in mice, rats, and dogs. \n \nRepeat-dose toxicity \nIn general, the tolerability of Erivedge in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs was limited by \nnonspecific manifestations of toxicity including decreased body weight gain and food consumption. \nAdditional findings at clinically relevant exposures included faecal changes; skeletal muscle twitching \nor tremors; alopecia; swelling, follicular hyperkeratosis, and inflammation in paw pads; and increased \nLDL and HDL cholesterol. Decreased haematocrit or platelet count were observed in some dogs at \nclinically relevant exposures; however, there was no evidence of a primary effect on bone marrow in \naffected animals. \n \nCarcinogenicity \nCarcinogenicity studies were performed in mice and rats.  Carcinogenic potential was identified in rats \nonly and was limited to benign hair follicle tumors, including pilomatricomas and keratoacanthomas \nrespectively at ≥ 0.1-fold and ≥0.6-fold of the steady-state AUC(0-24h) of the recommended human \ndose. No malignant tumors were identified in either species tested. Benign hair follicle tumors have \nnot been reported in clinical trials with Erivedge, and the relevance of this finding to humans is \nuncertain. \n \nMutagenicity \nThere was no evidence of genotoxicity in in vitro assays (reverse bacterial mutagenesis [Ames] and \nhuman lymphocyte chromosome aberration assays) or in the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus \nassay. \n \nFertility \nIn the dedicated 26-week vismodegib rat fertility study, significantly increased absolute weights of \nseminal vesicles and reduced absolute weights of prostate were observed. In addition, the ratio of \norgan weight to terminal body weight was significantly increased for epididymis, cauda epididymis, \ntestes and seminal vesicles.  In the same study there were no histopathological findings in male \nreproductive organs and no effects on male fertility endpoints, including percent motile sperm, \nobserved at 100 mg/kg/day at the end of dosing or recovery phase (corresponding to 1.3-fold of the \nsteady-state AUC0-24h at the recommended human dose).  In addition, in the vismodegib general \ntoxicity studies up to 26-week in sexually mature rats and dogs, no effects on male reproductive \norgans were observed. Increased number of degenerating germ cells and hypospermia in sexually \nimmature dogs observed at ≥ 50 mg/kg/day in the 4-week general toxicity study was of undetermined \nrelationship to vismodegib.   \n \nIn the dedicated 26-week vismodegib rat fertility study, vismodegib-related effects on female \nreproductive organs were observed at 100 mg/kg/day immediately after treatment discontinuation, \nincluding decreased implantations, increased percent preimplantation loss, and decreased number of \ndams with viable embryos. Similar findings were not observed after a 16 week recovery period.  No \ncorrelative histopathologic changes were observed.  The exposure in female rats at 100 mg/kg \ncorresponds to 1.2-fold of the steady-state AUC0-24h at the recommended human dose.  In addition, \nin the vismodegib general 26-week toxicity study, decreased number of corpora lutea was observed at \n100 mg/kg/day; the effect was not reversed by the end of an 8 week recovery period. \n \nTeratogenicity \nIn an embryo-foetal development study in which pregnant rats were administered vismodegib daily \nduring organogenesis, vismodegib crossed the placenta and was severely toxic to the conceptus. \nMalformations, including craniofacial anomalies, open perineum, and absent and/or fused digits, were \nobserved in foetuses of dams at a dose which corresponded to 20 % of the typical steady-state \nexposure in patients, and a 100 % incidence of embryolethality was observed at higher doses.  \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nPost-natal development \nDedicated studies to assess the potential of vismodegib to affect post-natal development have not been \nperformed. However, irreversible defects in growing teeth and premature closure of the femoral \nepiphyseal plate, observed in rat toxicity studies at clinically relevant exposures, represent risks to \npost-natal development. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nErivedge 150 mg hard capsules  \nvismodegib \n\n \nErivedge may cause severe birth defects. It may lead to the death of a baby before it is born or shortly \nafter being born. You must not become pregnant while taking this medicine. You must follow the \ncontraception advice described in this leaflet. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n \n1. What Erivedge is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Erivedge \n3. How to take Erivedge \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Erivedge \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Erivedge is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Erivedge is \nErivedge is an anti-cancer medicine and contains the active substance vismodegib.  \n \nWhat Erivedge is used for \nErivedge is used to treat adults with a type of skin cancer called advanced basal cell carcinoma. It is \nused when the cancer: \n• has spread to other parts of the body (called “metastatic” basal cell carcinoma)  \n• has spread to areas nearby (called “locally advanced” basal cell carcinoma) and your doctor \n\ndecides that treatment with surgery or radiation is inappropriate. \n \nHow Erivedge works \nBasal cell carcinoma develops when DNA in normal skin cells becomes damaged and the body cannot \nrepair the damage. This damage can change how certain proteins in these cells work and the damaged \ncells become cancerous and begin to grow and divide. Erivedge is an anti-cancer medicine that works \nby controlling one of the key proteins involved in basal cell carcinoma. This may slow down or stop \nthe growth of the cancer cells, or may kill them. As a result, your skin cancer may shrink. \n \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Erivedge \n \nRead the specific instructions given to you by your doctor, particularly on the effects of Erivedge on \nunborn babies. \n \nRead carefully and follow the instructions of the patient brochure and reminder card given to you by \nyour doctor. \n \nDo not take Erivedge \n• if you are allergic to vismodegib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n• if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant during the \n\ncourse of treatment or during the 24 months after your final dose of this medicine. This is \nbecause Erivedge may harm or cause the death of your unborn baby. \n\n• if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed during the course of treatment or during \nthe 24 months after your final dose of this medicine. This is because it is unknown whether \nErivedge can pass into your milk and cause harm to your baby. \n\n• if you are able to become pregnant but are unable or unwilling to follow the necessary \npregnancy prevention measures that are listed in the Erivedge Pregnancy Prevention \nProgramme,  \n\n• if you are also taking St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) – a herbal medicine used for \ndepression (see “Other medicines and Erivedge”). \n\n \nMore information on the issues above is found in the sections “Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility” \nand “Contraception – for men and women”. \n \nDo not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking Erivedge. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Erivedge if you have questions on the information in \nthis section: \n \n• You should not donate blood at any time during treatment and for 24 months after your final \n\ndose of this medicine. \n• If you are male, you should not donate semen at any time during treatment and for 2 months \n\nafter the final dose.  \n• Serious skin reactions have been reported in association with Erivedge treatment. Stop using \n\nErivedge and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms described \nin section 4. \n\n• Your doctor should check your skin regularly for a type of cancer called “cutaneous squamous \ncell carcinoma’ (SCC). It is not known if SCC is related to treatment with Erivedge. Usually \nthis type of lesion appears on sun-damaged skin, remains local and can be cured. Tell your \ndoctor in case you notice any changes in your skin.• Never give this medicine to anyone \nelse. You should return unused capsules at the end of your treatment. Talk to your doctor or \npharmacist regarding where to return the capsules. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Erivedge in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years is not recommended. This is \nbecause it is not known if it is safe or effective in this age group. Erivedge can cause bones to stop \ngrowing and lead to premature onset of puberty (before age 8 years in girls or age 9 years in boys). \nThis can happen even after stopping Erivedge. Problems with growing teeth and bones were seen in \nanimal studies with this medicine. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nOther medicines and Erivedge \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nThis also includes non-prescription medicines, vitamins and herbal medicines. \n \nSome medicines may affect how Erivedge works, or make it more likely that you will have side effects. \nErivedge can also affect how some other medicines work.  \nIn particular, tell your doctor if you take any of the following medicines: \n• rifampicin – used for bacterial infections, \n• carbamazepine, phenytoin – used for epilepsy, \n• ezetimibe and statins , such as atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin – \n\nused for high cholesterol, \n• bosentan, glibenclamide, repaglinide, valsartan,   \n• topotecan – used for certain types of cancer, \n• sulfasalazine – used for certain inflammatory disorders, and especially, \n• St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) – a herbal medicine used for depression, since you \n\nmust not use it at the same time as Erivedge. \n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nPregnancy \nDo not take Erivedge if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to become \npregnant during the course of treatment or during the 24 months after your final dose of this medicine. \nYou must stop treatment and inform your doctor straight away if: you miss or think you have missed a \nperiod, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect you are pregnant. If you do become \npregnant during the treatment with Erivedge, you must stop the treatment and inform your doctor \nimmediately. \n\nErivedge may cause severe birth defects. It may also lead to the death of the unborn baby. Specific \ninstructions (the Erivedge Pregnancy Prevention Programme), given to you by your doctor contain \ninformation particularly on the effects of Erivedge on unborn babies. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed during your treatment and for 24 months after your final dose of this medicine. It is \nnot known if Erivedge can pass into your breast milk and harm your baby. \n \nFertility \nErivedge may affect a woman’s ability to have children. Some women taking Erivedge have stopped \nhaving periods. If this happens to you, it is not known if your periods will come back. Talk to your \ndoctor if you wish to have children in the future.  \n \nContraception – for men and women  \nFor women taking Erivedge \nBefore starting the treatment, ask your doctor if you are able to become pregnant. Even if your periods \nhave stopped, it is essential to ask your doctor if there is any risk that you could become pregnant. \n\nIf you are able to become pregnant: \n• you must take precautions so that you do not become pregnant while taking Erivedge \n• use 2 methods of contraception, one highly effective method and one barrier method (please see \n\nthe examples below) \n• you need to continue contraception for 24 months after your final dose of this medicine – \n\nbecause Erivedge may remain in your body for up to 24 months after your final dose. \n \nMethod of recommended contraception: Talk to your doctor about the best two contraception methods \nfor you.   \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nUse one highly effective method, such as: \n• a contraceptive depot injection  \n• an intra-uterine device (“the coil” or IUD) \n• surgical sterilisation. \n \nYou must also use one barrier method, such as: \n• a condom (with spermicide, if available) \n• a diaphragm (with spermicide, if available). \n \nYour doctor will make sure to test you for pregnancy: \n• within a maximum of 7 days before starting treatment – to make sure that you are not already \n\npregnant \n• every month during treatment.  \n \nYou must tell your doctor immediately during the course of treatment or during the 24 months after \nyour final dose of this medicine if: \n• you think your contraception has failed for any reason, \n• your periods stop,  \n• you stop using contraception,  \n• you need to change contraception.  \n \nFor men taking Erivedge \nErivedge can pass into semen. Always use a condom (with spermicide, if available) even after a \nvasectomy, when you have sex with a female partner. Do this during treatment and for 2 months after \nyour final dose of this medicine.  \n \nYou should not donate semen at any time during treatment and for 2 months after your final dose of \nthis medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nErivedge is unlikely to affect your ability to drive, use any tools or machines. Talk to your doctor if \nyou are not sure. \n \nErivedge contains lactose and sodium \nErivedge contains a type of sugar called lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, i.e. essentially ‘sodium free’.  \n \n \n3. How to take Erivedge \n \nAlways take Erivedge exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure.  \n \nTaking this medicine \nThe recommended dose is one capsule each day. \n• Swallow the capsule whole with a drink of water. \n• Do not crush, open or chew the capsule, to avoid unintended exposure to the capsule contents. \n• Erivedge can be taken with or without food. \n \nIf you take more Erivedge than you should \nIf you take more Erivedge than you should, talk to your doctor. \n \nIf you forget to take Erivedge \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, but resume with the next scheduled dose. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \nIf you stop taking Erivedge \nDo not stop taking this medicine without talking to your doctor first as this could make your treatment \nless effective. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Erivedge can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nErivedge may cause severe birth defects.

At least one case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis (SJS/TEN), 2 cases of Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \nand one case of acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) are causally related to the \ntreatment, based on clinical and pathological features, and the compatible temporal relationship. \nAlthough the number of identified cases is limited, the reactions are serious and the association with \nvismodegib is plausible. The PRAC therefore recommends that the Product Information should be \nupdated accordingly.  \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for vismodegib the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing vismodegib is unchanged subject to the \nproposed changes to the product information. \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
