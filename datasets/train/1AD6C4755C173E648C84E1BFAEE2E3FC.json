NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma 20 mg concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach single-dose vial of Docetaxel Teva Pharma concentrate contains 20 mg docetaxel (anhydrous). \nEach ml of concentrate contains 27.73 mg docetaxel. \n \nExcipients with known effect:  \nEach vial of concentrate contains 25.1% (w/w) anhydrous ethanol. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\nConcentrate and solvent for solution for infusion. \nThe concentrate is a clear viscous, yellow to brown-yellow solution. \nThe solvent is a colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced \nor metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have \nincluded an anthracycline or an alkylating agent. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic \nnon-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with \nunresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not \npreviously received chemotherapy for this condition. \n \nProstate cancer \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment \nof patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nThe use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the \nuse of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \nRecommended dose \n \nFor breast and non-small cell lung cancer, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as \ndexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 3\n\nadministration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used \nto mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. \n \nFor prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or prednisolone the recommended \npremedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel \ninfusion (see section 4.4).  \n \nDocetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks. \n \nBreast cancer \nFor the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose \nof docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy.  \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nIn chemotherapy na\u00efve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen \nis docetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment \nafter failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m\u00b2 as a single \nagent. \n \nProstate cancer \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily \nis administered continuously (see section 5.1). \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nGeneral \nDocetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is \u22651,500 cells/mm3. \nIn patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count <500 cells/mm3 for more than \none week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel \ntherapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from \n75 to 60 mg/m\u00b2. If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m\u00b2, the treatment \nshould be discontinued. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin \nFor patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose \nnadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who \nexperience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel \ndose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2.  For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the \ncorresponding summary of product characeteristics. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment  \nBased on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent, patients who have both \nelevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal \nrange (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of \ndocetaxel is 75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin >ULN and/or \nALT and AST >3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase >6 times the ULN, no \ndose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Docetaxel Teva Pharma in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged \n1 month to less than 18 years have not yet been established. \nThere is no relevant use of Docetaxel Teva Pharma in the paediatric population in the indications \nbreast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer. \n \nOlder People \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 4\n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in older \npeople. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with baseline neutrophil count of <1,500 cells/mm3. \n \nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with severe liver impairment since there is no data available \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nContraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nFor breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as \ndexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel \nadministration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well \nas the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral \ndexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). \n \nHaematology \n \nNeutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median \nof 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of \ncomplete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be \nretreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level \u22651,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). \n \nIn the case of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of \ndocetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate \nsymptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile \nneutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic \nG-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of \ncomplicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). \nPatients receiving TCF should be closely monitored, (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), \nfebrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received \nprimary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive \nadjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile \nneutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be \nclosely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nPatients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and \nsecond infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation \nof the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should \nbe available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised \ncutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe \nhypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of \ndocetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions \nshould not be re-challenged with docetaxel. \n \nCutaneous reactions \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 5\n\n \nLocalised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema \nfollowed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by \ndesquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nFluid retention \n \nPatients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be \nmonitored closely. \n \nRespiratory disorders \n \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, \npulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure have been reported and may be associated with fatal \noutcome.  Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant \nradiotherapy. \nIf new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly \ninvestigated, and appropriately treated.  Interruption of docetaxel therapy is recommended until \ndiagnosis is available.  Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition.  The \nbenefit of resuming docetaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. \n \nPatients with liver impairment \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels \n(ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels \ngreater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as \ntoxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, \ninfections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel \nin those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at \nbaseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). \nFor patients with serum bilirubin levels >ULN and/or ALT and AST >3.5 times the ULN concurrent \nwith serum alkaline phosphatase levels >6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended \nand docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin> 1 x UNL; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nThere are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel. \n \nNervous system \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). \n \nCardiac toxicity \n \nHeart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, \nparticularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may \nbe moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). \n \nWhen patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they \nshould undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 6\n\ntreatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For \nmore details see Summary of Product Characteristics of trastuzumab. \n \nEye disorders \n \nCystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel.  Patients with \nimpaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examination.  In case CMO is \ndiagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated (see section \n4.8). \n \nOthers \n \nContraceptive measures must be taken by both men and women during treatment and for men at least \n6 months after cessation of therapy (see section 4.6). \n \nAdditional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \nComplicated neutropenia \nFor patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or \ninfection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). \n \nGastrointestinal reactions \nSymptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, \nmay be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated \npromptly. \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) \nPatients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the \nfollow up period. In patients treated with the TAC regimen for node positive breast cancer, the risk of \nCHF has been shown to be higher during the first year after treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nLeukaemia \nIn the docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) treated patients, the risk of delayed \nmyelodysplasia or myeloid leukaemia requires haematological follow-up. \n \nPatients with 4+ nodes \nAs the benefit observed in patient with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on disease-free \nsurvival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ \nnodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis (see section 5.1). \n \nOlder people \nThere are limited data available in patients > 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with \ndoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n \nOf the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study, 209 patients \nwere 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients treated with \ndocetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate \u2265 10% higher in \npatients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The incidence of related \nfever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates \u2265 10% higher in patients who were \n75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years. \n \nAmong the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer \nstudy, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of \nserious adverse events was higher in older people compared to younger patients. \nThe incidence of the following adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection \noccurred at rates \u2265 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger \npatients. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 7\n\nOlder people treated with TCF should be closely monitored. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant \nadministration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the \nenzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as cyclosporine, terfenadine, ketoconazole, \nerythromycin and troleandomycin. As a result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with \nthese medicinal products as concomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. \n \nDocetaxel is highly protein bound (>95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with \nconcomitantly administered medicinal products has not been investigated formally, in vitro \ninteractions with tightly protein-bound drugs such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, \npropafenone, phenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein \nbinding of docetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. \nDocetaxel did not influence the binding of digitoxin. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their \ncoadministration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction \nbetween docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was \nabout 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. \n \nDocetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic \nprostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. \nNo statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \nClinical cases consistent with an increase in docetaxel toxicity were reported when it was combined \nwith ritonavir.  The mechanism behind this interaction is a CYP3A4 inhibition, the main isoenzyme \ninvolved in docetaxel metabolism by ritonavir.  Based on extrapolation from a pharmacokinetic study \nwith ketoconazole in 7 patients, consider a 50% docetaxel dose reduction if patients require co-\nadministrtion of a stron CYP3A4 inhibitor such as azole antifungals, ritonavir and some macrolides \n(clarithromycin, telithromycin). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be \nboth embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats, and to reduce fertility in rats. As with other \ncytotoxic medicinal products, docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant \nwomen. Therefore, docetaxel must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated.  \n \nWomen of childbearing age receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant, and to \ninform the treating physician immediately should this occur. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nDocetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. \nConsequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be \ndiscontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. \n \nContracteption in males and females \n \nAn effective method of contraception should be used during treatment. \n \nFertility \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 8\n\nIn non clinical studies, docetaxel has genotoxic effects and may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). \nTherefore, men being treated with docetaxel are advised not to father a child during and up to \n6 months after treatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile for all indications \n \nThe adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel \nhave been obtained in: \n\u2022 1312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/m\u00b2 and 75 mg/m\u00b2 of docetaxel as a single agent \n\nrespectively. \n\u2022 258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin. \n\u2022 406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin. \n\u2022 92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab. \n\u2022 255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. \n\u2022 332 patients who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone (clinically \n\nimportant treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\u2022 1276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received \n\ndocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important \ntreatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\u2022 300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and \n79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and \n5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\u2022 174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin \nand 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n \nThese reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; \ngrade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4) and the COSTART and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined \nas: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was \nreversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe \nneutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea \nand asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in \ncombination with other chemotherapeutic agents. \n \nFor combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in \u2265 10% are displayed. There \nwas an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the \ntrastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. \n \nFor combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects (\u2265 5%) \nreported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see \ncapecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \nThe following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel: \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 9\n\nImmune system disorders \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the \ninfusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms \nwere flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills.  \nSevere reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized \nrash/erythema (see section 4.4). \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paresthesia, dysesthesia or pain \nincluding burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nReversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to \nmoderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and \nhands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently \nassociated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. \nLess frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to \ninterruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe \nnail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nInfusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, \nredness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasations and swelling of the vein. \nFluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, \npericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Taxanes, ATC Code: L01CD 02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDocetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable \nmicrotubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The \nbinding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for \nvital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDocetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and \nagainst freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular \nconcentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some \nbut not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance \ngene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental antitumour \nactivity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nBreast cancer \nTwo randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or \n392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the \nrecommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks. \n \nIn alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). \nWithout affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p=0.38) or \ntime to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p=0.54), docetaxel increased \nresponse rate (52% vs. 37%, p=0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, \np=0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas 15 \ndoxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart \nfailure). \n \nIn anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and \nvinblastine (12 mg/m\u00b2 every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate \n(33% vs. 12%, p<0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p=0.0004) and \nprolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p=0.01). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 23\n\n \nDuring these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety \nprofile observed in phase II studies (see section 4.8). \n \nAn open-label, multicenter, randomized phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel \nmonotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous \ntherapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomized to receive \neither docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m\u00b2 as a 3 hour \ninfusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. \nWithout affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p=0.10), docetaxel \nprolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p<0.01) and median survival \n(15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p=0.03). \nMore grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to \npaclitaxel (23.0%). \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nPatients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy \n \nIn a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) \nand overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to Best Supportive \nCare. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). \nThere was less use of morphinic analgesic (p<0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p<0.01), other disease \nrelated medications (p=0.06) and radiotherapy (p<0.01) in patients treated with docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 \ncompared to those with BSC. \nThe overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was \n26.1 weeks. \n \nDocetaxel in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients \n \nIn a phase III study, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or \ngreater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either \ndocetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/m2 over \n30-60 minutes every 3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with \ncarboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ml. min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2 \nadministered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on \nday 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks (VCis). \n \nSurvival data, median time to progression and response rates for two arms of the study are illustrated \nin the following table: \n \n TCis \n\nn=408 \n \n\nVCis \nn=404 \n\n \n\nStatistical Analysis \n\nOverall survival \n(Primary end-point): \n\n   \n\nMedian survival (months) 11.3 10.1 Hazard ratio: 1.122 \n[97.2% CI: 0.937; 1.342]* \n\n1-year Survival (%) 46 41 Treatment difference: 5.4% \n [95% CI: -1.1; 12.0] \n\n2-year Survival (%) 21 14 Treatment difference: 6.2% \n[95% CI: 0.2; 12.3] \n\nMedian time to progression     \n(weeks) 22.0 23.0 Hazard ratio: 1.032 \n\n[95% CI: 0.876; 1.216] \nOverall response rate (%):  31.6 24.5 Treatment difference: 7.1% \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 24\n\n[95% CI: 0.7; 13.5] \n*: Corrected for multiple comparisons and adjusted for stratification factors (stage of disease and \nregion of treatment), based on evaluable patient population. \n \nSecondary end-points included change of pain, global rating of quality of life by EuroQoL-5D, Lung \nCancer Symptom Scale, and changes in Karnosfky performance status.

The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent \nwith a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half lives for the \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 phases of 4 min, \n36 min and 11.1 h, respectively. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel \nfrom the peripheral compartment.  \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one hour infusion a mean peak plasma \nlevel of 3.7 \u03bcg/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h.\u03bcg/ml. Mean values for total body \nclearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter \nindividual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% \nbound to plasma proteins. \n \nElimination \n \nA study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in \nboth the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl \nester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of \nthe administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is \nexcreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites \nand very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge and gender \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. \nPharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from Phase I \nstudies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a small number of patients (n=23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver \nfunction impairment (ALT, AST \u22651.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase \u22652.5 times \nthe ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2).  \n \nFluid retention \nDocetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are \nno data available in patients with severe fluid retention. \n \nCombination therapy \n \nDoxorubicin \nWhen used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma \nlevels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin \nand cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their coadministration. \n \nCapecitabine \nPhase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice \nversa showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no \neffect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5\u2019-DFUR. \n \nCisplatin \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 26\n\nClearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following \nmonotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is \nsimilar to that observed with cisplatin alone. \n \nCisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nThe combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid \ntumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product. \n \nPrednisone and dexamethasone \nThe effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard \ndexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients.  \n \nPrednisone \nNo effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro micronucleus and chromosome aberration \ntest in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. However, it did not induce \nmutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. These results are consistent \nwith the pharmacological activity of docetaxel. \n \nUndesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair \nmale fertility. \n \n \n6.

This fill volume has been established during the development of docetaxel to \ncompensate for liquid loss during preparation of the premix due to foaming, adhesion to the \nwalls of the vial and \"dead-volume\". This overfill ensures that after dilution with the entire \ncontents of the accompanying solvent for docetaxel vial, there is a minimal extractable premix \nvolume of 2 ml containing 10 mg/ml docetaxel which corresponds to the labelled amount of \n20 mg per vial. \n\n \nSolvent for Docetaxel Teva Pharma 20 mg vial \n6 ml clear glass Type I vial with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and a flip-off cap. \n \nSolvent vial contains 1.28 ml of water for injections (fill volume: 1.71 ml). The addition of the \nentire contents of the solvent vial to the contents of the Docetaxel Teva Pharma 20 mg \nconcentrate for solution for infusion vial ensures a premix concentration of 10 mg/ml docetaxel. \n\n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, \ncaution should be exercised when handling it and preparing Docetaxel solutions. The use of gloves is \nrecommended. \n \nIf Docetaxel Teva Pharma concentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact \nwith skin, wash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If Docetaxel concentrate, premix \nsolution or infusion solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately \nand thoroughly with water. \n \nPreparation for the intravenous administration \n\na) Preparation of the Docetaxel Teva Pharma premix solution (10 mg docetaxel/ml) \n\nIf the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of Docetaxel Teva Pharma boxes \nto stand at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. \n \nUsing a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw the entire contents of the solvent for \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma vial by partially inverting the vial. \n \nInject the entire contents of the syringe into the corresponding Docetaxel Teva Pharma vial. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 28\n\nRemove the syringe and needle and mix manually by repeated inversions for at least 45 seconds. Do \nnot shake. \n \nAllow the premix vial to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and then check that \nthe solution is homogenous and clear (foaming is normal even after 5 minutes due to the presence of \npolysorbate 80 in the formulation). \n \nThe premix solution contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used immediately after preparation. \nHowever the chemical and physical stability of the premix solution has been demonstrated for 8 hours \nwhen stored either between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C or at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C). \n \nb) Preparation of the infusion solution \n\nMore than one premix vial may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. Based on the \nrequired dose for the patient expressed in mg, aseptically withdraw the corresponding premix volume \ncontaining 10 mg/ml docetaxel from the appropriate number of premix vials using graduated syringes \nfitted with a needle. For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require 14 ml docetaxel premix \nsolution. \n \nInject the required premix volume into a non-PVC 250 ml infusion bag containing either 5% glucose \nsolution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. \n \nIf a dose greater than 200 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so \nthat a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n \nMix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n \nThe Docetaxel Teva Pharma infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be aseptically \nadministered as a 1-hour infusion under room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and normal lighting \nconditions. \n \nAs with all parenteral products, Docetaxel Teva Pharma premix solution and infusion solution should \nbe visually inspected prior to use, solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n \n \n\n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma 80 mg concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach single dose vial of Docetaxel Teva Pharma concentrate contains 80 mg docetaxel (anhydrous). \nEach ml of concentrate contains 27.73 mg docetaxel. \n \nExcipients with known effect:  \nEach vial of concentrate contains 25.1% (w/w) anhydrous ethanol. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\nConcentrate and solvent for solution for infusion. \nThe concentrate is a clear viscous, yellow to brown-yellow solution. \nThe solvent is a colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced \nor metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have \nincluded an anthracycline or an alkylating agent. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic \nnon-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with \nunresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not \npreviously received chemotherapy for this condition. \n \nProstate cancer \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment \nof patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nThe use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the \nuse of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \nRecommended dose \n \nFor breast and non-small cell lung cancer, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as \ndexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 31\n\nadministration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used \nto mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. \n \nFor prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or prednisolone the recommended \npremedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel \ninfusion (see section 4.4).  \n \nDocetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks. \n \nBreast cancer \nFor the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose \nof docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy.  \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nIn chemotherapy na\u00efve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen \nis docetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment \nafter failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m\u00b2 as a single \nagent. \n \nProstate cancer \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily \nis administered continuously (see section 5.1). \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nGeneral \nDocetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is \u22651,500 cells/mm3. \nIn patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count <500 cells/mm3 for more than \none week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel \ntherapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from \n75 to 60 mg/m\u00b2. If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m\u00b2, the treatment \nshould be discontinued. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin \nFor patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose \nnadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who \nexperience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel \ndose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2.  For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the \ncorresponding summary of product characeteristics. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment  \nBased on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent, patients who have both \nelevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal \nrange (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of \ndocetaxel is 75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin >ULN and/or \nALT and AST >3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase >6 times the ULN, no \ndose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Docetaxel Teva Pharma in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged \n1 month to less than 18 years have not yet been established. \nThere is no relevant use of Docetaxel Teva Pharma in the paediatric population in the indications \nbreast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer. \n \nOlder people \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 32\n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in older \npeople.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with baseline neutrophil count of <1,500 cells/mm3. \n \nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with severe liver impairment since there is no data available \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nContraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nFor breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as \ndexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel \nadministration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well \nas the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral \ndexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). \n \nHaematology \n \nNeutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median \nof 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of \ncomplete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be \nretreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level \u22651,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). \n \nIn the case of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of \ndocetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate \nsymptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile \nneutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic \nG-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of \ncomplicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). \nPatients receiving TCF should be closely monitored, (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), \nfebrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received \nprimary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive \nadjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile \nneutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be \nclosely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nPatients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and \nsecond infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation \nof the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should \nbe available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised \ncutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe \nhypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of \ndocetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions \nshould not be re-challenged with docetaxel. \n \nCutaneous reactions \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 33\n\n \nLocalised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema \nfollowed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by \ndesquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nFluid retention \n \nPatients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be \nmonitored closely. \n \nRespiratory disorders \n \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitital lung disease, \npulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure have been reported and may be associated with fatal \noutcome.  Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant \nradiotherapy. \nIf new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly \ninvestigated, and appropriately treated.  Interruption of docetaxel therapy is recommended until \ndiagnosis is available.  Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition.  The \nbenefit of resuming docetaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. \n \nPatients with liver impairment \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels \n(ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels \ngreater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as \ntoxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, \ninfections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel \nin those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at \nbaseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). \nFor patients with serum bilirubin levels >ULN and/or ALT and AST >3.5 times the ULN concurrent \nwith serum alkaline phosphatase levels >6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended \nand docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin> 1 x UNL; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nThere are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel. \n \nNervous system \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). \n \nCardiac toxicity \n \nHeart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, \nparticularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may \nbe moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). \n \nWhen patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they \nshould undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 34\n\ntreatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For \nmore details see Summary of Product Characteristics of trastuzumab. \n \nEye disorders \n \nCystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel.  Patients with \nimpaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examiniation.  In case CMO is \ndiagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatement initiated (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nOthers \n \nContraceptive measures must be taken by both men and women during treatment and for men at least \n6 months after cessation of therapy (see section 4.6). \n \nAdditional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \nComplicated neutropenia \nFor patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or \ninfection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). \n \nGastrointestinal reactions \nSymptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, \nmay be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated \npromptly. \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) \nPatients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the \nfollow up period.  In patients treated with the TAC regimen for node positive breast cancer, the risk of \nCHF has been shown to be higher during the first year after treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nLeukaemia \nIn the docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) treated patients, the risk of delayed \nmyelodysplasia or myeloid leukaemia requires haematological follow-up. \n \nPatients with 4+ nodes \nAs the benefit observed in patient with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on disease-free \nsurvival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ \nnodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis (see section 5.1). \n \nOlder people \nThere are limited data available in patients > 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with \ndoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n \nOf the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study, 209 patients \nwere 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients treated with \ndocetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate \u2265 10% higher in \npatients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The incidence of related \nfever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates \u2265 10% higher in patients who were \n75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years. \n \nAmong the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer \nstudy, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of \nserious adverse events was higher in older people compared to younger patients. \nThe incidence of the following adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection \noccurred at rates \u2265 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger \npatients. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 35\n\nOlder people treated with TCF should be closely monitored. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nIn vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant \nadministration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the \nenzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as cyclosporine, terfenadine, ketoconazole, \nerythromycin and troleandomycin. As a result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with \nthese medicinal products as concomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. \n \nDocetaxel is highly protein bound (>95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with \nconcomitantly administered medicinal products has not been investigated formally, in vitro \ninteractions with tightly protein-bound drugs such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, \npropafenone, phenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein \nbinding of docetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. \nDocetaxel did not influence the binding of digitoxin. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their \ncoadministration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction \nbetween docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was \nabout 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. \n \nDocetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic \nprostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. \nNo statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \nClincal cases consistent with an increase in docetaxel toxicity were reported when it was combined \nwith ritonavir.  The mechanism behind this interaction is a CYP3A4 inhibition, the main isoenzyme \ninvolved in docetaxel metabolism by ritonavir.  Based on extrapolation from a pharmacokinetic study \nwith ketoconazole in 7 patients, consider a 50% docetaxel dose reduction if patients require co-\nadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor such as azole antifungals, ritonavir and some macrolides \n(clarithromycin, telithromycin). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be \nboth embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats, and to reduce fertility in rats. As with other \ncytotoxic medicinal products, docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant \nwomen. Therefore, docetaxel must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated.  \n \nWomen of childbearing age receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant, and to \ninform the treating physician immediately should this occur. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nDocetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. \nConsequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be \ndiscontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nAn effective method of contraception should be used during treatment. \n \nFertility \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 36\n\nIn non clinical studies, docetaxel has genotoxic effects and may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). \nTherefore, men being treated with docetaxel are advised not to father a child during and up to \n6 months after treatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile for all indications \n \nThe adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel \nhave been obtained in: \n\u2022 1312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/m\u00b2 and 75 mg/m\u00b2 of docetaxel as a single agent \n\nrespectively. \n\u2022 258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin. \n\u2022 406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin. \n\u2022 92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab. \n\u2022 255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. \n\u2022 332 patients who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone (clinically \n\nimportant treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\u2022 1276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received \n\ndocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important \ntreatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\u2022 300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and \n79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and \n5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\u2022 174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin \nand 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n \nThese reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; \ngrade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4) and the COSTART and the MedRA terms. Frequencies are defined \nas: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was \nreversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe \nneutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea \nand asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in \ncombination with other chemotherapeutic agents. \n \nFor combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in \u2265 10% are displayed. There \nwas an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the \ntrastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. \n \nFor combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects  (\u2265 5%) \nreported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see \ncapecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \nThe following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel: \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 37\n\nImmune system disorders \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the \ninfusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms \nwere flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills.  \nSevere reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized \nrash/erythema (see section 4.4). \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paresthesia, dysesthesia or pain \nincluding burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nReversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to \nmoderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and \nhands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently \nassociated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. \nLess frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to \ninterruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe \nnail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nInfusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, \nredness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasations and swelling of the vein. \nFluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, \npericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The peripheral oedema usually starts at the lower \nextremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of 3 kg or more. Fluid retention is \ncumulative in incidence and severity (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions in breast cancer for Docetaxel 100 mg/m\u00b2 single agent \nMedDRA system \norgan classes  \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions  \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions   \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions  \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nInfections (G3/4: 5.7%; \nincluding sepsis and \npneumonia, fatal in \n1.7%) \n\nInfection associated \nwith G4 neutropenia \n(G3/4: 4.6%) \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nNeutropenia \n(G4: 76.4%);  \nAnaemia (G3/4: 8.9%); \nFebrile neutropenia \n\nThrombocytopenia \n(G4: 0.2%) \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nHypersensitivity (G3/4:  \n5.3%) \n\n  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nAnorexia   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders  \n\nPeripheral sensory \nneuropathy (G3: 4.1%);  \n\n  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 38\n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes  \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions  \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions   \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions  \n\nPeripheral motor \nneuropathy (G3/4: 4%);  \nDysgeusia \n(severe 0.07%)  \n\nCardiac disorders  Arrhythmia \n(G3/4: 0.7%) \n\nCardiac failure \n\nVascular disorders  Hypotension; \nHypertension \nHaemorrhage \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDyspnoea (severe 2.7%)   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders  \n\nStomatitis (G3/4: 5.3%); \nDiarrhoea (G3/4: 4%); \nNausea (G3/4: 4%); \nVomiting (G3/4: 3%) \n\nConstipation \n(severe 0.2%); \nAbdominal pain \n(severe 1%); \nGastrointestinal \nHaemorrhage \n(severe 0.3%) \n\nOesophagitis \n(severe: 0.4%) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nAlopecia; \nSkin reaction \n(G3/4: 5.9%); \nNail disorders \n(severe 2.6%) \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal, \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nMyalgia (severe 1.4%) Arthralgia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nFluid retention \n(severe: 6.5%); \nAsthenia \n(severe 11.2%); \nPain \n\nInfusion site reaction; \nNon-cardiac chest \npain (severe 0.4%) \n\n \n\nInvestigations  G3/4 Blood bilirubin \nincreased (< 5%); \nG3/4 Blood alkaline \nphosphatase increased \n(< 4%);  \nG3/4 AST increased \n(<3%); \nG3/4 ALT increased \n(<2%) \n\n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 single agent \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nRare: bleeding episodes associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. \n \nNervous system disorders \nReversibility data are available among 35.3% of patients who developed neurotoxicity following \ndocetaxel treatment at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent.

All except one patient in each arm were diagnosed with CHF \nmore than 30 days after the treatment period.  Two patients in the TAC arm and 4 patients in the FAC \narm died because of cardiac failure. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nIn study TAX316, alopecia persisting into the follow-up period after the end of chemotherapy was \nreported in 687 TAC patients and 645 FAC patients. \nAt the end of the follow-up period, alopecia was observed to be ongoing in 29 TAC patients (4.2%) \nand 16 FAC patients (2.4%). \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nAmenorrhoea was observed to be ongoing during follow-up in 121 patients out of the 202 patients \nwith amenorrhoea at the end of the chemotherapy in study TAX316. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nIn study TAX316, peripheral oedema was observed to be ongoing in 19 patients out of the 119 patients \nwith peripheral oedema in the TAC arm and 4 patients out of the 23 patients with peripheral oedema in \nthe FAC arm. \nIn study GEICAM 9805, lymphoedema was observed to be ongoing in 4 of the 5 patients with \nlymphoedema at the end of the chemotherapy. \n \nAcute leukaemia / Myelodysplastic syndrome. \nAfter 10 years of follow up in study TAX316, acute leukaemia was reported in 4 of 744 TAC patients \nand in 1 of 736 FAC patients.  Myelodysplastic syndrome was reported in 2 of 744 TAC patients and \nin 1 of 736 FAC patients. \nAt a median follow-up time of 77 months, acute leukaemia occurred in 1 of 532 (0.2%) patients who \nreceived docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide in the GEICAM 9805 study.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n\nThere were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of \noverdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In \ncases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated \ncomplications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and \nmucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. \nOther appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Taxanes, ATC Code: L01CD 02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDocetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable \nmicrotubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The \nbinding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for \nvital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDocetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and \nagainst freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular \nconcentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some \nbut not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance \ngene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental antitumour \nactivity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nBreast Cancer \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 51\n\nTwo randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or \n392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the \nrecommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks. \n \nIn alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). \nWithout affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p=0.38) or \ntime to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p=0.54), docetaxel increased \nresponse rate (52% vs. 37%, p=0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, \np=0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas 15 \ndoxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart \nfailure). \n \nIn anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and \nvinblastine (12 mg/m\u00b2 every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate \n(33% vs. 12%, p<0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p=0.0004) and \nprolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p=0.01). \n \nDuring these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety \nprofile observed in phase II studies (see section 4.8). \n \nAn open-label, multicenter, randomized phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel \nmonotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous \ntherapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomized to receive \neither docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m\u00b2 as a 3 hour \ninfusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. \nWithout affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p=0.10), docetaxel \nprolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p<0.01) and median survival \n(15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p=0.03). \nMore grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to \npaclitaxel (23.0%). \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \n\nPatients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy \n\nIn a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) \nand overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to Best Supportive \nCare. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). \nThere was less use of morphinic analgesic (p<0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p<0.01), other disease \nrelated medications (p=0.06) and radiotherapy (p<0.01) in patients treated with docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 \ncompared to those with BSC. \nThe overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was \n26.1 weeks. \n \nDocetaxel in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients \n \nIn a phase III study, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or \ngreater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either \nDocetaxel  (T) 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/m2 over \n30-60 minutes every 3 weeks (TCis), Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with \ncarboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ml. min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2 \nadministered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on \nday 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks (VCis). \n \nSurvival data, median time to progression and response rates for two arms of the study are illustrated \nin the following table: \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 52\n\n TCis \nn=408 \n\n \n\nVCis \nn=404 \n\n \n\nStatistical Analysis \n\nOverall survival \n(Primary end-point): \n\n   \n\nMedian survival (months) 11.3 10.1 Hazard ratio: 1.122 \n[97.2% CI: 0.937; 1.342]* \n\n1-year Survival (%) 46 41 Treatment difference: 5.4% \n [95% CI: -1.1; 12.0] \n\n2-year Survival (%) 21 14 Treatment difference: 6.2% \n[95% CI: 0.2; 12.3] \n\nMedian time to progression     \n(weeks) 22.0 23.0 Hazard ratio: 1.032 \n\n[95% CI: 0.876; 1.216] \nOverall response rate (%):  31.6 24.5 Treatment difference: 7.1% \n\n[95% CI: 0.7; 13.5] \n*: Corrected for multiple comparisons and adjusted for stratification factors (stage of disease and \nregion of treatment), based on evaluable patient population. \n \nSecondary end-points included change of pain, global rating of quality of life by EuroQoL-5D, Lung \nCancer Symptom Scale, and changes in Karnosfky performance status.

A total of 1006 patients with KPS\u226560 were randomized to the following treatment groups: \n\u2022 Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. \n\u2022 Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 administered weekly for the first 5 weeks in a 6 week cycle for 5 cycles. \n\u2022 Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. \nAll 3 regimens were administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily, \ncontinuously. \n \nPatients who received docetaxel every three weeks demonstrated significantly longer overall survival \ncompared to those treated with mitoxantrone. The increase in survival seen in the docetaxel weekly \narm was not statistically significant compared to the mitoxantrone control arm. Efficacy endpoints for \nthe docetaxel arms versus the control arm are summarized in the following table: \n \nEndpoint \n \n\nDocetaxel \nevery 3 weeks \n\n \n\nDocetaxel \nevery week \n\n \n\nMitoxantrone \nevery 3 weeks \n\nNumber of patients \nMedian survival (months) \n95% CI \nHazard ratio \n95% CI \np-value\u2020* \n\n335 \n18.9 \n\n(17.0-21.2) \n0.761 \n\n(0.619-0.936) \n0.0094 \n\n334 \n17.4 \n\n(15.7-19.0) \n0.912 \n\n(0.747-1.113) \n0.3624 \n\n337 \n16.5 \n\n(14.4-18.6) \n-- \n-- \n-- \n\nNumber of patients \nPSA** response rate (%) \n95% CI \np-value* \n\n291 \n45.4 \n\n(39.5-51.3) \n0.0005 \n\n282 \n47.9 \n\n(41.9-53.9) \n<0.0001 \n\n300 \n31.7 \n\n(26.4-37.3) \n-- \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 53\n\nNumber of patients \nPain response rate (%) \n95% CI \np-value* \n\n153 \n34.6 \n\n(27.1-42.7) \n0.0107 \n\n154 \n31.2 \n\n(24.0-39.1) \n0.0798 \n\n157 \n21.7 \n\n(15.5-28.9) \n-- \n\nNumber of patients \nTumour response rate \n(%) \n95% CI \np-value* \n\n141 \n12.1 \n\n(7.2-18.6) \n0.1112 \n\n134 \n8.2 \n\n(4.2-14.2) \n0.5853 \n\n137 \n6.6 \n\n(3.0-12.1) \n-- \n\n\u2020Stratified log rank test \n*Threshold for statistical significance=0.0175 \n**PSA: Prostate-Specific Antigen \n \nGiven the fact that docetaxel every week presented a slightly better safety profile than docetaxel every \n3 weeks, it is possible that certain patients may benefit from docetaxel every week. \n \nNo statistical differences were observed between treatment groups for Global Quality of Life. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel have been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of \n20-115 mg/m2 in Phase I studies. The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent \nwith a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half lives for the \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 phases of 4 min, \n36 min and 11.1 h, respectively. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel \nfrom the peripheral compartment.  \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one hour infusion a mean peak plasma \nlevel of 3.7 \u03bcg/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h.\u03bcg/ml. Mean values for total body \nclearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter \nindividual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% \nbound to plasma proteins. \n \nElimination \n \nA study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in \nboth the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl \nester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of \nthe administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is \nexcreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites \nand very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge and gender \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. \nPharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from Phase I \nstudies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a small number of patients (n=23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver \nfunction impairment (ALT, AST \u22651.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase \u22652.5 times \nthe ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2).  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 54\n\nFluid retention \nDocetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are \nno data available in patients with severe fluid retention. \n \nCombination therapy \n \nDoxorubicin \nWhen used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma \nlevels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin \nand cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their coadministration. \n \nCapecitabine \nPhase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice \nversa showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no \neffect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5\u2019-DFUR. \n \nCisplatin \nClearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following \nmonotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is \nsimilar to that observed with cisplatin alone. \n \nCisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nThe combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid \ntumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product. \n \nPrednisone and dexamethasone \nThe effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard \ndexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients.  \n \nPrednisone \nNo effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro micronucleus and chromosome aberration \ntest in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. However, it did not induce \nmutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. These results are consistent \nwith the pharmacological activity of docetaxel. \n \nUndesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair \nmale fertility. \n \n \n6.

From a \nmicrobiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, \nin-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would \nnormally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8\u00b0C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled \nand validated aseptic conditions. \n\n\u2022 Infusion solution: Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 4 hours at \nroom temperature (below 25\u00b0C). From a microbiological point of view, the product should be \nused immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are \nthe responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8\u00b0C, unless \ndilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage and other handling \n \n\nDo not store above 25\u00b0C . \nDo not freeze. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \nFor storage conditions of the diluted medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nEach carton contains: \n\u2022 One vial of concentrate and, \n\u2022 One vial of solvent \n \n\u2022 Docetaxel Teva Pharma 80 mg vial  \n 15 ml clear glass Type I vial with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and a flip-off cap. \n\n \nThis vial contains 2.88  ml of a 27.73 mg/ml solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 \n(fill volume: 94.4 mg/3.40 ml). This fill volume has been established during the development of \ndocetaxel to compensate for liquid loss during preparation of the premix due to foaming, \nadhesion to the walls of the vial and \"dead-volume\". This overfill ensures that after dilution with \nthe entire contents of the accompanying solvent for docetaxel vial, there is a minimal extractable \npremix volume of 8 ml containing 10 mg/ml docetaxel which corresponds to the labelled \namount of 80 mg per vial. \n \nSolvent for Docetaxel Teva Pharma 80 mg vial \n15 ml clear glass Type I vial with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and a flip-off cap. \n \nSolvent vial contains 5.12 ml of water for injections (fill volume: 6.29 ml). The addition of the \nentire contents of the solvent vial to the contents of the Docetaxel Teva Pharma 80 mg \nconcentrate for solution for infusion vial ensures a premix concentration of 10 mg/ml docetaxel. \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, \ncaution should be exercised when handling it and preparing Docetaxel solutions. The use of gloves is \nrecommended. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 56\n\nIf Docetaxel Teva Pharma concentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact \nwith skin, wash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If Docetaxel concentrate, premix \nsolution or infusion solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately \nand thoroughly with water. \n \nPreparation for the intravenous administration \n\na) Preparation of the Docetaxel Teva Pharma premix solution (10 mg docetaxel/ml) \n\nIf the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of Docetaxel Teva Pharma boxes \nto stand at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. \n \nUsing a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw the entire contents of the solvent for \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma vial by partially inverting the vial. \n \nInject the entire contents of the syringe into the corresponding Docetaxel Teva Pharma vial. \n \nRemove the syringe and needle and mix manually by repeated inversions for at least 45 seconds. Do \nnot shake. \n \nAllow the premix vial to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and then check that \nthe solution is homogenous and clear (foaming is normal even after 5 minutes due to the presence of \npolysorbate 80 in the formulation). \n \nThe premix solution contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used immediately after preparation. \nHowever the chemical and physical stability of the premix solution has been demonstrated for 8 hours \nwhen stored either between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C or at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C). \n \nb) Preparation of the infusion solution \n\nMore than one premix vial may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. Based on the \nrequired dose for the patient expressed in mg, aseptically withdraw the corresponding premix volume \ncontaining 10 mg/ml docetaxel from the appropriate number of premix vials using graduated syringes \nfitted with a needle. For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require 14 ml docetaxel premix \nsolution. \n \nInject the required premix volume into a non-PVC 250 ml infusion bag containing either 5% glucose \nsolution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. \n \nIf a dose greater than 200 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so \nthat a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n \nMix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n \nThe Docetaxel Teva Pharma infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be aseptically \nadministered as a 1-hour infusion under room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and normal lighting \nconditions. \n \nAs with all parenteral products, Docetaxel Teva Pharma premix solution and infusion solution should \nbe visually inspected prior to use, solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n \n \n\n7.

FORMULATION \n\nDocetaxel Teva Pharma 20 mg concentrate for solution for infusion is a clear viscous, yellow to \nbrown-yellow solution containing 27.73 mg/ml docetaxel (anhydrous) in polysorbate 80. The solvent \nfor Docetaxel Teva Pharma is water for injections. \n \n \n2. PRESENTATION \n\nDocetaxel Teva Pharma is supplied as single-dose vials. \n \nEach box contains one Docetaxel Teva Pharma vial (20 mg) and one corresponding solvent for \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma vial in a carton. \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma vials should not be stored above 25\u00b0C and should be protected from light. \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma should not be used after the expiry date shown on the carton and vials. \n \n2.1 Docetaxel 20 mg vial: \n\n\u2022 The Docetaxel 20 mg vial is a 6 ml clear glass vial with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and a \nflip-off cap. \n\n \n\u2022 The Docetaxel 20 mg vial contains a solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 at a concentration \n\nof 27.73 mg/ml. \n \n\u2022 Each vial contains 20 mg/0.72 ml of a 27.73 mg/ml solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 (fill \n\nvolume: 24.4 mg/0.88 ml). This fill volume has been established during the development of \ndocetaxel to compensate for liquid loss during preparation of the premix (see section 4) due to \nfoaming, adhesion to the walls of the vial and \"dead-volume\". This overfill ensures that after \ndilution with the entire contents of the accompanying solvent for docetaxel vial, there is a \nminimal extractable premix volume of 2 ml containing 10 mg/ml docetaxel which corresponds \nto the labelled amount of 20 mg per vial. \n\n \n2.2 Solvent for Docetaxel 20 mg vial: \n\n\u2022 The solvent for Docetaxel 20 mg vial is a 6 ml clear glass vial with a bromobutyl rubber stopper \nand a flip-off cap. \n\n \n\u2022 The solvent for Docetaxel composition is water for injections. \n \n\u2022 Each solvent vial contains 1.28 ml of water for injections (fill volume: 1.71 ml). The addition of \n\nthe entire contents of the solvent vial to the contents of the Docetaxel Teva Pharma 20mg vial \nensures a premix concentration of 10 mg/ml docetaxel. \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 79\n\n3. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SAFE HANDLING \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, \ncaution should be exercised when handling it and preparing Docetaxel Teva Pharma solutions. The use \nof gloves is recommended. \n \nIf Docetaxel Teva Pharma concentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact \nwith skin, wash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If Docetaxel Teva Pharma \nconcentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, \nwash immediately and thoroughly with water. \n \n \n4. PREPARATION FOR THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION \n\n4.1 Preparation of the Docetaxel Teva Pharma premix solution (10 mg docetaxel/ml) \n \n4.1.1 If the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of Docetaxel Teva \n\nPharma boxes to stand at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. \n \n\n4.1.2 Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw the entire contents of the solvent for \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma vial by partially inverting the vial. \n \n\n4.1.3 Inject the entire contents of the syringe into the corresponding Docetaxel Teva Pharma vial. \n \n4.1.4 Remove the syringe and needle and mix manually by repeated inversions for at least 45 \n\nseconds. Do not shake. \n \n4.1.5 Allow the premix vial to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and then \n\ncheck that the solution is homogenous and clear (foaming is normal even after 5 minutes due \nto the presence of polysorbate 80 in the formulation). \n \nThe premix solution contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used immediately after \npreparation. However the chemical and physical stability of the premix solution has been \ndemonstrated for 8 hours when stored either between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C or at room temperature \n(below 25\u00b0C). \n\n \n \n \n4.2 Preparation of the infusion solution \n \n4.2.1 More than one premix vial may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. Based \n\non the required dose for the patient expressed in mg, aseptically withdraw the corresponding \npremix volume containing 10 mg/ml docetaxel from the appropriate number of premix vials \nusing graduated syringes fitted with a needle. For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would \nrequire 14 ml docetaxel premix solution. \n\n \n4.2.2 Inject the required premix volume into a 250 ml non-PVC infusion bag containing either 5% \n\nglucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose greater \nthan 200 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so that a \nconcentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n\n \n4.2.3 Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n \n4.2.4  The Docetaxel Teva Pharma infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be \n\naseptically administered as a 1-hour infusion under room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and \nnormal lighting conditions. \n\n \n4.2.5 As with all parenteral products, Docetaxel Teva Pharma premix solution and infusion solution \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 80\n\nshould be visually inspected prior to use, solutions containing a precipitate should be \ndiscarded. \n\n \n \n \n5.

FORMULATION \n\nDocetaxel Teva Pharma 80 mg concentrate for solution for infusion is a clear viscous, yellow to \nbrown-yellow solution containing 27.73 mg/ml docetaxel (anhydrous) in polysorbate 80. The solvent \nfor Docetaxel Teva Pharma is water for injections. \n \n \n2. PRESENTATION \n\nDocetaxel Teva Pharma is supplied as single-dose vials. \n \nEach box contains one Docetaxel Teva Pharma vial (80 mg) and one corresponding solvent for \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma vial in a carton. \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma vials should not be stored above 25\u00b0C and should be protected from light. \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma should not be used after the expiry date shown on the carton and vials. \n \n \n2.1 Docetaxel 80 mg vial: \n\n\u2022 The Docetaxel 80 mg vial is a 15 ml clear glass vial with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and a \nflip-off cap. \n\n \n\u2022 The Docetaxel 80 mg vial contains a solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 at a concentration \n\nof 27.73 mg/ml. \n \n\nEach vial contains 80 mg/2.88 ml of a 27.73 mg/ml solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 (fill \nvolume: 94.4 mg/3.40 ml). This fill volume has been established during the development of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 88\n\ndocetaxel to compensate for liquid loss during preparation of the premix due to foaming, \nadhesion to the walls of the vial and \"dead-volume\". This overfill ensures that after dilution with \nthe entire contents of the accompanying solvent for docetaxel vial, there is a minimal extractable \npremix volume of 8 ml containing 10 mg/ml docetaxel which corresponds to the labelled \namount of 80 mg per vial. \n\n \n2.2 Solvent for Docetaxel 80 mg vial: \n\n\u2022 The solvent for Docetaxel 80 mg vial is a 15 ml clear glass vial with a bromobutyl rubber \nstopper and a flip-off cap. \n\n \n\u2022 The solvent for Docetaxel composition is water for injections. \n \n\nEach solvent vial contains 5.12 ml of water for injections (fill volume: 6.29 ml). The addition of \nthe entire contents of the solvent vial to the contents of the docetaxel 80 mg concentrate for \nsolution for infusion vial ensures a premix concentration of 10 mg/ml docetaxel. \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 89\n\n3. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SAFE HANDLING \n \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, \ncaution should be exercised when handling it and preparing Docetaxel Teva Pharma solutions. The use \nof gloves is recommended. \n \nIf Docetaxel Teva Pharma concentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact \nwith skin, wash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If Docetaxel Teva Pharma \nconcentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, \nwash immediately and thoroughly with water. \n \n \n4. PREPARATION FOR THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION \n\n4.1 Preparation of the Docetaxel Teva Pharma premix solution (10 mg docetaxel/ml) \n \n4.1.1 If the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of Docetaxel Teva \n\nPharma boxes to stand at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. \n \n\n4.1.2 Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw the entire contents of the solvent for \nDocetaxel Teva Pharma vial by partially inverting the vial. \n \n\n4.1.3 Inject the entire contents of the syringe into the corresponding Docetaxel Teva Pharma vial. \n \n4.1.4 Remove the syringe and needle and mix manually by repeated inversions for at least 45 \n\nseconds. Do not shake. \n \n4.1.5 Allow the premix vial to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and then \n\ncheck that the solution is homogenous and clear (foaming is normal even after 5 minutes due \nto the presence of polysorbate 80 in the formulation). \n \nThe premix solution contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used immediately after \npreparation. However the chemical and physical stability of the premix solution has been \ndemonstrated for 8 hours when stored either between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C or at room temperature \n(below 25\u00b0C). \n\n \n \n \n4.2 Preparation of the infusion solution \n \n4.2.1 More than one premix vial may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. Based \n\non the required dose for the patient expressed in mg, aseptically withdraw the corresponding \npremix volume containing 10 mg/ml docetaxel from the appropriate number of premix vials \nusing graduated syringes fitted with a needle. For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would \nrequire 14 ml docetaxel premix solution. \n\n \n4.2.2 Inject the required premix volume into a 250 ml non-PVC infusion bag containing either 5% \n\nglucose solution or  sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose greater \nthan 200 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so that a \nconcentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n\n \n4.2.3 Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n \n4.2.4  The Docetaxel Teva Pharma infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be \n\naseptically administered as a 1-hour infusion under room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and \nnormal lighting conditions. \n\n \n4.2.5 As with all parenteral products, Docetaxel Teva Pharma premix solution and infusion solution \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n 90\n\nshould be visually inspected prior to use, solutions containing a precipitate should be \ndiscarded. \n\n \n \n \n5.
