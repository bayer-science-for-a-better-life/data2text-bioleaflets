CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth \nfactor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer: \n\n- in combination with an aromatase inhibitor;  \n- in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy (see \n\nsection 5.1). \nIn pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinizing \nhormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with IBRANCE should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \nanticancer medicinal products. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 125 mg of palbociclib once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by \n7 days off treatment (Schedule 3/1) to comprise a complete cycle of 28 days. The treatment with \nIBRANCE should be continued as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit from therapy or until \nunacceptable toxicity occurs. \n \nWhen coadministered with palbociclib, the aromatase inhibitor should be administered according to \nthe dose schedule reported in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Treatment of \npre/perimenopausal women with the combination of palbociclib plus an aromatase inhibitor should \nalways be combined with an LHRH agonist (see section 4.4).  \n \nWhen coadministered with palbociclib, the recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg administered \nintramuscularly on Days 1, 15, 29, and once monthly thereafter. Please refer to the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics of fulvestrant. Prior to the start of treatment with the combination of \npalbociclib plus fulvestrant, and throughout its duration, pre/perimenopausal women should be treated \nwith LHRH agonists according to local clinical practice. \n \nPatients should be encouraged to take their dose at approximately the same time each day. If the \npatient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken that day. The next prescribed \ndose should be taken at the usual time. \n \nDose adjustments \nDose modification of IBRANCE is recommended based on individual safety and tolerability. \n \nManagement of some adverse reactions may require temporary dose interruptions/delays, and/or dose \nreductions, or permanent discontinuation as per dose reduction schedules provided in Tables 1, 2, and \n3 (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nTable 1. IBRANCE recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions \n\nDose level Dose\nRecommended dose 125 mg/day\nFirst dose reduction   100 mg/day\nSecond dose reduction   75 mg/day*\n*If further dose reduction below 75 mg/day is required, discontinue the treatment.\n \nComplete blood count should be monitored prior to the start of IBRANCE therapy and at the \nbeginning of each cycle, as well as on Day 15 of the first 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nFor patients who experience a maximum of Grade 1 or 2 neutropenia in the first 6 cycles, complete \nblood counts for subsequent cycles should be monitored every 3 months, prior to the beginning of a \ncycle and as clinically indicated. \n \nAbsolute neutrophil counts (ANC) of ≥ 1,000/mm3 and platelet counts of ≥ 50,000/mm3 are \nrecommended to receive IBRANCE. \n \nTable 2. IBRANCE dose modification and management – Haematological toxicities \n\nCTCAE grade Dose modifications \nGrade 1 or 2 No dose adjustment is required. \nGrade 3a Day 1 of cycle: \n\nWithhold IBRANCE, until recovery to Grade ≤ 2, and repeat complete \nblood count monitoring within 1 week. When recovered to Grade ≤ 2, \nstart the next cycle at the same dose. \n \nDay 15 of first 2 cycles: \nIf Grade 3 on Day 15, continue IBRANCE at the current dose to \ncomplete cycle and repeat complete blood count on Day 22. \nIf Grade 4 on Day 22, see Grade 4 dose modification guidelines \nbelow. \n \nConsider dose reduction in cases of prolonged (> 1 week) recovery \nfrom Grade 3 neutropenia or recurrent Grade 3 neutropenia on Day 1 \nof subsequent cycles. \n\nGrade 3 ANCb  \n(< 1,000 to 500/mm3) \n+ Fever ≥ 38.5 ºC \nand/or infection \n\nAt any time: \nWithhold IBRANCE until recovery to Grade ≤ 2  \nResume at next lower dose. \n\nGrade 4a \n \n\nAt any time: \nWithhold IBRANCE until recovery to Grade ≤ 2. \nResume at next lower dose.\n\nGrading according to CTCAE 4.0. \nANC=absolute neutrophil counts; CTCAE=Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; \nLLN=lower limit of normal. \na Table applies to all haematological adverse reactions except lymphopenia (unless associated with \n\nclinical events, e.g., opportunistic infections). \nb ANC: Grade 1: ANC < LLN – 1,500/mm3; Grade 2: ANC 1,000 - < 1,500/mm3; \n\nGrade 3: ANC 500 - < 1,000/mm3; Grade 4: ANC < 500/mm3.\n \nTable 3. IBRANCE dose modification and management – Non-haematological toxicities \n\nCTCAE grade Dose modifications \nGrade 1 or 2 No dose adjustment is required. \nGrade ≥ 3 non-haematological toxicity (if \npersisting despite medical treatment) \n\nWithhold until symptoms resolve to: \n Grade ≤ 1; \n Grade ≤ 2 (if not considered a safety risk \n\nfor the patient) \nResume at the next lower dose. \n\nGrading according to CTCAE 4.0. \nCTCAE=Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. \n \nPermanently discontinue IBRANCE in patients with severe interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis \n(see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment of IBRANCE is necessary in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of IBRANCE is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh classes A and B). For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), the \nrecommended dose of IBRANCE is 75 mg once daily on Schedule 3/1 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of IBRANCE is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 15 mL/min). Insufficient data are available in patients \nrequiring haemodialysis to provide any dose adjustment recommendation in this patient population \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of IBRANCE in children and adolescents < 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nIBRANCE is for oral use. It should be taken with food, preferably a meal to ensure consistent \npalbociclib exposure (see section 5.2). Palbociclib should not be taken with grapefruit or grapefruit \njuice (see section 4.5). \n \nIBRANCE capsules should be swallowed whole (should not be chewed, crushed, or opened prior to \nswallowing). No capsule should be ingested if it is broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nUse of preparations containing St. John’s Wort (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPre/perimenopausal women \n \nOvarian ablation or suppression with an LHRH agonist is mandatory when pre/perimenopausal \nwomen are administered IBRANCE in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, due to the mechanism \nof action of aromatase inhibitors. Palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant in pre/perimenopausal \nwomen has only been studied in combination with an LHRH agonist. \n \nCritical visceral disease \n \nThe efficacy and safety of palbociclib have not been studied in patients with critical visceral disease \n(see section 5.1). \n \nHaematological disorders \n \nDose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients \nwho develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Appropriate monitoring should be performed (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.8). \n \nInterstitial lung disease/pneumonitis \n \nSevere, life-threatening, or fatal ILD and/or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with IBRANCE \nwhen taken in combination with endocrine therapy. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nAcross clinical trials (PALOMA-1, PALOMA-2, PALOMA-3), 1.4% of IBRANCE-treated patients \nhad ILD/pneumonitis of any grade, 0.1% had Grade 3, and no Grade 4 or fatal cases were reported. \nAdditional cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in the post-marketing setting, with fatalities \nreported (see section 4.8). \n \nMonitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. hypoxia, cough, \ndyspnoea). In patients who have new or worsening respiratory symptoms and are suspected to have \ndeveloped ILD/pneumonitis, interrupt IBRANCE immediately and evaluate the patient. Permanently \ndiscontinue IBRANCE in patients with severe ILD or pneumonitis (see section 4.2).  \n \nInfections \n \nSince IBRANCE has myelosuppressive properties, it may predispose patients to infections. \n \nInfections have been reported at a higher rate in patients treated with IBRANCE in randomised \nclinical studies compared to patients treated in the respective comparator arm. Grade 3 and Grade 4 \ninfections occurred respectively in 5.6% and 0.9% of patients treated with IBRANCE in any \ncombination (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated as medically appropriate \n(see section 4.2). \n \nPhysicians should inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nAdminister IBRANCE with caution to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, with close \nmonitoring of signs of toxicity (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nAdminister IBRANCE with caution to patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, with close \nmonitoring of signs of toxicity (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nConcomitant treatment with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 \n \nStrong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may lead to increased toxicity (see section 4.5). Concomitant use of \nstrong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with palbociclib should be avoided. Coadministration \nshould only be considered after careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks. If \ncoadministration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, reduce the IBRANCE dose to 75 mg \nonce daily. When the strong inhibitor is discontinued, increase the IBRANCE dose (after 3-5 half-lives \nof the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor (see section 4.5). \n \nCoadministration of CYP3A inducers may lead to decreased palbociclib exposure and consequently a \nrisk for lack of efficacy. Therefore, concomitant use of palbociclib with strong CYP3A4 inducers \nshould be avoided. No dose adjustments are required for coadministration of palbociclib with \nmoderate CYP3A inducers (see section 4.5). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential or their partners  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential or their male partners must use a highly effective method of \ncontraception while taking IBRANCE (see section 4.6). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nLactose \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nSodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per capsule, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPalbociclib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A and sulphotransferase (SULT) enzyme SULT2A1. \nIn vivo, palbociclib is a weak, time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib \n \nEffect of CYP3A inhibitors \nCoadministration of multiple 200 mg doses of itraconazole with a single 125 mg palbociclib dose \nincreased palbociclib total exposure (AUCinf) and the peak concentration (Cmax) by approximately 87% \nand 34%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg palbociclib dose given alone.  \n \nThe concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors including, but not limited to: clarithromycin, \nindinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, \nsaquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice, should be \navoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustments are needed for mild and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. \n \nEffect of CYP3A inducers \nCoadministration of multiple 600 mg doses of rifampin with a single 125 mg palbociclib dose \ndecreased palbociclib AUCinf and Cmax by 85% and 70%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg \npalbociclib dose given alone. \n \nThe concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers including, but not limited to: carbamazepine, \nenzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampin, and St. John’s Wort should be avoided (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nCoadministration of multiple 400 mg daily doses of modafinil, a moderate CYP3A inducer, with a \nsingle 125 mg IBRANCE dose decreased palbociclib AUCinf and Cmax by 32% and 11%, respectively, \nrelative to a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose given alone. No dose adjustments are required for \nmoderate CYP3A inducers (see section 4.4). \n \nEffect of acid reducing agents  \n \nUnder fed conditions (intake of a moderate-fat meal), coadministration of multiple doses of the proton \npump inhibitor (PPI) rabeprazole with a single dose of 125 mg IBRANCE decreased palbociclib Cmax \nby 41%, but had limited impact on AUCinf (13% decrease) compared with a single dose of 125 mg \nIBRANCE administered alone. \n \nUnder fasting conditions, the coadministration of multiple doses of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) \nrabeprazole with a single dose of 125 mg IBRANCE decreased palbociclib AUCinf and Cmax by 62% \nand 80%, respectively. Therefore, IBRANCE should be taken with food, preferably a meal (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n \nGiven the reduced effect on gastric pH of H2-receptor antagonists and local antacids compared to \nPPIs, no clinically relevant effect of H2-receptor antagonists or local antacids on palbociclib exposure \nis expected when palbociclib is taken with food. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nEffects of palbociclib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n \nPalbociclib is a weak, time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A following daily 125 mg dosing at steady \nstate. Coadministration of multiple doses of palbociclib with midazolam increased the midazolam \nAUCinf and Cmax values by 61% and 37%, respectively, as compared with administration of midazolam \nalone.  \n \nThe dose of sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, \ndihydroergotamine, ergotamine, everolimus, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus) \nmay need to be reduced when coadministered with IBRANCE as IBRANCE may increase their \nexposure.  \n \nDrug-drug interaction between palbociclib and letrozole  \n \nData from the drug-drug interaction (DDI) evaluation portion of a clinical study in patients with breast \ncancer showed that there was no drug interaction between palbociclib and letrozole when the \n2 medicinal products were coadministered.  \n \nEffect of tamoxifen on palbociclib exposure \n \nData from a DDI study in healthy male subjects indicated that palbociclib exposures were comparable \nwhen a single dose of palbociclib was coadministered with multiple doses of tamoxifen and when \npalbociclib was given alone. \n \nDrug-drug interaction between palbociclib and fulvestrant  \n \nData from a clinical study in patients with breast cancer showed that there was no clinically relevant \ndrug interaction between palbociclib and fulvestrant when the two medicinal products were \ncoadministered. \n \nDrug-drug interaction between palbociclib and oral contraceptives \n \nDDI studies of palbociclib with oral contraceptives have not been conducted (see section 4.6). \n \nIn vitro studies with transporters  \n \nBased on in vitro data, palbociclib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast \ncancer resistance protein (BCRP) mediated transport. Therefore, administration of palbociclib with \nmedicinal products that are substrates of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran, colchicine) or BCRP (e.g., \npravastatin, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine) may increase their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.  \n \nBased on in vitro data, palbociclib may inhibit the uptake transporter organic cationic transporter \nOCT1 and then may increase the exposure of medical product substrates of this transporter \n(e.g., metformin). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \n \nFemales of childbearing potential who are receiving this medicinal product, or their male partners \nshould use adequate contraceptive methods (e.g., double-barrier contraception) during therapy and for \nat least 3 weeks or 14 weeks after completing therapy for females and males, respectively (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of palbociclib in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). IBRANCE is not recommended during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nNo studies have been conducted in humans or animals to assess the effect of palbociclib on milk \nproduction, its presence in breast milk, or its effects on the breast-fed child. It is unknown whether \npalbociclib is excreted in human milk. Patients receiving palbociclib should not breast feed. \n \nFertility \n \nThere were no effects on oestrous cycle (female rats) or mating and fertility in rats (male or female) in \nnon-clinical reproductive studies. However, no clinical data have been obtained on fertility in humans. \nBased on male reproductive organ findings (seminiferous tubule degeneration in testis, epididymal \nhypospermia, lower sperm motility and density, and decreased prostate secretion) in nonclinical safety \nstudies, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with palbociclib (see section 5.3). Thus, men \nmay consider sperm preservation prior to beginning therapy with IBRANCE. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIBRANCE has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, IBRANCE may \ncause fatigue and patients should exercise caution when driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of IBRANCE is based on pooled data from 872 patients who received \npalbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy (N=527 in combination with letrozole and N=345 \nin combination with fulvestrant) in randomised clinical studies in HR-positive, HER2-negative \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer. \n \nThe most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions of any grade reported in patients receiving palbociclib in \nrandomised clinical studies were neutropenia, infections, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, stomatitis, \nanaemia, diarrhoea, alopecia and thrombocytopenia. The most common (≥ 2%) Grade ≥ 3 adverse \nreactions of palbociclib were neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, anaemia, aspartate aminotransferase \n(AST) increased, fatigue, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased. \n \nDose reductions or dose modifications due to any adverse reaction occurred in 38.4% of patients \nreceiving IBRANCE in randomised clinical studies regardless of the combination. \n \nPermanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 5.2% of patients receiving \nIBRANCE in randomised clinical studies regardless of the combination. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 4 reports the adverse reactions from the pooled dataset of 3 randomised studies. The median \nduration of palbociclib treatment across the pooled dataset at the time of the final overall survival (OS) \nanalysis was 14.8 months. \n \nTable 5 reports the laboratory abnormalities observed in pooled datasets from 3 randomised studies. \n \nThe adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency category. Frequency categories \nare defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to \n\n\n\n10 \n\n< 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness.  \n \nTable 4.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE33. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPalbociclib is a highly selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6. \nCyclin D1 and CDK4/6 are downstream of multiple signalling pathways which lead to cellular \nproliferation. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nThrough inhibition of CDK4/6, palbociclib reduced cellular proliferation by blocking progression of \nthe cell from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle. Testing of palbociclib in a panel of molecularly \nprofiled breast cancer cell lines revealed high activity against luminal breast cancers, particularly \nER-positive breast cancers. In the cell lines tested, the loss of retinoblastoma (Rb) was associated with \nloss of palbociclib activity. However, in a follow-up study with fresh tumour samples, no relation \nbetween RB1 expression and tumour response was observed. Similarly, no relation was observed \nwhen studying the response to palbociclib in in vivo models with patient-derived xenografts (PDX \nmodels). Available clinical data are reported in the clinical efficacy and safety section (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \n \nThe effect of palbociclib on the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval was evaluated using \ntime matched electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluating the change from baseline and corresponding \npharmacokinetic data in 77 patients with advanced breast cancer. Palbociclib did not prolong the QTc \nto any clinically relevant extent at the recommended dose of 125 mg daily (Schedule 3/1). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRandomised Phase 3 Study PALOMA-2: IBRANCE in combination with letrozole  \n \nThe efficacy of palbociclib in combination with letrozole versus letrozole plus placebo was evaluated \nin an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study \nconducted in women with ER-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced breast cancer not amenable \nto resection or radiation therapy with curative intent or metastatic breast cancer who had not received \nprior systemic treatment for their advanced disease. \n \nA total of 666 postmenopausal women were randomised 2:1 to the palbociclib plus letrozole arm or \nplacebo plus letrozole arm and were stratified by site of disease (visceral versus nonvisceral), \ndisease-free interval from the end of (neo)adjuvant treatment to disease recurrence (de novo metastatic \nversus  12 months versus > 12 months), and by the type of prior (neo)adjuvant anticancer therapies \n(prior hormonal therapy versus no prior hormonal therapy). Patients with advanced symptomatic, \nvisceral spread, that were at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term (including patients \nwith massive uncontrolled effusions [pleural, pericardial, peritoneal], pulmonary lymphangitis, and \nover 50% liver involvement), were not eligible for enrolment into the study.  \n \nPatients continued to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic \ndeterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. \nCrossover between treatment arms was not allowed. \n \nPatients were well matched for baseline demographics and prognostic characteristics between the \npalbociclib plus letrozole arm and the placebo plus letrozole arm. The median age of patients enrolled \nin this study was 62 years (range 28-89), 48.3% of patients had received chemotherapy and 56.3% had \n\n\n\n13 \n\nreceived antihormonal therapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting prior to their diagnosis of advanced breast \ncancer while 37.2% of patients had received no prior systemic therapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting. \nThe majority of patients (97.4%) had metastatic disease at baseline, 23.6% of patients had bone-only \ndisease, and 49.2% of patients had visceral disease. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated according to \nResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1, as assessed by investigator. \nSecondary efficacy endpoints included objective response (OR), clinical benefit response (CBR), \nsafety, and change in quality of life (QoL).  \n \nAt the data cutoff date of 26-February-2016, the study met its primary objective of improving PFS. \nThe observed hazard ratio (HR) was 0.576 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46, 0.72) in favour of \npalbociclib plus letrozole, with a stratified log-rank test 1-sided p-value of < 0.000001. An updated \nanalysis of the primary and secondary endpoints was performed after an additional 15 months of \nfollow up (data cutoff date: 31-May-2017). A total of 405 PFS events were observed; 245 events \n(55.2%) in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 160 (72.1%) in the comparator arm respectively. \n \nTable 6 shows the efficacy results based on the primary and the updated analyses from the \nPALOMA-2 study, as assessed by the investigator and by the independent review.  \n \n\nTable 6.

Similarly, a reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the \npalbociclib plus letrozole arm was observed in 512 patients whose tumour tested positive for Rb \nprotein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (HR of 0.543 [95% CI: 0.433, 0.681], mPFS \n27.4 months versus 13.7 months). For the 51 patients IHC negative for Rb expression, the difference \nbetween treatment arms was not statistically significant (HR of 0.868 [95% CI: 0.424, 1.777], mPFS \n23.2 versus 18.5 months) for the palbociclib plus letrozole arm versus the placebo plus letrozole arm, \nrespectively. \n \nAdditional efficacy measures (OR and time to response [TTR]) assessed in the sub-groups of patients \nwith or without visceral disease based on the 31-May-2017 updated cutoff date are displayed in \nTable 7. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nTable 7.

Pre/perimenopausal women \nreceived the LHRH agonist goserelin. Patients with advanced/metastatic, symptomatic, visceral \nspread, that were at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term (including patients with \nmassive uncontrolled effusions [pleural, pericardial, peritoneal], pulmonary lymphangitis, and over \n50% liver involvement), were not eligible for enrolment into the study. \n \nPatients continued to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic \ndeterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. \nCrossover between treatment arms was not allowed.  \n \nPatients were well matched for baseline demographics and prognostic characteristics between the \npalbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. The median age of patients \nenrolled in this study was 57 years (range 29, 88). In each treatment arm the majority of patients were \nWhite, had documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, and were postmenopausal. \nApproximately 20% of patients were pre/perimenopausal. All patients had received prior systemic \ntherapy and most patients in each treatment arm had received a previous chemotherapy regimen for \ntheir primary diagnosis. More than half (62%) had an ECOG PS of 0, 60% had visceral metastases, \nand 60% had received more than 1 prior hormonal regimen for their primary diagnosis. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated according to RECIST 1.1. \nSupportive PFS analyses were based on an Independent Central Radiology Review. Secondary \nendpoints included OR, CBR, overall survival (OS), safety, and time-to-deterioration (TTD) in pain \nendpoint.  \n \nThe study met its primary endpoint of prolonging investigator-assessed PFS at the interim analysis \nconducted on 82% of the planned PFS events; the results crossed the prespecified Haybittle-Peto \n\n\n\n16 \n\nefficacy boundary (α=0.00135), demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in PFS and a \nclinically meaningful treatment effect. A more mature update of efficacy data is reported in Table 8. \n \nAfter a median follow-up time of 45 months, the final OS analysis was performed based on 310 events \n(60% of randomised patients). A 6.9-month difference in median OS in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant \narm compared with the placebo plus fulvestrant arm was observed; this result was not statistically \nsignificant at the prespecified significance level of 0.0235 (1-sided). In the placebo plus fulvestrant \narm, 15.5% of randomised patients received palbociclib and other CDK inhibitors as post progression \nsubsequent treatments. \n \nThe results from the investigator-assessed PFS and final OS data from PALOMA-3 study are \npresented in Table 8.

A total of 335 patients in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 166 patients \nin the fulvestrant only arm completed the questionnaire at baseline and at least 1 postbaseline visit. \n \nTime-to-Deterioration was prespecified as time between baseline and first occurrence of ≥ 10 points \nincrease from baseline in pain symptom scores. Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant resulted in a \nsymptom benefit by significantly delaying time-to-deterioration in pain symptom compared with \nplacebo plus fulvestrant (median 8.0 months versus 2.8 months; HR of 0.64 [95% CI: 0.49, 0.85]; \np< 0.001).   \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nIBRANCE in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of breast carcinoma (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of palbociclib were characterised in patients with solid tumours including \nadvanced breast cancer and in healthy volunteers. \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe mean Cmax of palbociclib is generally observed between 6 to 12 hours following oral \nadministration. The mean absolute bioavailability of palbociclib after an oral 125 mg dose is 46%. In \nthe dosing range of 25 mg to 225 mg, the area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax increase proportionally \nwith dose in general. Steady state was achieved within 8 days following repeated once daily dosing. \nWith repeated once daily administration, palbociclib accumulates with a median accumulation ratio of \n2.4 (range 1.5-4.2). \n \nFood effect \n \nPalbociclib absorption and exposure were very low in approximately 13% of the population under the \nfasted condition. Food intake increased the palbociclib exposure in this small subset of the population, \nbut did not alter palbociclib exposure in the rest of the population to a clinically relevant extent. \nCompared to palbociclib given under overnight fasted conditions, the AUCinf and Cmax of palbociclib \nincreased by 21% and 38% when given with high-fat food, by 12% and 27% when given with low-fat \nfood, and by 13% and 24% when moderate-fat food was given 1 hour before and 2 hours after \npalbociclib dosing. In addition, food intake significantly reduced the intersubject and intrasubject \n\n\n\n19 \n\nvariability of palbociclib exposure. Based on these results, palbociclib should be taken with food (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nDistribution \n \nBinding of palbociclib to human plasma proteins in vitro was ~85%, with no concentration \ndependence. The mean fraction unbound (fu) of palbociclib in human plasma in vivo increased \nincrementally with worsening hepatic function. There was no obvious trend in the mean palbociclib fu \nin human plasma in vivo with worsening renal function. In vitro, the uptake of palbociclib into human \nhepatocytes occurred mainly via passive diffusion. Palbociclib is not a substrate of OATP1B1 or \nOATP1B3. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn vitro and in vivo studies indicate that palbociclib undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism in \nhumans. Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of [14C]palbociclib to humans, the \nmajor primary metabolic pathways for palbociclib involved oxidation and sulphonation, with acylation \nand glucuronidation contributing as minor pathways. Palbociclib was the major circulating \ndrug-derived entity in plasma.  \n \nThe majority of the material was excreted as metabolites. In faeces, the sulfamic acid conjugate of \npalbociclib was the major drug-related component, accounting for 25.8% of the administered dose. \nIn vitro studies with human hepatocytes, liver cytosolic and S9 fractions, and recombinant \nsulphotransferase (SULT) enzymes indicated that CYP3A and SULT2A1 are mainly involved in the \nmetabolism of palbociclib. \n \nElimination \n \nThe geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of palbociclib was 63 L/h, and the mean plasma \nelimination half-life was 28.8 hours in patients with advanced breast cancer. In 6 healthy male subjects \ngiven a single oral dose of [14C]palbociclib, a median of 92% of the total administered radioactive \ndose was recovered in 15 days; faeces (74% of dose) was the major route of excretion, with 17% of \nthe dose recovered in urine. Excretion of unchanged palbociclib in faeces and urine was 2% and 7% of \nthe administered dose, respectively. \n \nIn vitro, palbociclib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6, and is not an \ninducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, and 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. \n \nIn vitro evaluations indicate that palbociclib has low potential to inhibit the activities of organic anion \ntransporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT)2, organic anion transporting polypeptide \n(OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, and bile salt export pump (BSEP) at clinically relevant concentrations.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge, gender, and body weight \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 183 patients with cancer (50 male and 133 female \npatients, age ranging from 22 to 89 years, and body weight ranging from 38 to 123 kg), gender had no \neffect on the exposure of palbociclib, and age and body weight had no clinically important effect on \nthe exposure of palbociclib. \n \nPaediatric population \nPharmacokinetics of palbociclib has not been evaluated in patients < 18 years of age. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nHepatic impairment \nData from a pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic function indicate that \npalbociclib unbound exposure (unbound AUCinf) decreased by 17% in subjects with mild hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh class A), and increased by 34% and 77% in subjects with moderate \n(Child-Pugh class B) and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to \nsubjects with normal hepatic function. Peak palbociclib unbound exposure (unbound Cmax) was \nincreased by 7%, 38% and 72% for mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, \nrelative to subjects with normal hepatic function. In addition, based on a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis that included 183 patients with advanced cancer, where 40 patients had mild hepatic \nimpairment based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) classification (total bilirubin ≤ Upper Limit of \nNormal (ULN) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) > ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN \nand any AST), mild hepatic impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib. \n \nRenal impairment \nData from a pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with varying degrees of renal function indicate that total \npalbociclib exposure (AUCinf) increased by 39%, 42%, and 31% with mild \n(60 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 90 mL/min), moderate (30 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 60 mL/min), and severe \n(CrCl < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal \n(CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min) renal function. Peak palbociclib exposure (Cmax) was increased by 17%, 12%, and \n15% for mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal \nrenal function. In addition, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 183 patients \nwith advanced cancer, where 73 patients had mild renal impairment and 29 patients had moderate \nrenal impairment, mild and moderate renal impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \npalbociclib. The pharmacokinetics of palbociclib have not been studied in patients requiring \nhaemodialysis. \n \nEthnicity \nIn a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers, palbociclib AUCinf and Cmax values were 30% and \n35% higher, respectively, in Japanese subjects compared with non-Asian subjects after a single oral \ndose. However, this finding was not reproduced consistently in subsequent studies in Japanese or \nAsian breast cancer patients after multiple dosing. Based on an analysis of the cumulative \npharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy data across Asian and non-Asian populations, no dose \nadjustment based on Asian race is considered necessary. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe primary target organ findings of potential relevance to humans included haematolymphopoietic \nand male reproductive organ effects in rats and dogs in studies up to 39 weeks duration. Effects on \nglucose metabolism were associated with findings in the pancreas and secondary effects on eye, teeth, \nkidney, and adipose tissue in studies ≥ 15 weeks duration in rats only and bone changes were observed \nin rats only following 27 weeks of dosing. These systemic toxicities were generally observed at \nclinically relevant exposures based on AUC. In addition, cardiovascular effects (QTc prolongation, \ndecreased heart rate, and increased RR interval and systolic blood pressure) were identified in \ntelemetered dogs at ≥ 4 times human clinical exposure based on Cmax. The reversibility of the effects \non glucose homeostasis, pancreas, eye, kidney, and bone was not established following a 12-week \nnondosing period, whereas partial to full reversal of effects on the haematolymphopoietic and male \nreproductive systems, teeth, and adipose tissue was observed. \n \nCarcinogenicity \n \nPalbociclib was assessed for carcinogenicity in a 6-month transgenic mouse study and in a 2-year rat \nstudy. Palbociclib was negative for carcinogenicity in transgenic mice at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day \n(No Observed Effect Level [NOEL] approximately 11 times human clinical exposure based on AUC). \nPalbociclib-related neoplastic finding in rats included an increased incidence of microglial cell \ntumours in the central nervous system of males at 30 mg/kg/day; there were no neoplastic findings in \nfemale rats at any dose up to 200 mg/kg/day. The NOEL for palbociclib-related carcinogenicity effects \nwas 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC) and \n\n\n\n21 \n\n200 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC) in males and \nfemales, respectively. The relevance of the male rat neoplastic finding to humans is unknown. \n \nGenotoxicity \n \nPalbociclib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and did not induce \nstructural chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay. \n \nPalbociclib induced micronuclei via an aneugenic mechanism in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells in vitro \nand in the bone marrow of male rats at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/day. The exposure of animals at the no \nobserved effect level for aneugenicity was approximately 7 times human clinical exposure based on \nAUC. \n \nImpairment of fertility \n \nPalbociclib did not affect mating or fertility in female rats at any dose tested up to 300 mg/kg/day \n(approximately 3 times human clinical exposure based on AUC), and no adverse effects were \nobserved in female reproductive tissues in repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 300 mg/kg/day in the rat \nand 3 mg/kg/day in the dog (approximately 5 and 3 times human clinical exposure based on AUC, \nrespectively).  \n \nPalbociclib is considered to have the potential to impair reproductive function and fertility in male \nhumans based on non-clinical findings in rats and dogs. Palbociclib-related findings in the testis, \nepididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicle included decreased organ weight, atrophy or degeneration, \nhypospermia, intratubular cellular debris, lower sperm motility and density, and decreased secretion. \nThese findings were observed in rats and/or dogs at exposures  9 times or subtherapeutic compared to \nhuman clinical exposure based on AUC, respectively. Partial reversibility of male reproductive organ \neffects was observed in the rat and dog following a 4- and 12-week nondosing period, respectively. \nDespite these male reproductive organ findings, there were no effects on mating or fertility in male \nrats at projected exposure levels 13 times human clinical exposure based on AUC. \n \nDevelopmental toxicity \n \nPalbociclib is a reversible inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, which are both involved in \nregulating the cell cycle. It may therefore have risk of foetal harm if used during pregnancy. \nPalbociclib was foetotoxic in pregnant animals. An increased incidence of a skeletal variation \n(increased incidence of a rib present at the seventh cervical vertebra) at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day was observed \nin rats. Reduced foetal body weights were observed at a maternally toxic dose of 300 mg/kg/day in \nrats (3 times human clinical exposure based on AUC), and an increased incidence of skeletal \nvariations, including small phalanges in the forelimb was observed at a maternally toxic dose of \n20 mg/kg/day in rabbits (4 times human clinical exposure based on AUC). Actual foetal exposure and \ncross-placenta transfer have not been examined.  \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth \nfactor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer: \n\n- in combination with an aromatase inhibitor;  \n- in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy (see \n\nsection 5.1). \nIn pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinizing \nhormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with IBRANCE should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \nanticancer medicinal products. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 125 mg of palbociclib once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by \n7 days off treatment (Schedule 3/1) to comprise a complete cycle of 28 days. The treatment with \nIBRANCE should be continued as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit from therapy or until \nunacceptable toxicity occurs. \n \nWhen coadministered with palbociclib, the aromatase inhibitor should be administered according to \nthe dose schedule reported in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Treatment of \npre/perimenopausal women with the combination of palbociclib plus an aromatase inhibitor should \nalways be combined with an LHRH agonist (see section 4.4).  \n \nWhen coadministered with palbociclib, the recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg administered \nintramuscularly on Days 1, 15, 29, and once monthly thereafter. Please refer to the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics of fulvestrant. Prior to the start of treatment with the combination of \npalbociclib plus fulvestrant, and throughout its duration, pre/perimenopausal women should be treated \nwith LHRH agonists according to local clinical practice. \n \nPatients should be encouraged to take their dose at approximately the same time each day. If the \npatient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken that day. The next prescribed \ndose should be taken at the usual time. \n \nDose adjustments \nDose modification of IBRANCE is recommended based on individual safety and tolerability. \n \nManagement of some adverse reactions may require temporary dose interruptions/delays, and/or dose \nreductions, or permanent discontinuation as per dose reduction schedules provided in Tables 1, 2, and \n3 (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nTable 1.

For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), the \nrecommended dose of IBRANCE is 75 mg once daily on Schedule 3/1 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n27 \n\nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of IBRANCE is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 15 mL/min). Insufficient data are available in patients \nrequiring haemodialysis to provide any dose adjustment recommendation in this patient population \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of IBRANCE in children and adolescents < 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nIBRANCE is for oral use. The tablets may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). Palbociclib \nshould not be taken with grapefruit or grapefruit juice (see section 4.5). \n \nIBRANCE tablets should be swallowed whole (should not be chewed, crushed, or split prior to \nswallowing). No tablet should be ingested if it is broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nUse of preparations containing St. John’s Wort (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPre/perimenopausal women \n \nOvarian ablation or suppression with an LHRH agonist is mandatory when pre/perimenopausal \nwomen are administered IBRANCE in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, due to the mechanism \nof action of aromatase inhibitors. Palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant in pre/perimenopausal \nwomen has only been studied in combination with an LHRH agonist. \n \nCritical visceral disease \n \nThe efficacy and safety of palbociclib have not been studied in patients with critical visceral disease \n(see section 5.1). \n \nHaematological disorders \n \nDose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients \nwho develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Appropriate monitoring should be performed (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.8). \n \nInterstitial lung disease/pneumonitis \n \nSevere, life-threatening, or fatal ILD and/or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with IBRANCE \nwhen taken in combination with endocrine therapy. \n \nAcross clinical trials (PALOMA-1, PALOMA-2, PALOMA-3), 1.4% of IBRANCE-treated patients \nhad ILD/pneumonitis of any grade, 0.1% had Grade 3, and no Grade 4 or fatal cases were reported. \nAdditional cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in the post-marketing setting, with fatalities \nreported (see section 4.8). \n \nMonitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. hypoxia, cough, \ndyspnoea). In patients who have new or worsening respiratory symptoms and are suspected to have \n\n\n\n28 \n\ndeveloped ILD/pneumonitis, interrupt IBRANCE immediately and evaluate the patient. Permanently \ndiscontinue IBRANCE in patients with severe ILD or pneumonitis (see section 4.2).  \n \nInfections \n \nSince IBRANCE has myelosuppressive properties, it may predispose patients to infections. \n \nInfections have been reported at a higher rate in patients treated with IBRANCE in randomised \nclinical studies compared to patients treated in the respective comparator arm. Grade 3 and Grade 4 \ninfections occurred respectively in 5.6% and 0.9% of patients treated with IBRANCE in any \ncombination (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated as medically appropriate \n(see section 4.2). \n \nPhysicians should inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nAdminister IBRANCE with caution to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, with close \nmonitoring of signs of toxicity (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nAdminister IBRANCE with caution to patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, with close \nmonitoring of signs of toxicity (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nConcomitant treatment with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 \n \nStrong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may lead to increased toxicity (see section 4.5). Concomitant use of \nstrong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with palbociclib should be avoided. Coadministration \nshould only be considered after careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks. If \ncoadministration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, reduce the IBRANCE dose to 75 mg \nonce daily. When the strong inhibitor is discontinued, increase the IBRANCE dose (after 3-5 half-lives \nof the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor (see section 4.5). \n \nCoadministration of CYP3A inducers may lead to decreased palbociclib exposure and consequently a \nrisk for lack of efficacy. Therefore, concomitant use of palbociclib with strong CYP3A4 inducers \nshould be avoided. No dose adjustments are required for coadministration of palbociclib with \nmoderate CYP3A inducers (see section 4.5). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential or their partners  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential or their male partners must use a highly effective method of \ncontraception while taking IBRANCE (see section 4.6). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPalbociclib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A and sulphotransferase (SULT) enzyme SULT2A1. \nIn vivo, palbociclib is a weak, time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib \n \nEffect of CYP3A inhibitors \nCoadministration of multiple 200 mg doses of itraconazole with a single 125 mg palbociclib dose \nincreased palbociclib total exposure (AUCinf) and the peak concentration (Cmax) by approximately 87% \nand 34%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg palbociclib dose given alone.  \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nThe concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors including, but not limited to: clarithromycin, \nindinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, \nsaquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice, should be \navoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustments are needed for mild and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. \n \nEffect of CYP3A inducers \nCoadministration of multiple 600 mg doses of rifampin with a single 125 mg palbociclib dose \ndecreased palbociclib AUCinf and Cmax by 85% and 70%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg \npalbociclib dose given alone. \n \nThe concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers including, but not limited to: carbamazepine, \nenzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampin, and St. John’s Wort should be avoided (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nCoadministration of multiple 400 mg daily doses of modafinil, a moderate CYP3A inducer, with a \nsingle 125 mg IBRANCE dose decreased palbociclib AUCinf and Cmax by 32% and 11%, respectively, \nrelative to a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose given alone. No dose adjustments are required for \nmoderate CYP3A inducers (see section 4.4). \n \nEffect of acid reducing agents  \n \nCoadministration of multiple doses of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) rabeprazole with a single \n125 mg IBRANCE tablet under fasted conditions had no effect on the rate and extent of absorption of \npalbociclib when compared to a single 125 mg IBRANCE tablet administered alone.   \n \nGiven the reduced effect on gastric pH of H2-receptor antagonists and local antacids compared to \nPPIs, no clinically relevant effect of H2-receptor antagonists or local antacids on palbociclib exposure \nis expected. \n \nEffects of palbociclib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n \nPalbociclib is a weak, time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A following daily 125 mg dosing at steady \nstate. Coadministration of multiple doses of palbociclib with midazolam increased the midazolam \nAUCinf and Cmax values by 61% and 37%, respectively, as compared with administration of midazolam \nalone.  \n \nThe dose of sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, \ndihydroergotamine, ergotamine, everolimus, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus) \nmay need to be reduced when coadministered with IBRANCE as IBRANCE may increase their \nexposure.  \n \nDrug-drug interaction between palbociclib and letrozole  \n \nData from the drug-drug interaction (DDI) evaluation portion of a clinical study in patients with breast \ncancer showed that there was no drug interaction between palbociclib and letrozole when the \n2 medicinal products were coadministered.  \n \nEffect of tamoxifen on palbociclib exposure \n \nData from a DDI study in healthy male subjects indicated that palbociclib exposures were comparable \nwhen a single dose of palbociclib was coadministered with multiple doses of tamoxifen and when \npalbociclib was given alone. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nDrug-drug interaction between palbociclib and fulvestrant  \n \nData from a clinical study in patients with breast cancer showed that there was no clinically relevant \ndrug interaction between palbociclib and fulvestrant when the two medicinal products were \ncoadministered. \n \nDrug-drug interaction between palbociclib and oral contraceptives \n \nDDI studies of palbociclib with oral contraceptives have not been conducted (see section 4.6). \n \nIn vitro studies with transporters  \n \nBased on in vitro data, palbociclib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast \ncancer resistance protein (BCRP) mediated transport. Therefore, administration of palbociclib with \nmedicinal products that are substrates of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran, colchicine) or BCRP (e.g., \npravastatin, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine) may increase their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.  \n \nBased on in vitro data, palbociclib may inhibit the uptake transporter organic cationic transporter \nOCT1 and then may increase the exposure of medical product substrates of this transporter \n(e.g., metformin). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \n \nFemales of childbearing potential who are receiving this medicinal product, or their male partners \nshould use adequate contraceptive methods (e.g., double-barrier contraception) during therapy and for \nat least 3 weeks or 14 weeks after completing therapy for females and males, respectively (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of palbociclib in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). IBRANCE is not recommended during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nNo studies have been conducted in humans or animals to assess the effect of palbociclib on milk \nproduction, its presence in breast milk, or its effects on the breast-fed child. It is unknown whether \npalbociclib is excreted in human milk. Patients receiving palbociclib should not breast feed. \n \nFertility \n \nThere were no effects on oestrous cycle (female rats) or mating and fertility in rats (male or female) in \nnon-clinical reproductive studies. However, no clinical data have been obtained on fertility in humans. \nBased on male reproductive organ findings (seminiferous tubule degeneration in testis, epididymal \nhypospermia, lower sperm motility and density, and decreased prostate secretion) in non-clinical \nsafety studies, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with palbociclib (see section 5.3). \nThus, men may consider sperm preservation prior to beginning therapy with IBRANCE. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIBRANCE has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, IBRANCE may \ncause fatigue and patients should exercise caution when driving or using machines. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of IBRANCE is based on pooled data from 872 patients who received \npalbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy (N=527 in combination with letrozole and N=345 \nin combination with fulvestrant) in randomised clinical studies in HR-positive, HER2-negative \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer. \n \nThe most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions of any grade reported in patients receiving palbociclib in \nrandomised clinical studies were neutropenia, infections, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, stomatitis, \nanaemia, diarrhoea, alopecia and thrombocytopenia. The most common (≥ 2%) Grade ≥ 3 adverse \nreactions of palbociclib were neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, anaemia, aspartate aminotransferase \n(AST) increased, fatigue, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased. \n \nDose reductions or dose modifications due to any adverse reaction occurred in 38.4% of patients \nreceiving IBRANCE in randomised clinical studies regardless of the combination. \n \nPermanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 5.2% of patients receiving \nIBRANCE in randomised clinical studies regardless of the combination. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 4 reports the adverse reactions from the pooled dataset of 3 randomised studies. The median \nduration of palbociclib treatment across the pooled dataset at the time of the final overall survival (OS) \nanalysis was 14.8 months. \n \nTable 5 reports the laboratory abnormalities observed in pooled datasets from 3 randomised studies. \n \nThe adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency category. Frequency categories \nare defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness.  \n \nTable 4.

Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the event of a palbociclib overdose, both gastrointestinal (e.g., nausea, vomiting) and \nhaematological (e.g., neutropenia) toxicity may occur and general supportive care should be provided. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE33. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPalbociclib is a highly selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6. \nCyclin D1 and CDK4/6 are downstream of multiple signalling pathways which lead to cellular \nproliferation. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nThrough inhibition of CDK4/6, palbociclib reduced cellular proliferation by blocking progression of \nthe cell from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle. Testing of palbociclib in a panel of molecularly \nprofiled breast cancer cell lines revealed high activity against luminal breast cancers, particularly \nER-positive breast cancers. In the cell lines tested, the loss of retinoblastoma (Rb) was associated with \nloss of palbociclib activity. However, in a follow-up study with fresh tumour samples, no relation \nbetween RB1 expression and tumour response was observed. Similarly, no relation was observed \nwhen studying the response to palbociclib in in vivo models with patient-derived xenografts (PDX \nmodels). Available clinical data are reported in the clinical efficacy and safety section (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \n \nThe effect of palbociclib on the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval was evaluated using \ntime matched electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluating the change from baseline and corresponding \npharmacokinetic data in 77 patients with advanced breast cancer. Palbociclib did not prolong the QTc \nto any clinically relevant extent at the recommended dose of 125 mg daily (Schedule 3/1). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRandomised Phase 3 Study PALOMA-2: IBRANCE in combination with letrozole  \n \nThe efficacy of palbociclib in combination with letrozole versus letrozole plus placebo was evaluated \nin an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study \nconducted in women with ER-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced breast cancer not amenable \nto resection or radiation therapy with curative intent or metastatic breast cancer who had not received \nprior systemic treatment for their advanced disease. \n \nA total of 666 postmenopausal women were randomised 2:1 to the palbociclib plus letrozole arm or \nplacebo plus letrozole arm and were stratified by site of disease (visceral versus nonvisceral), \ndisease-free interval from the end of (neo)adjuvant treatment to disease recurrence (de novo metastatic \nversus  12 months versus > 12 months), and by the type of prior (neo)adjuvant anticancer therapies \n(prior hormonal therapy versus no prior hormonal therapy). Patients with advanced symptomatic, \nvisceral spread, that were at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term (including patients \nwith massive uncontrolled effusions [pleural, pericardial, peritoneal], pulmonary lymphangitis, and \nover 50% liver involvement), were not eligible for enrolment into the study.  \n \nPatients continued to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic \ndeterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. \nCrossover between treatment arms was not allowed. \n \nPatients were well matched for baseline demographics and prognostic characteristics between the \npalbociclib plus letrozole arm and the placebo plus letrozole arm. The median age of patients enrolled \nin this study was 62 years (range 28-89), 48.3% of patients had received chemotherapy and 56.3% had \nreceived antihormonal therapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting prior to their diagnosis of advanced breast \ncancer while 37.2% of patients had received no prior systemic therapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting. \nThe majority of patients (97.4%) had metastatic disease at baseline, 23.6% of patients had bone-only \ndisease, and 49.2% of patients had visceral disease. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated according to \nResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1, as assessed by investigator. \nSecondary efficacy endpoints included objective response (OR), clinical benefit response (CBR), \nsafety, and change in quality of life (QoL).  \n \nAt the data cutoff date of 26-February-2016, the study met its primary objective of improving PFS. \nThe observed hazard ratio (HR) was 0.576 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46, 0.72) in favour of \n\n\n\n35 \n\npalbociclib plus letrozole, with a stratified log-rank test 1-sided p-value of < 0.000001.

A reduction in the \nrisk of disease progression or death in favour of the palbociclib plus letrozole arm was observed in all \nindividual patient subgroups defined by stratification factors and baseline characteristics in the \nprimary and in the updated analysis.  \n \nBased on the 31-May-2017 data cutoff date, this reduction in risk continued to be observed in the \nfollowing subgroups: (1) patients with either visceral metastases (HR of 0.62 [95% CI: 0.47, 0.81], \nmedian progression-free survival [mPFS] 19.3 months versus 12.3 months) or without visceral \nmetastases (HR of 0.50 [95% CI: 0.37, 0.67], mPFS 35.9 months versus 17.0 months) and (2) patients \nwith either bone only disease (HR of 0.41 [95% CI: 0.26, 0.63], mPFS 36.2 months versus \n11.2 months) or without bone-only disease (HR of 0.62 [95% CI: 0.50, 0.78], mPFS 24.2 months \nversus 14.5 months). Similarly, a reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the \npalbociclib plus letrozole arm was observed in 512 patients whose tumour tested positive for Rb \nprotein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (HR of 0.543 [95% CI: 0.433, 0.681], mPFS \n27.4 months versus 13.7 months). For the 51 patients IHC negative for Rb expression, the difference \nbetween treatment arms was not statistically significant (HR of 0.868 [95% CI: 0.424, 1.777], mPFS \n23.2 versus 18.5 months) for the palbociclib plus letrozole arm versus the placebo plus letrozole arm, \nrespectively. \n \nAdditional efficacy measures (OR and time to response [TTR]) assessed in the sub-groups of patients \nwith or without visceral disease based on the 31-May-2017 updated cutoff date are displayed in \nTable 7. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nTable 7.

Pre/perimenopausal women \nreceived the LHRH agonist goserelin. Patients with advanced/metastatic, symptomatic, visceral \nspread, that were at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term (including patients with \nmassive uncontrolled effusions [pleural, pericardial, peritoneal], pulmonary lymphangitis, and over \n50% liver involvement), were not eligible for enrolment into the study. \n \nPatients continued to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic \ndeterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. \nCrossover between treatment arms was not allowed.  \n \nPatients were well matched for baseline demographics and prognostic characteristics between the \npalbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. The median age of patients \nenrolled in this study was 57 years (range 29, 88). In each treatment arm the majority of patients were \nWhite, had documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, and were postmenopausal. \nApproximately 20% of patients were pre/perimenopausal. All patients had received prior systemic \ntherapy and most patients in each treatment arm had received a previous chemotherapy regimen for \ntheir primary diagnosis. More than half (62%) had an ECOG PS of 0, 60% had visceral metastases, \nand 60% had received more than 1 prior hormonal regimen for their primary diagnosis. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated according to RECIST 1.1. \nSupportive PFS analyses were based on an Independent Central Radiology Review. Secondary \nendpoints included OR, CBR, overall survival (OS), safety, and time-to-deterioration (TTD) in pain \nendpoint.  \n \nThe study met its primary endpoint of prolonging investigator-assessed PFS at the interim analysis \nconducted on 82% of the planned PFS events; the results crossed the prespecified Haybittle-Peto \n\n\n\n38 \n\nefficacy boundary (α=0.00135), demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in PFS and a \nclinically meaningful treatment effect.  \n \nA more mature update of efficacy data is reported in Table 8. \n \nAfter a median follow-up time of 45 months, the final OS analysis was performed based on 310 events \n(60% of randomised patients). A 6.9-month difference in median OS in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant \narm compared with the placebo plus fulvestrant arm was observed; this result was not statistically \nsignificant at the prespecified significance level of 0.0235 (1-sided). In the placebo plus fulvestrant \narm, 15.5% of randomised patients received palbociclib and other CDK inhibitors as post progression \nsubsequent treatments. \n \nThe results from the investigator-assessed PFS and final OS data from PALOMA-3 study are \npresented in Table 8.

A total of 335 patients in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 166 patients \nin the fulvestrant only arm completed the questionnaire at baseline and at least 1 postbaseline visit. \n \nTime-to-Deterioration was prespecified as time between baseline and first occurrence of ≥ 10 points \nincrease from baseline in pain symptom scores. Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant resulted in a \nsymptom benefit by significantly delaying time-to-deterioration in pain symptom compared with \nplacebo plus fulvestrant (median 8.0 months versus 2.8 months; HR of 0.64 [95% CI: 0.49, 0.85]; \np< 0.001).   \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nIBRANCE in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of breast carcinoma (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of palbociclib were characterised in patients with solid tumours including \nadvanced breast cancer and in healthy volunteers. \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe Cmax of palbociclib is generally observed between 4 to 12 hours (time to reach maximum \nconcentration [Tmax]) following oral administration of IBRANCE tablets. The mean absolute \nbioavailability of palbociclib after an oral 125 mg dose is 46%. In the dosing range of 25 mg to \n225 mg, the area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax increase proportionally with dose in general. Steady \nstate was achieved within 8 days following repeated once daily dosing. With repeated once daily \nadministration, palbociclib accumulates with a median accumulation ratio of 2.4 (range 1.5-4.2). \n \nFood effect \n \nThe AUCinf and Cmax of palbociclib increased by 22% and 26%, respectively, when IBRANCE tablets \nwere given with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (approximately 800 to 1,000 calories with 150, 250, and \n500 to 600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively), and by 9% and 10%, \nrespectively, when IBRANCE tablets were given with a moderate fat, standard-calorie meal \n(approximately 500 to 700 calories with 75 to 105, 250 to 350, and 175 to 245 calories from protein, \ncarbohydrate, and fat, respectively), compared to IBRANCE tablets given under overnight fasted \nconditions. Based on these results, palbociclib tablets may be taken with or without food.  \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nDistribution \n \nBinding of palbociclib to human plasma proteins in vitro was ~85%, with no concentration \ndependence. The mean fraction unbound (fu) of palbociclib in human plasma in vivo increased \nincrementally with worsening hepatic function. There was no obvious trend in the mean palbociclib fu \nin human plasma in vivo with worsening renal function. In vitro, the uptake of palbociclib into human \nhepatocytes occurred mainly via passive diffusion. Palbociclib is not a substrate of OATP1B1 or \nOATP1B3. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn vitro and in vivo studies indicate that palbociclib undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism in \nhumans. Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of [14C]palbociclib to humans, the \nmajor primary metabolic pathways for palbociclib involved oxidation and sulphonation, with acylation \nand glucuronidation contributing as minor pathways. Palbociclib was the major circulating \ndrug-derived entity in plasma.  \n \nThe majority of the material was excreted as metabolites. In faeces, the sulfamic acid conjugate of \npalbociclib was the major drug-related component, accounting for 25.8% of the administered dose. \nIn vitro studies with human hepatocytes, liver cytosolic and S9 fractions, and recombinant \nsulphotransferase (SULT) enzymes indicated that CYP3A and SULT2A1 are mainly involved in the \nmetabolism of palbociclib. \n \nElimination \n \nThe geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of palbociclib was 63 L/h, and the mean plasma \nelimination half-life was 28.8 hours in patients with advanced breast cancer. In 6 healthy male subjects \ngiven a single oral dose of [14C]palbociclib, a median of 92% of the total administered radioactive \ndose was recovered in 15 days; faeces (74% of dose) was the major route of excretion, with 17% of \nthe dose recovered in urine. Excretion of unchanged palbociclib in faeces and urine was 2% and 7% of \nthe administered dose, respectively. \n \nIn vitro, palbociclib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6, and is not an \ninducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, and 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. \n \nIn vitro evaluations indicate that palbociclib has low potential to inhibit the activities of organic anion \ntransporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT)2, organic anion transporting polypeptide \n(OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, and bile salt export pump (BSEP) at clinically relevant concentrations.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge, gender, and body weight \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 183 patients with cancer (50 male and 133 female \npatients, age ranging from 22 to 89 years, and body weight ranging from 38 to 123 kg), gender had no \neffect on the exposure of palbociclib, and age and body weight had no clinically important effect on \nthe exposure of palbociclib. \n \nPaediatric population \nPharmacokinetics of palbociclib has not been evaluated in patients < 18 years of age. \n \nHepatic impairment \nData from a pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic function indicate that \npalbociclib unbound exposure (unbound AUCinf) decreased by 17% in subjects with mild hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh class A), and increased by 34% and 77% in subjects with moderate \n(Child-Pugh class B) and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to \nsubjects with normal hepatic function. Peak palbociclib unbound exposure (unbound Cmax) was \nincreased by 7%, 38% and 72% for mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, \n\n\n\n42 \n\nrelative to subjects with normal hepatic function. In addition, based on a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis that included 183 patients with advanced cancer, where 40 patients had mild hepatic \nimpairment based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) classification (total bilirubin ≤ Upper Limit of \nNormal (ULN) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) > ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN \nand any AST), mild hepatic impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib. \n \nRenal impairment \nData from a pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with varying degrees of renal function indicate that total \npalbociclib exposure (AUCinf) increased by 39%, 42%, and 31% with mild \n(60 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 90 mL/min), moderate (30 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 60 mL/min), and severe \n(CrCl < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal \n(CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min) renal function. Peak palbociclib exposure (Cmax) was increased by 17%, 12%, and \n15% for mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal \nrenal function. In addition, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 183 patients \nwith advanced cancer, where 73 patients had mild renal impairment and 29 patients had moderate \nrenal impairment, mild and moderate renal impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \npalbociclib. The pharmacokinetics of palbociclib have not been studied in patients requiring \nhaemodialysis. \n \nEthnicity \nIn a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers, palbociclib AUCinf and Cmax values were 30% and \n35% higher, respectively, in Japanese subjects compared with non-Asian subjects after a single oral \ndose. However, this finding was not reproduced consistently in subsequent studies in Japanese or \nAsian breast cancer patients after multiple dosing. Based on an analysis of the cumulative \npharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy data across Asian and non-Asian populations, no dose \nadjustment based on Asian race is considered necessary. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe primary target organ findings of potential relevance to humans included haematolymphopoietic \nand male reproductive organ effects in rats and dogs in studies up to 39 weeks duration. Effects on \nglucose metabolism were associated with findings in the pancreas and secondary effects on eye, teeth, \nkidney, and adipose tissue in studies ≥ 15 weeks duration in rats only and bone changes were observed \nin rats only following 27 weeks of dosing. These systemic toxicities were generally observed at \nclinically relevant exposures based on AUC. In addition, cardiovascular effects (QTc prolongation, \ndecreased heart rate, and increased RR interval and systolic blood pressure) were identified in \ntelemetered dogs at ≥ 4 times human clinical exposure based on Cmax. The reversibility of the effects \non glucose homeostasis, pancreas, eye, kidney, and bone was not established following a 12-week \nnondosing period, whereas partial to full reversal of effects on the haematolymphopoietic and male \nreproductive systems, teeth, and adipose tissue was observed. \n \nCarcinogenicity \n \nPalbociclib was assessed for carcinogenicity in a 6-month transgenic mouse study and in a 2-year rat \nstudy. Palbociclib was negative for carcinogenicity in transgenic mice at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day \n(No Observed Effect Level [NOEL] approximately 11 times human clinical exposure based on AUC). \nPalbociclib-related neoplastic finding in rats included an increased incidence of microglial cell \ntumours in the central nervous system of males at 30 mg/kg/day; there were no neoplastic findings in \nfemale rats at any dose up to 200 mg/kg/day. The NOEL for palbociclib-related carcinogenicity effects \nwas 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC) and \n200 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC) in males and \nfemales, respectively. The relevance of the male rat neoplastic finding to humans is unknown. \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nGenotoxicity \n \nPalbociclib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and did not induce \nstructural chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay. \n \nPalbociclib induced micronuclei via an aneugenic mechanism in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells in vitro \nand in the bone marrow of male rats at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/day. The exposure of animals at the no \nobserved effect level for aneugenicity was approximately 7 times human clinical exposure based on \nAUC. \n \nImpairment of fertility \n \nPalbociclib did not affect mating or fertility in female rats at any dose tested up to 300 mg/kg/day \n(approximately 3 times human clinical exposure based on AUC), and no adverse effects were \nobserved in female reproductive tissues in repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 300 mg/kg/day in the rat \nand 3 mg/kg/day in the dog (approximately 5 and 3 times human clinical exposure based on AUC, \nrespectively).  \n \nPalbociclib is considered to have the potential to impair reproductive function and fertility in male \nhumans based on non-clinical findings in rats and dogs. Palbociclib-related findings in the testis, \nepididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicle included decreased organ weight, atrophy or degeneration, \nhypospermia, intratubular cellular debris, lower sperm motility and density, and decreased secretion. \nThese findings were observed in rats and/or dogs at exposures  9 times or subtherapeutic compared to \nhuman clinical exposure based on AUC, respectively. Partial reversibility of male reproductive organ \neffects was observed in the rat and dog following a 4- and 12-week nondosing period, respectively. \nDespite these male reproductive organ findings, there were no effects on mating or fertility in male \nrats at projected exposure levels 13 times human clinical exposure based on AUC. \n \nDevelopmental toxicity \n \nPalbociclib is a reversible inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, which are both involved in \nregulating the cell cycle. It may therefore have risk of foetal harm if used during pregnancy. \nPalbociclib was foetotoxic in pregnant animals. An increased incidence of a skeletal variation \n(increased incidence of a rib present at the seventh cervical vertebra) at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day was observed \nin rats. Reduced foetal body weights were observed at a maternally toxic dose of 300 mg/kg/day in \nrats (3 times human clinical exposure based on AUC), and an increased incidence of skeletal \nvariations, including small phalanges in the forelimb was observed at a maternally toxic dose of \n20 mg/kg/day in rabbits (4 times human clinical exposure based on AUC). Actual foetal exposure and \ncross-placenta transfer have not been examined.  \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What IBRANCE is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take IBRANCE \n3. How to take IBRANCE \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store IBRANCE \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What IBRANCE is and what it is used for \n \nIBRANCE is an anticancer medicine containing the active substance palbociclib.  \n \nPalbociclib works by blocking proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, which regulate cell \ngrowth and division. Blocking these proteins can slow down growth of cancer cells and delay the \nprogression of your cancer.  \n \nIBRANCE is used to treat patients with certain types of breast cancer (hormone receptor-positive, \nhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative) which have spread beyond the original tumour \nand/or to other organs. It is given together with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant, which are used as \nhormonal anticancer therapies. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take IBRANCE  \n \nDo not take IBRANCE \n \n\n- if you are allergic to palbociclib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).  \n\n- use of preparations containing St. John’s Wort should be avoided while you are taking \nIBRANCE. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking IBRANCE. \n \n\n\n\n93 \n\nIBRANCE may reduce the number of your white blood cells and weaken your immune system. \nTherefore, you may be at greater risk of getting an infection while you are taking IBRANCE. \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you experience signs or symptoms of an infection, such as \nchills or fever. \n \nYou will have regular blood tests during treatment to check whether IBRANCE affects your blood \ncells (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets).  \n \nIBRANCE may cause severe or life-threatening inflammation of the lungs during treatment that can \nlead to death. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any new or worsening symptoms \nincluding: \n\n difficulty breathing or shortness of breath \n dry cough  \n chest pain \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nIBRANCE is not to be used in children or adolescents (under 18 years of age). \n \nOther medicines and IBRANCE \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. IBRANCE may affect the way some other medicines work. \n \nIn particular, the following may increase the risk of side effects with IBRANCE: \n\n Lopinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, telaprevir, and saquinavir used to treat HIV \ninfection/AIDS. \n\n Clarithromycin and telithromycin antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections.  \n Voriconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and posaconazole used to treat fungal infections. \n Nefazodone used to treat depression. \n\n \nThe following medicines may have increased risk of side effects when given with IBRANCE:  \n\n Quinidine generally used to treat heart rhythm problems. \n Colchicine used to treat gout. \n Pravastatin and rosuvastatin used to treat high cholesterol levels. \n Sulfasalazine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. \n Alfentanil used for anaesthesia in surgery; fentanyl used in pre-procedures as a pain reliever as \n\nwell as an anaesthetic. \n Cyclosporine, everolimus, tacrolimus, and sirolimus used in organ transplantation to prevent \n\nrejection. \n Dihydroergotamine and ergotamine used to treat migraine. \n Pimozide used to treat schizophrenia and chronic psychosis. \n \n\nThe following medicines may reduce the effectiveness of IBRANCE:  \n Carbamazepine and phenytoin, used to stop seizures or fits. \n Enzalutamide to treat prostate cancer. \n Rifampin used to treat tuberculosis (TB). \n St. John’s Wort, an herbal product used to treat mild depression and anxiety. \n\n  \nIBRANCE with food and drink \n \nAvoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while you are taking IBRANCE as it may increase the side \neffects of IBRANCE. \n \n\n\n\n94 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding and fertility \n \nYou should not use IBRANCE if you are pregnant. \n \nYou should avoid becoming pregnant while taking IBRANCE. \n \nDiscuss contraception with your doctor if there is any possibility that you or your partner may become \npregnant.  \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential who are receiving this medicinal product, or their male partners \nshould use adequate contraceptive methods (e.g., double-barrier contraception such as condom and \ndiaphragm). These methods should be used during therapy and for at least 3 weeks after completing \ntherapy for females and for at least 14 weeks for males. \n \nBreast-feeding \nYou should not breast-feed while taking IBRANCE. It is not known if IBRANCE is excreted in breast \nmilk. \n \nFertility \nPalbociclib may decrease fertility in men. \n \nTherefore, men may consider sperm preservation before taking IBRANCE. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nTiredness is a very common side effect. If you feel unusually tired, take special care when driving or \nusing machines. \n \nIBRANCE contains lactose and sodium \nThis medicine contains lactose (found in milk or dairy products). If you have been told by your doctor \nthat you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say it is essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take IBRANCE \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose is 125 mg of IBRANCE taken once a day for 3 weeks followed by 1 week \nwithout taking IBRANCE. Your doctor will tell you how many capsules of IBRANCE to take. \n \nIf you experience certain side effects while you are taking IBRANCE (see section 4 “Possible side \neffects”), your doctor may lower your dose or stop treatment, either temporarily or permanently. The \ndose may be lowered to one of the other available strengths 100 mg or 75 mg. \n \nTake IBRANCE once a day at about the same time every day with food, preferably a meal. \n \nSwallow the capsule whole with a glass of water. Do not chew or crush the capsules. Do not open the \ncapsules. \n \n\n\n\n95 \n\nIf you take more IBRANCE than you should \n \nIf you have taken too much IBRANCE, see a doctor or go to a hospital immediately.

What you need to know before you take IBRANCE \n3. How to take IBRANCE \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store IBRANCE \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What IBRANCE is and what it is used for \n \nIBRANCE is an anticancer medicine containing the active substance palbociclib.  \n \nPalbociclib works by blocking proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, which regulate cell \ngrowth and division. Blocking these proteins can slow down growth of cancer cells and delay the \nprogression of your cancer.  \n \nIBRANCE is used to treat patients with certain types of breast cancer (hormone receptor-positive, \nhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative) which have spread beyond the original tumour \nand/or to other organs. It is given together with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant, which are used as \nhormonal anticancer therapies. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take IBRANCE  \n \nDo not take IBRANCE \n \n\n- if you are allergic to palbociclib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).  \n\n- use of preparations containing St. John’s Wort should be avoided while you are taking \nIBRANCE. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking IBRANCE. \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \nIBRANCE may reduce the number of your white blood cells and weaken your immune system. \nTherefore, you may be at greater risk of getting an infection while you are taking IBRANCE. \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you experience signs or symptoms of an infection, such as \nchills or fever. \n \nYou will have regular blood tests during treatment to check whether IBRANCE affects your blood \ncells (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets).  \n \nIBRANCE may cause severe or life-threatening inflammation of the lungs during treatment that can \nlead to death. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any new or worsening symptoms \nincluding: \n\n difficulty breathing or shortness of breath \n dry cough  \n chest pain \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nIBRANCE is not to be used in children or adolescents (under 18 years of age). \n \nOther medicines and IBRANCE \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. IBRANCE may affect the way some other medicines work. \n \nIn particular, the following may increase the risk of side effects with IBRANCE: \n\n Lopinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, telaprevir, and saquinavir used to treat HIV \ninfection/AIDS. \n\n Clarithromycin and telithromycin antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections.  \n Voriconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and posaconazole used to treat fungal infections. \n Nefazodone used to treat depression. \n\n \nThe following medicines may have increased risk of side effects when given with IBRANCE:  \n\n Quinidine generally used to treat heart rhythm problems. \n Colchicine used to treat gout. \n Pravastatin and rosuvastatin used to treat high cholesterol levels. \n Sulfasalazine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. \n Alfentanil used for anaesthesia in surgery; fentanyl used in pre-procedures as a pain reliever as \n\nwell as an anaesthetic. \n Cyclosporine, everolimus, tacrolimus, and sirolimus used in organ transplantation to prevent \n\nrejection. \n Dihydroergotamine and ergotamine used to treat migraine. \n Pimozide used to treat schizophrenia and chronic psychosis. \n \n\nThe following medicines may reduce the effectiveness of IBRANCE:  \n Carbamazepine and phenytoin, used to stop seizures or fits. \n Enzalutamide to treat prostate cancer. \n Rifampin used to treat tuberculosis (TB). \n St. John’s Wort, an herbal product used to treat mild depression and anxiety. \n\n \nIBRANCE with food and drink \n \nIBRANCE tablets may be taken with or without food.  \n \n\n\n\n101 \n\nAvoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while you are taking IBRANCE as it may increase the side \neffects of IBRANCE.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding and fertility \n \nYou should not use IBRANCE if you are pregnant. \n \nYou should avoid becoming pregnant while taking IBRANCE. \n \nDiscuss contraception with your doctor if there is any possibility that you or your partner may become \npregnant.  \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential who are receiving this medicinal product, or their male partners \nshould use adequate contraceptive methods (e.g., double-barrier contraception such as condom and \ndiaphragm). These methods should be used during therapy and for at least 3 weeks after completing \ntherapy for females and for at least 14 weeks for males. \n \nBreast-feeding \nYou should not breast-feed while taking IBRANCE. It is not known if IBRANCE is excreted in breast \nmilk. \n \nFertility \nPalbociclib may decrease fertility in men. \n \nTherefore, men may consider sperm preservation before taking IBRANCE. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nTiredness is a very common side effect. If you feel unusually tired, take special care when driving or \nusing machines. \n \n \n3. How to take IBRANCE \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose is 125 mg of IBRANCE taken once a day for 3 weeks followed by 1 week \nwithout taking IBRANCE. Your doctor will tell you how many tablets of IBRANCE to take. \n \nIf you experience certain side effects while you are taking IBRANCE (see section 4 “Possible side \neffects”), your doctor may lower your dose or stop treatment, either temporarily or permanently. The \ndose may be lowered to one of the other available strengths 100 mg or 75 mg. \n \nTake IBRANCE once a day at about the same time every day with or without food. \n \nSwallow the tablet whole with a glass of water. Do not chew or crush the tablets. Do not split the \ntablets prior to swallowing. No tablet should be ingested if it is broken, cracked, or otherwise not \nintact. \n \nIf you take more IBRANCE than you should \n \nIf you have taken too much IBRANCE, see a doctor or go to a hospital immediately. Urgent treatment \nmay be necessary. \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \nTake the carton and this leaflet, so that the doctor knows what you have been taking. \n \nIf you forget to take IBRANCE \n \nIf you miss a dose or vomit, take your next dose as scheduled. Do not take a double dose to make up \nfor the forgotten tablets. \n \nIf you stop taking IBRANCE \n \nDo not stop taking IBRANCE unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
