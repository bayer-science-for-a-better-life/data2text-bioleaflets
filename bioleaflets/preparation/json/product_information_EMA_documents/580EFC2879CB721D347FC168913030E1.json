NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAzacitidine Mylan 25 mg/mL powder for suspension for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial of powder contains 100 mg azacitidine.  \nAfter reconstitution, each mL of suspension contains 25 mg azacitidine. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for suspension for injection (powder for injection). \n \nWhite lyophilised powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAzacitidine Mylan is indicated for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for \nhaematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with: \n- intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to the International \n\nPrognostic Scoring System (IPSS), \n- chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with 10-29% marrow blasts without \n\nmyeloproliferative disorder, \n- acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to \n\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) classification, \n- AML with > 30% marrow blasts according to the WHO classification. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nAzacitidine Mylan treatment should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician \nexperienced in the use of chemotherapeutic agents. Patients should be premedicated with anti-emetics \nfor nausea and vomiting. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline \nhaematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m2 of body surface area, injected subcutaneously, daily for \n7 days, followed by a rest period of 21 days (28-day treatment cycle). \n \nIt is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 6 cycles. Treatment should be continued \nas long as the patient continues to benefit or until disease progression. \n \nPatients should be monitored for haematologic response/toxicity and renal toxicities (see section 4.4); \na delay in starting the next cycle or a dose reduction as described below may be necessary. \n \nLaboratory tests \nLiver function tests, serum creatinine and serum bicarbonate should be determined prior to initiation \nof therapy and prior to each treatment cycle. Complete blood counts should be performed prior to \ninitiation of therapy and as needed to monitor response and toxicity, but at a minimum, prior to each \ntreatment cycle. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nDose adjustment due to haematological toxicity \nHaematological toxicity is defined as the lowest count reached in a given cycle (nadir) if platelets \n≤ 50.0 x 109/l and/or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤ 1 x 109/l. \n \nRecovery is defined as an increase of cell line(s) where haematological toxicity was observed of at \nleast half of the difference of nadir and the baseline count plus the nadir count (i.e. blood count at \nrecovery ≥ nadir count + (0.5 x [baseline count – nadir count]). \n \nPatients without reduced baseline blood counts (i.e. white blood cells (WBC) ≥ 3.0 x 109/l and \nANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, and platelets ≥ 75.0 x 109/l) prior to the first treatment \n \nIf haematological toxicity is observed following Azacitidine Mylan treatment, the next cycle of the \ntherapy should be delayed until the platelet count and the ANC have recovered. If recovery is achieved \nwithin 14 days, no dose adjustment is necessary. However, if recovery has not been achieved within \n14 days, the dose should be reduced according to the following table. Following dose modifications, \nthe cycle duration should return to 28 days. \n \nNadir counts % Dose in the next cycle, if \n\nrecovery* is not achieved \nwithin 14 days \n\nANC (x 109/l) Platelets (x 109/l) \n\n≤ 1.0 ≤ 50.0 50% \n> 1.0 > 50.0 100% \n*Recovery = counts ≥ nadir count + (0.5 x [baseline count – nadir count]) \n \nPatients with reduced baseline blood counts (i.e. WBC < 3.0 x 109/l or ANC < 1.5 x 109/l or platelets \n< 75.0 x 109/l) prior to the first treatment \nFollowing Azacitidine Mylan treatment, if the decrease in WBC or ANC or platelets from that prior to \ntreatment is ≤ 50%, or greater than 50% but with an improvement in any cell line differentiation, the \nnext cycle should not be delayed and no dose adjustment made. \n \nIf the decrease in WBC or ANC or platelets is greater than 50% from that prior to treatment, with no \nimprovement in cell line differentiation, the next cycle of Azacitidine Mylan therapy should be \ndelayed until the platelet count and the ANC have recovered. If recovery is achieved within 14 days, \nno dose adjustment is necessary. However, if recovery has not been achieved within 14 days, bone \nmarrow cellularity should be determined. If the bone marrow cellularity is > 50%, no dose adjustments \nshould be made. If bone marrow cellularity is ≤ 50%, treatment should be delayed and the dose \nreduced according to the following table: \n \nBone marrow cellularity % Dose in the next cycle if recovery is not achieved within \n\n14 days \n Recovery* ≤ 21 days Recovery* > 21 days \n15-50% 100% 50% \n< 15% 100% 33% \n*Recovery = counts ≥ nadir count + (0.5 x [baseline count – nadir count]) \nFollowing dose modifications, the cycle duration should return to 28 days. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly patients \nNo specific dose adjustments are recommended for the elderly. Because elderly patients are more \nlikely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nAzacitidine Mylan can be administered to patients with renal impairment without initial dose \nadjustment (see section 5.2). If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than \n20 mmol/l occur, the dose should be reduced by 50% on the next cycle. If unexplained elevations in \nserum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to ≥ 2-fold above baseline values and above upper \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nlimit of normal (ULN) occur, the next cycle should be delayed until values return to normal or \nbaseline and the dose should be reduced by 50% on the next treatment cycle (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). Patients \nwith severe hepatic organ impairment should be carefully monitored for adverse events. No specific \nmodification to the starting dose is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment prior to starting \ntreatment; subsequent dose modifications should be based on haematology laboratory values. \nAzacitidine Mylan is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumours (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Azacitidine Mylan in children aged 0-17 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \nReconstituted Azacitidine Mylan should be injected subcutaneously into the upper arm, thigh or \nabdomen. \n \nInjection sites should be rotated. New injections should be given at least 2.5 cm from the previous site \nand never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hardened. \n \nAfter reconstitution, the suspension should not be filtered. For instructions on reconstitution of the \nmedicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nAdvanced malignant hepatic tumours (see section 4.4). \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHaematological toxicity \nTreatment with azacitidine is associated with anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, particularly \nduring the first 2 cycles (see section 4.8). Complete blood counts should be performed as needed to \nmonitor response and toxicity, but at least prior to each treatment cycle. After administration of the \nrecommended dose for the first cycle, the dose for subsequent cycles should be reduced or its \nadministration delayed based on nadir counts and haematological response (see section 4.2). Patients \nshould be advised to promptly report febrile episodes. Patients and physicians are also advised to be \nobservant for signs and symptoms of bleeding. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with extensive \ntumour burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma \nand death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline serum albumin \n< 30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumours (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal abnormalities ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death were reported in \npatients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. In \naddition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to < 20 mmol/L in association \nwith an alkaline urine and hypokalaemia (serum potassium < 3 mmol/L) developed in 5 subjects with \nchronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) treated with azacitidine and etoposide. If unexplained \nreductions in serum bicarbonate (< 20 mmol/L) or elevations of serum creatinine or BUN occur, the \ndose should be reduced or administration delayed (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \nPatients should be advised to report oliguria and anuria to the health care provider immediately. \n \nAlthough no clinically relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions were noted between \nsubjects with normal renal function compared to those with renal impairment, patients with renal \nimpairment should be closely monitored for toxicity since azacitidine and/or its metabolites are \nprimarily excreted by the kidney (see section 4.2). \n \nLaboratory tests \nLiver function tests, serum creatinine and serum bicarbonate should be determined prior to initiation \nof therapy and prior to each treatment cycle. Complete blood counts should be performed prior to \ninitiation of therapy and as needed to monitor response and toxicity, but at a minimum, prior to each \ntreatment cycle, see also section 4.8. \n \nCardiac and pulmonary disease \nPatients with a history of severe congestive heart failure, clinically unstable cardiac disease or \npulmonary disease were excluded from the pivotal registration studies (AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 and \nAZA-AML-001) and therefore the safety and efficacy of azacitidine in these patients has not been \nestablished. Recent data from a clinical study in patients with a known history of cardiovascular or \npulmonary disease showed a significantly increased incidence of cardiac events with azacitidine (see \nsection 4.8). It is therefore advised to exercise caution when prescribing azacitidine to these patients. \nCardiopulmonary assessment before and during the treatment should be considered. \n \nNecrotising fasciitis \nNecrotising fasciitis, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients treated with azacitidine. \nAzacitidine therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop necrotising fasciitis and \nappropriate treatment should be promptly initiated. \n \nTumour lysis syndrome \nThe patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. \nThese patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBased on in vitro data, azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 \nisoenzymes (CYPs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulfotransferases (SULTs), and \nglutathione transferases (GSTs); interactions related to these metabolizing enzymes in vivo are \ntherefore considered unlikely. \n \nClinically significant inhibitory or inductive effects of azacitidine on cytochrome P450 enzymes are \nunlikely (see section 5.2). \n \nNo formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential and men have to use effective contraception during and up to \n3 months after treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Studies in mice have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Based on \nresults from animal studies and its mechanism of action, azacitidine should not be used during \npregnancy, especially during the first trimester, unless clearly necessary. The advantages of treatment \nshould be weighed against the possible risk for the foetus in every individual case. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether azacitidine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Due to the potential serious \nadverse reactions in the breast-feeding child, breast-feeding is contraindicated during azacitidine \ntherapy. \n \nFertility \nThere are no human data on the effect of azacitidine on fertility. In animals, adverse reactions with \nazacitidine use on male fertility have been documented (see section 5.3). Men should be advised not to \nfather a child while receiving treatment and must use effective contraception during and up to \n3 months after treatment. Before starting treatment, male patients should be advised to seek \ncounselling on sperm storage. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAzacitidine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has \nbeen reported with the use of azacitidine. Therefore, caution is recommended when driving or \noperating machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nAdult population with MDS, CMML and AML (20-30% marrow blasts) \nAdverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of azacitidine \nhave occurred in 97% of patients. \n \nThe most common serious adverse reactions noted from the pivotal study (AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001) \nincluded febrile neutropenia (8.0%) and anaemia (2.3%), which were also reported in the supporting \nstudies (CALGB 9221 and CALGB 8921). Other serious adverse reactions from these 3 studies \nincluded infections such as neutropenic sepsis (0.8%) and pneumonia (2.5%) (some with fatal \noutcome), thrombocytopenia (3.5%), hypersensitivity reactions (0.25%) and haemorrhagic events (e.g. \ncerebral haemorrhage [0.5%], gastrointestinal haemorrhage [0.8%] and intracranial haemorrhage \n[0.5%])). \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions with azacitidine treatment were haematological \nreactions (71.4%) including thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and leukopenia (usually Grade 3-4), \ngastrointestinal events (60.6%) including nausea, vomiting (usually Grade 1-2) or injection site \nreactions (77.1%; usually Grade 1-2). \n \nAdult population aged 65 years or older with AML with > 30% marrow blasts \nThe most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 10%) noted from AZA-AML-001 within the \nazacitidine treatment arm included febrile neutropenia (25.0%), pneumonia (20.3%), and pyrexia \n(10.6%).

There is a greater risk of these events occurring during the first 2 cycles, \nafter which they occur with less frequency in patients with restoration of haematological function. \nMost haematological adverse reactions were managed by routine monitoring of complete blood counts \nand delaying azacitidine administration in the next cycle, prophylactic antibiotics and/or growth factor \nsupport (e.g. G-CSF) for neutropenia and transfusions for anaemia or thrombocytopenia as required. \n \nInfections \nMyelosuppression may lead to neutropenia and an increased risk of infection. Serious adverse \nreactions such as sepsis, including neutropenic sepsis, and pneumonia were reported in patients \nreceiving azacitidine, some with a fatal outcome. Infections may be managed with the use of \nanti-infectives plus growth factor support (e.g. G-CSF) for neutropenia. \n \nBleeding \nBleeding may occur with patients receiving azacitidine. Serious adverse reactions such as \ngastrointestinal haemorrhage and intracranial haemorrhage have been reported. Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding, particularly those with pre-existing or treatment \nrelated thrombocytopenia. \n \nHypersensitivity \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving azacitidine. In case of an \nanaphylactic-like reaction, treatment with azacitidine should be immediately discontinued and \nappropriate symptomatic treatment initiated. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue adverse reactions \nThe majority of skin and subcutaneous adverse reactions were associated with the injection site. None \nof these adverse reactions led to discontinuation of azacitidine, or reduction of azacitidine dose in the \npivotal studies. The majority of adverse reactions occurred during the first 2 cycles and tended to \ndecrease with subsequent cycles. Subcutaneous adverse reactions such as injection site \nrash/inflammation/pruritus, rash, erythema and skin lesion may require management with concomitant \nmedicinal products, such as antihistamines, corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedicinal products (NSAIDs). These cutaneous reactions have to be distinguished from soft tissue \ninfections, sometimes occurring at injection site. Soft tissue infections, including cellulitis and \nnecrotising fasciitis in rare cases leading to death, have been reported with azacitidine in the post \nmarketing setting. For clinical management of infectious adverse reactions, see section 4.8 Infections. \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \nGastrointestinal adverse reactions \nThe most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with azacitidine treatment \nincluded constipation, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. These adverse reactions were managed \nsymptomatically with anti-emetics for nausea and vomiting; anti-diarrhoeals for diarrhoea, and \nlaxatives and/or stool softeners for constipation. \n \nRenal adverse reactions \nRenal abnormalities, ranging from elevated serum creatinine and haematuria to renal tubular acidosis, \nrenal failure and death were reported in patients treated with azacitidine (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic adverse reactions \nPatients with extensive tumour burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience \nhepatic failure, progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nCardiac events \nData from a clinical study allowing enrolment of patients with known history of cardiovascular or \npulmonary disease showed a statistically significant increase in cardiac events in patients with newly \ndiagnosed AML treated with azacitidine (see section 4.4). \n \nElderly population \nThere is limited safety information available with azacitidine in patients ≥ 85 years (with \n14 [5.9%] patients ≥ 85 years in AZA-AML-001 study). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOne case of overdose with azacitidine was reported during clinical studies. A patient experienced \ndiarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting after receiving a single intravenous dose of approximately 290 mg/m2, \nalmost 4 times the recommended starting dose. \n \nIn the event of overdose, the patient should be monitored with appropriate blood counts and should \nreceive supportive treatment, as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for azacitidine \noverdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, pyrimidine analogues, ATC code: L01BC07 \n \nMechanism of action \nAzacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by multiple mechanisms including \ncytotoxicity on abnormal haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and hypomethylation of DNA. The \ncytotoxic effects of azacitidine may result from multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of DNA, \nRNA and protein synthesis, incorporation into RNA and DNA, and activation of DNA damage \npathways. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. Incorporation of azacitidine \ninto DNA results in the inactivation of DNA methyltransferases, leading to hypomethylation of DNA. \n \nDNA hypomethylation of aberrantly methylated genes involved in normal cell cycle regulation, \ndifferentiation and death pathways may result in gene re-expression and restoration of cancer \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nsuppressing functions to cancer cells. The relative importance of DNA hypomethylation versus \ncytotoxicity or other activities of azacitidine to clinical outcomes has not been established. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nAdult population (MDS, CMML and AML [20-30% marrow blasts]) \nThe efficacy and safety of azacitidine were studied in an international, multicenter, controlled, \nopen-label, randomised, parallel-group, Phase 3 comparative study (AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001) in \nadult patients with: intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according to the International Prognostic \nScoring System (IPSS), refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anaemia with excess \nblasts in transformation (RAEB-T) and modified chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (mCMML) \naccording to the French American British (FAB) classification system. RAEB-T patients \n(21-30% blasts) are now considered to be AML patients under the current WHO classification system. \nAzacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) (n = 179) was compared to conventional care regimens \n(CCR). CCR consisted of BSC alone (n = 105), low-dose cytarabine plus BSC (n = 49) or standard \ninduction chemotherapy plus BSC (n = 25). Patients were pre-selected by their physician to 1 of the \n3 CCR prior to randomisation. Patients received this pre-selected regimen if not randomised to \nazacitidine. As part of the inclusion criteria, patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative \nOncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. Patients with secondary MDS were excluded \nfrom the study. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. Azacitidine was administered \nat a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days, followed by a rest period of 21 days (28-day \ntreatment cycle) for a median of 9 cycles (range = 1-39) and a mean of 10.2 cycles. Within the Intent \nto Treat population (ITT), the median age was 69 years (range 38 to 88 years). \n \nIn the ITT analysis of 358 patients (179 azacitidine and 179 CCR), azacitidine treatment was \nassociated with a median survival of 24.46 months versus 15.02 months for those receiving CCR \ntreatment, a difference of 9.4 months, with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.0001. The hazard ratio for \nthe treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). The two-year survival rates were 50.8% in patients \nreceiving azacitidine versus 26.2% in patients receiving CCR (p < 0.0001). \n\n \nKEY: AZA = azacitidine; CCR  = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; \nHR  = hazard ratio \n \nThe survival benefits of azacitidine were consistent regardless of the CCR treatment option (BSC \nalone, low-dose cytarabine plus BSC or standard induction chemotherapy plus BSC) utilised in the \ncontrol arm. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nWhen IPSS cytogenetic subgroups were analysed, similar findings in terms of median overall survival \nwere observed in all groups (good, intermediate, poor cytogenetics, including monosomy 7). \n \nOn analyses of age subgroups, an increase in median overall survival was observed for all groups \n(< 65 years, ≥ 65 years and ≥ 75 years). \n \nAzacitidine treatment was associated with a median time to death or transformation to AML of \n13.0 months versus 7.6 months for those receiving CCR treatment, an improvement of 5.4 months \nwith a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.0025. \n \nAzacitidine treatment was also associated with a reduction in cytopenias, and their related symptoms. \nAzacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusions. Of the \npatients in the azacitidine group who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline, 45.0% of these \npatients became RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period, compared with 11.4% of \nthe patients in the combined CCR groups (a statistically significant (p < 0.0001) difference of 33.6% \n(95% CI: 22.4, 44.6). In patients who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became \nindependent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13 months in the azacitidine \ngroup. \n \nResponse was assessed by the investigator or by the Independent Review Committee (IRC). Overall \nresponse (complete remission [CR] + partial remission [PR]) as determined by the investigator was \n29% in the azacitidine group and 12% in the combined CCR group (p = 0.0001). Overall response \n(CR + PR) as determined by the IRC in AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 was 7% (12/179) in the azacitidine \ngroup compared with 1% (2/179) in the combined CCR group (p = 0.0113). The differences between \nthe IRC and investigator assessments of response were a consequence of the International Working \nGroup (IWG) criteria requiring improvement in peripheral blood counts and maintenance of these \nimprovements for a minimum of 56 days. A survival benefit was also demonstrated in patients that \nhad not achieved a complete/partial response following azacitidine treatment. Haematological \nimprovement (major or minor) as determined by the IRC was achieved in 49% of patients receiving \nazacitidine compared with 29% of patients treated with combined CCR (p < 0.0001). \n \nIn patients with one or more cytogenetic abnormalities at baseline, the percentage of patients with a \nmajor cytogenetic response was similar in the azacitidine and combined CCR groups. Minor \ncytogenetic response was statistically significantly (p = 0.0015) higher in the azacitidine group (34%) \ncompared with the combined CCR group (10%). \n \nAdult population aged 65 years or older with AML with > 30% marrow blasts \nThe results presented below represent the intent-to-treat population studied in AZA-AML-001 (see \nsection 4.1 for the approved indication). \n \nThe efficacy and safety of azacitidine was studied in an international, multicentre, controlled, \nopen-label, parallel group Phase 3 study in patients 65 years and older with newly diagnosed de novo \nor secondary AML with > 30% bone marrow blasts according to the WHO classification, who were \nnot eligible for HSCT. Azacitidine plus BSC (n=241) was compared to CCR. CCR consisted of BSC \nalone (n=45), low dose cytarabine plus BSC (n=158), or standard intensive chemotherapy with \ncytarabine and anthracycline plus BSC (n=44). Patients were pre-selected by their physician to 1 of the \n3 CCRs prior to randomization. Patients received the pre-selected regimen if not randomised to \nazacitidine. As part of the inclusion criteria, patients were required to have an ECOG performance \nstatus of 0-2 and intermediate- or poor-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. The primary endpoint of the \nstudy was overall survival. \n \nAzacitidine was administered at a SC dose of 75mg/m2/day for 7 days, followed by a rest period of \n21 days (28 day treatment cycle), for a median of 6 cycles (range: 1 to 28), BSC-only patients for a \nmedian of 3 cycles (range: 1 to 20), low-dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4 cycles \n(range 1 to 25) and standard intensive chemotherapy patients for a median of 2 cycles (range: 1 to 3, \ninduction cycle plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nThe individual baseline parameters were comparable between the azacitidine and CCR groups. The \nmedian age of the subjects was 75.0 years (range: 64 to 91 years), 75.2% were Caucasian and 59.0% \nwere male. At baseline 60.7% were classified as AML not otherwise specified, 32.4% AML with \nmyelodysplasia-related changes, 4.1% therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and 2.9% AML with \nrecurrent genetic abnormalities according to the WHO classification. \n \nIn the ITT analysis of 488 patients (241 azacitidine and 247 CCR), azacitidine treatment was \nassociated with a median survival of 10.4 months versus 6.5 months for those receiving CCR \ntreatment, a difference of 3.8 months, with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.1009 (two-sided). The \nhazard ratio for the treatment effect was 0.85 (95% CI= 0.69, 1.03). The one-year survival rates were \n46.5% in patients receiving azacitidine versus 34.3% in patients receiving CCR. \n \n\n \n \nThe Cox PH model adjusted for pre-specified baseline prognostic factors defined a HR for azacitidine \nversus CCR of 0.80 (95% CI= 0.66, 0.99; p = 0.0355). \n \nIn addition, although the study was not powered to demonstrate a statistically significant difference \nwhen comparing azacitidine to the preselection CCR treatment groups, the survival of azacitidine \ntreated patients was longer when compared to CCR treatment options BSC alone, low-dose cytarabine \nplus BSC and were similar when compared to standard intensive chemotherapy plus BSC. \n \nIn all pre-specified subgroups age [(< 75 years & ≥ 75 years), gender, race, ECOG performance status \n(0 or 1 & 2), baseline cytogenetic risk (intermediate & poor), geographic region, WHO classification \nof AML (including AML with myelodysplasia-related changes), baseline WBC count (≤ 5 x109/L & \n> 5 x 109/L), baseline bone marrow blasts (≤ 50% & > 50%) and prior history of MDS] there was a \ntrend in OS benefit in favour of azacitidine. In a few pre-specified subgroups, the OS HR reached \nstatistical significance including patients with poor cytogenetic risk, patients with AML with \nmyelodysplasia-related changes, patients < 75 years, female patients and white patients. \n \nHaematologic and cytogenetic responses were assessed by the investigator and by the IRC with similar \nresults. Overall response rate (complete remission [CR] + complete remission with incomplete blood \ncount recovery [CRi]) as determined by the IRC was 27.8% in the azacitidine group and 25.1% in the \ncombined CCR group (p = 0.5384). In patients who achieved CR or CRi, the median duration of \nremission was 10.4 months (95% CI = 7.2, 15.2) for the azacitidine subjects and 12.3 months \n(95% CI = 9.0, 17.0) for the CCR subjects. A survival benefit was also demonstrated in patients that \nhad not achieved a complete response for azacitidine compared to CCR. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nAzacitidine treatment improved peripheral blood counts and led to a reduced need for RBC and \nplatelet transfusions. A patient was considered RBC or platelet transfusion dependent at baseline if the \nsubject had one or more RBC or platelet transfusions during the 56 days (8 weeks) on or prior to \nrandomization, respectively. A patient was considered RBC or platelet transfusion independent during \nthe treatment period if the subject had no RBC or platelet transfusions during any consecutive 56 days \nduring the reporting period, respectively. \n \nOf the patients in the azacitidine group who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline, 38.5% \n(95% CI = 31.1, 46.2) of these patients became RBC transfusion independent during the treatment \nperiod, compared with 27.6% of (95% CI = 20.9, 35.1) patients in the combined CCR groups. In \npatients who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and achieved transfusion independence on \ntreatment, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.9 months in the azacitidine \ngroup and was not reached in the CCR group. \n \nOf the patients in the azacitidine group who were platelet transfusion dependent at baseline, 40.6% \n(95% CI = 30.9, 50.8) of these patients became platelet transfusion independent during the treatment \nperiod, compared with 29.3% of (95% CI = 19.7, 40.4) patients in the combined CCR groups. In \npatients who were platelet transfusion dependent at baseline and achieved transfusion independence on \ntreatment, the median duration of platelet transfusion independence was 10.8 months in the azacitidine \ngroup and 19.2 months in the CCR group. \n \nHealth-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the European Organization for Research \nand Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). HRQoL data could \nbe analysed for a subset of the full study population. While there are limitations in the analysis, the \navailable data suggest that patients do not experience meaningful deterioration in quality of life during \ntreatment with azacitidine. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of a single 75 mg/m2 dose, azacitidine was rapidly absorbed \nwith peak plasma concentrations of 750 ± 403 ng/mL occurring at 0.5 h after dosing (the first \nsampling point). The absolute bioavailability of azacitidine after subcutaneous relative to intravenous \nadministration (single 75 mg/m2 doses) was approximately 89% based on area under the curve (AUC). \n \nArea under the curve and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of subcutaneous administration of \nazacitidine were approximately proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m2 dose range. \n \nDistribution \nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution was 76 ± 26 L, and systemic \nclearance was 147 ± 47 L/h. \n \nBiotransformation \nBased on in vitro data, azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 \nisoenzymes (CYPs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulfotransferases (SULTs), and \nglutathione transferases (GSTs). \n \nAzacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. In \nhuman liver S9 fractions, formation of metabolites was independent of NADPH implying that \nazacitidine metabolism was not mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. An in vitro study of \nazacitidine with cultured human hepatocytes indicates that at concentrations of 1.0 μM to 100 μM (i.e. \nup to approximately 30-fold higher than clinically achievable concentrations), azacitidine does not \ninduce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4 or 3A5. In studies to assess inhibition of a series of P450 isoenzymes \n(CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) azacitidine up to 100 μM did not produce \ninhibition. Therefore, CYP enzyme induction or inhibition by azacitidine at clinically achievable \nplasma concentrations is unlikely. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nElimination \nAzacitidine is cleared rapidly from plasma with a mean elimination half-life (t½) after subcutaneous \nadministration of 41 ± 8 minutes. No accumulation occurs after subcutaneous administration of \n75 mg/m2 azacitidine once daily for 7 days. Urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of \nazacitidine and/or its metabolites. Following intravenous and subcutaneous administration of \n14C-azacitidine, 85 and 50% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine respectively, \nwhile < 1% was recovered in faeces. \n \nSpecial populations \nThe effects of hepatic impairment (see section 4.2), gender, age, or race on the pharmacokinetics of \nazacitidine have not been formally studied. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal impairment has no major effect on the pharmacokinetic exposure of azacitidine after single and \nmultiple subcutaneous administrations. Following subcutaneous administration of a single \n75 mg/m2 dose, mean exposure values (AUC and Cmax) from subjects with mild, moderate and severe \nrenal impairment were increased by 11-21%, 15-27%, and 41-66%, respectively, compared to normal \nrenal function subjects. However, exposure was within the same general range of exposures observed \nfor subjects with normal renal function. Azacitidine can be administered to patients with renal \nimpairment without initial dose adjustment provided these patients are monitored for toxicity since \nazacitidine and/or its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. \n \nPharmacogenomics \nThe effect of known cytidine deaminase polymorphisms on azacitidine metabolism has not been \nformally investigated. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAzacitidine induces both gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations in bacterial and mammalian \ncell systems in vitro. The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. \nAzacitidine induced tumours of the haematopoietic system in female mice, when administered \nintraperitoneally 3 times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumours in the \nlymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine \nadministered intraperitoneally for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats revealed an increased \nincidence of testicular tumours. \n \nEarly embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death \n(increased resorption) after a single intraperitoneal injection of azacitidine during organogenesis. \nDevelopmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before \nclosure of the hard palate. In rats, azacitidine caused no adverse reactions when given \npre-implantation, but it was clearly embryotoxic when given during organogenesis. Foetal \nabnormalities during organogenesis in rats included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), \nlimb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly) and others (microphthalmia, \nmicrognathia, gastroschisis, oedema, and rib abnormalities). \n \nAdministration of azacitidine to male mice prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in \ndecreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. \n \nTreatment of male rats resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, decreased sperm \ncounts, decreased pregnancy rates, an increase in abnormal embryos and increased loss of embryos in \nmated females (see section 4.4). \n \n \n6.

If not \nused immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user \nand must not be longer than 8 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C when reconstituted using water for injections that \nhas not been refrigerated or not longer than 22 hours when reconstituted using refrigerated (2 °C to \n8 °C) water for injections. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nClear colourless type I glass vial sealed with a grey halo butyl rubber stopper and aluminium seal, \ncontaining 100 mg of azacitidine. \n \nPack size: 1 vial and 7 vials. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nRecommendations for safe handling \nAzacitidine Mylan is a cytotoxic medicinal product and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, \ncaution should be exercised when handling and preparing azacitidine suspensions. Procedures for \nproper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products should be applied. \nIf reconstituted azacitidine comes into contact with the skin, immediately and thoroughly wash with \nsoap and water. If it comes into contact with mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. \n \nReconstitution procedure \nAzacitidine Mylan should be reconstituted with water for injections. The shelf life of the reconstituted \nmedicinal product can be extended by reconstituting with refrigerated (2 °C to 8 °C) water for \ninjections. Details on storage of the reconstituted product are provided below. \n \n1. The following supplies should be assembled: \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nVial(s) of azacitidine, vial(s) of water for injections, non-sterile surgical gloves, alcohol wipes, \n5 mL injection syringe(s) with needle(s). \n\n2. 4 mL of water for injections should be drawn into the syringe, making sure to purge any air \ntrapped within the syringe. \n\n3. The needle of the syringe containing the 4 mL of water for injections should be inserted through \nthe rubber top of the azacitidine vial followed by injection of the water for injections into the \nvial. \n\n4. Following removal of the syringe and needle, the vial should be vigorously shaken until a \nuniform cloudy suspension is achieved. After reconstitution each mL of suspension will contain \n25 mg of azacitidine (100 mg/4 mL). The reconstituted product is a homogeneous, cloudy \nsuspension, free of agglomerates. The product should be discarded if it contains large particles \nor agglomerates. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution since this could remove the \nactive substance. It must be taken into account that filters are present in some adaptors, spikes \nand closed systems, therefore such systems should not be used for administration of the \nmedicinal product after reconstitution. \n\n5.  The rubber top should be cleaned and a new syringe with needle inserted into the vial. The vial \nshould then be turned upside down, making sure the needle tip is below the level of the liquid. \nThe plunger should then be pulled back to withdraw the amount of medicinal product required \nfor the proper dose, making sure to purge any air trapped within the syringe. The syringe with \nneedle should then be removed from the vial and the needle disposed of. \n\n6. A fresh subcutaneous needle (recommended 25-gauge) should then be firmly attached to the \nsyringe. The needle should not be purged prior to injection, in order to reduce the incidence of \nlocal injection site reactions. \n\n7. When more than 1 vial is needed all the above steps for preparation of the suspension should be \nrepeated. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, the dose should be equally divided, e.g. dose \n150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it \nmay not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. \n\n8. The contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. \nThe syringe filled with reconstituted suspension should be allowed up to 30 minutes prior to \nadministration to reach a temperature of approximately 20 °C-25 °C. If the elapsed time is \nlonger than 30 minutes, the suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose \nprepared. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy \nsuspension is achieved. The product should be discarded if it contains large particles or \nagglomerates. \n\n \nStorage of the reconstituted product \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \nCalculation of an individual dose \nThe total dose, according to the body surface area (BSA) can be calculated as follows: \nTotal dose (mg) = Dose (mg/m2) x BSA (m2) \n \nThe following table is provided only as an example of how to calculate individual azacitidine doses \nbased on an average BSA value of 1.8 m2. \n \nDose mg/m2 \n(% of recommended \nstarting dose) \n\nTotal dose based on \nBSA value of 1.8 m2 \n\nNumber of vials \nrequired \n\nTotal volume of \nreconstituted \nsuspension required \n\n75 mg/m2 (100%) 135 mg 2 vials 5.4 mL \n37.5 mg/m2 (50%) 67.5 mg 1 vial 2.7 mL \n25 mg/m2 (33%) 45 mg 1 vial 1.8 mL \n \nMethod of administration \nReconstituted Azacitidine Mylan should be injected subcutaneously (insert the needle at a \n45-90° angle) using a 25-gauge needle into the upper arm, thigh or abdomen. \n \nDoses greater than 4 mL should be injected into two separate sites. \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\nInjection sites should be rotated. New injections should be given at least 2.5 cm from the previous site \nand never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hardened. \n \nDisposal \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Azacitidine Mylan is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Azacitidine Mylan is \nAzacitidine Mylan is an anti-cancer agent which belongs to a group of medicines called \n‘anti-metabolites’. Azacitidine Mylan contains the active substance ‘azacitidine’. \n \nWhat Azacitidine Mylan is used for \nAzacitidine Mylan is used in adults who are not able to have a stem cell transplantation to treat: \n• higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). \n• chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). \n• acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). \n \nThese are diseases which affect the bone marrow and can cause problems with normal blood cell \nproduction. \n \nHow Azacitidine Mylan works \nAzacitidine Mylan works by preventing cancer cells from growing. Azacitidine becomes incorporated \ninto the genetic material of cells (ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)). It is \nthought to work by altering the way the cell turns genes on and off and also by interfering with the \nproduction of new RNA and DNA. These actions are thought to correct problems with the maturation \nand growth of young blood cells in the bone marrow that cause myelodysplastic disorders, and to kill \ncancerous cells in leukaemia. \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about how Azacitidine Mylan works or why \nthis medicine has been prescribed for you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Azacitidine Mylan  \n \nDo not use Azacitidine Mylan \n• if you are allergic to azacitidine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n• if you have advanced liver cancer. \n• if you are breast-feeding. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Azacitidine Mylan: \n• if you have decreased counts of platelets, red or white blood cells. \n•  if you have kidney disease. \n• if you have liver disease. \n• if you have ever had a heart condition or heart attack or any history of lung disease. \n \nBlood test \nYou will have blood tests before you begin treatment with Azacitidine Mylan and at the start of each \nperiod of treatment (called a ‘cycle’). This is to check that you have enough blood cells and that your \nliver and kidneys are working properly. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nAzacitidine Mylan is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18. \n \nOther medicines and Azacitidine Mylan \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nThis is because Azacitidine Mylan may affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other \nmedicines may affect the way Azacitidine Mylan works. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nPregnancy \nYou should not use Azacitidine Mylan during pregnancy as it may be harmful to the baby. \nUse an effective method of contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment. \nTell your doctor straight away if you become pregnant during treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \nYou must not breast-feed when using Azacitidine Mylan.

Procedures for \nproper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products should be applied. \n \nIf reconstituted azacitidine comes into contact with the skin, immediately and thoroughly wash with \nsoap and water. If it comes into contact with mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. \n \nIncompatibilities \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned \nbelow (see “Reconstitution procedure”). \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \nReconstitution procedure \nAzacitidine Mylan should be reconstituted with water for injections. The shelf life of the reconstituted \nmedicinal product can be extended by reconstituting with refrigerated (2 °C to 8 °C) water for \ninjections. Details on storage of the reconstituted product are provided below. \n \n1. The following supplies should be assembled: \n Vial(s) of azacitidine, vial(s) of water for injections, non-sterile surgical gloves, alcohol wipes, \n\n5 mL injection syringe(s) with needle(s). \n2. 4 mL of water for injections should be drawn into the syringe, making sure to purge any air \n\ntrapped within the syringe. \n3. The needle of the syringe containing the 4 mL of water for injections should be inserted through \n\nthe rubber top of the azacitidine vial followed by injection of the water for injections into the \nvial. \n\n4. Following removal of the syringe and needle, the vial should be vigorously shaken until a \nuniform cloudy suspension is achieved. After reconstitution each mL of suspension will contain \n25 mg of azacitidine (100 mg/4 mL). The reconstituted product is a homogeneous, cloudy \nsuspension, free of agglomerates. The product should be discarded if it contains large particles \nor agglomerates. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution since this could remove the \nactive substance. It must be taken into account that filters are present in some adaptors, spikes \nand closed systems; therefore such systems should not be used for administration of the \nmedicinal product after reconstitution. \n\n5. The rubber top should be cleaned and a new syringe with needle inserted into the vial. The vial \nshould then be turned upside down, making sure the needle tip is below the level of the liquid. \nThe plunger should then be pulled back to withdraw the amount of medicinal product required \nfor the proper dose, making sure to purge any air trapped within the syringe. The syringe with \nneedle should then be removed from the vial and the needle disposed of. \n\n6. A fresh subcutaneous needle (recommended 25-gauge) should then be firmly attached to the \nsyringe. The needle should not be purged prior to injection, in order to reduce the incidence of \nlocal injection site reactions. \n\n7. When more than 1 vial is needed all the above steps for preparation of the suspension should be \nrepeated. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, the dose should be equally divided e.g., dose \n150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it \nmay not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. \n\n8. The contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. \n The temperature of the suspension at the time of injection should be approximately 20 ºC-25 ºC. \n To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension \n\nis achieved. The product should be discarded if it contains large particles or agglomerates. \n \nStorage of the reconstituted product \nFor immediate use \nThe Azacitidine Mylan suspension may be prepared immediately before use and the reconstituted \nsuspension should be administered within 1 hour. If elapsed time is greater than 1 hour, the \nreconstituted suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared. \n \nFor later use \nWhen reconstituting using water for injections that has not been refrigerated, the reconstituted \nsuspension must be placed in a refrigerator (2 °C to 8 °C) immediately after reconstitution and kept in \nthe refrigerator for a maximum of 8 hours. If the elapsed time in the refrigerator is greater than \n8 hours, the suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared. \n \nWhen reconstituting using refrigerated (2 °C to 8 °C) water for injections, the reconstituted suspension \nmust be placed in a refrigerator (2 °C to 8 °C) immediately after reconstitution and kept in a \nrefrigerator for a maximum of 22 hours. If the elapsed time in the refrigerator is greater than 22 hours, \nthe suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nThe syringe filled with reconstituted suspension should be allowed up to 30 minutes prior to \nadministration to reach a temperature of approximately 20 ºC-25 ºC. If the elapsed time is longer than \n30 minutes, the suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared. \n \nCalculation of an individual dose \nThe total dose, according to the body surface area (BSA) can be calculated as follows: \n \nTotal dose (mg) = Dose (mg/m2) x BSA (m2) \n \nThe following table is provided only as an example of how to calculate individual azacitidine doses \nbased on an average BSA value of 1.8 m2. \n \nDose mg/m2 (% of \nrecommended starting \ndose) \n\nTotal dose based on \nBSA value of 1.8 m2 \n\nNumber of vials \nrequired \n\nTotal volume of \nreconstituted \nsuspension required \n\n75 mg/m2 (100%) 135 mg 2 vials 5.4 mL \n37.5 mg/m2 (50%) 67.5 mg 1 vial 2.7 mL \n25 mg/m2 (33%) 45 mg 1 vial 1.8 mL \n \nMethod of administration \nReconstituted Azacitidine Mylan should be injected subcutaneously (insert the needle at a \n45-90°angle) using a 25-gauge needle into the upper arm, thigh or abdomen. \n \nDoses greater than 4 mL should be injected into two separate sites. \n \nInjection sites should be rotated. New injections should be given at least 2.5 cm from the previous site \nand never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hardened. \n \nDisposal \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
