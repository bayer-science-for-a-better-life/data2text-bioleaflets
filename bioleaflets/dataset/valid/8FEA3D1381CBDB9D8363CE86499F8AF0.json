NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRilonacept Regeneron 80 mg/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial of powder contains 220 mg of rilonacept. After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains 80 \nmg rilonacept. \n  \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nThe powder is white to off-white. \nThe solvent is a clear colourless solution.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRilonacept Regeneron is indicated for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) \nwith severe symptoms, including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells \nSyndrome (MWS), in adults and children aged 12 years and older. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a specialist physician experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of CAPS. \n \nAfter proper training in the correct injection technique, patients may self-inject Rilonacept Regeneron if \ntheir physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. \n \nPosology \nAdults \nTreatment in adults should be initiated with a loading dose of 320 mg. Dosing should be continued with a \nonce-weekly injection of 160 mg. Rilonacept Regeneron should not be given more often than once \nweekly.  \n \nPaediatric population (12 to 17 years old) \nTreatment should be initiated with a loading dose of 4.4 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 320 mg. Dosing \nshould be continued with a once-weekly injection of 2.2 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 160 mg (see Table \n1).  Dosing in children must be adjusted as the child grows. The patient or care giver should be advised to \nspeak to the treating physician before adjusting the dose. The experience in children is limited. In the \nclinical program for CAPS, 8 adolescents aged 12-17 were treated for up to 18 months. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population (up to 12 years old) \nNo data are available on the use of Rilonacept Regeneron in children with CAPS under 12 years of age, \ntherefore it is not recommended in this paediatric age group. \n \nElderly (65 years old or older) \nAvailable data indicate that dose modification is not required based on advanced age. However, clinical \nexperience in patients above 65 years is limited, therefore caution is recommended (see section 5.1). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, or end stage \nrenal disease. However, clinical experience in such patients is limited. \n \nHepatic impairment \nRilonacept Regeneron has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nMethod of administration \nRilonacept Regeneron is for subcutaneous use only.  It is not intended for intravenous or intramuscular \nuse. \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.  \n \nThe adult loading dose should be administered as two 2 ml subcutaneous injections (320 mg of rilonacept \nin total) given on the same day at different sites. The subsequent doses are administered as a 2 ml (160 mg \nof rilonacept) subcutaneous injection once a week. \n \nFor paediatric patients, the dose is delivered as one or two (for loading dose) subcutaneous injections with \na maximum single-injection volume of 2 ml. \n \nFor convenience, the corresponding dose volume for weekly injection in paediatric patients is presented in \nTable 1 below.  \n \nTable 1:  Rilonacept Regeneron dose volume (after reconstitution) by body weight for paediatric patients \naged 12-17 years \n \n\nWeight range (kg) Dose volume (ml) \n23.6 to 27.2  0.7 \n27.3 to 30.8 0.8 \n30.9 to 34.4  0.9 \n34.5 to 38.1  1 \n38.2 to 41.7  1.1 \n41.8 to 45.4  1.2 \n45.5 to 49.0  1.3 \n49.1 to 52.6  1.4 \n52.7 to 56.3  1.5 \n56.4 to 59.9  1.6 \n60.0 to 63.5  1.7 \n63.6 to 67.2 1.8 \n67.3 to 70.8  1.9 \n\n70.9 or greater 2 \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to rilonacept or to any of the excipients.  \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSerious infections \nInterleukin-1 (IL-1) blockade may interfere with immune response to infections. Serious, life-threatening \ninfections have been reported uncommonly in patients taking Rilonacept Regeneron.  \n \nIn an open-label extension study, one patient developed bacterial meningitis and died. Rilonacept \nRegeneron should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. Treatment should not be \ninitiated in patients with an active or chronic infection (see section 4.3) and physicians should exercise \ncaution when administering Rilonacept Regeneron to patients with a history of recurring infections or with \nunderlying conditions that may predispose them to infections. \n \nBecause Rilonacept Regeneron dampens an inflammatory response, vigilance in excluding underlying \ninfection in unwell patients is required. \n \nTumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of reactivation of \nlatent tuberculosis (TB). It is unknown whether the use of IL-1 inhibitors like rilonacept increases the risk \nof reactivation of TB or of opportunistic infections.  Before starting treatment with Rilonacept Regeneron, \nall patients should be evaluated for both active and inactive (latent) tuberculosis.  \n \nCombinations not recommended  \nThe combination of Rilonacept Regeneron with TNF inhibitors has not been evaluated in clinical studies. \nAn increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of another IL-1 \ninhibitor, in combination with a TNF inhibitor.  \n \nRilonacept Regeneron should not be used with TNF inhibitors because of increased risk of serious \ninfections (see section 4.5).  \n \nThe concomitant use of Rilonacept Regeneron with other IL-1 inhibitors is not recommended (see section \n4.5).  \n \nHypersensitivity \nAlthough hypersensitivity reactions related to treatment with Rilonacept Regeneron were not seen in the \ninitial clinical program, if a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration should be stopped \nimmediately and permanently, and appropriate therapy initiated. \n \nThe risk for severe hypersensitivity reactions, which is not uncommon for injectable proteins, cannot be \nexcluded (see section 4.3). \n \nImmunogenicity \nAntibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected by an ELISA assay in 35% \nof patients (19 out of 55) treated for at least 6 weeks in the clinical study. There was no correlation of \nantibody activity with either clinical efficacy or safety. \n \nNeutropenia \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n5 \n\nNeutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 1.5 x 109/l) has been observed commonly with another \nmedicinal product that inhibits IL-1 used in a patient population (rheumatoid arthritis) other than CAPS. \nNeutropenia was observed commonly in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (not an approved use) who \nwere administered Rilonacept Regeneron subcutaneously in clinical studies.  None of these patients had \nserious infections associated with the neutropenia. Although neutropenia was observed uncommonly in \nCAPS patients, the numbers studied are small. Treatment with Rilonacept Regeneron should not be \ninitiated in patients with neutropenia. It is recommended that neutrophil counts be assessed prior to \ninitiating treatment, after 1 to 2 months, and periodically thereafter while receiving Rilonacept Regeneron. \nIf a patient becomes neutropenic the ANC should be monitored closely and treatment discontinuation \nshould be considered. \n \nMalignancies \nThe impact of treatment with Rilonacept Regeneron on the development of malignancies is not known. \nHowever, treatment with immunosuppressants, including Rilonacept Regeneron, may result in an increase \nin the risk of malignancies.   \n \nVaccines \nLive vaccines should not be given concurrently with Rilonacept Regeneron (see section 4.5). Prior to \ninitiation of Rilonacept Regeneron therapy, adult and paediatric patients should receive all recommended \nvaccinations, as appropriate, including pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine. \n \nLipid profile changes \nPatients should be monitored for changes in their lipid profiles and provided with medical treatment if \nwarranted (see section 4.8). \n \nMutation in NLRP3 gene \nAll cases in the clinical trials had a confirmed mutation in the NLRP3 gene. The efficacy was not \nevaluated in patients without a confirmed NLRP3 gene mutation. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nThe concomitant administration of Rilonacept Regeneron with any TNF inhibitor is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4), because an increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration \nof another IL-1 blocker in combination with TNF inhibitors. \n \nThe concomitant administration of Rilonacept Regeneron with other IL-1 inhibitors has not been studied \nand is therefore not recommended.  \n \nThe formation of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines during chronic \ninflammation. Thus it is expected that for a molecule that binds to IL-1, such as rilonacept, the formation \nof CYP450 enzymes could be normalized. This is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow \ntherapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted (e.g. warfarin). Upon initiation of Rilonacept \nRegeneron, in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of the \neffect or plasma levels should be performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product may need to \nbe adjusted as needed.   \n \nNo data are available on either the effects of live vaccination or the secondary transmission of infection by \nlive vaccines in patients receiving Rilonacept Regeneron. Therefore, live vaccines should not be given \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n6 \n\nconcurrently with Rilonacept Regeneron, unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Should \nvaccination with live vaccines be indicated after initiation of Rilonacept Regeneron treatment, the \nrecommendation is to wait for at least 6 weeks after the last Rilonacept Regeneron injection and before the \nnext one (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from use of rilonacept in pregnant women. Reproductive toxicity studies have \nbeen conducted in animals and have shown no effects on fertility or foetal morphology; however a study \nin pregnant monkeys showed reduced levels of oestrogen (see section 5.3). The risk for the foetus/mother \nis unknown. Women should use effective contraceptives during treatment with Rilonacept Regeneron and \nfor up to 6 weeks after the last dose. Women who are pregnant or who desire to become pregnant should \ntherefore only be treated after a thorough benefit-risk evaluation. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether rilonacept is excreted in human or animal breast milk. A decision on whether to \ncontinue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Rilonacept Regeneron should \nbe made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Rilonacept \nRegeneron therapy to the woman. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe ability to drive and operate machines may be impaired by some symptoms associated with CAPS. \nPatients who experience vertigo during Rilonacept Regeneron treatment should wait for this to resolve \ncompletely before driving or operating machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe majority of the related adverse events in the clinical trials were classified as injection site reactions, \nexperienced by approximately 50% of the patients in the Phase 3 study.  Reported ISRs were generally \nmild to moderate in severity.  No patients withdrew from the study due to ISRs. \n \nADRs to Rilonacept Regeneron reported during  the Phase 2/3 program in a total of 109 patients, some \ntreated for longer than 2 years, are listed below using the following categories of frequency: very common \n(\u22651/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1000 to <1/100).  \n \nDue to the small patient population, an ADR reported in 2 or more patients is classified as \n\u201ccommon.\u201d \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n7 \n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions with Rilonacept Regeneron in CAPS patients \n\nMedDRA \nSystem Organ Class  \n\nAdverse reaction Frequency \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n \n\nInjection site reactions, \nincluding erythema, bruising, \npruritus, swelling, \ninflammation, pain, dermatitis, \noedema, urticaria, vesicles  \n\nvery common \n \n\nFatigue common \nInfections and infestations Upper respiratory tract \n\ninfection; sinusitis \nvery common \n \n\nBronchitis; gastroenteritis; \nviral infections; skin, eye and \near infections; pneumonia \n\ncommon \n\nBacterial meningitis uncommon \nInvestigations Eosinophil count increased common \nNervous system disorders Headache very common \n\nDizziness common \nVascular disorders Hypertension, flushing common \nEar and labyrinth disorders Vertigo common \nEye disorders Iritis uncommon \nPsychiatric disorders Anxiety, insomnia common \nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity common \n \n \nInfections and infestations \nDuring Part A of the pivotal study (see section 5.1), the incidence of patients reporting infections and \nconsidered by the investigator as related to treatment was greater with Rilonacept Regeneron (9%) than \nwith placebo (0%). In Part B, randomised withdrawal, the incidence of infections were similar in the \nRilonacept Regeneron (0%) and the placebo patients (4%). Part A of the trial was initiated in the winter \nmonths, while Part B was predominantly performed in the summer months. \n \nIn placebo-controlled studies across a variety of patient populations encompassing 336 patients treated \nwith rilonacept and 165 treated with placebo, the incidence of infections was 6.8% and 3% (0.44 per \npatient-exposure year and 0.19 per patient-exposure year), respectively, for rilonacept and placebo. \n \nSerious infections \nOne patient in an open-label study of CAPS died after developing sinusitis and bacterial (Streptococcus \npneumoniae) meningitis.  \n \nIn a study in patients with adult Still\u2019s disease, one patient developed an infection in his elbow with \nMycobacterium intracellulare after an intraarticular glucocorticoid injection and subsequent local \nexposure to a suspected source of mycobacteria. In a study in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica, one \npatient developed bronchitis and sinusitis, which resulted in hospitalization.  \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorder \nDuring the initial placebo-controlled portion of the pivotal trial, mean values increased for haemoglobin \nand decreased for neutrophils and platelets in the patients treated with Rilonacept Regeneron. These \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n8 \n\nchanges were not deemed as clinically significant and were potentially due to a decrease in the chronic \ninflammatory state present in CAPS with an attendant decrease in acute-phase response. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nIn patients with CAPS, the most common and consistently reported adverse event associated with \ntreatment was injection-site reaction (ISR). The ISRs included erythema, swelling, pruritus, and bruising. \nMost ISRs lasted for one to two days. In studies of patients with CAPS, no ISRs were assessed as severe, \nand no patient discontinued study participation due to an ISR. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAntibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected by an ELISA assay in \npatients with CAPS after treatment with Rilonacept Regeneron in clinical studies. Nineteen of 55 patients \n(35%) who had received Rilonacept Regeneron for at least 6 weeks tested positive for treatment-emergent \nbinding antibodies on at least one occasion.  Of the 19 patients, 7 tested positive at the last assessment \n(Week 18 or 24 of the open-label extension period), and 5 patients tested positive for neutralising \nantibodies on at least one occasion.  There was no correlation of antibody activity and either clinical \nefficacy or safety. \n \nThe data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to rilonacept in \nspecific assays, and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays. The observed \nincidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay \nsensitivity and specificity, sample handling, concomitant medicinal products, and underlying disease. For \nthese reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to rilonacept with the incidence of antibodies to \nother products may be misleading. \n \nChanges in lipid parameters \nCholesterol and lipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Patients with CAPS \ntreated with Rilonacept Regeneron experienced mean increases from baseline for total cholesterol, HDL \ncholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 19 mg/dl, 2 mg/dl, 10 mg/dl, and 57 mg/dl respectively \nafter 6 weeks of open-label therapy. Physicians should monitor the lipid profiles of their patients (for \nexample after 2-3 months) and consider lipid-lowering therapies as needed based upon cardiovascular risk \nfactors and current guidelines. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. The maximum amount of product that can be safely administered \nhas not been determined. \n \nIntravenous administration of Rilonacept Regeneron at doses of up to 2000 mg monthly in another patient \npopulation for up to six months was generally well-tolerated. One patient in a study of osteoarthritis \ndeveloped transient neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1 x 109/l) after receiving a very large dose \n(2000 mg). Maximum weekly doses of up to 320 mg have been administered subcutaneously for up to \napproximately 2 years or more in a small number of patients with CAPS and up to 6 months in patients \nwith RA in clinical studies without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities.  \n \nIn case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse \nreactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately. \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n9 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC04. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under \u201cExceptional Circumstances\u201d. This means that due to \nthe rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product. \nThe EMA will review any new information, which may become available every year, and this SPC will be \nupdated as necessary.  \n \nMechanism of action \nRilonacept is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the ligand-binding domains of the extracellular \nportions of the human type I interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1RI) and IL-1 receptor accessory protein \n(IL-1RAcP) linked in-line to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Rilonacept binds to and blocks the activity of \nthe cytokine IL-1 and binds both IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b1, which are the primary pro-inflammatory cytokines \nimplicated in many inflammatory diseases. Rilonacept also binds the endogenous IL-1 receptor antagonist \n(IL-1ra) but with a lower affinity than IL-1\u03b2 or IL-1\u03b1. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn clinical studies, CAPS patients who have uncontrolled over-production of IL-1\u03b2 show a rapid response \nto therapy with rilonacept, i.e. laboratory parameters such as  C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum \namyloid A (SAA) levels, leukocytosis, and high platelet count rapidly returned to normal. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \nThe safety and efficacy of rilonacept for the treatment of CAPS, including patients with FCAS, also \nknown as familial cold urticaria syndrome (FCUS), and MWS was demonstrated in a randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled study with two parts (A and B) conducted sequentially in the same \npatients. The efficacy portion of the study included 47 patients, 44 of whom had a diagnosis of FCAS and \n3 with a diagnosis of MWS.  Twelve additional patients enrolled during the open label extension in which \nefficacy data were collected, 8 adults with a diagnosis of FCAS and 4 adolescents (13-16 years old), 3 \nwith FCAS and 1 with FCAS/MWS overlap. Four additional adolescents (12-17 years) all with a diagnosis \nof FCAS subsequently enrolled in the open label extension where efficacy assessments were not collected. \nThe efficacy was not evaluated in patients without a confirmed NLRP3/CIAS1 gene mutation. \n \nPart A was a 6-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled period to evaluate rilonacept at a dose \nof 160 mg weekly after an initial loading dose of 320 mg. Immediately after Part A patients entered Part B \nwhich consisted of a 9-week, patient-blind period during which all patients received rilonacept 160 mg \nweekly, followed by a 9-week, double-blind, randomised withdrawal period in which patients were \nrandomly assigned to either remain on rilonacept 160 mg weekly or to receive placebo. Patients were then \ngiven the option to enroll in a 24-week, open-label treatment extension phase during which all patients \nwere treated with rilonacept 160 mg weekly. \n \nUsing a daily diary questionnaire, patients rated the following five signs and symptoms of CAPS: joint \npain, rash, feeling of fever/chills, eye redness/pain, and fatigue, each on a scale of 0 (none, no severity) to \n10 (very severe). The study evaluated the mean symptom score using the change from baseline to the end \nof treatment.  \n \nThe changes in mean symptom scores for the randomised parallel-group period (Part A) and the \nrandomised withdrawal period (Part B) of the study are shown in Table 3. Patients treated with rilonacept \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n10 \n\nexperienced an 84% reduction in the mean symptom score in Part A compared to 13% for placebo-treated \npatients (p< 0.0001). In Part B, mean symptom scores increased more in patients withdrawn to placebo \ncompared to patients who remained on rilonacept. \n \nImprovement in key symptom scores was noted within one day of initiation of rilonacept therapy in most \npatients. Patients treated with rilonacept experienced more improvement in each of the five components of \nthe composite endpoint than placebo-treated patients.  \n \nThe mean number of symptomatic \u201cflare\u201d days (defined as a day in which the mean symptom score \nreported on the patient diary was greater than 3) during the 21-day pre-treatment baseline period and the \non-treatment endpoint period, in Part A, decreased from 8.6 at baseline to 0.1 at endpoint for the group on \nrilonacept, compared to a change from 6.2 to 5.0 for the placebo group (p<0.0001 vs. placebo). \n \nA significantly higher proportion of patients in the rilonacept group compared to the placebo group \nexperienced improvement from baseline in the composite score by at least 30% (96% vs. 29% of patients), \nby at least 50% (87% vs. 8%) and by at least 75% (70% vs. 0%) (p<0.0001).   \n \nIn Part A and Part B, physician\u2019s and patient\u2019s global assessment of disease activity and patients\u2019 \nassessment of the degree of limitation of their daily activities due to their disease were significantly \nimproved for patients treated with rilonacept compared with those on placebo.  \n \nMean levels of C reactive protein (CRP) were significantly decreased versus baseline for the rilonacept-\ntreated patients, while there was no change for those on placebo. Rilonacept also led to a significant \ndecrease in serum amyloid A (SAA) versus baseline to levels within the normal range.  \n \nDuring the open-label extension, reductions in mean symptom scores, serum CRP, and serum SAA levels \nwere maintained for up to one year. \n \nTable 3:  Mean Symptom Scores in Adults (age 18 and older) \n\nPart A Placebo (n=24) \nRilonacept  \n(n=23) Part B \n\nPlacebo \n(n=23) \n\nRilonacept  \n(n=22) \n\nPre-treatment \nBaseline Period \n(Weeks -3 to 0) \n\n2.4 3.1 \nActive Rilonacept \nBaseline Period \n(Weeks 13 to 15) \n\n0.2 0.3 \n\nEndpoint Period \n(Weeks 4 to 6) 2.1 0.5 \n\nEndpoint Period \n(Weeks 22 to 24) 1.2 0.4 \n\nMean Change \nfrom Baseline to \nEndpoint \n\n-0.3 -2.6* Mean Change from Baseline to Endpoint 0.9 0.1** \n\np-value for within \ngroup comparison \nof change from \nBaseline \n\nNS  p< 0.0001 \n\np-value for within \ngroup comparison of \nchange from \nBaseline \n\np< 0.0001 NS \n\n*p< 0.0001, comparison of rilonacept vs. placebo \n**p< 0.001, comparison of rilonacept vs. placebo,  \nNS = not significant \n \nAn assessment of efficacy with respect to age group and diagnosis was obtained by comparing KSS at the \nend of the 24 week open label extension with KSS at baseline using time averaged daily mean scores.

The steady state appeared to be \nreached by 6 weeks. \n \nTable 5: Rilonacept steady-state pharmacokinetic properties1 \nParameter Value2 \n\nCmax (mg/l) \n \n31.5 \n\n \nAUC (day mg/l) \n\n \n198 \n\n \nCL /F (l/day) \n\n \n0.808 \n\n \nT1/2 terminal (day) \n\n \n7.72 \n \n\n1 Based on population PK modelling \n2 Derived values are presented.    \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n12 \n\nSpecial populations  \nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic impairment. As with other large proteins \nelimination of rilonacept is expected to be via proteolytic catabolism and target mediated clearance. \nConsequently, impaired liver function is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of rilonacept in a \nclinically significant way. \n \nResults of a single-dose study in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) indicate that the rate of \nelimination of rilonacept was not decreased. Renal elimination of rilonacept is therefore considered to be a \nminor pathway for clearance. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. \n \nNo study was conducted to evaluate the effect of age, gender, or body weight on rilonacept exposure. \nBased on limited data obtained from the clinical study, steady-state trough concentrations were similar \nbetween male and female patients. Age (26-78 years old) and body weight (50-120 kg) did not appear to \nhave a significant effect on trough rilonacept concentrations. The effect of race could not be assessed \nbecause only Caucasian patients participated in the clinical studies in CAPS, reflecting the epidemiology \nof the disease.   \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology and repeated-dose toxicity. \n \nAnimal studies were conducted to assess reproductive toxicity. In mice, a murine analogue of rilonacept \nhad no effect on fertility. A study of embryo-foetal development was conducted with rilonacept in \nmonkeys at doses up to approximately 4 times the human dose. Decreases in \u03b2-estradiol levels were seen \nin the treated groups, the significance of this finding is unknown. In a prenatal and postnatal reproductive \ntoxicology study in which mice were dosed subcutaneously, with a murine analogue of rilonacept at doses \nof 20, 100 or 200 mg/kg three times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6-fold higher than the \n160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area), there were no treatment-related effects.  \n \nGenotoxicity or long term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic or \ncarcinogenic potential of rilonacept. \n \n \n6.

If not used immediately, in-use storage \ntimes and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and should not be longer than 24 hours \nat 2 to 8\u00b0C.   \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator. Do not freeze. \nKeep the vials in the outer carton in order to protect from light.  \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nPowder vial \n20 ml clear type I glass vial with  rubber stopper and lacquered flip-off aluminium seal containing 220 mg \nrilonacept.  \n \nSolvent vial \nLDPE vials containing 5 ml water for injections \nEach pack contains:  \n4 vials of powder for solution for injection \n4 vials of solvent \n8 disposable 3 ml syringes \n8 disposable 27 gauge, \u00bd-inch needles \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nInstructions for reconstitution \n \nUsing aseptic technique, Rilonacept Regeneron powder should be reconstituted with 2.3 ml of solvent \n(water for injections) prior to administration.  \n \nThe 2.3 ml of solvent should be withdrawn from the solvent vial attached directly to a 3 ml syringe and \nthen injected into the powder vial for reconstitution using the 27 gauge, \u00bd-inch needle (to obtain a final \nreconstitution volume of 2.75 ml). The needle and syringe used for reconstitution with solvent should then \nbe discarded and should not be used for subcutaneous injections. After the addition of solvent, the vial \ncontents should be reconstituted by shaking the vial for approximately one minute and then allowing it to \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n14 \n\nsit for one minute. The resulting 80 mg/ml solution is sufficient to allow a withdrawable volume of up to 2 \nml for subcutaneous administration.  \n \nThe reconstituted solution is viscous, clear and colourless to pale yellow. Prior to injection, the \nreconstituted solution should be carefully inspected for any discolouration or particulate matter. If there is \ndiscolouration or particulate matter in the solution, the product must not be used.  \n \nInstructions for administration \n \nUsing aseptic technique, the recommended dose volume, up to 2 ml (160 mg) of the solution, should be \nwithdrawn with a new 27 gauge, \u00bd-inch injection needle attached to a new 3 ml syringe for subcutaneous \ninjection.  \n \nSites for subcutaneous injection, such as the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm, should be rotated. Injections \nshould never be made at sites that are bruised, red, tender, or hard.  \n \nThe initial administration of Rilonacept Regeneron by a patient or caregiver should be under the guidance \nof a trained healthcare professional. For subsequent self-administration by patients, appropriate instruction \nin proper injection technique should be provided and ability to apply that technique ascertained.  \n \nDisposal \n \nEach vial should be used for a single dose only. The vial should be discarded after withdrawal of the \nsolution. \n \nPatients or their caregivers should be instructed on the appropriate procedure for disposal of the vials, \nneedles, and syringes. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

The fact that a limited number of paediatric \npatients were included in the clinical studies combined with the lack of data on the \neffect of long term IL-1\u00df suppression is a concern in view of the orphan nature of the \ncondition. The continued collection of data should be maintained from the registry on \nsafety and efficacy in children; particularly risk of infection and possible impairment \nof immune reactions such as response to vaccinations and growth. In addition the \nMAH is requested to assess cases for which there is loss of efficacy to determine \nwhether this is due to changes over time in PK/PD or antibody development. The \nMAH shall provide updates on the recruitment rates and any intermediary results with \nthe PSURs. The patients should be included in the Registry until both following \nconditions are met: 5 years recruitment period and 200 patients included. \n\nWith PSUR \n\nFurther PK steady state exposure data (AUC, Cmax, Cmin during steady state) especially \nfor paediatric subjects is required.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rilonacept Regeneron is and what it is used for \n \nRilonacept Regeneron is used to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with severe \nsymptoms of Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS).  \n \nRilonacept Regeneron belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin inhibitors. Rilonacept Regeneron \nblocks the activity of substances including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). In patients with CAPS, the body \nproduces excessive amounts of IL-1 beta. This may lead to symptoms such as fever, headache, fatigue, \nskin rash, or painful joints and muscles. By blocking the activity of IL-1 beta, Rilonacept Regeneron leads \nto an improvement in these symptoms. \n \nIf you have any questions about how Rilonacept Regeneron works or why this medicine has been \nprescribed for you, ask your doctor. \n \n2.

Proceed with the injection as described in \nStep 6 below. \n\n \nSTEP 6: Giving the injection \n \n1. Rilonacept Regeneron is injected into the tissue directly below the layers of skin. It is not meant to \n\ngo into any muscle, vein, or artery.  \n \n\nWhere to inject \n \nInject in a different place each time in order to keep your skin healthy.  \n\n \nChanging injection sites helps to prevent irritation and allows the medicine to be better absorbed. \nAsk your doctor any questions that you have about rotating injection sites.   \n\n \n\u2022 Do not inject into skin that is tender, red, or hard. If an area is tender or feels hardened, \nchoose another site for injection until the tenderness or \u201chardening\u201d goes away.  \n\n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor about any skin reactions including redness, swelling, or hardening of the \nskin.  \n\n \n\u2022 Areas where you may inject Rilonacept Regeneron include the left and right sides of the \nabdomen, and left and right thighs. If someone else is giving you the injection, the upper arms \nmay also be used for injection (see Figure 12):  \n\n \n(Do not inject within a 5-cm area around the navel.) \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 12 \n\n \n2. Choose the area for the injection. Clean the area in a circular motion with a new alcohol wipe. \n\nBegin at the centre of the site and move outward. Let the alcohol air dry completely. Do not touch \nthis area again before injecting. \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n42 \n\n \n3.

Dosing \nshould be continued with a once-weekly injection of 2.2 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 160 mg (see Table \n1). Dosing in children must be adjusted as the child grows. The patient or care giver should be advised to \nspeak to the treating physician before adjusting the dose. The experience in children is limited. In the \nclinical program for CAPS, 8 adolescents aged 12-17 were treated for up to 18 months. \n \nPaediatric population (up to 12 years old) \nNo data are available on the use of Rilonacept Regeneron in children with CAPS under 12 years of age, \ntherefore it is not recommended in this paediatric age group. \n \nElderly (65 years old or older) \nAvailable data indicate that dose modification is not required based on advanced age. However, clinical \nexperience in patients above 65 years is limited, therefore caution is recommended. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, or end stage \nrenal disease. However, clinical experience in such patients is limited. \n \nHepatic impairment \nRilonacept Regeneron has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nMethod of administration \nRilonacept Regeneron is for subcutaneous use only. It is not intended for intravenous or intramuscular use. \n \nThe adult loading dose should be administered as two 2 ml subcutaneous injections (320 mg of rilonacept \nin total) given on the same day at different sites.  The subsequent doses are administered as a 2 ml (160 mg \nof rilonacept) subcutaneous injection once a week.  \n \nFor paediatric patients, the dose is delivered as one or two (for loading dose) subcutaneous injections with \na maximum single-injection volume of 2 ml. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n45 \n\nFor convenience, the corresponding dose volume for weekly injection in paediatric patients is presented in \nTable 1 below.  \n \nTable 1:  Rilonacept Regeneron dose volume (after reconstitution) by body weight for paediatric patients, \naged 12-17 years  \n\nWeight range (kg) Dose volume (ml) \n23.6 to 27.2  0.7 \n27.3 to 30.8 0.8 \n30.9 to 34.4  0.9 \n34.5 to 38.1  1 \n38.2 to 41.7  1.1 \n41.8 to 45.4  1.2 \n45.5 to 49.0  1.3 \n49.1 to 52.6  1.4 \n52.7 to 56.3  1.5 \n56.4 to 59.9  1.6 \n60.0 to 63.5  1.7 \n63.6 to 67.2 1.8 \n67.3 to 70.8  1.9 \n\n70.9 or greater 2 \n \nSpecial precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator.

The needle and syringe used for reconstitution with solvent should then \nbe discarded and should not be used for subcutaneous injections. After the addition of solvent, the vial \ncontents should be reconstituted by shaking the vial for approximately one minute and then allowing it to \nsit for one minute. The resulting 80 mg/ml solution is sufficient to allow a withdrawable volume of up to 2 \nml for subcutaneous administration.  \n \nThe reconstituted solution is viscous, clear and colourless to pale yellow. Prior to injection, the \nreconstituted solution should be carefully inspected for any discolouration or particulate matter. If there is \ndiscolouration or particulate matter in the solution, the product must not be used.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n46 \n\nInstructions for administration \n \nUsing aseptic technique, the recommended dose volume, up to 2 ml (160 mg) of the solution should be \nwithdrawn with a new 27-gauge, \u00bd-inch injection needle attached to a new 3-ml syringe for subcutaneous \ninjection.  \n \nSites for subcutaneous injection, such as the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm, should be rotated. Injections \nshould never be made at sites that are bruised, red, tender, or hard.  \n \nThe initial administration of Rilonacept Regeneron by a patient or caregiver should be under the guidance \nof a trained healthcare professional. For subsequent self-administration by patients, appropriate instruction \nin proper injection technique should be provided and ability to apply that technique ascertained.  \n \nDisposal \n \nEach vial should be used for a single dose only. The vial should be discarded after withdrawal of the \nsolution. \n \nPatients or their caregivers should be instructed on the appropriate procedure for disposal of the vials, \nneedles, and syringes. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
