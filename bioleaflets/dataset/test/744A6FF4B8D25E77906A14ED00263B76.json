NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZelboraf 240 mg film-coated tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 240 mg of vemurafenib (as a co-precipitate of vemurafenib and hypromellose \nacetate succinate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nPinkish white to orange white, oval, biconvex film-coated tablets of approximately 19 mm, with \n\u2018VEM\u2019 engraved on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVemurafenib is indicated in monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with BRAF V600 \nmutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with vemurafenib should be initiated and supervised by a qualified physician experienced \nin the use of anticancer medicinal products. \n \nBefore taking vemurafenib, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumour status \nconfirmed by a validated test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of vemurafenib is 960 mg (4 tablets of 240 mg) twice daily (equivalent to a \ntotal daily dose of 1,920 mg). Vemurafenib may be taken with or without food, but consistent intake of \nboth daily doses on an empty stomach should be avoided (see section 5.2). \n \nDuration of treatment \nTreatment with vemurafenib should continue until disease progression or the development of \nunacceptable toxicity (see tables 1 and 2 below). \n \nMissed doses \nIf a dose is missed, it can be taken up to 4 hours prior to the next dose to maintain the twice daily \nregimen. Both doses should not be taken at the same time. \n \nVomiting \nIn case of vomiting after vemurafenib administration the patient should not take an additional dose of \nthe medicinal product but the treatment should be continued as usual. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology adjustments \nManagement of adverse drug reactions or QTc prolongation may require dose reduction, temporary \ninterruption and/or treatment discontinuation (see tables 1 and 2). Posology adjustments resulting in a \ndose below 480 mg twice daily are not recommended. \n \nIn the event the patient develops Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cuSCC), it is recommended to \ncontinue the treatment without modifying the dose of vemurafenib (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nTable 1: Dose modification schedule based on the grade of any Adverse Events (AEs)  \n \nGrade (CTC-AE) (a) Recommended dose modification \nGrade 1 or Grade 2 (tolerable)  Maintain vemurafenib at a dose of 960 mg twice daily. \nGrade 2 (intolerable) or Grade 3  \n1st occurrence of any grade 2 or 3 AE Interrupt treatment until grade 0 \u2013 1. Resume dosing at \n\n720 mg twice daily (or 480 mg twice daily if the dose \nhas already been lowered). \n\n2nd occurrence of any grade 2 or 3 AE \nor persistence after treatment \ninterruption \n\nInterrupt treatment until grade 0 \u2013 1. Resume dosing at \n480 mg twice daily (or discontinue permanently if the \ndose has already been lowered to 480 mg twice daily). \n\n3rd occurrence of any grade 2 or 3 AE \nor persistence after 2nd dose reduction \n\nDiscontinue permanently. \n\nGrade 4  \n1st occurrence of any grade 4 AE Discontinue permanently or interrupt vemurafenib \n\ntreatment until grade 0 \u2013 1. \nResume dosing at 480 mg twice daily (or discontinue \npermanently if the dose has already been lowered to 480 \nmg twice daily). \n\n2nd occurrence of any grade 4 AE or \npersistence of any grade 4 AE after \n1st dose reduction \n\nDiscontinue permanently. \n\n(a) The intensity of clinical adverse events graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 \n(CTC-AE). \n \nExposure-dependent QT prolongation was observed in an uncontrolled, open-label phase II study in \npreviously treated patients with metastatic melanoma. Management of QTc prolongation may require \nspecific monitoring measures (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 2: Dose modification schedule based on prolongation of the QT interval \n \nQTc value Recommended dose modification \nQTc>500 ms at baseline Treatment not recommended. \nQTc increase meets values of both >500 ms \nand >60 ms change from pre-treatment values \n\nDiscontinue permanently. \n\n1st occurrence of QTc>500 ms during \ntreatment and change from pre-treatment value \nremains <60 ms \n\nTemporarily interrupt treatment until QTc \ndecreases below 500 ms. \nSee monitoring measures in section 4.4. \nResume dosing at 720 mg twice daily (or \n480 mg twice daily if the dose has already \nbeen lowered). \n\n2nd occurrence of QTc>500 ms during \ntreatment and change from pre-treatment value \nremains <60 ms \n\nTemporarily interrupt treatment until QTc \ndecreases below 500 ms. \nSee monitoring measures in section 4.4. \nResume dosing at 480 mg twice daily (or \ndiscontinue permanently if the dose has \nalready been lowered to 480 mg twice daily). \n\n3rd occurrence of QTc>500 ms during \ntreatment and change from pre-treatment value \nremains <60 ms \n\nDiscontinue permanently. \n\n \nSpecial population \n \nElderly \nNo special dose adjustment is required in patients aged > 65 years old. \n \nRenal impairment \nLimited data are available in patients with renal impairment. A risk for increased exposure in patients \nwith severe renal impairment cannot be excluded. Patients with severe renal impairment should be \nclosely monitored (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nLimited data are available in patients with hepatic impairment. As vemurafenib is cleared by the liver, \npatients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment may have increased exposure and should be \nclosely monitored (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of vemurafenib in children less than 18 years old have not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2, but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made.  \n \nNon-Caucasian patients \nThe safety and efficacy of vemurafenib has not been established in non-Caucasian patients. No data \nare available. \n \nMethod of administration \nVemurafenib is for oral use. The tablets are to be swallowed whole with water. They should not be \nchewed or crushed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBefore taking vemurafenib, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumour status \nconfirmed by a validated test. The efficacy and safety of vemurafenib in patients with tumours \nexpressing rare BRAF V600 mutations other than V600E and V600K have not been convincingly \nestablished (see section 5.1). Vemurafenib should not be used in patients with wild type BRAF \nmalignant melanoma. \n \nHypersensitivity reaction \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis have been reported in association with \nvemurafenib (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Severe hypersensitivity reactions may include \nStevens-Johnson syndrome, generalised rash, erythema or hypotension. In patients who experience \nsevere hypersensitivity reactions, vemurafenib treatment should be permanently discontinued. \n \nDermatologic reactions \nSevere dermatologic reactions have been reported in patients receiving vemurafenib, including rare \ncases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in the pivotal clinical trial. Drug \nreaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in association with \nvemurafenib in the post-marketing setting (see section 4.8). In patients who experience a severe \ndermatologic reaction, vemurafenib treatment should be permanently discontinued. \n \nPotentiation of radiation toxicity \nCases of radiation recall and radiation sensitization have been reported in patients treated with \nradiation either prior, during, or subsequent to vemurafenib treatment. Most cases were cutaneous in \nnature but some cases involving visceral organs had fatal outcomes (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \nVemurafenib should be used with caution when given concomitantly or sequentially with radiation \ntreatment. \n \nQT prolongation \nExposure-dependent QT prolongation was observed in an uncontrolled, open-label phase II study in \npreviously treated patients with metastatic melanoma (see section 4.8). QT prolongation may lead to \nan increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias including Torsade de Pointes. Treatment with \nvemurafenib is not recommended in patients with uncorrectable electrolyte abnormalities (including \nmagnesium), long QT syndrome or who are taking medicinal products known to prolong the QT \ninterval. \n \nElectrocardiogram (ECG) and electrolytes (including magnesium) must be monitored in all patients \nbefore treatment with vemurafenib, after one month of treatment and after dose modification. \nFurther monitoring is recommended in particular in patients with moderate to severe hepatic \nimpairment monthly during the first 3 months of treatment followed by every 3 months thereafter or \nmore often as clinically indicated. Initiation of treatment with vemurafenib is not recommended in \npatients with QTc>500 milliseconds (ms). If during treatment the QTc exceeds 500 ms, vemurafenib \ntreatment should be temporarily interrupted, electrolyte abnormalities (including magnesium) should \nbe corrected, and cardiac risk factors for QT prolongation (e.g. congestive heart failure, \nbradyarrhythmias) should be controlled. Re-initiation of treatment should occur once the QTc \ndecreases below 500 ms and at a lower dose as described in table 2. Permanent discontinuation of \nvemurafenib treatment is recommended if the QTc increase meets values of both >500 ms and >60 ms \nchange from pre-treatment values. \n \nOphthalmologic reactions \nSerious ophthalmologic reactions, including uveitis, iritis and retinal vein occlusion, have been \nreported. Monitor patients routinely for ophthalmologic reactions. \n \nCutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cuSCC)  \nCases of cuSCC (which include those classified as keratoacanthoma or mixed keratoacanthoma \nsubtype) have been reported in patients treated with vemurafenib (see section 4.8).  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIt is recommended that all patients receive a dermatologic evaluation prior to initiation of therapy and \nbe monitored routinely while on therapy. Any suspicious skin lesions should be excised, sent for \ndermatopathologic evaluation and treated as per local standard of care. The prescriber should examine \nthe patient monthly during and up to six months after treatment for cuSCC. In patients who develop \ncuSCC, it is recommended to continue the treatment without dose adjustment. Monitoring should \ncontinue for 6 months following discontinuation of vemurafenib or until initiation of another \nanti-neoplastic therapy. Patients should be instructed to inform their physicians upon the occurrence of \nany skin changes. \n \nNon-Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (non-cuSCC) \nCases of non-cuSCC have been reported in clinical trials where patients received vemurafenib. \nPatients should undergo a head and neck examination, consisting of at least a visual inspection of oral \nmucosa and lymph node palpation prior to initiation of treatment and every 3 months during treatment. \nIn addition, patients should undergo a chest Computerised Tomography (CT) scan, prior to treatment \nand every 6 months during treatment. \nAnal examinations and pelvic examinations (for women) are recommended before and at the end of \ntreatment or when considered clinically indicated. \nFollowing discontinuation of vemurafenib, monitoring for non-cuSCC should continue for up to \n6 months or until initiation of another anti-neoplastic therapy. Abnormal findings should be managed \naccording to clinical practices. \n \nNew primary melanoma \nNew primary melanomas have been reported in clinical trials. Cases were managed with excision and \npatients continued treatment without dose adjustment. Monitoring for skin lesions should occur as \noutlined above for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. \n \nOther malignancies \nBased on mechanism of action, vemurafenib may cause progression of cancers associated with RAS \nmutations (see section 4.8). Carefully consider benefits and risks before administering vemurafenib to \npatients with a prior or concurrent cancer associated with RAS mutation. \n \nPancreatitis \nPancreatitis has been reported in vemurafenib-treated subjects. Unexplained abdominal pain should be \npromptly investigated (including measurement of serum amylase and lipase). Patients should be \nclosely monitored when re-starting vemurafenib after an episode of pancreatitis. \n \nLiver injury \nLiver injury, including cases of severe liver injury, has been reported with vemurafenib (see section \n4.8). Liver enzymes (transaminases and alkaline phosphatase) and bilirubin should be measured before \ninitiation of treatment and monitored monthly during treatment, or as clinically indicated. Laboratory \nabnormalities should be managed with dose reduction, treatment interruption or with treatment \ndiscontinuation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nRenal toxicity \nRenal toxicity, ranging from serum creatinine elevations to acute interstitial nephritis and acute tubular \nnecrosis, has been reported with vemurafenib. Serum creatinine should be measured before initiation \nof treatment and monitored during treatment as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo adjustment to the starting dose is needed for patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with mild \nhepatic impairment due to liver metastases without hyperbilirubinaemia may be monitored according \nto the general recommendations. There are only very limited data available in patients with moderate \nto severe hepatic impairment. Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment may have increased \nexposure (see section 5.2). Thus close monitoring is warranted especially after the first few weeks of \ntreatment as accumulation may occur over an extended period of time (several weeks). In addition \nECG monitoring every month during the first three months is recommended. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nRenal impairment \nNo adjustment to the starting dose is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \nThere are only limited data available in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). \nVemurafenib should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment and patients should \nbe closely monitored. \n \nPhotosensitivity \nMild to severe photosensitivity was reported in patients who received vemurafenib in clinical studies \n(see section 4.8). All patients should be advised to avoid sun exposure while taking vemurafenib. \nWhile taking the medicinal product, patients should be advised to wear protective clothing and use a \nbroad spectrum Ultraviolet A (UVA)/Ultraviolet B (UVB) sunscreen and lip balm (Sun Protection \nFactor \u2265 30) when outdoors to help protect against sunburn. \nFor photosensitivity grade 2 (intolerable) or greater, dose modifications are recommended (see section \n4.2). \n \nDupuytren\u2019s contracture and plantar fascial fibromatosis  \nDupuytren\u2019s contracture and plantar fascial fibromatosis have been reported with vemurafenib. The \nmajority of cases were mild to moderate, but severe, disabling cases of Dupuytren\u2019s contracture have \nalso been reported (see section 4.8). \n \nEvents should be managed with dose reduction with treatment interruption or with treatment \ndiscontinuation (see section 4.2). \n \nEffects of vemurafenib on other medicinal products \nVemurafenib may increase the plasma exposure of medicinal products predominantly metabolised by \nCYP1A2 and decrease the plasma exposure of medicines predominantly metabolised by CYP3A4. \nConcomitant use of vemurafenib with agents metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 with narrow \ntherapeutic windows is not recommended. Dose adjustments for medicinal products predominantly \nmetabolised via CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 should be considered based on their therapeutic windows before \nconcomitantly treating with vemurafenib (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). \n \nExercise caution and consider additional INR (International Normalised Ratio) monitoring when \nvemurafenib is used concomitantly with warfarin. \n \nVemurafenib may increase the plasma exposure of medicinal products that are P-gp substrates. \nCaution should be exercised when dosing vemurafenib concurrently with P-gp substrates. Dose \nreduction and/or additional drug level monitoring for P-gp substrate medicinal products with narrow \ntherapeutic index (NTI) (e.g. digoxin, dabigatran etexilate, aliskiren) may be considered if these \nmedicinal products are used concomitantly with vemurafenib (see section 4.5). \n  \nEffect of other medicinal products on vemurafenib \n \nConcomitant administration of strong inducers of CYP3A4, P-gp and glucuronidation (e.g. rifampicin, \nrifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin or St John\u2019s Wort [hypericin]) might lead to decreased exposure \nof vemurafenib and should be avoided when possible (see section 4.5). Alternative treatment with less \ninducing potential should be considered to maintain the efficacy of vemurafenib. Caution should be \nused when administering Vemurafenib with strong CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors. Patients should be \ncarefully monitored for safety and dose modifications applied if clinically indicated (see Table 1 in \nsection 4.2).  \n \nConcurrent administration with ipilimumab \nIn a Phase I trial, asymptomatic grade 3 increases in transaminases (ALT/AST >5 x ULN) and \nbilirubin (total bilirubin >3x ULN) were reported with concurrent administration of ipilimumab \n(3 mg/kg) and vemurafenib (960 mg BID or 720 mg BID). Based on these preliminary data, the \nconcurrent administration of ipilimumab and vemurafenib is not recommended. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of vemurafenib on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes \nResults from an in vivo drug-drug interaction study in metastatic melanoma patients demonstrated that \nvemurafenib is a moderate CYP1A2 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inducer. \n \nConcomitant use of vemurafenib with agents metabolized by CYP1A2  with narrow therapeutic \nwindows (e.g. agomelatine, alosetron, duloxetine, melatonin, ramelteon, tacrine, tizanidine, \ntheophylline) is not recommended. If co-administration cannot be avoided, exercise caution, as \nvemurafenib may increase plasma exposure of CYP1A2 substrate drugs. Dose reduction of the \nconcomitant CYP1A2 substrate drug may be considered, if clinically indicated.  \nCo-administration of vemurafenib increased the plasma exposure (AUC) of caffeine (CYP1A2 \nsubstrate) 2.6-fold. In another clinical trial, vemurafenib increased Cmax and AUC of a single 2 mg \ndose of tizanidine (CYP1A2 substrate) approximately 2.2-fold  \nand 4.7-fold, respectively.  \n \nConcomitant use of vemurafenib with agents metabolized by CYP3A4  with narrow therapeutic \nwindows  is not recommended. If co-administration cannot be avoided, it needs to be considered that \nvemurafenib may decrease plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates and thereby their efficacy \nmay be impaired. On this basis, the efficacy of contraceptive pills metabolized by CYP3A4 used \nconcomitantly with vemurafenib might be decreased. Dose adjustments for CYP3A4 substrates with \nnarrow therapeutic window may be considered, if clinically indicated (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \nIn a clinical trial, co-administration of vemurafenib decreased the AUC of midazolam (CYP3A4 \nsubstrate) by an average 39% (maximum decrease up to 80%).   \n \nMild induction of CYP2B6 by vemurafenib was noted in vitro at a vemurafenib concentration of \n10 \u00b5M. It is currently unknown whether vemurafenib at a plasma level of 100 \u00b5M observed in patients \nat steady state (approximately 50 \u00b5g/ml) may decrease plasma concentrations of concomitantly \nadministered CYP2B6 substrates, such as bupropion. \n \nCo-administration of vemurafenib resulted in an 18% increase in AUC of S-warfarin (CYP2C9 \nsubstrate).  Exercise caution and consider additional INR (international normalized ratio) monitoring \nwhen vemurafenib is used concomitantly with warfarin (see section 4.4).  \n \nVemurafenib moderately inhibited CYP2C8 in vitro. The in vivo relevance of this finding is unknown, \nbut a risk for a clinically relevant effect on concomitantly administered CYP2C8 substrates cannot be \nexcluded. Concomitant administration of CYP2C8 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window \nshould be made with caution since vemurafenib may increase their concentrations. \n \nDue to the long half-life of vemurafenib, the full inhibitory effect of vemurafenib on a concomitant \nmedicinal product might not be observed before 8 days of vemurafenib treatment. \nAfter cessation of vemurafenib treatment, a washout of 8 days might be necessary to avoid an \ninteraction with a subsequent treatment. \n \nRadiation treatment \nPotentiation of radiation treatment toxicity has been reported in patients receiving vemurafenib (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8).  In the majority of cases, patients received radiotherapy regimens greater than or \nequal to 2 Gy/day (hypofractionated regimens). \n \nEffects of vemurafenib on drug transport systems \nIn vitro studies have demonstrated that vemurafenib is an inhibitor of the efflux transporters \nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). \n \nA clinical drug interaction study demonstrated that multiple oral doses of vemurafenib (960 mg twice \ndaily) increased the exposure of a single oral dose of the P-gp substrate digoxin, approximately 1.8 \nand 1.5 fold for digoxin AUClast and Cmax, respectively.  \n\n\n\n9 \n\nCaution should be exercised when dosing vemurafenib concurrently with P-gp substrates (e.g. \naliskiren, ambrisentan, colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, everolimus, fexofenadine, lapatinib, \nmaraviroc, nilotinib, posaconazole, ranolazine, sirolimus, sitagliptin, talinolol, topotecan) and dose \nreduction of the concomitant medicinal product may be considered, if clinically indicated. Consider \nadditional drug level monitoring for P-gp substrate medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index \n(NTI) (e.g. digoxin, dabigatran etexilate, aliskiren) (see section 4.4). \n \nThe effects of vemurafenib on medicinal products that are substrates of BCRP are unknown.  It cannot \nbe excluded that vemurafenib may increase the exposure of medicines transported by  BCRP (e.g. \nmethotrexate, mitoxantrone, rosuvastatin). \nMany anticancer medicinal products  are substrates of BCRP and therefore there is a theoretical risk \nfor an interaction with vemurafenib. \n \nThe possible effect of vemurafenib on other transporters is currently unknown. \n \nEffects of concomitant medicines on vemurafenib \nIn vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 metabolism and glucuronidation are responsible for the \nmetabolism of vemurafenib. Biliary excretion appears to be another important elimination pathway. In \nvitro studies have demonstrated that vemurafenib is a substrate of the efflux transporters P-gp and \nBCRP. It is currently unknown whether vemurafenib is a substrate also to other transport proteins. \nConcomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers or inhibitors/inducer of transport \nprotein activity may alter vemurafenib concentrations.  \n \nCo-administration of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4/Pgp inhibitor, increased steady state vemurafenib \nAUC by approximately 40%. Vemurafenib should be used with caution in combination with strong \ninhibitors of CYP3A4, glucuronidation and/or transport proteins (e.g. ritonavir, saquinavir, \ntelithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, nefazodone, atazanavir). \nPatients co-treated with such agents should be carefully monitored for safety and dose modifications \napplied if clinically indicated (see Table 1 in section 4.2). \n \nIn a clinical study, co-administration of a single dose 960 mg of vemurafenib with rifampicin, \nsignificantly decreased the plasma exposure of vemurafenib by approximately 40%. \nConcomitant administration of strong inducers of P-gp, glucuronidation, and/or CYP3A4 (e.g. \nrifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin or St John\u2019s Wort [Hypericum perforatum]) may lead \nto suboptimal exposure to vemurafenib and should be avoided. \n \nThe effects of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors that are not also strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are unknown. It \ncannot be excluded that vemurafenib pharmacokinetics could be affected by such medicines through \ninfluence on P-gp (e.g. verapamil, cyclosporine, quinidine) or BCRP (e.g. cyclosporine, gefitinib). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in females \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least \n6 months after treatment. \nVemurafenib might decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.5). \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data regarding the use of vemurafenib in pregnant women. \nVemurafenib revealed no evidence of teratogenicity in rat or rabbit embryo/foetuses (see section 5.3). \nIn animal studies, vemurafenib was found to cross the placenta. Based on its mechanism of action, \nvemurafenib could cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Vemurafenib should not \nbe administered to pregnant women unless the possible benefit to the mother outweighs the possible \nrisk to the foetus. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether vemurafenib is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot \nbe excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue \nvemurafenib therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nNo specific studies with vemurafenib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on \nfertility. However, in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, no histopathological findings were \nnoted in reproductive organs in males and females (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVemurafenib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be made \naware of the potential fatigue or eye problems that could be a reason for not driving. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most common adverse drug reactions (ADR) of any grade (> 30%) reported with vemurafenib \ninclude arthralgia, fatigue, rash, photosensitivity reaction, alopecia, nausea diarrhea, headache, \npruritus, vomiting, skin papilloma and hyperkeratosis. The most common (\u2265 5%) Grade 3 ADRs were \ncuSCC, keratoacanthoma, rash, arthralgia and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) increased. CuSCC \nwas most commonly treated by local excision. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nADRs which were reported in melanoma patients are listed below by MedDRA body system organ \nclass, frequency and grade of severity. The following convention has been used for the classification \nof frequency: \nVery common \u2265 1/10 \nCommon \u2265 1/100 to < 1/10 \nUncommon \u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \nRare \u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000 \nVery rare < 1/10,000 \n \nIn this section, ADRs are based on results in 468 patients from a phase III randomised open label \nstudy in adult patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or stage IV melanoma, as well \nas a phase II single-arm study in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive stage IV melanoma who \nhad previously failed at least one prior systemic therapy (see section 5.1).

The incidence of cuSCC in \nvemurafenib-treated patients across studies was approximately 20%. The majority of the excised \nlesions reviewed by an independent central dermatopathology laboratory were classified as SCC-\nkeratoacanthoma subtype or with mixed-keratoacanthoma features (52%). Most lesions classified as \n\u201cother\u201d (43%) were benign skin lesions (e.g. verruca vulgaris, actinic keratosis, benign keratosis, \ncyst/benign cyst). CuSCC usually occurred early in the course of treatment with a median time to the \n\n\n\n13 \n\nfirst appearance of 7 to 8 weeks. Of the patients who experienced cuSCC, approximately 33% \nexperienced > 1 occurrence with median time between occurrences of 6 weeks. Cases of cuSCC were \ntypically managed with simple excision, and patients generally continued on treatment without dose \nmodification (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nNon-cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (non-cuSCC) \nCases of non-cuSCC have been reported in patients receiving vemurafenib while enrolled in clinical \ntrials. Surveillance for non-cuSCC should occur as outlined in section 4.4. \n \nNew primary melanoma \nNew primary melanomas have been reported in clinical trials. These cases were managed with \nexcision, and patients continued treatment without dose adjustment. Monitoring for skin lesions should \noccur as outlined in section 4.4. \n \nPotentiation of radiation toxicity(i) \nCases reported include recall phenomenon, radiation skin injury, radiation pneumonitis, radiation \nesophagitis, radiation proctitis, radiation hepatitis, cystitis radiation, and radiation necrosis. \n \nIn a phase III clinical trial (MO25515, N= 3219), a higher incidence of potentiation of radiation \ntoxicity was reported when vemurafenib patients received radiation prior to and during vemurafenib \ntherapy (9.1%) compared to those patients who received radiation and vemurafenib concomitantly (5.2 \n%) or to those whose radiation treatment was prior to vemurafenib (1.5%). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions (e) \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis have been reported in association with \nvemurafenib. Severe hypersensitivity reactions may include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, generalised \nrash, erythema or hypotension. In patients who experience severe hypersensitivity reactions, \nvemurafenib treatment should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.4). \n \nDermatologic reactions (f) \nSevere dermatologic reactions have been reported in patients receiving vemurafenib, including rare \ncases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in the pivotal clinical trial. In \npatients who experience a severe dermatologic reaction, vemurafenib treatment should be permanently \ndiscontinued. \n \nQT prolongation \nAnalysis of centralised ECG data from an open-label uncontrolled phase II QT sub-study in 132 \npatients dosed with vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (NP22657) showed an exposure-dependent QTc \nprolongation. The mean QTc effect remained stable between 12-15 ms beyond the first month of \ntreatment, with the largest mean QTc prolongation (15.1 ms; upper 95% CI: 17.7 ms) observed within \nthe first 6 months (n=90 patients). Two patients (1.5%) developed treatment-emergent absolute QTc \nvalues >500 ms (CTC Grade 3), and only one patient (0.8%) exhibited a QTc change from baseline of \n>60 ms (see section 4.4). \n \nAcute kidney injury (h) \nCases of renal toxicity have been reported with vemurafenib ranging from creatinine elevations to \nacute interstitial nephritis and acute tubular necrosis, some observed in the setting of dehydration \nevents. Serum creatinine elevations were  mostly mild (>1-1.5x ULN) to moderate (>1.5-3x ULN) and \nobserved to be reversible in nature (see table 4). \n \nTable 4: Creatinine changes from baseline in the phase III study \n \n Vemurafenib (%) Dacarbazine (%) \nChange \u2265 1 grade from baseline to any grade 27.9 6.1 \nChange \u2265 1 grade from baseline to grade 3 or higher 1.2 1.1 \n\n\u2022 To grade 3 0.3 0.4 \n\u2022 To grade 4 0.9 0.8 \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \nTable 5: Acute kidney injury cases in the phase III study \n \n Vemurafenib (%) Dacarbazine (%) \nAcute kidney injury cases* 10.0 1.4 \nAcute kidney injury cases associated with \ndehydration events 5.5 1.0 \n\nDose modified for acute kidney injury 2.1 0 \nAll percentages are expressed as cases out of total patients exposed to each medicinal product. \n*  Includes acute kidney injury, renal impairment, and laboratory changes consistent with acute kidney injury. \n \nSarcoidosis (j) \nCases of sarcoidosis have been reported in patients treated with vemurafenib, mostly involving the \nskin, lung and eye. In majority of the cases, vemurafenib was maintained and the event of sarcoidosis \neither resolved or persisted.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nIn the phase III study, ninety-four (28%) of 336 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma \ntreated with vemurafenib were \u2265 65 years. Older patients (\u2265 65 years) may be more likely to \nexperience adverse reactions, including cuSCC, decreased appetite, and cardiac disorders. \n \nGender \nDuring clinical trials with vemurafenib, grade 3 adverse reactions reported more frequently in females \nthan males were rash, arthralgia and photosensitivity. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety of vemurafenib  in children and adolescents has not been established. No new safety signals \nwere observed in a clinical study with six adolescent patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose of vemurafenib. Patients who develop adverse reactions \nshould receive appropriate symptomatic treatment. No cases of overdose have been observed with \nvemurafenib in clinical trials. In case of suspected overdose, vemurafenib should be withheld and \nsupportive care initiated.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01XE15 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nVemurafenib is an inhibitor of BRAF serine-threonine kinase. Mutations in the BRAF gene result in \nconstitutive activation of BRAF proteins, which can cause cell proliferation without associated growth \nfactors. \nPreclinical data generated in biochemical assays demonstrated that vemurafenib can potently inhibit \nBRAF kinases with activating codon 600 mutations (table 6). \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n15 \n\n \nTable 6: Kinase inhibitory activity of vemurafenib against different BRAF kinases  \n \n\nKinase Anticipated frequency in V600 \nmutation-positive melanoma (t) \n\nInhibitory Concentration 50 \n(nM) \n\nBRAFV600E 87.3% 10 \nBRAFV600K 7.9% 7 \nBRAFV600R 1% 9 \nBRAFV600D <0.2% 7 \nBRAFV600G <0.1% 8 \nBRAFV600M <0.1% 7 \nBRAFV600A <0.1% 14 \nBRAFWT N/A 39 \n\n(t) Estimated from 16,403 melanomas with annotated BRAF codon 600 mutations in the public COSMIC \ndatabase, release 71 (November 2014).  \n \nThis inhibitory effect was confirmed in the ERK phosphorylation and cellular anti-proliferation assays \nin available melanoma cell lines expressing V600-mutant BRAF. In cellular anti-proliferation assays \nthe inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) against V600 mutated cell lines (V600E, V600R, V600D and \nV600K mutated cell lines) ranged from 0.016 to 1.131 \u00b5M whereas the IC50 against BRAF wild type \ncell lines were 12.06 and 14.32 \u00b5M, respectively. \n \nDetermination of BRAF mutation status \nBefore taking vemurafenib, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumour status \nconfirmed by a validated test. In the phase II and phase III clinical trials, eligible patients were \nidentified using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation \nTest). This test has CE marking and is used to assess the BRAF mutation status of DNA isolated from \nformalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour tissue. It was designed to detect the predominant \nBRAF V600E mutation with high sensitivity (down to 5% V600E sequence in a background of wild \ntype sequence from FFPE-derived DNA). Non-clinical and clinical studies with retrospective \nsequencing analyses have shown that the test also detects the less common BRAF V600D mutations \nand V600K mutations with lower sensitivity. Of the specimens available from the non-clinical and \nclinical studies (n=920), that were mutation-positive by the cobas test and additionally analyzed by \nsequencing, no specimen was identified as being wild type by both Sanger and 454 sequencing. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of vemurafenib has been evaluated in 336 patients from a phase III clinical trial \n(NO25026) and 278 patients from two phase II clinical trials (NP22657 and MO25743). All patients \nwere required to have advanced melanoma with BRAF V600 mutations according to the cobas 4800 \nBRAF V600 Mutation Test. \n \nResults from the Phase III study (NO25026) in previously untreated patients \nAn open-label, multicentre, international, randomised phase III study supports the use of vemurafenib \nin previously untreated patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic \nmelanoma. Patients were randomised to treatment with vemurafenib (960 mg twice daily) or \ndacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 on day 1 every 3 weeks). \n \nA total of 675 patients were randomised to vemurafenib (n=337) or dacarbazine (n=338). Most \npatients were male (56%) and Caucasian (99%), the median age was 54 years (24% were \u2265 65 years), \nall patients had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and the majority of patients had stage M1c \ndisease (65%). The co-primary efficacy endpoints of the study were overall survival (OS) and \nprogression-free survival (PFS). \n \nAt the pre-specified interim analysis with a December 30, 2010 data cut-off, significant improvements \nin the co-primary endpoints of OS (p<0.0001) and PFS (p<0.0001) (unstratified log-rank test) were \n\n\n\n16 \n\nobserved. Upon Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommendation, those results were released \nin January 2011 and the study was modified to permit dacarbazine patients to cross over to receive \nvemurafenib. Post-hoc survival analyses were undertaken thereafter as described in table 7. \n \nTable 7: Overall survival in previously untreated patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive \nmelanoma by study cut-off date (N=338 dacarbazine, N=337 vemurafenib) \n \nCut-off dates Treatment Number of deaths \n\n(%) \nHazard Ratio  \n(95% CI) \n\nNumber of cross-\nover patients (%) \n\nDecember 30, \n2010 \n\ndacarbazine 75 (22) 0.37 (0.26, 0.55) \n \n\n0 (not applicable) \nvemurafenib 43 (13) \n\nMarch 31, \n2011 \n\ndacarbazine 122 (36) 0.44 (0.33, 0.59) (w) \n \n\n50 (15%) \nvemurafenib 78 (23) \n\nOctober 3, \n2011 \n\ndacarbazine 175 (52) 0.62 (0.49, 0.77) (w) 81 (24%) \nvemurafenib 159 (47) \n\nFebruary 1, \n2012 \n\ndacarbazine 200 (59) 0.70 (0.57, 0.87) (w) 83 (25%) \nvemurafenib 199 (59) \n\nDecember 20, \n2012 \n\ndacarbazine 236 (70) 0.78 (0.64, 0.94) (w) 84 (25%) \nvemurafenib 242 (72) \n\n(w) Censored results at time of cross-over \nNon-censored results at time of cross-over: March 31 2011: HR (95% CI) = 0.47 (0.35, 0.62); October 3 2011: \nHR (95% CI) = 0.67 (0.54, 0.84); February 1 2012: HR (95% CI) = 0.76 (0.63, 0.93); December 20 2012: \nHR (95% CI) = 0.79 (0.66, 0.95) \n \nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival \u2013 previously untreated patients (December 20, \n2012 cut-off)  \n\n \nTable 8 shows the treatment effect for all pre-specified stratification variables which are established as \nprognostic factors. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTable 8: Overall survival in previously untreated patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive \nmelanoma by LDH, tumour stage and ECOG status (post hoc analysis, December 20, 2012 cut-\noff, censored results at time of cross over) \n \n\nStratification variable N Hazard Ratio 95% Confidence Interval \nLDH normal 391 0.88 0.67; 1.16 \nLDH >ULN 284 0.57 0.44; 0.76 \nStage IIIc/M1A/M1B 234 1.05 0.73; 1.52 \nStage MIC 441 0.64 0.51; 0.81 \nECOG PS=0 459 0.86 0.67; 1.10 \nECOG PS=1 216 0.58 0.42; 0.9 \n\nLDH: Lactate Dehydrogenase, ECOG PS: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status \n \nTable 9 shows the overall response rate and progression-free survival in previously untreated patients \nwith BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma. \n \nTable 9: Overall response rate and progression-free survival in previously untreated patients \nwith BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma  \n \n\n vemurafenib dacarbazine p-value (x) \nDecember 30, 2010 data cut-off date (y) \nOverall Response Rate \n(95% CI) \n\n48.4% \n(41.6%, 55.2%) \n\n5.5% \n(2.8%, 9.3%) <0.0001 \n\nProgression-free survival \nHazard Ratio \n(95% CI) \n\n0.26 \n(0.20, 0.33) <0.0001 \n\nNumber of events (%) 104 (38%) 182 (66%)  \nMedian PFS (months) \n(95% CI) \n\n5.32 \n(4.86, 6.57) \n\n1.61 \n(1.58, 1.74)  \n\nFebruary 01, 2012 data cut-off date (z) \nProgression-free survival \nHazard Ratio \n(95% CI) \n\n0.38 \n(0.32, 0.46) <0.0001 \n\nNumber of events (%) 277 (82%) 273 (81%)  \nMedian PFS (months) \n(95% CI) \n\n6.87 \n(6.14, 6.97) \n\n1.64 \n(1.58, 2.07)  \n\n(x) Unstratified log-rank test for PFS and Chi-squared test for Overall Response Rate. \n(y) As of December 30, 2010, a total of 549 patients were evaluable for PFS and 439 patients were evaluable for \noverall response rate. \n(z) As of February 01, 2012, a total of 675 patients were evaluable for the post-hoc analysis update of PFS. \n \nA total of 57 patients out of 673 whose tumours were analysed retrospectively by sequencing were \nreported to have BRAF V600K mutation-positive melanoma in NO25026. Although limited by the \nlow number of patients, efficacy analyses among these patients with V600K-positive tumours \nsuggested similar treatment benefit of vemurafenib in terms of OS, PFS and confirmed best overall \nresponse. No data are available in patients with melanoma harbouring rare BRAF V600 mutations \nother than V600E and V600K. \n \nResults from the phase II study (NP22657) in patients who failed at least one prior therapy \n \nA phase II single-arm, multi-centre, multinational study was conducted in 132 patients who had BRAF \nV600E mutation-positive metastatic melanoma according to the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation \nTest and had received at least one prior therapy. The median age was 52 years with 19% of patients \nbeing older than 65 years. The majority of patients was male (61%), Caucasian (99%), and had stage \nM1c disease (61%). Forty-nine percent of patients failed \u2265 2 prior therapies.  \n\n\n\n18 \n\nWith a median follow-up of 12.9 months (range, 0.6 to 20.1), the primary endpoint of confirmed best \noverall response rate (CR + PR) as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) was 53% \n(95% CI: 44%, 62%). Median overall survival was 15.9 months (95% CI: 11.6, 18.3). The overall \nsurvival rate at 6 months was 77% (95% CI: 70%, 85%) and at 12 months was 58% (95% CI: 49%, \n67%).  \nNine of the 132 patients enrolled into NP22657 had V600K mutation-positive tumours according to \nretrospective Sanger sequencing. Amongst these patients, 3 had a PR, 3 had SD, 2 had PD and one \nwas not evaluable. \n \nResults from the phase II study (MO25743) in  patients with brain metastases \n \nA single-arm, multicentre study (N = 146) of vemurafenib was conducted in adult patients with \nhistologically confirmed metastatic melanoma harbouring the BRAF V600 mutation (according to the \ncobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test) and with brain metastases. The study included two \nsimultaneously enrolling cohorts: \n \n- Cohort 1 with previously untreated patients (N = 90): Patients who had not received previous \n\ntreatment for brain metastases; prior systemic therapy for metastatic melanoma was allowed, \nexcluding BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors. \n\n \n- Cohort 2 with previously treated patients (N = 56): Patients who had been previously treated for \n\ntheir brain metastases and had progressed following this treatment.  For patients treated with \nstereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) or surgery, a new RECIST-assessable brain lesion must have \ndeveloped following this prior therapy.  \n\n \nA total of 146 patients were enrolled. The majority of patients were male (61.6%), and Caucasian \n(92.5%), and the median age was 54 years (range 26 to 83 years), similarly distributed between the \ntwo cohorts. The median number of brain target lesions at baseline was 2 (range 1 to 5), in both \ncohorts. \nThe primary efficacy objective of the study was best overall response rate (BORR) in the brain of \nmetastatic melanoma patients with previously untreated brain metastases, as assessed by an \nindependent review committee (IRC).   \nSecondary objectives included an evaluation of the efficacy of vemurafenib using BORR in the brain \nof previously treated patients, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall \nsurvival (OS) in patients with melanoma metastatic to the brain (see table 10). \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nTable 10:  Efficacy of vemurafenib in patients with brain metastases \n \n\n Cohort 1 \nNo previous \n\ntreatment \nn = 90 \n\nCohort 2 \nPreviously \n\ntreated \nn = 56 \n\nTotal \n \n \n\nn =  146 \nBORRa in brain \nResponders n (%) \n(95% CI)b \n\n \n16 (17.8%) \n(10.5, 27.3) \n\n \n10 (17.9%) \n(8.9, 30.4) \n\n \n26 (17.8%) \n(12.0, 25.0) \n\nDORc in brain (n) \nMedian (months) \n(95% CI)d \n\n(n = 16) \n4.6 \n\n(2.9, 6.2) \n\n(n = 10) \n6.6 \n\n(2.8, 10.7) \n\n(n = 26) \n5.0 \n\n(3.7, 6.6) \nBORR extra-\ncranial n (%)a 26 (32.9%) 9 (22.5%) 35 (29.4%) \nPFS - overall  \nMedian (months)e \n(95% CI)d \n\n \n3.7 \n\n(3.6, 3.7) \n\n \n3.7 \n\n(3.6, 5.5) \n\n \n3.7 \n\n(3.6, 3.7) \nPFS - brain only  \nMedian (months)e   \n(95% CI)d \n\n \n3.7 \n\n(3.6, 4.0) \n\n \n4.0 \n\n(3.6, 5.5) \n\n \n3.7 \n\n(3.6, 4.2) \nOS \nMedian (months) \n(95% CI)d \n\n \n8.9 \n\n(6.1, 11.5) \n\n \n9.6 \n\n(6.4, 13.9) \n\n \n9.6 \n\n (6.9, 11.5) \na Best overall confirmed response rate as assessed by independent review committee, number of responders \n\nn (%) \nb Two-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson Confidence Interval (CI) \nc Duration of response as assessed by an Independent Review Committee \nd Kaplan-Meier estimate \ne Assessed by investigator \n \nPaediatric population \n \nResults from the phase I study (NO25390) in  paediatric patients \n \nA phase I dose-escalation study evaluating the use of vemurafenib in six adolescent patients with stage \nIIIC or IV BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma was conducted. All patients treated were at least \n15 years of age and weighed at least 45 kg. Three patients were treated with vemurafenib 720 mg \ntwice daily, and three patients were treated with vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. The maximum \ntolerated dose could not be determined. Although transient tumour regressions were seen, the best \noverall response rate (BORR) was 0% (95% CI: 0%, 46%) based on confirmed responses. The study \nwas terminated due to low enrollment. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nVemurafenib is a Class IV substance (low solubility and permeability), using the criteria described in \nthe Biopharmaceutics Classification System. The pharmacokinetic parameters for vemurafenib were \ndetermined using non-compartmental analysis in a phase I and phase III studies (20 patients after 15 \ndays of dosing at 960 mg twice daily, and 204 patients in steady state day 22) as well as by population \nPK analysis using pooled data from 458 patients. Among these patients, 457 were Caucasians.  \n \nAbsorption \nThe bioavailability at steady state ranged between 32 and 115% (mean 64%) relative to an intravenous \nmicrodose, in a phase I study with uncontrolled food conditions in 4 patients with BRAF V600 \npositive malignancies. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nVemurafenib is absorbed with a median Tmax of approximately 4 hours following a single 960 mg \ndose (four 240 mg tablets). Vemurafenib exhibits high inter-patient variability. In the phase II study, \nAUC0-8h and Cmax at day 1 were 22.1 \u00b1 12.7 \u00b5g\u22c5h/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.3 \u00b5g/mL. Accumulation occurs upon \nmultiple twice daily dosing of vemurafenib. In the non-compartmental analysis, after dosing with \n960 mg vemurafenib twice daily the Day 15 / Day 1 ratio ranged from 15- to 17-fold for AUC, and 13- \nto 14-fold for Cmax, yielding AUC0-8h and Cmax of 380.2 \u00b1 143.6 \u00b5g\u22c5h/mL and 56.7 \u00b1 21.8 \u00b5g/mL, \nrespectively, under steady-state conditions. \nFood (high fat meal) increases the relative bioavailability of a single 960 mg dose of vemurafenib. The \ngeometric mean ratios between the fed and fasted states for Cmax and AUC were 2.5 and 4.6 to 5.1 \nfold, respectively. The median Tmax was increased from 4 to 7.5 hours when a single vemurafenib dose \nwas taken with food.  \nThe effect of food on steady state vemurafenib exposure is currently unknown. Consistent intake of \nvemurafenib on an empty stomach may lead to significantly lower steady state exposure than \nconsistent intake of vemurafenib with or a short time after a meal. Occasional intake of vemurafenib \non an empty stomach is expected to have limited influence on steady state exposure due to the high \naccumulation of vemurafenib at steady state. Safety and efficacy data from pivotal studies were \ncollected from patients taking vemurafenib with or without food. \nVariability in exposure may also occur due to differences in gastro-intestinal fluid content, volumes, \npH, motility and transition time and bile composition. \nAt steady state, the mean vemurafenib exposure in plasma is stable during the 24-hour interval as \nindicated by the mean ratio of 1.13 between the plasma concentrations before and 2-4 hours after the \nmorning dose. Following oral dosing, the absorption rate constant for the population of metastatic \nmelanoma patients is estimated to be 0.19 hr-1 (with 101% between patient variability). \n \nDistribution \nThe population apparent volume of distribution for vemurafenib in metastatic melanoma patients is \nestimated to be 91 L (with 64.8% between patient variability). It is highly bound to human plasma \nproteins in vitro (>99%).  \n \nBiotransformation \nThe relative proportions of vemurafenib and its metabolites were characterised in a human mass \nbalance study with a single dose of 14C-labeled vemurafenib administered orally. CYP3A4 is the \nprimary enzyme responsible for the metabolism of vemurafenib in vitro. Conjugation metabolites \n(glucuronidation and glycosylation) were also identified in humans. However, the parent compound \nwas the predominant component (95%) in plasma. Although metabolism does not appear to result in a \nrelevant amount of metabolites in plasma, the importance of metabolism for excretion cannot be \nexcluded.  \n \nElimination \nThe population apparent clearance of vemurafenib in patients with metastatic melanoma is estimated \nto be 29.3 L/day (with 31.9% between patient variability). The population elimination half-life \nestimated by the population PK analysis for vemurafenib is 51.6 hours (the 5th and 95th percentile \nrange of the individual half-life estimates is 29.8 - 119.5 hours). \n \nIn the human mass balance study with vemurafenib administered orally, on average 95% of the dose \nwas recovered within 18 days. The majority of vemurafenib-related material (94%) was recovered in \nfaeces, and <1% in urine. Renal elimination does not appear to be of importance for vemurafenib \nelimiation, whereas biliary excretion of unchanged compound may be an important route of \nelimination.. Vemurafenib is a substrate and inhibitor of P-gp in vitro. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nBased on the population PK analysis, age has no statistically significant effect on vemurafenib \npharmacokinetics. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nGender \nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated a 17% greater apparent clearance (CL/F) and a \n48% greater apparent volume of distribution (V/F) in males than in females. It is unclear whether this \nis a gender or a body size effect. However, the differences in exposure are not large enough to warrant \ndose adjustment based on body size or gender. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn the population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from clinical trials in patients with metastatic \nmelanoma, mild and moderate renal impairment did not influence the apparent clearance of \nvemurafenib (creatinine clearance >40 ml/min). There are no data in patients with severe renal \nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nBased on preclinical data and the human mass balance study, major part of vemurafenib is eliminated \nvia the liver. In the population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from clinical trials in patients with \nmetastatic melanoma, increases in AST and ALT up to three times the upper limit of normal did not \ninfluence the apparent clearance of vemurafenib. Data are insufficient to determine the effect of \nmetabolic or excretory hepatic impairment on vemurafenib pharmacokinetics (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nLimited pharmacokinetic data from six adolescent patients aged between 15 and 17 years with stage \nIIIC or IV BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma suggest that vemurafenib pharmacokinetic \ncharacteristics in adolescents are generally similar to those in adults. See section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use.   \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe preclinical safety profile of vemurafenib was assessed in rats, dogs, and rabbits. \n \nRepeat-dose toxicology studies identified the liver and bone marrow as target organs in the dog. \nReversible toxic effects (hepatocellular necrosis and degeneration) in the liver at exposures below the \nanticipated clinical exposure (based on AUC comparisons) were noted in the 13-week dog study. \nFocal bone marrow necrosis was noted in one dog in a prematurely terminated 39-week BID dog study \nat exposures similar to the anticipated clinical exposure (based on AUC comparisons). In an in vitro \nbone marrow cytotoxicity study, slight cytotoxicity was observed in some lympho-haematopoietic cell \npopulations of rat, dog and human at clinically relevant concentrations. \n \nVemurafenib was shown to be phototoxic, in vitro, on cultured murine fibroblasts after UVA \nirradiation, but not in vivo in a rat study at doses up to 450 mg/kg/day (at exposures below the \nanticipated clinical exposure (based on AUC comparison). No specific studies with vemurafenib have \nbeen conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility. However, in repeat-dose toxicity studies, \nno histopathological findings were noted on reproductive organs in males and females in rats and dogs \nat doses up to 450 mg/kg/day (at exposures below the anticipated clinical exposure based on AUC \ncomparison). No teratogenicity was observed in embryofoetal development studies in rats and rabbits \nat doses up to respectively 250 mg/kg/day and 450 mg/kg/day leading to exposures below the \nanticipated clinical exposure (based on AUC comparison). However, exposures in the embryofoetal \ndevelopment studies were below the clinical exposure based on AUC comparison, it is therefore \ndifficult to define to what extent these results can be extrapolated to humans. Therefore an effect of \nvemurafenib on the foetus cannot be excluded. No studies were performed regarding pre- and \npostnatal development. \n \nNo signs of genotoxicity were identified in in vitro assays (bacterial mutation [AMES Assay], human \nlymphocyte chromosome aberration) nor in the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus test conducted \nwith vemurafenib.  \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with vemurafenib. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n\u25cf If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n\u25cf This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u25cf If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Zelboraf is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Zelboraf \n3. How to take Zelboraf \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Zelboraf \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Zelboraf is and what it is used for \n \nZelboraf is an anticancer medicine that contains the active substance vemurafenib. It is used to treat \nadult patients with melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by \nsurgery. \n \nIt can only be used in patients whose cancer has a change (mutation) in the \u201cBRAF\u201d gene. This change \nmay have led to the development of melanoma. \n \nZelboraf targets proteins made from this modified gene and slows down or stops the development of \nyour cancer. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Zelboraf \n \nDo not take Zelboraf: \n\u25cf If you are allergic to vemurafenib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6 of this leaflet). Symptoms of allergic reactions may include swelling of the face, lips \nor tongue, difficulty breathing, rash, or fainting sensation. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Zelboraf. \n \nAllergic reactions \n\u25cf Allergic reactions can happen while taking Zelboraf and may be severe. Stop taking \n\nZelboraf and get medical help immediately if you have any symptoms of an allergic reaction \nsuch as swelling of the face, lips or tongue, difficulty breathing, rash, or fainting sensation. \n\n \nSevere skin reactions \n\u25cf Severe skin reactions can happen while taking Zelboraf. Stop taking Zelboraf and talk to \n\nyour doctor immediately if you get a skin rash with any of the following symptoms: blisters on \nyour skin, blisters or sores in your mouth, peeling of your skin, fever, redness or swelling of \nyour face, hands, or soles of your feet. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \nPrevious history of cancer \n\u25cf Tell your doctor if you have had a different type of cancer than melanoma, as Zelboraf may \n\ncause progression of certain types of cancers. \n \nRadiation therapy reactions \n\u25cf Tell your doctor if you have had, or are going to have radiotherapy, as Zelboraf may worsen \nradiation treatment side effects.  \n \nHeart disorder \n\u25cf Tell your doctor if you have a heart disorder, such as an alteration of the electrical activity \n\nof your heart called \u201cQT prolongation\u201d. Your doctor will run tests to check that your heart is \nworking properly before and during your treatment with Zelboraf. If necessary, your doctor may \ndecide to interrupt your treatment temporarily or stop it altogether. \n\n \nEye problems \n\u25cf You should have your eyes examined by your doctor while you are taking Zelboraf. Tell \n\nyour doctor immediately if you get eye pain, swelling, redness, blurred vision or other vision \nchanges during your treatment. \n\n \nMusculoskeletal/Connective Tissue disorder  \n\u25cf Tell your doctor if you observe any unusual thickening of the palms of your hands \n\naccompanied by tightening of the fingers inward or any unusual thickening of the soles of your \nfeet which may be painful. \n\n \nChecks of your skin before, during and after treatment  \n\u25cf If you notice any changes in your skin while taking this medicine, please talk to your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible. \n\u25cf Regularly during your treatment and up to 6 months after your treatment, your doctor needs to \n\ncheck your skin for a type of cancer called \u201ccutaneous squamous cell carcinoma\u201d.  \n\u25cf Usually, this lesion appears on sun-damaged skin, remains local and can be cured by surgical \n\nremoval.  \n\u25cf If your doctor finds this type of skin cancer, he or she will treat it or send you to another doctor \n\nfor treatment.  \n\u25cf Additionally, your doctor needs to inspect your head, your neck, your mouth, your lymph \n\nglands and you will undergo CT scans regularly. This is a precautionary measure in case a \nsquamous cell carcinoma lesion would develop inside your body. Genital examinations (for \nwomen) and anal examinations are also recommended before and at the end of your treatment.   \n\n\u25cf You may develop new melanoma lesions while taking Zelboraf. These lesions are usually \nremoved by surgery and patients continue their treatment. Monitoring of these lesions occurs as \noutlined above for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.  \n\n \nKidney or liver problems \n\u25cf Tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver problems. This may affect the activity of \n\nZelboraf. Your doctor will also do some blood tests to check your liver and kidney functions \nbefore you start taking Zelboraf and during treatment. \n\n \nSun protection \n\u25cf If you are taking Zelboraf, you may become more sensitive to sunlight and get sunburns that can \n\nbe severe. During treatment, avoid exposing your skin to direct sunlight. \n\u25cf If you do plan to go into the sun: \n\n\u25cf wear clothing which protects your skin, including your head and face, arms and legs; \n\u25cf use a lip balm and a broad spectrum sunscreen (minimum of Sun Protection Factor (SPF) 30, \n\nre-applied every 2 to 3 hours). \n\u25cf This will help to protect you against sunburn.  \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nChildren and adolescents \nZelboraf is not recommended for children and adolescents. The effects of Zelboraf in people younger \nthan 18 years old are not known.  \n \nOther medicines and Zelboraf \nBefore starting treatment, tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might use \nany other medicines (including those you have bought for yourself from a pharmacy, supermarket or \nhealth store). This is very important, as using more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen \nor weaken the effect of medicines.  \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are taking: \n\u25cf Medicines that are known to affect the way your heart beats:  \n\n\u25cf medicines for heart rhythm problems (e.g. quinidine, amiodarone) \n\u25cf medicines for depression (e.g. amitriptyline, imipramine) \n\u25cf medicines for bacterial infections (e.g. azithromycin, clarithromycin) \n\u25cf medicines for nausea and vomiting (e.g. ondansetron, domperidone). \n\n\u25cf Medicines that are mainly eliminated by metabolising proteins called CYP1A2 (e.g caffeine, \nolanzapine, theophylline), CYP3A4 (e.g. some oral contraceptives) or called CYP2C8. \n\n\u25cf Medicines that influence a protein called P-gp or BCRP (e.g. verapamil, cyclosporine, ritonavir, \nquinidine, itraconazole, gefitinib). \n\n\u25cf Medicines that could be influenced by a protein called P-gp (e.g. aliskiren, colchicine, digoxin, \neverolimus, fexofenadine) or a protein called BCRP (e.g. methotrexate, mitoxantrone, \nrosuvastatin). \n\n\u25cf Medicines that stimulate the metabolising proteins called CYP3A4 or a metabolising process \ncalled glucuronidation (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin or St John\u2019s Wort) \n\n\u25cf Medicines that strongly inhibit the metabolising protein called CYP3A4  (e.g. ritonavir, \nsaquinavir, telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, nefazodone, \natazanavir) \n\n\u25cf A medicine used to prevent blood clots called warfarin \n\u25cf A medicine called ipilimumab, another medicine for the treatment of melanoma. The \n\ncombination of this medicine with Zelboraf is not recommended due to increased toxicity to the \nliver. \n\n \nIf you are taking any of these medicines (or if you are not sure), please talk to your doctor before \ntaking Zelboraf. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\u25cf Use an appropriate method of contraception during your treatment and for at least \n\n6 months after the end of your treatment. Zelboraf may decrease the efficacy of some oral \ncontraceptives. Please tell your doctor if you are taking an oral contraceptive. \n\n\u25cf Zelboraf is not recommended for use during pregnancy unless your doctor considers that the \nbenefit for the mother outweighs the risk for the baby. There is no information about the safety \nof Zelboraf in pregnant women. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become \npregnant.  \n\n\u25cf It is not known whether the ingredients in Zelboraf pass into human milk. Breast-feeding is not \nrecommended during treatment with Zelboraf. \n\n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nZelboraf has side effects that can affect your ability to drive or to operate machines. Beware of fatigue \nor eye problems that could be a reason for not driving. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Zelboraf \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019.   \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n \n3. How to take Zelboraf \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nHow many tablets should you take \n\u25cf The recommended dose is 4 tablets twice a day (a total of 8 tablets).  \n\u25cf Take 4 tablets in the morning. Then take 4 tablets in the evening.  \n\u25cf If you experience side effects, your doctor may decide to carry on your treatment but lower your \n\ndose. Always take Zelboraf exactly as your doctor has told you. \n\u25cf In case of vomiting, continue to take Zelboraf as usual and do not take an additional dose.  \n \nTaking your tablets \n\u25cf Do not take Zelboraf regularly on an empty stomach. \n\u25cf Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water. Do not chew or crush the tablets. \n \nIf you take more Zelboraf than you should \nIf you take more Zelboraf than you should, talk to your doctor immediately. Taking too much Zelboraf \nmay increase the likelihood and severity of side effects. No cases of overdose have been observed with \nZelboraf.  \n \nIf you forget to take Zelboraf \n\u25cf If you forget a dose and it is more than 4 hours before your next dose, just take your dose as \n\nsoon as you remember it. Take the next dose at the usual time. \n\u25cf If it is less than 4 hours before your next dose, skip the missed dose. Then take the next dose at \n\nthe usual time. \n\u25cf Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  \n \nIf you stop taking Zelboraf \nIt is important to keep taking Zelboraf for as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. If you have any \nfurther questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4.

ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 of this leaflet). symptoms of allergic reactions may include swelling of the face, lips or tongue, difficulty breathing, rash, or fainting sensation. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before taking zelboraf. allergic reactions allergic reactions can happen while taking zelboraf and may be severe. stop taking zelboraf and get medical help immediately if you have any symptoms of an allergic reaction such as swelling of the face, lips or tongue, difficulty breathing, rash, or fainting sensation. severe skin reactions severe skin reactions can happen while taking zelboraf. stop taking zelboraf and talk to your doctor immediately if you get a skin rash with any of the following symptoms: blisters on your skin, blisters or sores in your mouth, peeling of your skin, fever, redness or swelling of your face, hands, or soles of your feet. previous history of cancer tell your doctor if you have had a different type of cancer than melanoma, as zelboraf may cause progression of certain types of cancers. radiation therapy reactions tell your doctor if you have had, or are going to have radiotherapy, as zelboraf may worsen radiation treatment side effects. heart disorder tell your doctor if you have a heart disorder, such as an alteration of the electrical activity of your heart called \"qt prolongation\". your doctor will run tests to check that your heart is working properly before and during your treatment with zelboraf. if necessary, your doctor may decide to interrupt your treatment temporarily or stop it altogether. eye problems you should have your eyes examined by your doctor while you are taking zelboraf. tell your doctor immediately if you get eye pain, swelling, redness, blurred vision or other vision changes during your treatment. musculoskeletal/connective tissue disorder tell your doctor if you observe any unusual thickening of the palms of your hands accompanied by tightening of the fingers inward or any unusual thickening of the soles of your feet which may be painful. checks of your skin before, during and after treatment if you notice any changes in your skin while taking this medicine, please talk to your doctor as soon as possible. regularly during your treatment and up to 6 months after your treatment, your doctor needs to check your skin for a type of cancer called \"cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma\". usually, this lesion appears on sun-damaged skin, remains local and can be cured by surgical removal. if your doctor finds this type of skin cancer, he or she will treat it or send you to another doctor for treatment. additionally, your doctor needs to inspect your head, your neck, your mouth, your lymph glands and you will undergo ct scans regularly. this is a precautionary measure in case a squamous cell carcinoma lesion would develop inside your body. genital examinations (for women) and anal examinations are also recommended before and at the end of your treatment. you may develop new melanoma lesions while taking zelboraf. these lesions are usually removed by surgery and patients continue their treatment. monitoring of these lesions occurs as outlined above for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. kidney or liver problems tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver problems. this may affect the activity of zelboraf. your doctor will also do some blood tests to check your liver and kidney functions before you start taking zelboraf and during treatment. sun protection if you are taking zelboraf, you may become more sensitive to sunlight and get sunburns that can be severe. during treatment, avoid exposing your skin to direct sunlight. if you do plan to go into the sun: wear clothing which protects your skin, including your head and face, arms and legs; use a lip balm and a broad spectrum sunscreen (minimum of sun protection factor (spf) 30, re-applied every 2 to 3 hours). this will help to protect you against sunburn. children and adolescents zelboraf is not recommended for children and adolescents. the effects of zelboraf in people younger than 18 years old are not known. other medicines and zelboraf before starting treatment, tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might use any other medicines (including those you have bought for yourself from a pharmacy, supermarket or health store). this is very important, as using more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen or weaken the effect of medicines. in particular, tell your doctor if you are taking: medicines that are known to affect the way your heart beats: medicines for heart rhythm problems (e.g. quinidine, amiodarone) medicines for depression (e.g. amitriptyline, imipramine) medicines for bacterial infections (e.g. azithromycin, clarithromycin) medicines for nausea and vomiting (e.g. ondansetron, domperidone). medicines that are mainly eliminated by metabolising proteins called cyp1a2 (e.g caffeine, olanzapine, theophylline), cyp3a4 (e.g. some oral contraceptives) or called cyp2c8. medicines that influence a protein called p-gp or bcrp (e.g. verapamil, cyclosporine, ritonavir, quinidine, itraconazole, gefitinib). medicines that could be influenced by a protein called p-gp (e.g. aliskiren, colchicine, digoxin, everolimus, fexofenadine) or a protein called bcrp (e.g. methotrexate, mitoxantrone, rosuvastatin). medicines that stimulate the metabolising proteins called cyp3a4 or a metabolising process called glucuronidation (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin or st john's wort) medicines that strongly inhibit the metabolising protein called cyp3a4 (e.g. ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, nefazodone, atazanavir) a medicine used to prevent blood clots called warfarin a medicine called ipilimumab, another medicine for the treatment of melanoma. the combination of this medicine with zelboraf is not recommended

appropriate method of contraception during your treatment and for at least 6 months after the end of your treatment. zelboraf may decrease the efficacy of some oral contraceptives. please tell your doctor if you are taking an oral contraceptive. zelboraf is not recommended for use during pregnancy unless your doctor considers that the benefit for the mother outweighs the risk for the baby. there
