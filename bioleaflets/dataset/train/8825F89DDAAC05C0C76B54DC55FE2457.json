CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nAdults (tritherapy)\nPegIntron in combination with ribavirin and boceprevir (tritherapy) is indicated for the treatment of \n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nchronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 infection in adult patients (18 years of age and older) with \ncompensated liver disease who are previously untreated or who have failed previous therapy (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nPlease refer to the ribavirin and boceprevir Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPCs) when \nPegIntron is to be used in combination with these medicines.\n\nAdults (bitherapy and monotherapy)\nPegIntron is indicated for the treatment of adult patients (18 years of age and older) with CHC who are \npositive for hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV-RNA), including patients with compensated cirrhosis and/or \nco-infected with clinically stable HIV (see section 4.4).\n\nPegIntron in combination with ribavirin (bitherapy) is indicated for the treatment of CHC infection in \nadult patients who are previously untreated including patients with clinically stable HIV co-infection \nand in adult patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or \nnonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).\n\nInterferon monotherapy, including PegIntron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or \ncontraindication to ribavirin.\n\nPlease refer to the ribavirin SmPC when PegIntron is to be used in combination with ribavirin. \n\nPaediatric population (bitherapy)\nPegIntron is indicated in a combination regimen with ribavirin for the treatment of children 3 years of \nage and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, previously untreated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA.\n\nWhen deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination \ntherapy induced a growth inhibition that may be irreversible in some patients. The decision to treat \nshould be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).\n\nPlease refer to the ribavirin SmPC for capsules or oral solution when PegIntron is to be used in \ncombination with ribavirin. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated and monitored only by a physician experienced in the management of \npatients with hepatitis C.\n\nPosology\nPegIntron should be administered as a once weekly subcutaneous injection. The dose administered in \nadults depends on whether it is used in combination therapy (bitherapy or tritherapy) or as \nmonotherapy.\n\nPegIntron combination therapy (bitherapy or tritherapy)\nBitherapy (PegIntron with ribavirin): applies to all adult and paediatric patients 3 years of age and \nolder.\n\nTritherapy (PegIntron with ribavirin and boceprevir): applies to adult patients with genotype 1 CHC.\n\nAdults \u2013 Dose to be administered\n\nPegIntron 1.5 micrograms/kg/week in combination with ribavirin capsules.\n\nThe intended dose of 1.5 \uf06dg/kg of PegIntron to be used in combination with ribavirin may be \ndelivered in weight categories with the PegIntron strengths according to Table 1. Ribavirin capsules \nare to be administered orally each day in two divided doses with food (morning and evening).\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nTable 1 Dosing for combination therapy*\nBody weight \n\n(kg)\nPegIntron Ribavirin capsules\n\nPegIntron strength\n(\uf06dg/0.5 ml)\n\nAdminister once \nweekly\n\n(ml)\n\nTotal daily \nribavirin dose\n\n(mg)\n\nNumber of \ncapsules \n(200 mg)\n\n< 40 50 0.5 800 4a\n\n40-50 80 0.4 800 4a\n\n51-64 80 0.5 800 4a\n\n65-75 100 0.5 1,000 5b\n\n76-80 120 0.5 1,000 5b\n\n81-85 120 0.5 1,200 6c\n\n86-105 150 0.5 1,200 6c\n\n> 105 150 0.5 1,400 7d\n\na: 2 morning, 2 evening\nb: 2 morning, 3 evening\nc: 3 morning, 3 evening\nd: 3 morning, 4 evening\n* Refer to the SmPC of boceprevir for details about the dose of boceprevir to be administered in tritherapy.\n\nAdults - Duration of treatment \u2013 Na\u00efve patients\nTritherapy: Refer to the SmPC for boceprevir.\n\nBitherapy: Predictability of sustained virological response - Patients infected with virus genotype 1 \nwho fail to achieve undetectable HCV-RNA or demonstrate adequate virological response at week 4 \nor 12 are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders and should be evaluated for \ndiscontinuation (see also section 5.1).\n\uf0b7 Genotype 1: \n\n- Patients who have undetectable HCV-RNA at treatment week 12, treatment should be \ncontinued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks). \n- Patients with detectable but \u2265 2 log decrease in HCV-RNA level from baseline at treatment \nweek 12 should be reassessed at treatment week 24 and, if HCV-RNA is undetectable, they \nshould continue with full course of therapy (i.e. a total of 48 weeks). However, if HCV-RNA is \nstill detectable at treatment week 24, discontinuation of therapy should be considered.\n- In the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) who \nbecome HCV-RNA negative at treatment week 4 and remain HCV-RNA negative at week 24, \nthe treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an \nadditional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). However, an overall 24 weeks \ntreatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment \nduration (see section 5.1).\n\n\uf0b7 Genotypes 2 or 3: \nIt is recommended that all patients be treated with bitherapy for 24 weeks, except for HCV/HIV \nco-infected patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment.\n\n\uf0b7 Genotype 4: \nIn general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study \ndata (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment with bitherapy as for \ngenotype 1.\n\nAdults - Duration of treatment - HCV/HIV co-infection\nBitherapy: The recommended duration of treatment for HCV/HIV co-infected patients is 48 weeks \nwith bitherapy, regardless of genotype.\n\nPredictability of response and non-response in HCV/HIV co-infection - Early virological response by \nweek 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV-RNA, has been shown \nto be predictive for sustained response. The negative predictive value for sustained response in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients treated with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; \n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nStudy 1) (see section 5.1). A positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; Study 1) was observed for \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving bitherapy.\n\nAdults - Duration of treatment - Retreatment\nTritherapy: Refer to the SmPC for boceprevir.\n\nBitherapy: Predictability of sustained virological response - All patients, irrespective of genotype, who \nhave demonstrated serum HCV-RNA below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive \n48 weeks of bitherapy. Retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response (i.e. HCV-RNA \nbelow the limits of detection) at week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after \n48 weeks of therapy (see also section 5.1).\nRetreatment duration greater than 48 weeks in non-responder patients with genotype 1 has not been \nstudied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy. \n\nPaediatric population (bitherapy only) \u2013 Dose to be administered\nDosing for children 3 years of age and older and adolescent patients is determined by body surface \narea for PegIntron and by body weight for ribavirin. The recommended dose of PegIntron is \n60 \uf06dg/m2/week subcutaneously in combination with ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day orally in two divided \ndoses with food (morning and evening).\n\nPaediatric population (bitherapy only) - Duration of treatment \n\uf0b7 Genotype 1: \n\nThe recommended duration of treatment with bitherapy is 1 year. By extrapolation from clinical \ndata on combination therapy with standard interferon in paediatric patients (negative predictive \nvalue 96 % for interferon alfa\u20132b/ribavirin), patients who fail to achieve virological response at \n12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders. Therefore, it is \nrecommended that children and adolescent patients receiving PegIntron/ribavirin combination \nbe discontinued from therapy if their week 12 HCV-RNA dropped < 2 log10 compared to \npretreatment or if they have detectable HCV-RNA at treatment week 24.\n\n\uf0b7 Genotype 2 or 3: \nThe recommended duration of treatment with bitherapy is 24 weeks.\n\n\uf0b7 Genotype 4: \nOnly 5 children and adolescents with Genotype 4 were treated in the PegIntron/ribavirin clinical \ntrial. The recommended duration of treatment with bitherapy is 1 year. It is recommended that \nchildren and adolescent patients receiving PegIntron/ribavirin combination be discontinued \nfrom therapy if their week 12 HCV-RNA dropped < 2 log10 compared to pretreatment or if they \nhave detectable HCV-RNA at treatment week 24.\n\nPegIntron monotherapy \u2013 Adults\nDose to be administered\nAs monotherapy the PegIntron regimen is 0.5 or 1.0 \uf06dg/kg/week. The lowest PegIntron strength \navailable is 50 \uf06dg/0.5 ml; therefore for patients prescribed 0.5 \uf06dg/kg/week, doses must be adjusted by \nvolume as shown in Table 2. For the 1.0 \uf06dg/kg dose, similar volume adjustments can be made or \nalternate strengths can be used as shown in Table 2. PegIntron monotherapy was not studied in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients.\n\nTable 2 Monotherapy dosing\n\n0.5 \uf06dg/kg 1.0 \uf06dg/kg\nBody weight \n\n(kg)\nPegIntron \nstrength\n\n(\uf06dg/0.5 ml)\n\nAdminister once \nweekly\n\n(ml)\n\nPegIntron \nstrength\n\n(\uf06dg/0.5 ml)\n\nAdminister once \nweekly\n\n(ml)\n30-35 50* 0.15 80 0.2\n36-45 50 0.2 50 0.4\n46-56 50 0.25 50 0.5\n57-72 80  0.2 80 0.4\n73-88 50  0.4 80 0.5\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\n89-106 50 0.5 100 0.5\n107-120** 80 0.4 120 0.5\nMinimum delivery for pen is 0.2 ml.\n*   Must use vial. \n** For patients > 120 kg, the PegIntron dose should be calculated based on the individual patient weight. This may require \ncombinations of various PegIntron dose strengths and volumes.\n\nDuration of treatment\nFor patients who exhibit virological response at week 12, treatment should be continued for at least \nanother three-month period (i.e., a total of six months). The decision to extend therapy to one year of \ntreatment should be based on prognostic factors (e.g., genotype, age > 40 years, male gender, bridging \nfibrosis).\n\nDose modification for all patients (monotherapy and combination therapy)\nIf severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop during treatment with PegIntron \nmonotherapy or combination therapy, the dosages of PegIntron and/or ribavirin must be modified as \nappropriate, until the adverse reactions abate. Dose reduction of boceprevir is not recommended. \nBoceprevir must not be administered in the absence of PegIntron and ribavirin.\nAs adherence might be of importance for outcome of therapy, the dose of PegIntron and ribavirin should \nbe kept as close as possible to the recommended standard dose. Guidelines were developed in clinical \ntrials for dose modification.\n\nCombination therapy dose reduction guidelines\n\nTable 2a Dose modification guidelines for combination therapy based on laboratory \nparameters\n\nLaboratory values Reduce only ribavirin \ndaily dose (see note 1) \n\nif:\n\nReduce only PegIntron\ndose (see note 2) if:\n\nDiscontinue\ncombination therapy \n\nif:\nHaemoglobin \u2265 8.5 g/dl, and \n\n< 10 g/dl\n- < 8.5 g/dl\n\nAdults: Haemoglobin \nin Patients with history \nof stable cardiac \ndisease\n\nChildren and \nadolescents: not \napplicable\n\n\uf0b3 2 g/dl decrease in haemoglobin during any\nfour week period during treatment\n\n(permanent dose reduction)\n\n< 12 g/dl after four \nweeks of dose \n\nreduction\n\nLeukocytes - \u2265 1.0 x 109/l, and \n< 1.5 x 109/l\n\n< 1.0 x 109/l\n\nNeutrophils - \u2265 0.5 x 109/l, and \n< 0.75 x 109/l\n\n< 0.5 x 109/l\n\nPlatelets - \u2265 25 x 109/l, and \n< 50 x 109/l (adults)\n\n\u2265 50 x 109/l, and \n<70 x 109/l (children and \n\nadolescents)\n\n< 25 x 109/l (adults)\n< 50 x 109/l (children \n\nand adolescents)\n\nBilirubin \u2013 direct - - 2.5 x ULN*\n\nBilirubin - indirect > 5 mg/dl - > 4 mg/dl\n(for > 4 weeks)\n\nSerum Creatinine - - > 2.0 mg/dl\nCreatinine Clearance - - Discontinue ribavirin \n\nif CrCL < 50ml/min\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nLaboratory values Reduce only ribavirin \ndaily dose (see note 1) \n\nif:\n\nReduce only PegIntron\ndose (see note 2) if:\n\nDiscontinue\ncombination therapy \n\nif:\nAlanine \naminotransferase\n(ALT)\n\nor\nAspartate \naminotransferase\n(AST)\n\n- - 2 x baseline and\n> 10 x ULN*\n\n2 x baseline and\n> 10 x ULN*\n\n* Upper limit of normal\n\nNote 1: In adult patients 1st dose reduction of ribavirin is by 200 mg/day (except in patients receiving \nthe 1,400 mg, dose reduction should be by 400 mg/day). If needed, 2nd dose reduction of \nribavirin is by an additional 200 mg/day. Patients whose dose of ribavirin is reduced to \n600 mg daily receive one 200 mg capsule in the morning and two 200 mg capsules in the \nevening. \nIn children and adolescent patients 1st dose reduction of ribavirin is to 12 mg/kg/day, 2nd dose \nreduction of ribavirin is to 8 mg/kg/day.\n\nNote 2: In adult patients 1st dose reduction of PegIntron is to 1 \u00b5g/kg/week. If needed, 2nd dose \nreduction of PegIntron is to 0.5 \u00b5g/kg/week. For patients on PegIntron monotherapy: refer to \nmonotherapy dose reduction guidelines section for dose reduction.\nIn children and adolescent patients 1st dose reduction of PegIntron is to 40 \uf06dg/m2/week, 2nd\n\ndose reduction of PegIntron is to 20 \uf06dg/m2/week.\n\nDose reduction of PegIntron in adults may be accomplished by reducing the prescribed volume or by \nutilizing a lower dose strength as shown in Table 2b. Dose reduction of PegIntron in children and \nadolescents is accomplished by modifying the recommended dose in a two-step process from the \noriginal starting dose of 60 \uf06dg/m2/week, to 40 \uf06dg/m2/week, then to 20 \uf06dg/m2/week, if needed.\n\nTable 2b Two-step dose reduction of PegIntron in combination therapy in adults\n\nFirst dose reduction to PegIntron 1 \u00b5g/kg Second dose reduction to PegIntron 0.5 \u00b5g/kg\n\nBody \nweight(kg)\n\nPegIntron \nstrength\n\n(\uf06dg/0.5 ml)\n\nAmount of\nPegIntron\n\nto \nadminister\n\n(\u00b5g)\n\nVolume of \nPegIntron \n\nto \nadminister\n\n(ml)\n\nBody \nweight\n(kg)\n\nPegIntron \nstrength\n\n(\uf06dg/0.5 ml)\n\nAmount of\nPegIntron\n\nto \nadminister\n\n(\u00b5g)\n\nVolume of \nPegIntron\n\nto \nadminister\n\n(ml)\n\n< 40 50 35 0.35 < 40 50 20 0.2\n\n40 \u2013 50 120\n48\n\n0.2\n40 \u2013 50 50 25 0.25\n\n51 \u2013 64 80 56 0.35 51 \u2013 64 80\n32 0.2\n\n65 \u2013 75 100 70\n0.35\n\n65 \u2013 75 50\n35 0.35\n\n76 \u2013 85 80 80 0.5 76 \u2013 85 120\n48\n\n0.2\n\n86 - 105 120 96 0.4 86 \u2013 105 50 50 0.5\n\n> 105 150\n105 0.35\n\n> 105 80 64 0.4\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nPegIntron monotherapy dose reduction guidelines in adults\n\nDose modification guidelines for adult patients who use PegIntron monotherapy are shown in \nTable 3a.\n\nTable 3a Dose modification guidelines for PegIntron monotherapy in adults based on \nlaboratory parameters\n\nLaboratory values Reduce PegIntron \nto one-half dose if:\n\nDiscontinue PegIntron if:\n\nNeutrophils \u2265 0.5 x 109/l, and < 0.75 x 109/l < 0.5 x 109/l\n\nPlatelets \u2265 25 x 109/l, and < 50 x 109/l < 25 x 109/l\n\nFor adult patients who use 0.5 \uf06dg/kg PegIntron monotherapy, dose reduction may be accomplished by \nreducing the prescribed volume by one-half as shown in Table 3b.\n\nTable 3b Reduced PegIntron dose (0.25 \uf06dg/kg) for the 0.5 \uf06dg/kg monotherapy regimen in \nadults\n\nBody weight \n(kg)\n\nPegIntron strength\n(\uf06dg/0.5 ml)\n\nAmount of PegIntron to \nadminister\n\n(\uf06dg)\n\nVolume of PegIntron to \nAdminister \n\n(ml)\n30-35 50* 8 0.08\n36-45 50* 10 0.1\n46-56 50* 13 0.13\n57-72 80* 16 0.1\n73-88 50 20 0.2\n\n89-106 50 25 0.25\n107-120** 80 32 0.2\n\nMinimum delivery for pen is 0.2 ml.\n* Must use vial.\n** For patients > 120 kg, the PegIntron dose should be calculated based on the individual patient weight.

This may require \ncombinations of various PegIntron dose strengths and volumes.\n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nMonotherapy\nPegIntron should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. In patients \nwith moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of PegIntron \nshould be reduced by 25 %. Patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance \n15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of PegIntron reduced by 50 %. Data are not available \nfor the use of PegIntron in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2). Patients \nwith severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored. If renal \nfunction decreases during treatment, PegIntron therapy should be discontinued. \n\nCombination therapy\nPatients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with PegIntron in combination \nwith ribavirin (see ribavirin SmPC). When administered in combination therapy, patients with impaired \nrenal function should be more carefully monitored with respect to the development of anaemia.\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe safety and efficacy of PegIntron therapy has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic \ndysfunction, therefore PegIntron must not be used for these patients.\n\nElderly (\uf0b3 65 years of age)\nThere are no apparent age-related effects on the pharmacokinetics of PegIntron. Data from elderly patients \ntreated with a single dose of PegIntron suggest no alteration in PegIntron dose is necessary based on age \n(see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nPegIntron can be used in combination with ribavirin in paediatric patients 3 years of age and older. \n\nMethod of administration\nPegIntron should be administered as a subcutaneous injection. For special handling information see \nsection 6.6. Patients may self-inject PegIntron if their physician determines that it is appropriate and with \nmedical follow-up as necessary.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any interferon or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1;\n\n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac disease \nin the previous six months (see section 4.4);\n\n- Severe, debilitating medical conditions;\n- Autoimmune hepatitis or a history of autoimmune disease;\n- Severe hepatic dysfunction or decompensated cirrhosis of the liver;\n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment;\n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function;\n- HCV/HIV patients with cirrhosis and a Child-Pugh score \u2265 6.\n- Combination of PegIntron with telbivudine.\n\nPaediatric population\n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicidal attempt.\n\nCombination therapy\nAlso see SmPCs for ribavirin and boceprevir if PegIntron is to be administered in combination therapy \nin patients with chronic hepatitis C.\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPsychiatric and Central Nervous System (CNS)\nSevere CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed \nin some patients during PegIntron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the \n6-month follow-up period. Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against \nothers such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status \nhave been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or \nsymptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these \nundesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate \ntherapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal \nor homicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with PegIntron be discontinued, \nand the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.\n\nPatients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions\nIf treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history \nof severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate \nindividualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.\n- The use of PegIntron in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric \nconditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Among children and adolescents treated with interferon \nalfa-2b in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently \ncompared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after \ntreatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events \n(e.g. depression, emotional lability, and somnolence).\n\nPatients with substance use/abuse\nHCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an \nincreased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders \nwhen treated with alpha interferon. If treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, \nthe presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully \nassessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach \nincluding a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and \nfollow the patient. Patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment \ndiscontinuation. Early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and \nsubstance use is recommended.\n\nGrowth and development (children and adolescents)\nDuring the course of therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss \nand growth inhibition were common. Long-term data available in children treated with the \ncombination therapy of pegylated interferon/ribavirin are indicative of substantial growth retardation. \nThirty two percent (30/94) of subjects demonstrated > 15 percentile decrease in height-for-age \npercentile 5 years after completion of therapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nCase by case benefit/risk assessment in children \nThe expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for \nchildren and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n- It is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, that \n\nresulted in reduced height in some patients.\n- This risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of \n\ndisease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease \nprogression (such as HIV co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (HCV \ngenotype and viral load).\n\nWhenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the \nrisk of growth inhibition. Although data are limited, no evidence of long-term effects on sexual \nmaturation was noted in the 5-year observational follow-up study.\n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in \nsome patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. While these effects are \ngenerally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have \noccurred with high doses of interferon alpha.\n\nAll patients in the selected chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain \ncases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. \nCurrent treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to \ncommencing treatment.\n\nAcute hypersensitivity\nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have \nbeen observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. If such a reaction develops during treatment with \nPegIntron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. Transient rashes \ndo not necessitate interruption of treatment.\n\nCardiovascular system\nAs with interferon alfa-2b, adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction \nand/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving PegIntron therapy require close monitoring. It \nis recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken \nprior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually \nrespond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of PegIntron therapy. There are no data \nin children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease.\n\nHepatic Failure\nPegIntron increases the risk of hepatic decompensation and death in patients with cirrhosis. As with all \ninterferons, discontinue treatment with PegIntron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation \nmarkers which might indicate liver decompensation. Liver enzymes and hepatic function should be \nclosely monitored in cirrhotic patients.\n\nPyrexia\nWhile pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon \ntherapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.\n\nHydration\nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing PegIntron therapy since hypotension \nrelated to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. Fluid \nreplacement may be necessary.\n\nPulmonary changes\nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients. Any patient developing pyrexia, cough, dyspnea or other \nrespiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or \nthere is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if \nappropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and \ntreatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.\n\nAutoimmune disease\nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment \nwith alpha interferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at \nincreased risk. Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be \nevaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also \nsection 4.4 Thyroid changes and section 4.8).\nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting \nthe eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment \nshould be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).\n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\nOcular changes\nOphthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, serous retinal detachment, \nand retinal artery or vein occlusion have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha \ninterferons (see section 4.8). All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient \ncomplaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and \ncomplete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations are recommended during PegIntron therapy, \nparticularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or \nhypertension. Discontinuation of PegIntron should be considered in patients who develop new or \nworsening ophthalmological disorders.\n\nThyroid changes\nInfrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with interferon alpha have developed \nthyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Approximately 21 % of children \ntreated with PegIntron/ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid stimulating \nhormone (TSH). Another approximately 2 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. \nPrior to initiation of PegIntron therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality \ndetected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. Determine TSH levels if, during the \ncourse of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the \npresence of thyroid dysfunction, PegIntron treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be \nmaintained in the normal range by medicine. Children and adolescents should be monitored every \n3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH).\n\nMetabolic disturbances\nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.\n\nHCV/HIV Co-infection\nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis\nPatients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be\nat increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding PegIntron and \nribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SmPC). \n\nHepatic decompensation in HCV/HIV co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis\nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with \nribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. Other baseline factors in co-infected patients that \nmay be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and \nelevated bilirubin serum concentration.\nCo-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely \nmonitored, assessing their Child-Pugh score during treatment. Patients progressing to hepatic \ndecompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the ARV \ntreatment reassessed.\n\nHaematological abnormalities in HCV/HIV co-infected patients\nHCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and HAART may \nbe at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia) compared to HCV mono-infected patients. Although, the majority of them could be managed \nby dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this \npopulation of patients (see section 4.2 and below \u201cLaboratory tests\u201d and section 4.8). \nPatients treated with PegIntron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk \nof developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5).\n\nPatients with low CD4 counts\nIn patients co-infected with HCV/HIV, limited efficacy and safety data (N = 25) are available in \nsubjects with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/\u00b5l. Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of \n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\npatients with low CD4 counts.\n\nPlease refer to the respective SmPCs of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken \nconcurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product \nand the potential for overlapping toxicities with PegIntron and ribavirin.\n\nHCV/HBV Coinfection\nCases of hepatitis B re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients co-\ninfected with hepatitis B and C viruses treated with interferon. The frequency of such re-activation \nappears to be low.\nAll patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting treatment with interferon for hepatitis C; \npatients co-infected with hepatitis B and C must then be monitored and managed according to current \nclinical guidelines.\n\nDental and periodontal disorders\nDental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients \nreceiving PegIntron and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging \neffect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination \nof PegIntron and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular \ndental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.\n\nOrgan transplant recipients\nThe safety and efficacy of PegIntron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of \nhepatitis C in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been studied. Preliminary data indicate \nthat interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection. Liver \ngraft rejection has also been reported.\n\nOther\nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nPegIntron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies \nthe potential risk.\n\nLaboratory tests\nStandard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all \npatients prior to initiating therapy. Acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a guideline prior \nto initiation of PegIntron therapy are:\n\n\uf0b7 Platelets \uf0b3 100,000/mm3\n\n\uf0b7 Neutrophil count \uf0b3 1,500/mm3\n\n\uf0b7 TSH level must be within normal limits\n\nLaboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as \nclinically appropriate. HCV-RNA should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).\n\nLong term maintenance monotherapy\nIt has been demonstrated in a clinical study that peginterferon alfa-2b at low-dose (0.5 \u03bcg/kg/week) is not \neffective in long term maintenance monotherapy (for a mean duration of 2.5 years) for the prevention of \ndisease progression in non responders with compensated cirrhosis. No statistically significant effect on the \ntime to development of the first clinical event (liver decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, death \nand/or liver transplantation) was observed as compared to the absence of treatment. PegIntron should \ntherefore not be used as long term maintenance monotherapy.\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of PegIntron \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-\nisomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially \n\"sodium-free\".\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nTelbivudine\nA clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon \nalfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination \nis associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these \nevents is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine SmPC). Moreover, the safety and \nefficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not \nbeen demonstrated. Therefore, the combination of PegIntron with telbivudine is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).\n\nMethadone\nIn patients with chronic hepatitis C that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and na\u00efve to \npeginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of PegIntron subcutaneously for 4 weeks \nincreased R-methadone AUC by approximately 15 % (95 % Cl for AUC ratio estimate 103 \u2013 128 %). \nThe clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs \nand symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. Especially in patients on \na high dose of methadone, the risk for QTc prolongation should be considered.\n\nEffect of Peginterferon alfa-2b on Co-administered Medicines\n\nThe potential interaction of peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIntron) on substrates of metabolic enzymes was \nevaluated in 3 multiple-dose clinical pharmacology studies. In these studies, the effects of \nmultiple-dose regimens of peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIntron) were investigated in Hepatitis C subjects \n(1.5 mcg/week) or healthy subjects (1 mcg/week or 3 mcg/week) (Table 4). A clinically significant \npharmacokinetic interaction was not observed between peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIntron) and \ntolbutamide, midazolam or dapsone; therefore, no dosing adjustment is necessary when peginterferon \nalfa-2b (PegIntron) is administered with medicines metabolized by CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and \nN-acetyltransferase. Concomitant administration of peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIntron) with caffeine or \ndesipramine modestly increased the exposure of caffeine and desipramine. When patients are \nadministered PegIntron with medications metabolized by CYP1A2 or CYP2D6, the extent of the \ndecrease in cytochrome P 450 activity is unlikely to have a clinical impact, except with medicines \nwhich have a narrow therapeutic margin (Table 5).\n\nTable 4Effect of Peginterferon alfa-2b on Co-administered Medicines\n\nCo-administered \nMedicine\n\nDose of \npeginterferon \nalfa-2b\n\nStudy Population\n\nGeometric Mean Ratio (Ratio \nwith/without peginterferon \nalfa-2b)\nAUC\n(90% CI)\n\nCmax\n(90% CI)\n\nCaffeine\n(CYP1A2 substrate)\n\n1.5 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nChronic Hepatitis \nC Subjects (N=22)\n\n1.39\n(1.27, 1.51)\n\n1.02\n(0.95, 1.09)\n\n1 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=24)\n\n1.18\n(1.07, 1.31)\n\n1.12\n(1.05, 1.19)\n\n3 mcg/kg/week \n(2 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=13)\n\n1.36 \n(1.25, 1.49)\n\n1.16 \n(1.10, 1.24)\n\nTolbutamide\n(CYP2C9 substrate)\n\n1.5 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nChronic Hepatitis \nC Subjects (N=22)\n\n1.1#\n(0.94, 1.28)\n\nNA\n\n1 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=24)\n\n0.90#\n(0.81, 1.00)\n\nNA\n\n3 mcg/kg/week \n(2 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=13)\n\n0.95\n(0.89, 1.01)\n\n0.99\n(0.92, 1.07)\n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\nCo-administered \nMedicine\n\nDose of \npeginterferon \nalfa-2b\n\nStudy Population\n\nGeometric Mean Ratio (Ratio \nwith/without peginterferon \nalfa-2b)\nAUC\n(90% CI)\n\nCmax\n(90% CI)\n\nDextromethorphan \nhydrobromide\n(CYP2D6 and \nCYP3A substrate)\n\n1.5 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nChronic Hepatitis \nC Subjects (N=22)\n\n0.96##\n(0.73, 1.26)\n\nNA\n\n1 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=24)\n\n2.03#\n(1.55, 2.67)\n\nNA\n\nDesipramine\n(CYP2D6 substrate)\n\n3 mcg/kg/week \n(2 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=13)\n\n1.30\n(1.18, 1.43)\n\n1.08\n(1.00, 1.16)\n\nMidazolam\n(CYP3A4 substrate)\n\n1.5 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nChronic Hepatitis \nC Subjects (N=24)\n\n1.07\n(0.91, 1.25)\n\n1.12\n(0.94, 1.33)\n\n1 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=24)\n\n1.07\n(0.99, 1.16)\n\n1.33\n(1.15, 1.53)\n\n3 mcg/kg/week \n(2 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=13)\n\n1.18\n(1.06, 1.32)\n\n1.24\n(1.07, 1.43)\n\nDapsone\n(N-acetyltransferase \nsubstrate)\n\n1.5 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nChronic Hepatitis \nC Subjects (N=24)\n\n1.05\n(1.02, 1.08)\n\n1.03\n(1.00, 1.06)\n\n# Calculated from urine data collected over an interval of 48-hours\n## Calculated from urine data collected over an interval of 24-hours\n\nTable 5 Precautions for co-administration (PegIntron should be administered with care \nwhen co-administered with the following medicines)\n\nMedicines Signs, Symptoms, and Treatment Mechanism and Risk Factors\nTheophylline Co-administration of theophylline \n\nwith the product (PegIntron) may \nincrease the blood concentrations of \ntheophylline. Careful \nco-administration of theophylline \nwith the product (PegIntron) is \nrecommended. Package inserts of \ntheophylline should be referred to \nwhen co-administering with the \nproduct (PegIntron)\n\nMetabolism of theophylline is \nsuppressed by inhibitory action of \nthe product (PegIntron) on \nCYP1A2.\n\nThioridazine Co-administration of thioridazine \nwith the product (PegIntron) may \nincrease the blood concentrations of \nthioridazine. Careful \nco-administration of thioridazine \nwith the product (PegIntron) is \nrecommended. Package inserts of \nthioridazine should be referred to \nwhen co-administering with the \nproduct (PegIntron)\n\nMetabolism of thioridazine is \nsuppressed by inhibitory action of \nthe product (PegIntron) on \nCYP2D6.\n\nTheophylline,\nAntipyrine,\nWarfarin\n\nElevation of blood concentrations \nof these medicines has been \nreported when administered in \ncombination with other interferon \npreparations and therefore care \nshould be taken.\n\nMetabolism of other medicines in \nthe liver may be suppressed.\n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\nMedicines Signs, Symptoms, and Treatment Mechanism and Risk Factors\nZidovudine When administered in combination \n\nwith other interferon preparations, \nsuppressive effect on bone marrow \nfunction may be strengthened and \naggravation of blood cell reduction \nsuch as white blood cells decreased \nmay occur.\n\nMechanism of action is unknown, \nbut it is considered that both \nmedicines have bone marrow \ndepressive effects.\n\nImmuno-suppressive \ntherapy\n\nWhen administered in combination \nwith other interferon preparations, \neffect of immunosuppressive \ntherapy may be weakened in \ntransplant (kidney, bone marrow, \netc.) patients.\n\nIt is considered that graft rejection \nreactions may be induced.\n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between PegIntron and ribavirin in a multiple-dose \npharmacokinetic study.\n\nHCV/HIV Co-infection\n\nNucleoside analogues\nUse of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic \nacidosis. Pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides in \nvitro. This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs \n(e.g. didanosine or abacavir). Co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended. \nReports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of which some fatal, \nhave been reported (see ribavirin SmPC).\n\nExacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen \nused to treat HIV, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of \nribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). \nConsideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment \n(ART) regimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with a \nknown history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females\nPegIntron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception \nduring the treatment.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin\nExtreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking \nPegIntron in combination with ribavirin. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective \ncontraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or their \nfemale partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has \nbeen concluded (see ribavirin SmPC).\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in \nprimates. PegIntron is likely to also cause this effect. \nThe potential risk in humans is unknown. PegIntron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential \nbenefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin\nRibavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy, therefore ribavirin therapy \nis contraindicated in women who are pregnant.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. \nBecause of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be \ndiscontinued prior to initiation of treatment.\n\nFertility\nThere are no data available regarding potential effects of PegIntron treatment on male or female \nfertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPatients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with PegIntron are cautioned to \navoid driving or operating machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nAdults\nTritherapy\nRefer to the SmPC for boceprevir.\n\nBitherapy and monotherapy\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with PegIntron in \ncombination with ribavirin in adults, seen in more than half of the study subjects, were fatigue, \nheadache, and injection site reaction. Additional adverse reactions reported in more than 25 % of \nsubjects included nausea, chills, insomnia, anaemia, pyrexia, myalgia, asthenia, pain, alopecia, \nanorexia, weight decreased, depression, rash and irritability. The most frequently reported adverse \nreactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were manageable without the need for \nmodification of doses or discontinuation of therapy. Fatigue, alopecia, pruritus, nausea, anorexia, \nweight decreased, irritability and insomnia occur at a notably lower rate in patients treated with \nPegIntron monotherapy compared to those treated with combination therapy (see Table 6). \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nThe following treatment-related adverse reactions were reported in adults in clinical trials or through \npost-marketing surveillance in patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2b, including PegIntron \nmonotherapy or PegIntron/ribavirin. These reactions are listed in table 6 by system organ class and \nfrequency (very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), \nrare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing

and thrombocytopenia were mild (WHO grades 1 or 2). There were some cases \nof more severe neutropenia in patients treated with the recommended doses of PegIntron in combination \nwith ribavirin (WHO grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and WHO grade 4: 13 of 186 [7 %]).\n\nIn a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with PegIntron or interferon alfa-2b in \ncombination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. These events \nincluded suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4). \n\nCardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with \npre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, \nthat may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients \nwithout prior evidence of cardiac disease. \n\nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa products, \nnotably in patients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV-infection, cirrhosis). \nEvents were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with \ninterferon alfa.\n\nOphthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies \n(including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein occlusion, retinal exudates, \nloss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).\n\nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons \nincluding thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated),\nidiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including \nmononeuropathies and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (see also section 4.4).\n\nHCV/HIV co-infected patients\nSummary of the safety profile\nFor HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving PegIntron in combination with ribavirin, other \nundesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the \nlarger studies with a frequency > 5 % were: oral candidiasis (14 %), lipodystrophy acquired (13 %), \nCD4 lymphocytes decreased (8 %), appetite decreased (8 %), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased \n(9 %), back pain (5 %), blood amylase increased (6 %), blood lactic acid increased (5 %), cytolytic \nhepatitis (6 %), lipase increased (6 %) and pain in limb (6 %).\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nMitochondrial toxicity\nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in HIV-positive patients receiving NRTI \nregimen and associated ribavirin for co-HCV infection (see section 4.4).\n\nLaboratory values for HCV/HIV co-infected patients\nAlthough haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more \nfrequently in HCV/HIV co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and \nrarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). Haematological abnormalities \nwere more frequently reported in patients receiving PegIntron in combination with ribavirin when \ncompared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin. In Study 1 (see \nsection 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in 4 % \n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\n(8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of \npatients receiving PegIntron in combination with ribavirin. Anaemia (hemoglobin < 9.4 g/dl) was \nreported in 12 % (23/194) of patients treated with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin.\n\nCD4 lymphocytes decrease\nTreatment with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute \nCD4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in CD4+ cell percentage. The decrease \nin CD4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. The use of PegIntron \nin combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of HIV viraemia \nduring therapy or follow-up. Limited safety data (N= 25) are available in co-infected patients with \nCD4+ cell counts < 200/\u00b5l (see section 4.4).\n\nPlease refer to the respective SmPCs of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken \nconcurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product and \nthe potential for overlapping toxicities with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin.\n\nPaediatric population\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with combination \ntherapy of PegIntron and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % of patients, most commonly \nfor anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. In general, the adverse reactions profile in children and \nadolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern \nregarding growth inhibition. During combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with PegIntron and ribavirin, \ngrowth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced height in some patients (see section 4.4). Weight \nloss and growth inhibition were very common during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean \ndecrease from baseline in weight and height percentile were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, \nrespectively) and growth velocity was inhibited (< 3rd percentile in 70 % of the patients).\n\nAt the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height \npercentiles were still of 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles respectively, and 20 % of the children \ncontinued to have inhibited growth (growth velocity < 3rd percentile). Ninety-four of 107 subjects \nenrolled in the 5 year long-term follow-up trial. The effects on growth were less in those subjects \ntreated for 24 weeks than those treated for 48 weeks. From pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-\nup among subjects treated for 24 or 48 weeks, height-for-age percentiles decreased 1.3 and \n9.0 percentiles, respectively. Twenty-four percent of subjects (11/46) treated for 24 weeks and 40 % of \nsubjects (19/48) treated for 48 weeks had a > 15 percentile height-for-age decrease from pre-treatment \nto the end of the 5 year long-term follow-up compared to pre-treatment baseline percentile. Eleven \npercent of subjects (5/46) treated for 24 weeks and 13 % of subjects (6/48) treated for 48 weeks were \nobserved to have a decrease from pre-treatment baseline of > 30 height-for-age percentiles to the end \nof the 5 year long-term follow-up. For weight, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up, weight-\nfor-age percentiles decreased 1.3 and 5.5 percentiles among subjects treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, \nrespectively. For BMI, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up, BMI-for-age percentiles \ndecreased 1.8 and 7.5 percentiles among subjects treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, respectively.\nDecrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up was most prominent in \nprepubertal age children. The decline of height, weight and BMI Z scores observed during the \ntreatment phase in comparison to a normative population did not fully recover at the end of long-term \nfollow-up period for children treated with 48 weeks of therapy (see section 4.4). \n\nIn the treatment phase of this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia \n(80 %), headache (62 %), neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site erythema \n(29 %). Only 1 subject discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction (thrombocytopenia). The \nmajority of adverse reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in severity. Severe adverse \nreactions were reported in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection site pain (1 %), pain in \nextremity (1 %), headache (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). Important treatment-emergent \nadverse reactions that occurred in this patient population were nervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger \n(2 %), depression/depressed mood (4 %) and hypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received levothyroxine \ntreatment for hypothyroidism/elevated TSH.\n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nThe following treatment-related adverse reactions were reported in the study in children and \nadolescent patients treated with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin. These reactions are listed in \nTable 7 by system organ class and frequency (very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data).\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 7 Adverse reactions very commonly, commonly and uncommonly reported in the \nclinical trial in children and adolescent patients treated with PegIntron in \ncombination with ribavirin\n\nInfections and infestations\n\nCommon: Fungal infection, influenza, oral herpes, otitis media, pharyngitis \nstreptococcal, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis\n\nUncommon: Pneumonia, ascariasis, enterobiasis, herpes zoster, cellulitis, urinary tract \ninfection, gastroenteritis\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\n\nVery common: Anaemia, leucopenia, neutropenia\nCommon: Thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy\n\nEndocrine disorders\n\nCommon: Hypothyroidism\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n\nVery common: Anorexia, decreased appetite\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nCommon: Suicidal ideation\u00a7, suicide attempt\u00a7, depression, aggression, affect lability, \n\nanger, agitation, anxiety, mood altered, restlessness, nervousness, insomnia\n\nUncommon: Abnormal behaviour, depressed mood, emotional disorder, fear, nightmare\nNervous system disorders\nVery common: Headache, dizziness \nCommon: Dysgeusia, syncope, disturbance in attention, somnolence, poor quality \n\nsleep\n\nUncommon: Neuralgia, lethargy, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, psychomotor \nhyperactivity, tremor\n\nEye disorders\nCommon: Eye pain\n\nUncommon: Conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pruritus, keratitis, vision blurred, photophobia\n\nEar and labyrinth disorders\nCommon: Vertigo\n\nCardiac disorders\nCommon: Palpitations, tachycardia\nVascular disorders\nCommon: Flushing\n\nUncommon: Hypotension, pallor\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\n\nCommon: Cough, epistaxis, pharyngolaryngeal pain\n\nUncommon: Wheezing, nasal discomfort, rhinorrhoea\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nVery common: Abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, vomiting, nausea\nCommon: Diarrhoea, aphthous stomatitis, cheilosis, mouth ulceration, stomach \n\ndiscomfort, oral pain\n\n \n\n\n\n23\n\nUncommon: Dyspepsia, gingivitis\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nUncommon: Hepatomegaly\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nVery common: Alopecia, dry skin\n\nCommon: Pruritus, rash, rash erythematous, eczema, acne, erythema\n\nUncommon: Photosensitivity reaction, rash maculo-papular, skin exfoliation, \npigmentation disorder, dermatitis atopic, skin discolouration\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nVery common: Myalgia, arthralgia \n\nCommon: Musculoskeletal pain, pain in extremity, back pain\n\nUncommon: Muscle contracture, muscle twitching\nRenal and urinary disorders\n\nUncommon: Proteinuria\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nUncommon: Female: Dysmenorrhoea\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nVery common: Injection site erythema, fatigue, pyrexia, rigors, influenza-like illness, \n\nasthenia, pain, malaise, irritability\n\nCommon: Injection site reaction, injection site pruritus, injection site rash injection \nsite dryness, injection site pain, feeling cold\n\nUncommon: Chest pain, chest discomfort, facial pain\nInvestigations\n\nVery common: Growth rate decrease (height and/or weight decrease for age)\n\nCommon: Blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, thyroglobulin increased\n\nUncommon: Anti-thyroid antibody positive\n\nInjury and poisoning\n\nUncommon: Contusion\n\u00a7class effect of interferon-alfa containing products \u2013 reported with standard interferon therapy in adult and paediatric patients; \nwith PegIntron reported in adult patients.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions in children and adolescents\nMost of the changes in laboratory values in the PegIntron/ribavirin clinical trial were mild or \nmoderate. Decreases in haemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, neutrophils and increase in bilirubin \nmay require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from therapy (see section 4.2). While \nchanges in laboratory values were observed in some patients treated with PegIntron used in \ncombination with ribavirin in the clinical trial, values returned to baseline levels within a few weeks \nafter the end of therapy.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDoses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported. The maximum daily dose reported is \n1,200 \u00b5g for one day. In general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving PegIntron are \nconsistent with the known safety profile for PegIntron; however, the severity of the events may be \nincreased. Standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not \nbeen shown to be useful. No specific antidote for PegIntron is available; therefore, symptomatic \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n24\n\ntreatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. If available, \nprescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (PCC).\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB10.\n\nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an \naverage degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. The average molecular mass is \napproximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.\n\nMechanism of action\nIn vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of PegIntron is derived from its interferon \nalfa-2b moiety.\n\nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nStudies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain monkey \nspecies, e.g., Rhesus monkeys are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to \nhuman type 1 interferons.\n\nOnce bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that \ninclude the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible \nfor the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-\ninfected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement \nof the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of \nlymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon\u2019s therapeutic \neffects.\n\nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact \nantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell \nmetabolism. This action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are \nunable to leave the cell.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nPegIntron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining \nchanges in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2\u20195\u2019-\noligoadenylate synthetase (2\u20195\u2019-OAS), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. Subjects treated with \nPegIntron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. Following single doses of PegIntron \nbetween 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related \nmanner. Neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of \nPegIntron.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety \u2013 Adults\nTritherapy with PegIntron, ribavirin and boceprevir\nRefer to the SmPC for boceprevir.\n\nMonotherapy with PegIntron and bitherapy with PegIntron and ribavirin\nNa\u00efve patients\nTwo pivotal trials have been conducted, one (C/I97-010) with PegIntron monotherapy; the other \n(C/I98-580) with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic \nhepatitis C confirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (> 30 IU/ml), a \nliver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the \nchronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.\n\n \n\n\n\n25\n\nIn the PegIntron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 na\u00efve chronic hepatitis C patients were treated with \nPegIntron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. In \naddition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million International Units [MIU] three times a \nweek) as a comparator. This study showed that PegIntron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (Table 8).\n\nIn the PegIntron combination trial, 1,530 na\u00efve patients were treated for one year with one of the \nfollowing combination regimens:\n- PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).\n- PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for \n\n11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514).\n- Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).\n\nIn this trial, the combination of PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly \nmore effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (Table 8), particularly in \npatients infected with Genotype 1 (Table 9). Sustained response was assessed by the response rate six \nmonths after the cessation of treatment.\n\nHCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. \nHowever, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin \nadministered in combination with PegIntron or interferon alfa-2b. In those patients that received \n> 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, \nresponse rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received \uf0a3 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin \n(Table 9), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.\n\nTable 8 Sustained virological response (% patients HCV negative)\nPegIntron monotherapy PegIntron + ribavirin\n\nTreatment regimen P 1.5 P 1.0 P 0.5 I P 1.5/R P 0.5/R I/R\nNumber of patients 304 297 315 303 511 514 505\nResponse at end of treatment 49 % 41 % 33 % 24 % 65 % 56 % 54 %\nSustained response 23 %* 25 % 18 % 12 % 54 %** 47 % 47 %\nP 1.5 PegIntron 1.5 micrograms/kg\nP 1.0 PegIntron 1.0 microgram/kg\nP 0.5 PegIntron 0.5 microgram/kg\nI Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU \nP 1.5/R PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg) + ribavirin (800 mg)\nP 0.5/R PegIntron (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg)\nI/R Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg)\n* p < 0.001 P 1.5 vs. I\n** p = 0.0143 P 1.5/R vs. I/R\n\nTable 9 Sustained response rates with PegIntron + ribavirin (by ribavirin dose, genotype \nand viral load)\n\nHCV Genotype Ribavirin dose\n(mg/kg)\n\nP 1.5/R P 0.5/R I/R\n\nAll Genotypes All 54 % 47 % 47 %\n\uf0a3 10.6 50 % 41 % 27 %\n> 10.6 61 % 48 % 47 %\n\nGenotype 1 All 42 % 34 % 33 %\n\uf0a3 10.6 38 % 25 % 20 %\n> 10.6 48 % 34 % 34 %\n\n   Genotype 1 \n   \uf0a3 600,000 IU/ml\n\nAll 73 % 51 % 45 %\n\uf0a3 10.6 74 % 25 % 33 %\n> 10.6 71 % 52 % 45 %\n\n   Genotype 1\n   > 600,000 IU/ml\n\nAll 30 % 27 % 29 %\n\uf0a3 10.6 27 % 25 % 17 %\n> 10.6 37 % 27 % 29 %\n\n \n\n\n\n26\n\nHCV Genotype Ribavirin dose\n(mg/kg)\n\nP 1.5/R P 0.5/R I/R\n\nGenotype 2/3 All 82 % 80 % 79 %\n\uf0a3 10.6 79 % 73 % 50 %\n> 10.6 88 % 80 % 80 %\n\nP 1.5/R PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg) + ribavirin (800 mg) \nP 0.5/R PegIntron (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg)\nI/R Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) \n\nIn the PegIntron monotherapy study, the Quality of Life was generally less affected by \n0.5 microgram/kg of PegIntron than by either 1.0 microgram/kg of PegIntron once weekly or 3 MIU \nof interferon alfa-2b three times a week. \n\nIn a separate trial, 224 patients with genotype 2 or 3 received PegIntron, 1.5 micrograms/kg \nsubcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with ribavirin 800 mg \u20131,400 mg p.o. for 6 months \n(based on body weight, only three patients weighing > 105 kg, received the 1,400 mg dose) \n(Table 10).

Any subject with missing data in and after the follow-up week 12 \nwindow was considered to be a non-responder at week 24 of follow-up.\n\nThe 6 month treatment duration in this trial was better tolerated than one year of treatment in the \npivotal combination trial; for discontinuation 5 % vs. 14 %, for dose modification 18 % vs. 49 %.\n\nIn a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) received \nPegIntron, 1.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted \nribavirin. The overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50 %. Forty-one \npercent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at week 4 and week 24 of \ntherapy. In this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response rate. The high \nsustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and \nprospectively confirmed (n=48).\nLimited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher \nsustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following \n24 weeks of treatment).\n\nA large randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of treatment for 48 weeks with two \nPegIntron/ribavirin regimens [PegIntron 1.5 \u00b5g/kg and 1 \u00b5g/kg subcutaneously once weekly both in \ncombination with ribavirin 800 to 1,400 mg p.o. daily (in two divided doses)] and peginterferon alfa-\n2a 180 \u00b5g subcutaneously once weekly with ribavirin 1,000 to 1,200 mg p.o. daily (in two divided \ndoses) in 3,070 treatment-na\u00efve adults with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1.

At the PegIntron 1.5 \u00b5g/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained \nvirologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients with normal ALT levels, in \npatients with a baseline viral load > 600,000 IU/ml, and in patients > 40 years old. Caucasian patients \nhad a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the African Americans. Among patients \nwith undetectable HCV-RNA at the end of treatment, the relapse rate was 24 %. \n\nPredictability of sustained virological response \u2013 Na\u00efve patients: Virological response by week 12 is \ndefined as at least 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV-RNA. Virological response \nby week 4 is defined as at least 1-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV-RNA. These \ntime points (treatment week 4 and treatment week 12) have been shown to be predictive for sustained \nresponse (Table 12).\n\nTable 12 Predictive value of in-treatment Virologic Response while on PegIntron \n1.5 \u00b5g/kg/ribavirin 800-1,400 mg combination therapy\n\nNegative Positive\nNo \n\nresponse \nat \n\ntreatment \nweek\n\nNo \nsustained \nresponse\n\nNegative \npredictive \n\nvalue\n\nResponse \nat \n\ntreatment \nweek\n\nSustained \nresponse\n\nPositive \npredictive \n\nvalue\nGenotype 1*\n\nBy week 4***\n(n=950)\nHCV-RNA negative 834 539 65 %\n\n(539/834)\n116 107 92 %\n\n(107/116)\n\nHCV-RNA negative\nor\n\n\u2265 1 log decrease \nin viral load\n\n220 210 95 %\n(210/220)\n\n730 392 54 %\n(392/730)\n\nBy week 12***\n(n=915)\nHCV-RNA negative 508 433 85 %\n\n(433/508)\n407 328 81 %\n\n(328/407)\n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nNegative Positive\nNo \n\nresponse \nat \n\ntreatment \nweek\n\nNo \nsustained \nresponse\n\nNegative \npredictive \n\nvalue\n\nResponse \nat \n\ntreatment \nweek\n\nSustained \nresponse\n\nPositive \npredictive \n\nvalue\nHCV-RNA negative\n\nor\n\u2265 2 log decrease in \n\nviral load\n\n206 205 N/A\u2020 709 402 57 %\n(402/709)\n\nGenotype 2, 3**\n\nBy week 12\n(n= 215)\n\nHCV-RNA negative \nor \n\n\u2265 2 log decrease in \nviral load\n\n2 1 50 %\n(1/2)\n\n213 177 83 %\n(177/213)\n\n*Genotype 1 receive 48 weeks treatment\n**Genotype 2, 3 receive 24 weeks treatment\n***The presented results are from a single point of time.

The response to treatment \nin both of these trials is presented in Table 13. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, \nmulticentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who \nwere co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either PegIntron (1.5 \u00b5g/kg/week) \nplus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for \n48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre \nstudy that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were \nco-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either PegIntron (100 or 150 \u00b5g/week \nbased on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU \nTIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with \na follow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load \n< 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period. \n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\nTable 13 Sustained virological response based on genotype after PegIntron in combination \nwith Ribavirin in HCV/HIV Co-infected patients\n\nStudy 11 Study 22\n\nPegIntron \n(1.5 \u00b5g/kg/\n\nweek) + \nribavirin \n(800 mg)\n\nInterferon \nalfa-2b \n\n(3 MIU TIW) + \nribavirin \n(800 mg)\n\np \nvaluea\n\nPegIntron \n(100 or \n\n150c \u00b5g/week) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800-\n1,200 mg)d\n\nInterferon \nalfa-2b \n\n(3 MIU TIW) \n+ ribavirin \n\n(800-\n1,200 mg)d\n\np \nvalueb\n\nAll 27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017\nGenotype 1, \n\n4\n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007\n\nGenotype 2, \n3\n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730\n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week.\na: p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test.\nb: p value based on chi-square test.\nc: subjects < 75 kg received 100 \u00b5g/week PegIntron and subjects \u2265 75 kg received 150 \u00b5g/week PegIntron.\nd: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg.\n\n1Carrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

Both the Metavir score and Ishak grade decreased among \nsubjects treated with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin. This decline was significant among \nresponders (-0.3 for Metavir and -1.2 for Ishak) and stable (-0.1 for Metavir and -0.2 for Ishak) among \nnon-responders. In terms of activity, about one-third of sustained responders showed improvement and \nnone showed worsening. There was no improvement in terms of fibrosis observed in this study. Steatosis \nwas significantly improved in patients infected with HCV Genotype 3.\n\nPegIntron/ribavirin retreatment of prior treatment failures\nIn a non-comparative trial, 2,293 patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous \ntreatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin were retreated with PegIntron, \n1.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin. \nFailure to prior therapy was defined as relapse or non-response (HCV-RNA positive at the end of a \nminimum of 12 weeks of treatment).\n\nPatients who were HCV-RNA negative at treatment week 12 continued treatment for 48 weeks and \nwere followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. Response week 12 was defined as undetectable \nHCV-RNA after 12 weeks of treatment. Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) is defined as \nundetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment (Table 14).\n\n \n\n\n\n30\n\nTable 14 Rates of response to retreatment in prior treatment failures\nPatients with undetectable HCV\u2013RNA \n\nat treatment week 12 and SVR upon retreatment\n\ninterferon alpha/ribavirin peginterferon alpha/ribavirin\nOverall \n\npopulation*\nResponse \nweek 12 % \n(n/N)\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99% CI\n\nResponse \nweek 12 % \n(n/N)\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99% CI\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99 % CI\n\nOverall 38.6 \n(549/1,423)\n\n59.4 \n(326/549)\n54.0,64.8\n\n31.5 \n(272/863)\n\n50.4 \n(137/272)\n42.6, 58.2\n\n21.7 \n(497/2,293)\n19.5, 23.9\n\nPrior response\n  Relapse 67.7 (203/300) 59.6 \n\n(121/203)\n50.7, 68.5\n\n58.1 \n(200/344)\n\n52.5 \n(105/200)\n43.4, 61.6\n\n37.7 (243/645)\n32.8, 42.6\n\n     Genotype 1/4 59.7 (129/216) 51.2 (66/129)\n39.8, 62.5\n\n48.6 \n(122/251)\n\n44.3 (54/122)\n32.7, 55.8\n\n28.6 (134/468)\n23.3, 34.0\n\n     Genotype 2/3 88.9 (72/81) 73.6 (53/72)\n(60.2, 87.0)\n\n83.7 (77/92) 64.9 (50/77)\n50.9, 78.9\n\n61.3 (106/173)\n51.7, 70.8\n\n  NR 28.6 (258/903) 57.0 \n(147/258)\n49.0, 64.9\n\n12.4 (59/476) 44.1 (26/59)\n27.4, 60.7\n\n13.6 \n(188/1,385)\n11.2, 15.9\n\n     Genotype 1/4 23.0 (182/790) 51.6 (94/182)\n42.1, 61.2\n\n9.9 (44/446) 38.6 (17/44)\n19.7, 57.5\n\n9.9 (123/1,242)\n7.7, 12.1\n\n     Genotype 2/3 67.9 (74/109) 70.3 (52/74)\n56.6, 84.0\n\n53.6 (15/28) 60.0 (9/15)\n27.4, 92.6\n\n46.0 (63/137)\n35.0, 57.0\n\nGenotype\n    1 30.2 \n\n(343/1,135)\n51.3 \n(176/343)\n44.4, 58.3\n\n23.0 \n(162/704)\n\n42.6 (69/162)\n32.6, 52.6\n\n14.6 \n(270/1,846)\n12.5, 16.7\n\n    2/3 77.1 (185/240) 73.0 \n(135/185)\n64.6, 81.4\n\n75.6 (96/127) 63.5 (61/96)\n50.9, 76.2\n\n55.3 (203/367)\n48.6, 62.0\n\n     4 42.5 (17/40) 70.6 (12/17)\n42.1, 99.1\n\n44.4 (12/27) 50.0 (6/12)\n12.8, 87.2\n\n28.4 (19/67)\n14.2, 42.5\n\nMETAVIR \nFibrosis score\n    F2 46.0 (193/420) 66.8 \n\n(129/193)\n58.1, 75.6\n\n33.6 (78/232) 57.7 (45/78)\n43.3, 72.1\n\n29.2 (191/653)\n24.7, 33.8\n\n    F3 38.0 (163/429) 62.6 \n(102/163)\n52.8, 72.3\n\n32.4 (78/241) 51.3 (40/78)\n36.7, 65.9\n\n21.9 (147/672)\n17.8, 26.0\n\n    F4 33.6 (192/572) 49.5 (95/192)\n40.2, 58.8\n\n29.7 \n(116/390)\n\n44.8 (52/116)\n32.9, 56.7\n\n16.5 (159/966)\n13.4, 19.5\n\nBaseline Viral \nLoad\nHVL \n(>600,000 IU/ml)\n\n32.4 (280/864) 56.1 \n(157/280)\n48.4, 63.7\n\n26.5 \n(152/573)\n\n41.4 (63/152)\n31.2, 51.7\n\n16.6 \n(239/1,441)\n14.1, 19.1\n\nLVL\n(\u2264600,000 IU/ml)\n\n48.3 (269/557) 62.8 \n(169/269)\n55.2, 70.4\n\n41.0 \n(118/288)\n\n61.0 (72/118)\n49.5, 72.6\n\n30.2 (256/848)\n26.1, 34.2\n\nNR: Non-responder defined as serum/plasma HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.\nPlasma HCV-RNA is measured with a research-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay by a central laboratory\n*Intent to treat population includes 7 patients for whom at least 12 weeks of prior therapy could not be confirmed.\n\n \n\n\n\n31\n\nOverall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at \nweek 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 IU/ml). In this \nsubgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. For patients with prior \nfailure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at week 12, the \nsustained response rates were 59 % and 50 %, respectively. Among 480 patients with > 2 log viral \nreduction but detectable virus at week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy. In those patients \nthe SVR was 12 %. \n\nNon-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a \nweek 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin \n(12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). However, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in SVR \nregardless of prior treatment or prior response.\n\nLong-term efficacy data-Adults\nA large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with PegIntron \n(with or without ribavirin). The purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained \nvirologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. \n327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained \nresponders relapsed during the study.\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % \n(95 % CI: 98-100 %). SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with PegIntron (with or without ribavirin) \nresults in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical \n\u201ccure\u201d from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in \npatients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety \u2013 paediatric population\nChildren and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \nHCV-RNA were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus \nPegIntron 60 \uf06dg/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and baseline viral load. \nAll patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 107 patients received \ntreatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV Genotype 1 and 63 % \n< 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate \nhepatitis C. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential \nfor undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of PegIntron with ribavirin needs to be \ncarefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). The study results are \nsummarized in Table 15.\n\nTable 15 Sustained virological response rates (na,b (%)) in previously untreated children and \nadolescents by genotype and treatment duration \u2013 All subjects n = 107\n\n24 weeks 48 weeks\nAll Genotypes 26/27 (96 %) 44/80 (55 %)\nGenotype 1 - 38/72 (53 %)\nGenotype 2 14/15 (93 %) -\nGenotype 3c 12/12 (100 %) 2/3 (67 %)\nGenotype 4 - 4/5 (80 %)\n\na: Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment lower limit of \ndetection=125IU/ml\n\nb: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration.\nc: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) were to receive 24 weeks of treatment while those with \n\ngenotype 3 and high viral load (\u2265 600,000 IU/ml) were to receive 48 weeks of treatment.\n\nLong-term efficacy data - paediatric population\nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 94 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \npatients after treatment in a multicentre trial. Of these, sixty-three were sustained responders. The \npurpose of the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment with 24 or 48 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin \n\n \n\n\n\n32\n\ntreatment. At the end of 5 years, 85 % (80/94) of all enrolled subjects and 86 % (54/63) of sustained \nresponders completed the study. No paediatric subjects with SVR had relapsed during the 5 years of \nfollow-up.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nPegIntron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (\u201cpegylated\u201d) derivative of interferon \nalfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. The plasma half-life of PegIntron \nis prolonged compared with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. PegIntron has a potential to depegylate to \nfree interferon alfa-2b. The biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but \nweaker than free interferon alfa-2b.\n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours \npost-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.\n\nPegIntron Cmax and AUC measurements increase in a dose-related manner. Mean apparent volume of \ndistribution is 0.99 l/kg.\n\nUpon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. There is, however, only a \nmodest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay. \n\nMean (SD) PegIntron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent \nclearance of 22.0 ml/hr/kg. The mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been \nfully elucidated. However, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of \nPegIntron apparent clearance.\n\nRenal impairment\nRenal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of PegIntron. In a single dose study \n(1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, Cmax, AUC, and half-life increased in \nrelation to the degree of renal impairment.\n\nFollowing multiple dosing of PegIntron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week \nfor four weeks) the clearance of PegIntron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with \nsevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal \nrenal function. Based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal \nimpairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. The dose of PegIntron \nfor monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with \nPegIntron in combination with ribavirin (bitherapy or tritherapy) (see section 4.3).\n\nBecause of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that \npatients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with PegIntron (see \nsection 4.2)\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of PegIntron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic \ndysfunction.\n\nElderly (\uf0b3 65 years of age)\nThe pharmacokinetics of PegIntron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were \nnot affected by age. The data suggest that no alteration in PegIntron dosage is necessary based on \nadvancing age.\n\nPaediatric population\nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for PegIntron and ribavirin (capsules and oral solution) in \nchildren and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis C have been evaluated during a clinical study. \n\n \n\n\n\n33\n\nIn children and adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing of PegIntron at \n60 \uf06dg/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted \nto be 58 % (90 % CI: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 1.5 \uf06dg/kg/week.\n\nInterferon neutralising factors\nInterferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received PegIntron \nin the clinical trial. Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the antiviral activity of \ninterferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who received \nPegIntron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.\n\nTransfer into seminal fluid\nSeminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal fluid is \napproximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female \npartner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely \nlimited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nPegIntron\nAdverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. These \nstudies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most \nmonkeys.\n\nReproduction studies of PegIntron have not been performed. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an \nabortifacient in primates. PegIntron is likely to also cause this effect. Effects on fertility have not been \ndetermined. It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into \nexperimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). \nPegIntron showed no genotoxic potential.\n\nThe relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG), which is liberated from \nPegIntron by metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity \nstudies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro \nmutagenicity assays.\n\nPegIntron plus ribavirin\nWhen used in combination with ribavirin, PegIntron did not cause any effects not previously seen with \neither active substance alone. The major treatment-related change was a reversible, mild to moderate \nanaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either active substance alone.\n\nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with PegIntron \non growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. Preclinical juvenile toxicity results have \ndemonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin \n(see section 5.3 of Rebetol SmPC if PegIntron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nAdults (tritherapy)\nPegIntron in combination with ribavirin and boceprevir (tritherapy) is indicated for the treatment of \nchronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 infection in adult patients (18 years of age and older) with \ncompensated liver disease who are previously untreated or who have failed previous therapy (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nPlease refer to the ribavirin and boceprevir Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPCs) when \nPegIntron is to be used in combination with these medicines.\n\nAdults (bitherapy and monotherapy)\nPegIntron is indicated for the treatment of adult patients (18 years of age and older) with CHC who are \npositive for hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV-RNA), including patients with compensated cirrhosis and/or \nco-infected with clinically stable HIV (see section 4.4). \n\nPegIntron in combination with ribavirin (bitherapy) is indicated for the treatment of CHC infection in \nadult patients who are previously untreated including patients with clinically stable HIV co-infection \nand in adult patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or \nnonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1). \n\nInterferon monotherapy, including PegIntron, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or \ncontraindication to ribavirin.\n\nPlease refer to the ribavirin SmPC when PegIntron is to be used in combination with ribavirin. \n\nPaediatric population (bitherapy)\nPegIntron is indicated in a combination regimen with ribavirin for the treatment of children 3 years of \nage and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, previously untreated, without liver \ndecompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA.\n\nWhen deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination \ntherapy induced a growth inhibition that may be irreversible in some patients. The decision to treat \nshould be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).\n\nPlease refer to the ribavirin SmPC for capsules or oral solution when PegIntron is to be used in \ncombination with ribavirin. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated and monitored only by a physician experienced in the management of \npatients with hepatitis C.\n\nPosology\nPegIntron should be administered as a once weekly subcutaneous injection. The dose administered in \nadults depends on whether it is used in combination therapy (bitherapy or tritherapy) or as \nmonotherapy.\n\nPegIntron combination therapy (bitherapy or tritherapy)\nBitherapy (PegIntron with ribavirin): applies to all adult and paediatric patients 3 years of age and \nolder.\nTritherapy (PegIntron with ribavirin and boceprevir): applies to adult patients with genotype 1 CHC.\n\n \n\n\n\n39\n\nAdults \u2013 Dose to be administered\n\nPegIntron 1.5 micrograms/kg/week in combination with ribavirin capsules.\n\nThe intended dose of 1.5 \u00b5g/kg of PegIntron to be used in combination with ribavirin may be \ndelivered in weight categories with the PegIntron strengths according to Table 1. Ribavirin capsules \nare to be administered orally each day in two divided doses with food (morning and evening).\n\nTable 1 Dosing for combination therapy*\nBody weight \n\n(kg)\nPegIntron Ribavirin capsules\n\nPegIntron strength\n(\u00b5g/0.5 ml)\n\nAdminister once \nweekly\n\n(ml)\n\nTotal daily \nribavirin dose \n\n(mg)\n\nNumber of \ncapsules \n(200 mg)\n\n< 40 50 0.5 800 4a\n\n40-50 80 0.4 800 4a\n\n51-64 80 0.5 800 4a\n\n65-75 100 0.5 1,000 5b\n\n76-80 120 0.5 1,000 5b\n\n81-85 120 0.5 1,200 6c\n\n86-105 150 0.5 1,200 6c\n\n> 105 150 0.5 1,400 7d\n\na: 2 morning, 2 evening\nb: 2 morning, 3 evening\nc: 3 morning, 3 evening\nd: 3 morning, 4 evening\n* Refer to the SmPC of boceprevir for details about the dose of boceprevir to be administered in tritherapy.\n\nAdults - Duration of treatment \u2013 Na\u00efve patients\nTritherapy: Refer to the SmPC for boceprevir.\n\nBitherapy: Predictability of sustained virological response - Patients infected with virus genotype 1 \nwho fail to achieve undetectable HCV-RNA or demonstrate adequate virological response at week 4 \nor 12 are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders and should be evaluated for \ndiscontinuation (see also section 5.1).\n\uf0b7 Genotype 1: \n\n- Patients who have undetectable HCV-RNA at treatment week 12, treatment should be \ncontinued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks). \n- Patients with detectable but \u2265 2 log decrease in HCV-RNA level from baseline at treatment \nweek 12 should be reassessed at treatment week 24 and, if HCV-RNA is undetectable, they \nshould continue with full course of therapy (i.e. a total of 48 weeks). However, if HCV-RNA is \nstill detectable at treatment week 24, discontinuation of therapy should be considered.\n- In the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) who \nbecome HCV-RNA negative at treatment week 4 and remain HCV-RNA negative at week 24, \nthe treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an \nadditional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration). However, an overall 24 weeks \ntreatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment \nduration (see section 5.1).\n\n\uf0b7 Genotypes 2 or 3: \nIt is recommended that all patients be treated with bitherapy for 24 weeks, except for HCV/HIV \nco-infected patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment.\n\n\uf0b7 Genotype 4: \nIn general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study \ndata (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment with bitherapy as for \ngenotype 1.\n\n \n\n\n\n40\n\nAdults - Duration of treatment - HCV/HIV co-infection\nBitherapy: The recommended duration of treatment for HCV/HIV co-infected patients is 48 weeks \nwith bitherapy, regardless of genotype.\n\nPredictability of response and non-response in HCV/HIV co-infection - Early virological response by \nweek 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV-RNA, has been shown \nto be predictive for sustained response. The negative predictive value for sustained response in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients treated with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin was 99 % (67/68; \nStudy 1) (see section 5.1). A positive predictive value of 50 % (52/104; Study 1) was observed for \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving bitherapy.\n\nAdults - Duration of treatment - Retreatment\nTritherapy: Refer to the SmPC for boceprevir.\n\nBitherapy: Predictability of sustained virological response - All patients, irrespective of genotype, who \nhave demonstrated serum HCV-RNA below the limits of detection at week 12 should receive \n48 weeks of bitherapy. Retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response (i.e. HCV-RNA \nbelow the limits of detection) at week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after \n48 weeks of therapy (see also section 5.1).\nRetreatment duration greater than 48 weeks in non-responder patients with genotype 1 has not been \nstudied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy. \n\nPaediatric population (bitherapy only) \u2013 Dose to be administered\nDosing for children 3 years of age and older and adolescent patients is determined by body surface \narea for PegIntron and by body weight for ribavirin. The recommended dose of PegIntron is \n60 \uf06dg/m2/week subcutaneously in combination with ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day orally in two divided \ndoses with food (morning and evening).\n\nPaediatric population (bitherapy only) - Duration of treatment \n\uf0b7 Genotype 1: \n\nThe recommended duration of treatment with bitherapy is 1 year. By extrapolation from clinical \ndata on combination therapy with standard interferon in paediatric patients (negative predictive \nvalue 96 % for interferon alfa\u20132b/ribavirin), patients who fail to achieve virological response at \n12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders. Therefore, it is \nrecommended that children and adolescent patients receiving PegIntron/ribavirin combination \nbe discontinued from therapy if their week 12 HCV-RNA dropped < 2 log10 compared to \npretreatment or if they have detectable HCV-RNA at treatment week 24.\n\n\uf0b7 Genotype 2 or 3: \nThe recommended duration of treatment with bitherapy is 24 weeks.\n\n\uf0b7 Genotype 4: \nOnly 5 children and adolescents with Genotype 4 were treated in the PegIntron/ribavirin clinical \ntrial. The recommended duration of treatment with bitherapy is 1 year. It is recommended that \nchildren and adolescent patients receiving PegIntron/ribavirin combination be discontinued \nfrom therapy if their week 12 HCV-RNA dropped < 2 log10 compared to pretreatment or if they \nhave detectable HCV-RNA at treatment week 24.\n\nPegIntron monotherapy \u2013 Adults\nDose to be administered\nAs monotherapy the PegIntron regimen is 0.5 or 1.0 \u00b5g/kg/week. The lowest PegIntron strength \navailable is 50 \u00b5g/0.5 ml; therefore for patients prescribed 0.5 \u00b5g/kg/week, doses must be adjusted by \nvolume as shown in Table 2. For the 1.0 \u00b5g/kg dose, similar volume adjustments can be made or \nalternate strengths can be used as shown in Table 2. PegIntron monotherapy was not studied in \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients.\n\n \n\n\n\n41\n\nTable 2 Monotherapy dosing\n0.5 \u00b5g/kg 1.0 \u00b5g/kg\n\nBody weight \n(kg)\n\nPegIntron \nstrength\n\n(\u00b5g/0.5 ml)\n\nAdminister once \nweekly\n\n(ml)\n\nPegIntron \nstrength\n\n(\u00b5g/0.5 ml)\n\nAdminister once \nweekly\n\n(ml)\n30-35 50* 0.15 80 0.2\n36-45 50 0.2 50 0.4\n46-56 50 0.25 50 0.5\n57-72 80  0.2 80 0.4\n73-88 50  0.4 80 0.5\n89-106 50 0.5 100 0.5\n107-120** 80 0.4 120 0.5\nMinimum delivery for pen is 0.2 ml.\n* Must use vial.\n** For patients > 120 kg, the PegIntron dose should be calculated based on the individual patient weight. This may require \n\ncombinations of various PegIntron dose strengths and volumes.\n\nDuration of treatment\nFor patients who exhibit virological response at week 12, treatment should be continued for at least \nanother three-month period (i.e., a total of six months). The decision to extend therapy to one year of \ntreatment should be based on prognostic factors (e.g., genotype, age > 40 years, male gender, bridging \nfibrosis).\n\nDose modification for all patients (monotherapy and combination therapy)\nIf severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop during treatment with PegIntron \nmonotherapy or combination therapy, the dosages of PegIntron and/or ribavirin must be modified as \nappropriate, until the adverse reactions abate. Dose reduction of boceprevir is not recommended. \nBoceprevir must not be administered in the absence of PegIntron and ribavirin.\nAs adherence might be of importance for outcome of therapy, the dose of PegIntron and ribavirin should \nbe kept as close as possible to the recommended standard dose. Guidelines were developed in clinical \ntrials for dose modification.\n\nCombination therapy dose reduction guidelines\n\nTable 2a Dose modification guidelines for combination therapy based on laboratory \nparameters\n\nLaboratory values Reduce only ribavirin \ndaily dose (see note 1) \n\nif:\n\nReduce only PegIntron\ndose (see note 2) if:\n\nDiscontinue\ncombination therapy \n\nif:\nHaemoglobin \u2265 8.5 g/dl, and \n\n< 10 g/dl\n- < 8.5 g/dl\n\nAdults: Haemoglobin \nin Patients with history \nof stable cardiac \ndisease\n\nChildren and \nadolescents: not \napplicable\n\n\uf0b3 2 g/dl decrease in haemoglobin during any\nfour week period during treatment\n\n(permanent dose reduction)\n\n< 12 g/dl after four \nweeks of dose \n\nreduction\n\nLeukocytes - \u2265 1.0 x 109/l, and \n< 1.5 x 109/l\n\n< 1.0 x 109/l\n\nNeutrophils - \u2265 0.5 x 109/l, and \n< 0.75 x 109/l\n\n< 0.5 x 109/l\n\n \n\n\n\n42\n\nLaboratory values Reduce only ribavirin \ndaily dose (see note 1) \n\nif:\n\nReduce only PegIntron\ndose (see note 2) if:\n\nDiscontinue\ncombination therapy \n\nif:\nPlatelets - \u2265 25 x 109/l, and \n\n< 50 x 109/l (adults)\n\u2265 50 x 109/l, and \n\n<70 x 109/l (children and \nadolescents)\n\n< 25 x 109/l (adults)\n< 50 x 109/l (children \n\nand adolescents)\n\nBilirubin \u2013 direct - - 2.5 x ULN*\n\nBilirubin \u2013 indirect > 5 mg/dl - > 4 mg/dl\n(for > 4 weeks)\n\nSerum Creatinine - - > 2.0 mg/dl\nCreatinine Clearance - - Discontinue ribavirin \n\nif CrCL < 50ml/min\nAlanine \naminotransferase\n(ALT)\n\nor\nAspartate \naminotransferase\n(AST)\n\n- - 2 x baseline and\n> 10 x ULN*\n\n2 x baseline and\n> 10 x ULN*\n\n* Upper limit of normal\n\nNote 1: In adult patients 1st dose reduction of ribavirin is by 200 mg/day (except in patients receiving \nthe 1,400 mg, dose reduction should be by 400 mg/day).

Patients whose dose of ribavirin is reduced to \n600 mg daily receive one 200 mg capsule in the morning and two 200 mg capsules in the \nevening. \nIn children and adolescent patients 1st dose reduction of ribavirin is to 12 mg/kg/day, 2nd dose \nreduction of ribavirin is to 8 mg/kg/day.\n\nNote 2: In adult patients 1st dose reduction of PegIntron is to 1 \u00b5g/kg/week. If needed, 2nd dose \nreduction of PegIntron is to 0.5 \u00b5g/kg/week. For patients on PegIntron monotherapy: refer to \nmonotherapy dose reduction guidelines section for dose reduction. \nIn children and adolescent patients 1st dose reduction of PegIntron is to 40 \uf06dg/m2/week, 2nd\n\ndose reduction of PegIntron is to 20 \uf06dg/m2/week.\n\nDose reduction of PegIntron in adults may be accomplished by reducing the prescribed volume or by \nutilizing a lower dose strength as shown in Table 2b. Dose reduction of PegIntron in children and \nadolescents is accomplished by modifying the recommended dose in a two-step process from the \noriginal starting dose of 60 \uf06dg/m2/week, to 40 \uf06dg/m2/week, then to 20 \uf06dg/m2/week, if needed.\n\n \n\n\n\n43\n\nTable 2b Two-step dose reduction of PegIntron in combination therapy in adults\n\nFirst dose reduction to PegIntron 1 \u00b5g/kg Second dose reduction to PegIntron 0.5 \u00b5g/kg\n\nBody \nweight\n\n(kg)\n\nPegIntron \nstrength \n\n(\u00b5g/0.5 ml)\n\nAmount of\nPegIntron\n\nto \nadminister\n\n(\u00b5g)\n\nVolume of \nPegIntron \n\nto \nadminister\n\n(ml)\n\nBody \nweight\n(kg)\n\nPegIntron \nstrength \n\n(\u00b5g/0.5 ml)\n\nAmount of\nPegIntron\n\nto \nadminister\n\n(\u00b5g)\n\nVolume of \nPegIntron\n\nto \nadminister\n\n(ml)\n\n< 40 50 35 0.35 < 40 50 20 0.2\n\n40 \u2013 50 120\n48\n\n0.2\n40 \u2013 50 50 25 0.25\n\n51 \u2013 64 80 56 0.35 51 \u2013 64 80\n32 0.2\n\n65 \u2013 75 100 70\n0.35\n\n65 \u2013 75 50\n35 0.35\n\n76 \u2013 85 80 80 0.5 76 \u2013 85 120\n48\n\n0.2\n\n86 - 105 120 96 0.4 86 \u2013 105 50 50 0.5\n\n> 105 150 105 0.35 > 105 80 64 0.4\n\nPegIntron monotherapy dose reduction guidelines in adults\n\nDose modification guidelines for adult patients who use PegIntron monotherapy are shown in \nTable 3a.\n\nTable 3a Dose modification guidelines for PegIntron monotherapy in adults based on \nlaboratory parameters\n\nLaboratory values Reduce PegIntron \nto one-half dose if:\n\nDiscontinue PegIntron if:\n\nNeutrophils \u2265 0.5 x 109/l, and < 0.75 x 109/l < 0.5 x 109/l\n\nPlatelets \u2265 25 x 109/l, and < 50 x 109/l < 25 x 109/l\n\nFor adult patients who use 0.5 \uf06dg/kg PegIntron monotherapy, dose reduction may be accomplished by \nreducing the prescribed volume by one-half as shown in Table 3b.\n\nTable 3b Reduced PegIntron dose (0.25 \uf06dg/kg) for the 0.5 \uf06dg/kg monotherapy regimen in \nadults\n\nBody weight\n(kg)\n\nPegIntron strength\n(\uf06dg/0.5 ml)\n\nAmount of PegIntron \nto administer\n\n(\uf06dg)\n\nVolume of PegIntron to \nadminister\n\n(ml)\n30-35 50* 8 0.08\n36-45 50* 10 0.1\n46-56 50* 13 0.13\n57-72 80* 16 0.1\n73-88 50 20 0.2\n\n89-106 50 25 0.25\n107-120** 80 32 0.2\n\nMinimum delivery for pen is 0.2 ml.\n* Must use vial.\n** For patients > 120 kg, the PegIntron dose should be calculated based on the individual patient weight.

This may require \n\ncombinations of various PegIntron dose strengths and volumes.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nMonotherapy\nPegIntron should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. In patients \nwith moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of PegIntron \nshould be reduced by 25 %. Patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance \n15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of PegIntron reduced by 50 %. Data are not available \nfor the use of PegIntron in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2). Patients \nwith severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored. If renal \nfunction decreases during treatment, PegIntron therapy should be discontinued. \n\nCombination therapy\nPatients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with PegIntron in combination \nwith ribavirin (see ribavirin SmPC). When administered in combination therapy, patients with impaired \nrenal function should be more carefully monitored with respect to the development of anaemia.\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe safety and efficacy of PegIntron therapy has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic \ndysfunction, therefore PegIntron must not be used for these patients.\n\nElderly (\uf0b3 65 years of age)\nThere are no apparent age-related effects on the pharmacokinetics of PegIntron. Data from elderly patients \ntreated with a single dose of PegIntron suggest no alteration in PegIntron dose is necessary based on age \n(see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nPegIntron can be used in combination with ribavirin in paediatric patients 3 years of age and older. \n\nMethod of administration\nPegIntron should be administered as a subcutaneous injection. For special handling information see \nsection 6.6. Patients may self-inject PegIntron if their physician determines that it is appropriate and with \nmedical follow-up as necessary.\n\n \n\n\n\n45\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any interferon or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1;\n\n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac disease \nin the previous six months (see section 4.4);\n\n- Severe, debilitating medical conditions;\n- Autoimmune hepatitis or a history of autoimmune disease;\n- Severe hepatic dysfunction or decompensated cirrhosis of the liver;\n- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment;\n- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function;\n- HCV/HIV patients with cirrhosis and a Child-Pugh score \u2265 6.\n- Combination of PegIntron with telbivudine.\n\nPaediatric population\n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation or suicidal attempt.\n\nCombination therapy\nAlso see SmPCs for ribavirin and boceprevir if PegIntron is to be administered in combination therapy \nin patients with chronic hepatitis C.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPsychiatric and Central Nervous System (CNS)\nSevere CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed \nin some patients during PegIntron therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the \n6-month follow-up period. Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against \nothers such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status \nhave been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or \nsymptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these \nundesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate \ntherapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal \nor homicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with PegIntron be discontinued, \nand the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. \n\nPatients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions\nIf treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history \nof severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate \nindividualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.\n- The use of PegIntron in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric \nconditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Among children and adolescents treated with interferon \nalfa-2b in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently \ncompared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after\ntreatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events \n(e.g. depression, emotional lability, and somnolence).\n\nPatients with substance use/abuse\nHCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an \nincreased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders \nwhen treated with alpha interferon. If treatment with alpha interferon is judged necessary in these patients, \nthe presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for other substance use should be carefully \nassessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach \nincluding a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and \nfollow the patient. Patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment \ndiscontinuation. Early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and \nsubstance use is recommended.\n\n \n\n\n\n46\n\nGrowth and development (children and adolescents)\nDuring the course of therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss \nand growth inhibition were common. Long-term data available in children treated with the \ncombination therapy of pegylated interferon/ribavirin are indicative of substantial growth retardation. \nThirty two percent (30/94) of subjects demonstrated > 15 percentile decrease in height-for-age \npercentile 5 years after completion of therapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nCase by case benefit/risk assessment in children \nThe expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for \nchildren and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n- It is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, that \n\nresulted in reduced height in some patients.\n- This risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of \n\ndisease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease \nprogression (such as HIV co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (HCV \ngenotype and viral load).\n\nWhenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the \nrisk of growth inhibition. Although data are limited, no evidence of long-term effects on sexual \nmaturation was noted in the 5-year observational follow-up study.\n\nMore significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some \npatients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications. While these effects are generally \nreversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred \nwith high doses of interferon alpha.\n\nAll patients in the selected chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain \ncases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation. \nCurrent treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to \ncommencing treatment.\n\nAcute hypersensitivity\nAcute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have \nbeen observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy. If such a reaction develops during treatment with \nPegIntron, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical therapy immediately. Transient rashes \ndo not necessitate interruption of treatment.\n\nCardiovascular system\nAs with interferon alfa-2b, adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction \nand/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving PegIntron therapy require close monitoring. It \nis recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken \nprior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually \nrespond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of PegIntron therapy. There are no data \nin children or adolescents with a history of cardiac disease.\n\nHepatic Failure\nPegIntron increases the risk of hepatic decompensation and death in patients with cirrhosis. As with all \ninterferons, discontinue treatment with PegIntron in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation \nmarkers which might indicate liver decompensation. Liver enzymes and hepatic function should be \nclosely monitored in cirrhotic patients.\n\nPyrexia\nWhile pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon \ntherapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.\n\n \n\n\n\n47\n\nHydration\nAdequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing PegIntron therapy since hypotension \nrelated to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons. Fluid \nreplacement may be necessary.\n\nPulmonary changes\nPulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed \nrarely in interferon alpha treated patients. Any patient developing pyrexia, cough, dyspnea or other \nrespiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or \nthere is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if \nappropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and \ntreatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.\n\nAutoimmune disease\nThe development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment \nwith alpha interferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at \nincreased risk. Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be \nevaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also \nsection 4.4 Thyroid changes and section 4.8).\nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic \nhepatitis C treated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting \nthe eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment \nshould be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).\n\nOcular changes\nOphthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, serous retinal detachment, \nand retinal artery or vein occlusion have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha \ninterferons (see section 4.8). All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient \ncomplaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and \ncomplete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations are recommended during PegIntron therapy, \nparticularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or \nhypertension. Discontinuation of PegIntron should be considered in patients who develop new or \nworsening ophthalmological disorders.\n\nThyroid changes\nInfrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with interferon alpha have developed \nthyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Approximately 21 % of children \ntreated with PegIntron/ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid stimulating \nhormone (TSH). Another approximately 2 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. \nPrior to initiation of PegIntron therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality \ndetected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. Determine TSH levels if, during the \ncourse of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the \npresence of thyroid dysfunction, PegIntron treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be \nmaintained in the normal range by medicine. Children and adolescents should be monitored every \n3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH).\n\nMetabolic disturbances\nHypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. \nMonitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.\n\nHCV/HIV Co-infection\nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis\nPatients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be\nat increased risk of developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding PegIntron and \nribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SmPC). \n\n \n\n\n\n48\n\nHepatic decompensation in HCV/HIV co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis\nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic \ndecompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with \nribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. Other baseline factors in co-infected patients that \nmay be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and \nelevated bilirubin serum concentration.\nCo-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely \nmonitored, assessing their Child-Pugh score during treatment. Patients progressing to hepatic \ndecompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the ARV \ntreatment reassessed.\n\nHaematological abnormalities in HCV/HIV co-infected patients\nHCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and HAART may \nbe at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia) compared to HCV mono-infected patients. Although, the majority of them could be managed \nby dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this \npopulation of patients (see section 4.2 and below \u201cLaboratory tests\u201d and section 4.8). \nPatients treated with PegIntron and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk \nof developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5).\n\nPatients with low CD4 counts\nIn patients co-infected with HCV/HIV, limited efficacy and safety data (N = 25) are available in \nsubjects with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/\u00b5l. Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of \npatients with low CD4 counts.\n\nPlease refer to the respective SmPCs of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken \nconcurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product \nand the potential for overlapping toxicities with PegIntron and ribavirin.\n\nHCV/HBV Coinfection\nCases of hepatitis B re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients co-\ninfected with hepatitis B and C viruses treated with interferon. The frequency of such re-activation \nappears to be low.\nAll patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting treatment with interferon for hepatitis C; \npatients co-infected with hepatitis B and C must then be monitored and managed according to current \nclinical guidelines.\n\nDental and periodontal disorders\nDental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients \nreceiving PegIntron and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging \neffect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination \nof PegIntron and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular \ndental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they \nshould be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.\n\nOrgan transplant recipients\nThe safety and efficacy of PegIntron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of \nhepatitis C in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been studied. Preliminary data indicate \nthat interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection. Liver \ngraft rejection has also been reported.\n\nOther\nDue to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of \nPegIntron in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies \nthe potential risk.\n\n \n\n\n\n49\n\nLaboratory tests\nStandard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all \npatients prior to initiating therapy. Acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a guideline prior \nto initiation of PegIntron therapy are:\n\n\uf0b7 Platelets \uf0b3 100,000/mm3\n\n\uf0b7 Neutrophil count \uf0b3 1,500/mm3\n\n\uf0b7 TSH level must be within normal limits\n\nLaboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as \nclinically appropriate. HCV-RNA should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).\n\nLong term maintenance monotherapy\nIt has been demonstrated in a clinical study that peginterferon alfa-2b at low-dose (0.5 \u03bcg/kg/week) is not \neffective in long term maintenance monotherapy (for a mean duration of 2.5 years) for the prevention of \ndisease progression in non responders with compensated cirrhosis. No statistically significant effect on the \ntime to development of the first clinical event (liver decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, death \nand/or liver transplantation) was observed as compared to the absence of treatment. PegIntron should \ntherefore not be used as long term maintenance monotherapy.\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of PegIntron \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase-\nisomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially \n\"sodium-free\".\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nTelbivudine\nA clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon \nalfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination \nis associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these \nevents is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine SmPC). Moreover, the safety and \nefficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not \nbeen demonstrated. Therefore, the combination of PegIntron with telbivudine is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).\n\nMethadone\nIn patients with chronic hepatitis C that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and na\u00efve to \npeginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of PegIntron subcutaneously for 4 weeks \nincreased R-methadone AUC by approximately 15 % (95 % Cl for AUC ratio estimate 103 \u2013 128 %). \nThe clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs \nand symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. Especially in patients on \na high dose of methadone, the risk for QTc prolongation should be considered.\n\nEffect of Peginterferon alfa-2b on Co-administered Medicines\n\nThe potential interaction of peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIntron) on substrates of metabolic enzymes was\nevaluated in 3 multiple-dose clinical pharmacology studies. In these studies, the effects of \nmultiple-dose regimens of peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIntron) were investigated in Hepatitis C subjects \n(1.5 mcg/week) or healthy subjects (1 mcg/week or 3 mcg/week) (Table 4). A clinically significant \npharmacokinetic interaction was not observed between peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIntron) and \ntolbutamide, midazolam or dapsone; therefore, no dosing adjustment is necessary when peginterferon \nalfa-2b (PegIntron) is administered with medicines metabolized by CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and \nN-acetyltransferase. Concomitant administration of peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIntron) with caffeine or \n\n \n\n\n\n50\n\ndesipramine modestly increased the exposure of caffeine and desipramine. When patients are \nadministered PegIntron with medications metabolized by CYP1A2 or CYP2D6, the extent of the \ndecrease in cytochrome P 450 activity is unlikely to have a clinical impact, except with medicines \nwhich have a narrow therapeutic margin (Table 5).\n\nTable 4Effect of Peginterferon alfa-2b on Co-administered Medicines\n\nCo-administered \nMedicine\n\nDose of \npeginterferon \nalfa-2b\n\nStudy Population\n\nGeometric Mean Ratio (Ratio \nwith/without peginterferon \nalfa-2b)\nAUC\n(90% CI)\n\nCmax\n(90% CI)\n\nCaffeine\n(CYP1A2 substrate)\n\n1.5 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nChronic Hepatitis \nC Subjects (N=22)\n\n1.39\n(1.27, 1.51)\n\n1.02\n(0.95, 1.09)\n\n1 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=24)\n\n1.18\n(1.07, 1.31)\n\n1.12\n(1.05, 1.19)\n\n3 mcg/kg/week \n(2 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=13)\n\n1.36 \n(1.25, 1.49)\n\n1.16 \n(1.10, 1.24)\n\nTolbutamide\n(CYP2C9 substrate)\n\n1.5 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nChronic Hepatitis \nC Subjects (N=22)\n\n1.1#\n(0.94, 1.28)\n\nNA\n\n1 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=24)\n\n0.90#\n(0.81, 1.00)\n\nNA\n\n3 mcg/kg/week \n(2 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=13)\n\n0.95\n(0.89, 1.01)\n\n0.99\n(0.92, 1.07)\n\nDextromethorphan \nhydrobromide\n(CYP2D6 and \nCYP3A substrate)\n\n1.5 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nChronic Hepatitis \nC Subjects (N=22)\n\n0.96##\n(0.73, 1.26)\n\nNA\n\n1 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=24)\n\n2.03#\n(1.55, 2.67)\n\nNA\n\nDesipramine\n(CYP2D6 substrate)\n\n3 mcg/kg/week \n(2 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=13)\n\n1.30\n(1.18, 1.43)\n\n1.08\n(1.00, 1.16)\n\nMidazolam\n(CYP3A4 substrate)\n\n1.5 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nChronic Hepatitis \nC Subjects (N=24)\n\n1.07\n(0.91, 1.25)\n\n1.12\n(0.94, 1.33)\n\n1 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=24)\n\n1.07\n(0.99, 1.16)\n\n1.33\n(1.15, 1.53)\n\n3 mcg/kg/week \n(2 weeks)\n\nHealthy Subjects \n(N=13)\n\n1.18\n(1.06, 1.32)\n\n1.24\n(1.07, 1.43)\n\nDapsone\n(N-acetyltransferase \nsubstrate)\n\n1.5 mcg/kg/week \n(4 weeks)\n\nChronic Hepatitis \nC Subjects (N=24)\n\n1.05\n(1.02, 1.08)\n\n1.03\n(1.00, 1.06)\n\n# Calculated from urine data collected over an interval of 48-hours\n## Calculated from urine data collected over an interval of 24-hours\n\n \n\n\n\n51\n\nTable 5 Precautions for co-administration (PegIntron should be administered with care \nwhen co-administered with the following medicines)\n\nMedicines Signs, Symptoms, and Treatment Mechanism and Risk Factors\nTheophylline Co-administration of theophylline \n\nwith the product (PegIntron) may \nincrease the blood concentrations of \ntheophylline.

Pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides in \nvitro. This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs \n(e.g. didanosine or abacavir). Co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended. \nReports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of which some fatal, \nhave been reported (see ribavirin SmPC).\n\n \n\n\n\n52\n\nExacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen \nused to treat HIV, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of \nribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). \nConsideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment \n(ART) regimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with a \nknown history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females\nPegIntron is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception \nduring the treatment.\n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin\nExtreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking \nPegIntron in combination with ribavirin. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective \ncontraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or their \nfemale partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has \nbeen concluded (see ribavirin SmPC).\n\nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in \nprimates. PegIntron is likely to also cause this effect. \nThe potential risk in humans is unknown. PegIntron is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential \nbenefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n\nCombination therapy with ribavirin\nRibavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy, therefore ribavirin therapy \nis contraindicated in women who are pregnant.\n\nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. \nBecause of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be \ndiscontinued prior to initiation of treatment.\n\nFertility\nThere are no data available regarding potential effects of PegIntron treatment on male or female \nfertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPatients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with PegIntron are cautioned to \navoid driving or operating machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nAdults\nTritherapy\nRefer to the SmPC for boceprevir. \n\nBitherapy and monotherapy\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with PegIntron in \ncombination with ribavirin in adults, seen in more than half of the study subjects, were fatigue, \nheadache, and injection site reaction. Additional adverse reactions reported in more than 25 % of \nsubjects included nausea, chills, insomnia, anaemia, pyrexia, myalgia, asthenia, pain, alopecia, \n\n \n\n\n\n53\n\nanorexia, weight decreased, depression, rash and irritability. The most frequently reported adverse \nreactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were manageable without the need for \nmodification of doses or discontinuation of therapy. Fatigue, alopecia, pruritus, nausea, anorexia, \nweight decreased, irritability and insomnia occur at a notably lower rate in patients treated with \nPegIntron monotherapy compared to those treated with combination therapy (see Table 6). \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nThe following treatment-related adverse reactions were reported in adults in clinical trials or through \npost-marketing surveillance in patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2b, including PegIntron \nmonotherapy or PegIntron/ribavirin.

neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were mild (WHO grades 1 or 2). There were some cases \nof more severe neutropenia in patients treated with the recommended doses of PegIntron in combination \nwith ribavirin (WHO grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and WHO grade 4: 13 of 186 [7 %]).\n\nIn a clinical trial, approximately 1.2 % of patients treated with PegIntron or interferon alfa-2b in \ncombination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment. These events \nincluded suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4). \n\nCardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with \npre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy, \nthat may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients \nwithout prior evidence of cardiac disease. \n\nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa products, \nnotably in patients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV-infection, cirrhosis). \nEvents were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with \ninterferon alfa.\n\n \n\n\n\n56\n\nOphthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies \n(including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein occlusion, retinal exudates, \nloss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).\n\nA wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons \nincluding thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated),\nidiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including \nmononeuropathies and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (see also section 4.4).\n\nHCV/HIV co-infected patients\nSummary of the safety profile\nFor HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving PegIntron in combination with ribavirin, other \nundesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the \nlarger studies with a frequency > 5 % were: oral candidiasis (14 %), lipodystrophy acquired (13 %), \nCD4 lymphocytes decreased (8 %), appetite decreased (8 %), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased \n(9 %), back pain (5 %), blood amylase increased (6 %), blood lactic acid increased (5 %), cytolytic \nhepatitis (6 %), lipase increased (6 %) and pain in limb (6 %).\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nMitochondrial toxicity\nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in HIV-positive patients receiving NRTI \nregimen and associated ribavirin for co-HCV infection (see section 4.4).\n\nLaboratory values for HCV/HIV co-infected patients\nAlthough haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more \nfrequently in HCV/HIV co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and \nrarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). Haematological abnormalities \nwere more frequently reported in patients receiving PegIntron in combination with ribavirin when \ncompared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin. In Study 1 (see \nsection 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in 4 % \n(8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of \npatients receiving PegIntron in combination with ribavirin. Anaemia (hemoglobin < 9.4 g/dl) was \nreported in 12 % (23/194) of patients treated with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin.\n\nCD4 lymphocytes decrease\nTreatment with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute \nCD4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in CD4+ cell percentage. The decrease \nin CD4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. The use of PegIntron \nin combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of HIV viraemia \nduring therapy or follow-up. Limited safety data (N= 25) are available in co-infected patients with \nCD4+ cell counts < 200/\u00b5l (see section 4.4).\n\nPlease refer to the respective SmPCs of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken \nconcurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product and \nthe potential for overlapping toxicities with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin.\n\nPaediatric population\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with combination \ntherapy of PegIntron and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % of patients, most commonly \nfor anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. In general, the adverse reactions profile in children and \nadolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern \nregarding growth inhibition. During combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with PegIntron and ribavirin, \ngrowth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced height in some patients (see section 4.4). Weight \nloss and growth inhibition were very common during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean \ndecrease from baseline in weight and height percentile were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, \nrespectively) and growth velocity was inhibited (< 3rd percentile in 70 % of the patients).\n\n \n\n\n\n57\n\nAt the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height \npercentiles were still of 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles respectively, and 20 % of the children \ncontinued to have inhibited growth (growth velocity < 3rd percentile). Ninety-four of 107 subjects \nenrolled in the 5 year long-term follow-up trial. The effects on growth were less in those subjects \ntreated for 24 weeks than those treated for 48 weeks. From pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-\nup among subjects treated for 24 or 48 weeks, height-for-age percentiles decreased 1.3 and \n9.0 percentiles, respectively. Twenty-four percent of subjects (11/46) treated for 24 weeks and 40 % of \nsubjects (19/48) treated for 48 weeks had a > 15 percentile height-for-age decrease from pre-treatment \nto the end of the 5 year long-term follow-up compared to pre-treatment baseline percentile. Eleven \npercent of subjects (5/46) treated for 24 weeks and 13 % of subjects (6/48) treated for 48 weeks were \nobserved to have a decrease from pre-treatment baseline of > 30 height-for-age percentiles to the end \nof the 5 year long-term follow-up. For weight, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up, weight-\nfor-age percentiles decreased 1.3 and 5.5 percentiles among subjects treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, \nrespectively. For BMI, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow-up, BMI-for-age percentiles \ndecreased 1.8 and 7.5 percentiles among subjects treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, respectively.\nDecrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long-term follow-up was most prominent in \nprepubertal age children. The decline of height, weight and BMI Z scores observed during the \ntreatment phase in comparison to a normative population did not fully recover at the end of long-term \nfollow-up period for children treated with 48 weeks of therapy (see section 4.4). \n\nIn the treatment phase of this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia \n(80 %), headache (62 %), neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site erythema \n(29 %). Only 1 subject discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction (thrombocytopenia). The \nmajority of adverse reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in severity. Severe adverse \nreactions were reported in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection site pain (1 %), pain in \nextremity (1 %), headache (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). Important treatment-emergent \nadverse reactions that occurred in this patient population were nervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger \n(2 %), depression/depressed mood (4 %) and hypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received levothyroxine \ntreatment for hypothyroidism/elevated TSH. \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nThe following treatment-related adverse reactions were reported in the study in children and \nadolescent patients treated with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin. These reactions are listed in \nTable 7 by system organ class and frequency (very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data).\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 7 Adverse reactions very commonly, commonly and uncommonly reported in the \nclinical trial in children and adolescent patients treated with PegIntron in \ncombination with ribavirin\n\nInfections and infestations\n\nCommon: Fungal infection, influenza, oral herpes, otitis media, pharyngitis \nstreptococcal, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis\n\nUncommon: Pneumonia, ascariasis, enterobiasis, herpes zoster, cellulitis, urinary tract \ninfection, gastroenteritis\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\n\nVery common: Anaemia, leucopenia, neutropenia\nCommon: Thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy\n\nEndocrine disorders\n\nCommon: Hypothyroidism\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n\nVery common: Anorexia, decreased appetite\n\n \n\n\n\n58\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nCommon: Suicidal ideation\u00a7, suicide attempt\u00a7, depression, aggression, affect lability, \n\nanger, agitation, anxiety, mood altered, restlessness, nervousness, insomnia\n\nUncommon: Abnormal behaviour, depressed mood, emotional disorder, fear, nightmare\nNervous system disorders\nVery common: Headache, dizziness \nCommon: Dysgeusia, syncope, disturbance in attention, somnolence, poor quality \n\nsleep\n\nUncommon: Neuralgia, lethargy, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, psychomotor \nhyperactivity, tremor\n\nEye disorders\nCommon: Eye pain\n\nUncommon: Conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pruritus, keratitis, vision blurred, photophobia\n\nEar and labyrinth disorders\nCommon: Vertigo\n\nCardiac disorders\nCommon: Palpitations, tachycardia\nVascular disorders\nCommon: Flushing\n\nUncommon: Hypotension, pallor\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\n\nCommon: Cough, epistaxis, pharyngolaryngeal pain\n\nUncommon: Wheezing, nasal discomfort, rhinorrhoea\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nVery common: Abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, vomiting, nausea\nCommon: Diarrhoea, aphthous stomatitis, cheilosis, mouth ulceration, stomach \n\ndiscomfort, oral pain\n\nUncommon: Dyspepsia, gingivitis\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nUncommon: Hepatomegaly\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nVery common: Alopecia, dry skin\n\nCommon: Pruritus, rash, rash erythematous, eczema, acne, erythema\n\nUncommon: Photosensitivity reaction, rash maculo-papular, skin exfoliation, \npigmentation disorder, dermatitis atopic, skin discolouration\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nVery common: Myalgia, arthralgia \n\nCommon: Musculoskeletal pain, pain in extremity, back pain\n\nUncommon: Muscle contracture, muscle twitching\nRenal and urinary disorders\n\nUncommon: Proteinuria\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nUncommon: Female: Dysmenorrhoea\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nVery common: Injection site erythema, fatigue, pyrexia, rigors, influenza-like illness, \n\nasthenia, pain, malaise, irritability\n\nCommon: Injection site reaction, injection site pruritus, injection site rash injection \nsite dryness, injection site pain, feeling cold\n\nUncommon: Chest pain, chest discomfort, facial pain\n\n \n\n\n\n59\n\nInvestigations\n\nVery common: Growth rate decrease (height and/or weight decrease for age)\n\nCommon: Blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, thyroglobulin increased\n\nUncommon: Anti-thyroid antibody positive\n\nInjury and poisoning\n\nUncommon: Contusion\n\u00a7class effect of interferon-alfa containing products \u2013 reported with standard interferon therapy in adult and paediatric \npatients; with PegIntron reported in adult patients.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions in children and adolescents\nMost of the changes in laboratory values in the PegIntron/ribavirin clinical trial were mild or \nmoderate. Decreases in haemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, neutrophils and increase in bilirubin \nmay require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from therapy (see section 4.2). While \nchanges in laboratory values were observed in some patients treated with PegIntron used in \ncombination with ribavirin in the clinical trial, values returned to baseline levels within a few weeks \nafter the end of therapy.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDoses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported. The maximum daily dose reported is \n1,200 \u00b5g for one day. In general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving PegIntron are \nconsistent with the known safety profile for PegIntron; however, the severity of the events may be \nincreased. Standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not \nbeen shown to be useful. No specific antidote for PegIntron is available; therefore, symptomatic \ntreatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose. If available, \nprescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (PCC).\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB10.\n\nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an \naverage degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. The average molecular mass is \napproximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.\n\nMechanism of action\nIn vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of PegIntron is derived from its interferon \nalfa-2b moiety.\n\nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. \nStudies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity. However, certain monkey \nspecies, e.g., Rhesus monkeys are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to \nhuman type 1 interferons.\n\nOnce bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that \ninclude the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible \nfor the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-\ninfected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n60\n\nof the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of \nlymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon\u2019s therapeutic \neffects.\n\nRecombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Although the exact \nantiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell \nmetabolism. This action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are \nunable to leave the cell.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nPegIntron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining \nchanges in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2\u20195\u2019-\noligoadenylate synthetase (2\u20195\u2019-OAS), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts. Subjects treated with \nPegIntron showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature. Following single doses of PegIntron \nbetween 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related \nmanner. Neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of \nPegIntron.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety \u2013 Adults\nTritherapy with PegIntron, ribavirin and boceprevir\nRefer to the SmPC for boceprevir.\n\nMonotherapy with PegIntron and bitherapy with PegIntron and ribavirin\nNa\u00efve patients\nTwo pivotal trials have been conducted, one (C/I97-010) with PegIntron monotherapy; the other \n(C/I98-580) with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic \nhepatitis C confirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (> 30 IU/ml), a \nliver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the \nchronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.\n\nIn the PegIntron monotherapy trial, a total of 916 na\u00efve chronic hepatitis C patients were treated with \nPegIntron (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months. In \naddition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million International Units [MIU] three times a \nweek) as a comparator. This study showed that PegIntron was superior to interferon alfa-2b (Table 8).\n\nIn the PegIntron combination trial, 1,530 na\u00efve patients were treated for one year with one of the \nfollowing combination regimens:\n- PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511).\n- PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for \n\n11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514).\n- Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).\n\nIn this trial, the combination of PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly \nmore effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (Table 8), particularly in \npatients infected with Genotype 1 (Table 9). Sustained response was assessed by the response rate six \nmonths after the cessation of treatment.\n\nHCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. \nHowever, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin \nadministered in combination with PegIntron or interferon alfa-2b. In those patients that received \n> 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, \nresponse rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received \uf0a3 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin \n(Table 9), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.\n\n \n\n\n\n61\n\nTable 8 Sustained virological response (% patients HCV negative)\nPegIntron monotherapy PegIntron + ribavirin\n\nTreatment regimen P 1.5 P 1.0 P 0.5 I P 1.5/R P 0.5/R I/R\nNumber of patients 304 297 315 303 511 514 505\nResponse at end of treatment 49 % 41 % 33 % 24 % 65 % 56 % 54 %\nSustained response 23 %* 25 % 18 % 12 % 54 %** 47 % 47 %\nP 1.5 PegIntron 1.5 micrograms/kg\nP 1.0 PegIntron 1.0 microgram/kg\nP 0.5 PegIntron 0.5 microgram/kg\nI Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU \nP 1.5/R PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg) + ribavirin (800 mg)\nP 0.5/R PegIntron (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg)\nI/R Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg)\n* p < 0.001 P 1.5 vs. I\n** p = 0.0143 P 1.5/R vs. I/R\n\nTable 9 Sustained response rates with PegIntron + ribavirin (by ribavirin dose, genotype \nand viral load)\n\nHCV Genotype Ribavirin dose\n(mg/kg)\n\nP 1.5/R P 0.5/R I/R\n\nAll Genotypes All 54 % 47 % 47 %\n\u2264 10.6 50 % 41 % 27 %\n> 10.6 61 % 48 % 47 %\n\nGenotype 1 All 42 % 34 % 33 %\n\u2264 10.6 38 % 25 % 20 %\n> 10.6 48 % 34 % 34 %\n\n   Genotype 1 \n   \u2264 600,000 IU/ml\n\nAll 73 % 51 % 45 %\n\u2264 10.6 74 % 25 % 33 %\n> 10.6 71 % 52 % 45 %\n\n   Genotype 1\n   > 600,000 IU/ml\n\nAll 30 % 27 % 29 %\n\u2264 10.6 27 % 25 % 17 %\n> 10.6 37 % 27 % 29 %\n\nGenotype 2/3 All 82 % 80 % 79 %\n\u2264 10.6 79 % 73 % 50 %\n> 10.6 88 % 80 % 80 %\n\nP 1.5/R PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg) + ribavirin (800 mg) \nP 0.5/R PegIntron (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg)\nI/R Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) \n\nIn the PegIntron monotherapy study, the Quality of Life was generally less affected by \n0.5 microgram/kg of PegIntron than by either 1.0 microgram/kg of PegIntron once weekly or 3 MIU \nof interferon alfa-2b three times a week. \n\nIn a separate trial, 224 patients with genotype 2 or 3 received PegIntron, 1.5 micrograms/kg \nsubcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with ribavirin 800 mg \u20131,400 mg p.o. for 6 months \n(based on body weight, only three patients weighing > 105 kg, received the 1,400 mg dose) \n(Table 10).

The overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50 %. Forty-one \npercent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at week 4 and week 24 of \ntherapy. In this subgroup, there was a 92 % (89/97) sustained virological response rate. The high \nsustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and \nprospectively confirmed (n=48).\nLimited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher \nsustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following \n24 weeks of treatment).\n\nA large randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of treatment for 48 weeks with two \nPegIntron/ribavirin regimens [PegIntron 1.5 \u00b5g/kg and 1 \u00b5g/kg subcutaneously once weekly both in \ncombination with ribavirin 800 to 1,400 mg p.o. daily (in two divided doses)] and \npeginterferon alfa-2a 180 \u00b5g subcutaneously once weekly with ribavirin 1,000 to 1,200 mg p.o. daily \n(in two divided doses) in 3,070 treatment-na\u00efve adults with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1. Response \nto the treatment was measured by Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) which is defined as \nundetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment (see Table 11).\n\nTable 11 Virologic response at treatment week 12, end of treatment response, relapse rate \n*and Sustained Virologic Response (SVR)\n\nTreatment group % (number) of patients\n\nPegIntron 1.5 \u00b5g/kg + \nribavirin\n\nPegIntron 1 \u00b5g/kg + \nribavirin\n\npeginterferon alfa-2a \n180 \u00b5g + ribavirin\n\nUndetectable HCV-\nRNA at treatment \n\nweek 12\n40 (407/1,019) 36 (366/1,016) 45 (466/1,035)\n\nEnd of treatment \nresponse\n\n53 (542/1,019) 49 (500/1,016) 64 (667/1,035)\n\nRelapse 24 (123/523) 20 (95/475) 32 (193/612)\n\nSVR 40 (406/1,019) 38 (386/1,016) 41 (423/1,035)\n\nSVR in patients with \nundetectable HCV-\nRNA at treatment \nweek 12\n\n81 (328/407) 83 (303/366) 74 (344/466)\n\n* (HCV-RNA PCR assay, with a lower limit of quantitation of 27 IU/ml)\nLack of early virologic response by Treatment week 12 (detectable HCV-RNA with a < 2 log10 reduction from baseline) was \na criterion for discontinuation of treatment.\n\n \n\n\n\n63\n\nIn all three treatment groups, sustained virologic response rates were similar. In patients of African \nAmerican origin (which is known to be a poor prognostic factor for HCV eradication), treatment with \nPegIntron (1.5 \u00b5g/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy resulted in a higher sustained virologic response \nrate compared to PegIntron 1 \u00b5g/kg dose. At the PegIntron 1.5 \u00b5g/kg plus ribavirin dose, sustained \nvirologic response rates were lower in patients with cirrhosis, in patients with normal ALT levels, in \npatients with a baseline viral load > 600,000 IU/ml, and in patients > 40 years old. Caucasian patients \nhad a higher sustained virologic response rate compared to the African Americans. Among patients \nwith undetectable HCV-RNA at the end of treatment, the relapse rate was 24 %. \n\nPredictability of sustained virological response \u2013 Na\u00efve patients: Virological response by week 12 is \ndefined as at least 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV-RNA.Virological response \nby week 4 is defined as at least 1-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV-RNA. These \ntime points (treatment week 4 and treatment week 12) have been shown to be predictive for sustained \nresponse (Table 12).\n\nTable 12 Predictive value of in-treatment Virologic Response while on PegIntron \n1.5 \u00b5g/kg/ribavirin 800-1,400 mg combination therapy\n\nNegative Positive\nNo \n\nresponse \nat \n\ntreatment \nweek\n\nNo \nsustained \nresponse\n\nNegative \npredictive \n\nvalue\n\nResponse \nat \n\ntreatment \nweek\n\nSustained \nresponse\n\nPositive \npredictive \n\nvalue\nGenotype 1*\n\nBy week 4***\n(n=950)\nHCV-RNA negative 834 539 65 %\n\n(539/834)\n116 107 92 %\n\n(107/116)\n\nHCV-RNA negative\nor\n\n\u2265 1 log \ndecrease in \nviral load\n\n220 210 95 %\n(210/220)\n\n730 392 54 %\n(392/730)\n\nBy week 12***\n(n=915)\nHCV-RNA negative 508 433 85 %\n\n(433/508)\n407 328 81 %\n\n(328/407)\n\nHCV-RNA negative\nor\n\n\u2265 2 log decrease in \nviral load\n\n206 205 N/A\u2020 709 402 57 %\n(402/709)\n\nGenotype 2, 3**\n\nBy week 12\n(n= 215)\nHCV-RNA negative\n\nor\n\u2265 2 log decrease in \n\nviral load\n\n2 1 50 %\n(1/2)\n\n213 177 83 %\n(177/213)\n\n*Genotype 1 receive 48 weeks treatment\n**Genotype 2, 3 receive 24 weeks treatment\n***The presented results are from a single point of time.

The response to treatment \nin both of these trials is presented in Table 13. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, \nmulticentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who \nwere co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either PegIntron (1.5 \u00b5g/kg/week) \nplus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for \n48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre \nstudy that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were \nco-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either PegIntron (100 or 150 \u00b5g/week \nbased on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU \nTIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight).

Both the Metavir score and Ishak grade decreased among \nsubjects treated with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin. This decline was significant among \nresponders (-0.3 for Metavir and -1.2 for Ishak) and stable (-0.1 for Metavir and -0.2 for Ishak) among \nnon-responders. In terms of activity, about one-third of sustained responders showed improvement and \nnone showed worsening. There was no improvement in terms of fibrosis observed in this study. Steatosis \nwas significantly improved in patients infected with HCV Genotype 3.\n\nPegIntron/ribavirin retreatment of prior treatment failures\nIn a non-comparative trial, 2,293 patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous \ntreatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin were retreated with PegIntron, \n1.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin. \nFailure to prior therapy was defined as relapse or non-response (HCV-RNA positive at the end of a \nminimum of 12 weeks of treatment).\n\n \n\n\n\n65\n\nPatients who were HCV-RNA negative at treatment week 12 continued treatment for 48 weeks and \nwere followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. Response week 12 was defined as undetectable \nHCV-RNA after 12 weeks of treatment. Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) is defined as \nundetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment (Table 14).\n\nTable 14 Rates of response to retreatment in prior treatment failures\nPatients with undetectable HCV\u2013RNA \n\nat treatment week 12 and SVR upon retreatment\n\ninterferon alpha/ribavirin peginterferon alpha/ribavirin\nOverall \n\npopulation*\nResponse \nweek 12 % \n(n/N)\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99% CI\n\nResponse \nweek 12 % \n(n/N)\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99% CI\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99 % CI\n\nOverall 38.6 \n(549/1,423)\n\n59.4 \n(326/549)\n54.0,64.8\n\n31.5 \n(272/863)\n\n50.4 \n(137/272)\n42.6, 58.2\n\n21.7 \n(497/2,293)\n19.5, 23.9\n\nPrior response\n  Relapse 67.7 (203/300) 59.6 \n\n(121/203)\n50.7, 68.5\n\n58.1 \n(200/344)\n\n52.5 \n(105/200)\n43.4, 61.6\n\n37.7 (243/645)\n32.8, 42.6\n\n     Genotype 1/4 59.7 (129/216) 51.2 (66/129)\n39.8, 62.5\n\n48.6 \n(122/251)\n\n44.3 (54/122)\n32.7, 55.8\n\n28.6 (134/468)\n23.3, 34.0\n\n     Genotype 2/3 88.9 (72/81) 73.6 (53/72)\n(60.2, 87.0)\n\n83.7 (77/92) 64.9 (50/77)\n50.9, 78.9\n\n61.3 (106/173)\n51.7, 70.8\n\n  NR 28.6 (258/903) 57.0 \n(147/258)\n49.0, 64.9\n\n12.4 (59/476) 44.1 (26/59)\n27.4, 60.7\n\n13.6 \n(188/1,385)\n11.2, 15.9\n\n     Genotype 1/4 23.0 (182/790) 51.6 (94/182)\n42.1, 61.2\n\n9.9 (44/446) 38.6 (17/44)\n19.7, 57.5\n\n9.9 (123/1,242)\n7.7, 12.1\n\n     Genotype 2/3 67.9 (74/109) 70.3 (52/74)\n56.6, 84.0\n\n53.6 (15/28) 60.0 (9/15)\n27.4, 92.6\n\n46.0 (63/137)\n35.0, 57.0\n\nGenotype\n    1 30.2 \n\n(343/1,135)\n51.3 \n(176/343)\n44.4, 58.3\n\n23.0 \n(162/704)\n\n42.6 (69/162)\n32.6, 52.6\n\n14.6 \n(270/1,846)\n12.5, 16.7\n\n    2/3 77.1 (185/240) 73.0 \n(135/185)\n64.6, 81.4\n\n75.6 (96/127) 63.5 (61/96)\n50.9, 76.2\n\n55.3 (203/367)\n48.6, 62.0\n\n     4 42.5 (17/40) 70.6 (12/17)\n42.1, 99.1\n\n44.4 (12/27) 50.0 (6/12)\n12.8, 87.2\n\n28.4 (19/67)\n14.2, 42.5\n\nMETAVIR \nFibrosis score\n    F2 46.0 (193/420) 66.8 \n\n(129/193)\n58.1, 75.6\n\n33.6 (78/232) 57.7 (45/78)\n43.3, 72.1\n\n29.2 (191/653)\n24.7, 33.8\n\n    F3 38.0 (163/429) 62.6 \n(102/163)\n52.8, 72.3\n\n32.4 (78/241) 51.3 (40/78)\n36.7, 65.9\n\n21.9 (147/672)\n17.8, 26.0\n\n    F4 33.6 (192/572) 49.5 (95/192)\n40.2, 58.8\n\n29.7 \n(116/390)\n\n44.8 (52/116)\n32.9, 56.7\n\n16.5 (159/966)\n13.4, 19.5\n\n \n\n\n\n66\n\nPatients with undetectable HCV\u2013RNA \nat treatment week 12 and SVR upon retreatment\n\ninterferon alpha/ribavirin peginterferon alpha/ribavirin\nOverall \n\npopulation*\nResponse \nweek 12 % \n(n/N)\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99% CI\n\nResponse \nweek 12 % \n(n/N)\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99% CI\n\nSVR % (n/N)\n99 % CI\n\nBaseline Viral \nLoad\nHVL (>600,000 \nIU/ml)\n\n32.4 (280/864) 56.1 \n(157/280)\n48.4, 63.7\n\n26.5 \n(152/573)\n\n41.4 (63/152)\n31.2, 51.7\n\n16.6 \n(239/1,441)\n14.1, 19.1\n\nLVL (\u2264600,000 \nIU/ml)\n\n48.3 (269/557) 62.8 \n(169/269)\n55.2, 70.4\n\n41.0 \n(118/288)\n\n61.0 (72/118)\n49.5, 72.6\n\n30.2 (256/848)\n26.1, 34.2\n\nNR: Non-responder defined as serum/plasma HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.\nPlasma HCV-RNA is measured with a research-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay by a central \nlaboratory\n*Intent to treat population includes 7 patients for whom at least 12 weeks of prior therapy could not be confirmed.\n\nOverall, approximately 36 % (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at \nweek 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 IU/ml). In this \nsubgroup, there was a 56 % (463/823) sustained virological response rate. For patients with prior \nfailure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at week 12, the \nsustained response rates were 59 % and 50 %, respectively. Among 480 patients with > 2 log viral \nreduction but detectable virus at week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy. In those patients \nthe SVR was 12 %. \n\nNon-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a \nweek 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin \n(12.4 % vs. 28.6 %). However, if a week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in SVR \nregardless of prior treatment or prior response.\n\nLong-term efficacy data-Adults\nA large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with PegIntron \n(with or without ribavirin). The purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained \nvirologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. \n327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained \nresponders relapsed during the study.\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99 % \n(95 % CI: 98-100 %). SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with PegIntron (with or without ribavirin) \nresults in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical \n\u201ccure\u201d from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in \npatients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety \u2013 paediatric population\nChildren and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \nHCV-RNA were enrolled in a multicentre trial and treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus \nPegIntron 60 \uf06dg/m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and baseline viral load. \nAll patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 107 patients received \ntreatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV Genotype 1 and 63 % \n< 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate \nhepatitis C. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential \nfor undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of PegIntron with ribavirin needs to be \ncarefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8). The study results are \nsummarized in Table 15.\n\n \n\n\n\n67\n\nTable 15 Sustained virological response rates (na,b (%)) in previously untreated children and \nadolescents by genotype and treatment duration \u2013 All subjects n = 107\n\n24 weeks 48 weeks\nAll Genotypes 26/27 (96 %) 44/80 (55 %)\nGenotype 1 - 38/72 (53 %)\nGenotype 2 14/15 (93 %) -\nGenotype 3c 12/12 (100 %) 2/3 (67 %)\nGenotype 4 - 4/5 (80 %)\n\na: Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment lower limit of \ndetection=125IU/ml\n\nb: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration.\nc: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) were to receive 24 weeks of treatment while those with \n\ngenotype 3 and high viral load (\u2265 600,000 IU/ml) were to receive 48 weeks of treatment.\n\nLong-term efficacy data - paediatric population\nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 94 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \npatients after treatment in a multicentre trial. Of these, sixty-three were sustained responders. The \npurpose of the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment with 24 or 48 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin \ntreatment. At the end of 5 years, 85 % (80/94) of all enrolled subjects and 86 % (54/63) of sustained \nresponders completed the study. No paediatric subjects with SVR had relapsed during the 5 years of \nfollow-up.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nPegIntron is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (\u201cpegylated\u201d) derivative of interferon \nalfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species. The plasma half-life of PegIntron \nis prolonged compared with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. PegIntron has a potential to depegylate to \nfree interferon alfa-2b. The biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but \nweaker than free interferon alfa-2b.\n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours \npost-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.\n\nPegIntron Cmax and AUC measurements increase in a dose-related manner. Mean apparent volume of \ndistribution is 0.99 l/kg.\n\nUpon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons. There is, however, only a \nmodest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay. \n\nMean (SD) PegIntron elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent \nclearance of 22.0 ml/hr/kg. The mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been \nfully elucidated. However, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30 %) of \nPegIntron apparent clearance.\n\nRenal impairment\nRenal clearance appears to account for 30 % of total clearance of PegIntron. In a single dose study \n(1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, Cmax, AUC, and half-life increased in \nrelation to the degree of renal impairment.\n\nFollowing multiple dosing of PegIntron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week \nfor four weeks) the clearance of PegIntron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with \nsevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal \nrenal function. Based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal \nimpairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. The dose of PegIntron \n\n \n\n\n\n68\n\nfor monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with \nPegIntron in combination with ribavirin (bitherapy or tritherapy) (see section 4.3).\n\nBecause of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that \npatients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with PegIntron (see \nsection 4.2)\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of PegIntron have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic \ndysfunction.\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years of age)\nThe pharmacokinetics of PegIntron following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were \nnot affected by age. The data suggest that no alteration in PegIntron dosage is necessary based on \nadvancing age.\n\nPaediatric population\nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for PegIntron and ribavirin (capsules and oral solution) in \nchildren and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis C have been evaluated during a clinical study. \nIn children and adolescent patients receiving body surface area-adjusted dosing of PegIntron at \n60 \uf06dg/m2/week, the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval is predicted \nto be 58 % (90 % CI: 141-177 %) higher than observed in adults receiving 1.5 \uf06dg/kg/week.\n\nInterferon neutralising factors\nInterferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received PegIntron \nin the clinical trial. Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the antiviral activity of \ninterferon. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who received \nPegIntron 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1 %.\n\nTransfer into seminal fluid\nSeminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal fluid is \napproximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female \npartner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely \nlimited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nPegIntron\nAdverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys. These \nstudies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most \nmonkeys.\n\nReproduction studies of PegIntron have not been performed. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an \nabortifacient in primates. PegIntron is likely to also cause this effect. Effects on fertility have not been \ndetermined. It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into \nexperimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation). \nPegIntron showed no genotoxic potential.\n\nThe relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG), which is liberated from \nPegIntron by metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity \nstudies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro \nmutagenicity assays.\n\n \n\n\n\n69\n\nPegIntron plus ribavirin\nWhen used in combination with ribavirin, PegIntron did not cause any effects not previously seen with \neither active substance alone. The major treatment-related change was a reversible, mild to moderate \nanaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either active substance alone.\n\nNo studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with PegIntron \non growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. Preclinical juvenile toxicity results have \ndemonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin \n(see section 5.3 of Rebetol SmPC if PegIntron is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What PegIntron is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use PegIntron\n3. How to use PegIntron\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store PegIntron\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What PegIntron is and what it is used for\n\nThe active substance in this medicine is a protein called peginterferon alfa-2b, which belongs to the \nclass of medicines called interferons. Interferons are made by your body\u2019s immune system to help \nfight infections and severe diseases. This medicine is injected into your body to work with your \nimmune system. This medicine is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, a viral infection of the \nliver.\n\nAdults\nThe combination of this medicine, ribavirin and boceprevir is recommended for use for some types of \nchronic hepatitis C virus infection (also called HCV infection) in adults 18 years of age and older. It may \nbe used in adults who have not been previously treated for HCV infection or who have previously used \nmedicines called interferons and pegylated interferons.\n\nThe combination of this medicine and ribavirin is recommended for adults 18 years of age and older who \nhave not previously been treated with these medicines. This includes adults also infected with clinically \nstable HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). The combination can also be used to treat adults who have \nalready failed treatment with an interferon alpha or peginterferon alpha in combination with ribavirin or \ninterferon alpha alone.\n\nIf you have a medical condition making use of ribavirin dangerous or if you already have had a problem \ntaking it, your doctor will likely prescribe this medicine alone.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThis medicine is used in combination with ribavirin in children 3 years of age and older and \nadolescents who have not been treated previously for chronic hepatitis C.\n\n \n\n\n\n114\n\n2. What you need to know before you use PegIntron\n\nDo not use PegIntron\nYou should tell your doctor before starting treatment if you, or the child you are caring for:\n- are allergic to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n- are allergic to any interferon.\n- have had severe heart problems.\n- have heart disease that has not been well controlled during the past 6 months.\n- have severe medical conditions that leave you very weak.\n- have autoimmune hepatitis or any other problem with your immune system.\n- are taking medicine that suppresses (weakens) your immune system.\n- have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease (other than hepatitis C).\n- have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines.\n- have epilepsy, a condition that causes convulsions (seizures, or \u201cfits\u201d).\n- are being treated with telbivudine (see section \u201cOther medicines and PegIntron\u201d).\n\nYou must not use PegIntron if any of the conditions above should apply to you, or the child you are \ncaring for.\n\nIn addition, children and adolescents must not use this medicine if they have had serious nervous or \nmental problems, such as severe depression or thoughts of suicide.\n\nReminder: Please also read the \u201cDo not take\u201d section of the Package Leaflet for ribavirin and \nboceprevir before using them in combination with this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nSeek medical help immediately in case of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, \nwheezing, or hives).\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking this medicine if you, or the child you are caring for:\n- have had a severe nervous or mental disorder or have a history of substance abuse (e.g. \n\nalcohol or drugs).\nThe use of this medicine in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe \npsychiatric conditions is not allowed (see section \u201cDo not use PegIntron\u201d above).\n\n- are being treated for a mental illness or had treatment in the past for any other nervous or mental \ndisorder, including depression (such as feelings of sadness, dejection) or suicidal or homicidal \nbehaviour (see section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d).\n\n- have ever had a heart attack or a heart problem.\n- have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your kidney \n\nblood values regularly during treatment. If this medicine is used in combination with ribavirin, \nyour doctor should monitor you, or the child you are caring for more carefully for a decrease in \nred blood cell count.\n\n- have cirrhosis or other liver problems (other than hepatitis C).\n- develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough, or \n\nany difficulty in breathing.\n- are diabetic or have high blood pressure, your doctor may ask you, or the child you are caring for \n\nto have an eye examination.\n- have had any serious illness affecting breathing or blood.\n- have the skin disorders, psoriasis or sarcoidosis, which may become worse while you are using \n\nthis medicine.\n- are planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use this \n\nmedicine.\n- have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase the \n\nrisk of rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor.\n- If you are also being treated for HIV (see section \u201cOther medicines and PegIntron\u201d).\n\n \n\n\n\n115\n\n- have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor may want to \nmonitor you more closely.\nReminder: Please read the \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d section of the Package Leaflet for ribavirin \nbefore using it in combination with this medicine.\n\nTeeth and mouth problems have been reported in patients receiving this medicine in combination with \nribavirin. You may develop gum disease, which could lead to loss of teeth. You may develop a dry \nmouth or vomiting, both of which can damage your teeth. It is important to brush your teeth thoroughly\ntwice a day, rinse your mouth out if you vomit, and have regular dental check-ups.\n\nDuring treatment, some patients may experience eye problems, or loss of vision in rare instances. \nYour doctor should carry out an eye examination before starting your treatment. In case of any \nchanges in vision, you must tell your doctor and have a prompt and complete eye examination. If you \nhave a medical condition that may lead to future eye problems (e.g. diabetes or high blood pressure), \nyou should receive regular eye exams during therapy. If your eye disorder becomes more severe or if \nyou develop new eye disorders, your treatment will be discontinued.\n\nWhile being treated with PegIntron, your doctor may advise to drink extra fluids to help prevent low \nblood pressure.\n\nYour doctor will test your blood before you begin therapy and throughout the treatment to make sure \nthat the therapy you are getting is safe and effective.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThis medicine is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 3 years.\n\nOther medicines and PegIntron\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you, or the child you are caring for: \n- are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or vitamins/nutritional supplements, \n\nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.\n- are infected with both Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-positive) and Hepatitis C \n\nVirus (HCV) and are being treated with an anti-HIV medicine(s) \u2013 [nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitor (NRTI), and/or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)]. Your \ndoctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions.\no Taking this medicine in combination with ribavirin and an anti-HIV medicine(s) may \n\nincrease the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities: reduction in \nnumber of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood clotting cells called platelets. \nPatients with advanced liver disease receiving HAART may be at increased risk of \nworsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with this medicine alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin may increase their risk.\n\no With zidovudine or stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these \nmedicines work. Therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the HIV \ninfection is not getting worse. If it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not \nyour ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. Additionally, patients treated with this \nmedicine and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of \ndeveloping anaemia (low number of red blood cells). Therefore the use of zidovudine \nwith this medicine and ribavirin combination therapy is not recommended.\n\nReminder: Please read the \u201cOther medicines\u201d section of the Package Leaflet for ribavirin\nbefore using it in combination with this medicine.\n\n- are taking telbivudine. If you take telbivudine with this medicine or any type of injectable \ninterferon product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling and/or \nburning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. These events may also be more severe. \nTherefore, you must not take this medicine at the same time as telbivudine.\n\n \n\n\n\n116\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nPregnancy\nIn studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect of this \nmedicine on human pregnancy is not known. Girls or women of childbearing potential need to use \neffective birth control during the treatment with this medicine.\n\nRibavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby. Therefore, you and your partner must take special\nprecautions in sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur:\n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age who is taking ribavirin:\nyou must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the \n4 months after treatment is stopped. You must use an effective birth control during the time you are \ntaking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment. This should be discussed with your doctor. \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin:\ndo not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. If your female partner is not \npregnant but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and \nfor the 7 months after treatment has stopped. You or your partner must use an effective birth control \nduring the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This should be \ndiscussed with your doctor.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. Therefore, you should not breast-feed\nan infant if you are taking this medicine. Ask your doctor for advice.\n\nReminder: Please read the \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d section of the Package Leaflet for \nribavirin before using it in combination with this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking this \nmedicine.\n\nPegIntron contains sucrose\nThis medicine contains sucrose. If you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before \ntaking this medicine.\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially \"sodium-free\".\n\n3. How to use PegIntron\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nGeneral information about taking this medicine\n\nYour doctor has determined the correct dose of this medicine based on how much you, or the child \nyou are caring for weighs. If necessary, the dose may be changed during treatment.\n\nThis medicine is intended for subcutaneous use. This means that it is injected through a short injection \nneedle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself, you will be \ninstructed how to prepare and give the injection. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous \nadministration are provided at the end of this leaflet (see section \u201cHow to self-inject \nPegIntron\u201d).\n\nWater for injection and PegIntron powder are provided in separate ampoules. Prepare the dose by \nadding water for injection to PegIntron powder just before you intend to inject it and use it \n\n \n\n\n\n117\n\nimmediately. Look carefully at the solution you prepared before you use it. The solution should be \nclear and colourless. Do not use the solution if it is discoloured (changed its colour from the original) \nor if there are bits of particles in the solution. Discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give \nyourself the injection. For disposal instructions, see section 5 \u201cHow to store PegIntron\u201d.\n\nInject this medicine once each week on the same day. Injecting it at the same time of day each week \nwill help you not to forget to take it.\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Do not exceed the recommended \ndosage, and take it for as long as prescribed.\n\nIf your doctor prescribes this medicine with ribavirin or with ribavirin and boceprevir, please read the \nPackage Leaflets of ribavirin and boceprevir before you begin combination treatment.\n\nUse in adults \u2013 PegIntron in combination treatment\nThis medicine, when given with ribavirin capsules, is usually given at a dose of 1.5 microgram per \nkilogram of body weight once a week. If you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, depending \nupon your kidney function.\n\nUse in adults \u2013 PegIntron alone\nThis medicine, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram per kilogram of \nbody weight once a week, for 6 months to 1 year. If you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, \ndepending upon your kidney function. Your doctor will determine the correct dose for you.\n\nUse in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents\nPegIntron will be given in combination with ribavirin. The dose of PegIntron is determined by a \ncalculation accounting for both height and weight. Your doctor will determine the correct dose for \nyou, or the child you are caring for. The duration of treatment is up to 1 year based on the doctor\u2019s \njudgement for you, or the child you are caring for.\n\nAll patients\nIf you are injecting this medicine yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed is \nclearly provided on the package of medicine you receive.\n\nIf you use more PegIntron than you should\nTell your doctor or healthcare professional or the doctor or healthcare professional of the child you are \ncaring for as soon as possible. \n\nIf you forget to take PegIntron\nTake/administer the dose of this medicine as soon as you remember, but only if within 1-2 days after \nthe forgotten dose. If it is very close to your next injection, do not double the dose to make up for the \nforgotten dose, but continue your treatment as usual.\nIf you are uncertain, contact your doctor or pharmacist or the doctor or pharmacist of the child you are \ncaring for.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Although \nnot all of these side effects may occur, they may need medical attention if they do. When this medicine \nis used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not occurred at all.\n\nPsychiatric and central nervous system:\nSome people get depressed when taking this medicine alone or in combination treatment with \nribavirin, and in some cases people have had thoughts about threatening the life of others, suicidal \nthoughts or aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others). Some patients have actually \ncommitted suicide. Seek emergency care if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have \n\n \n\n\n\n118\n\nsuicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. Ask a family member or close friend to help you stay \nalert to signs of depression or changes in your behaviour.\n\nChildren and adolescents are particularly prone to develop depression when being treated with this \nmedicine and ribavirin.

Do not attempt to \ninject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirements of self-\ninjection. The following instructions explain how to inject this medicine yourself. Please read the \ninstructions carefully and follow them step by step. \n\nPreparation\nCollect the necessary items before you begin:\n- a vial of PegIntron powder for injection;\n- an ampoule of water for injections solvent to prepare PegIntron injection;\n- a 1 ml syringe;\n- a long needle (for example 0.8 \uf0b4 40 mm [21 gauge 1.5 inch]) to be used to add water for \n\ninjections to the PegIntron powder vial;\n- a short needle (for example 0.3 \uf0b4 13 mm [30 gauge 0.5 inch]) for the subcutaneous injection;\n- a cleansing swab.\nWash your hands carefully.\n\nReconstituting PegIntron powder for injection\nBefore reconstitution, this medicine may appear either as a white tablet-shaped solid that is whole or in \npieces, or as a white powder.\nWhen the total amount of solvent is combined with the full amount of PegIntron powder, the solution \nwill be at the correct concentration to measure your dose (i.e., the labelled amount is contained in \n0.5 ml).\nA small volume is lost during preparation of this medicine for injection and when the dose is measured \nand injected. Therefore, each vial contains an extra amount of solvent and PegIntron powder to ensure \ndelivery of the labeled dose in 0.5 ml of PegIntron, solution for injection.\n\n- Remove the protective cap from the PegIntron vial.\n- Clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. You can save the swab to clean the skin area \n\nwhere you will inject the dose.\n- Remove the syringe from the wrapping and do not touch the tip of the syringe.\n- Take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe.\n- Remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in your \n\nhand.\n- Tap the top of the ampoule of solvent gently to make sure that all the liquid is at the bottom of the \n\nampoule.\n- Break off the top of the ampoule of solvent.\n- Insert the needle in the ampoule of solvent and withdraw the total amount of solvent.\n- Then insert the needle through the rubber top of the PegIntron vial. Gently place the needle tip \n\nagainst the glass wall of the vial without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands.\n- Inject the solvent SLOWLY, aiming the stream of liquid at the glass wall of the vial. Do not aim \n\nthe stream directly at the white solid or powder, or inject the liquid quickly, as this causes a greater \namount of bubbles. The solution may appear cloudy or bubbly for a few minutes. This is to be \nexpected and is not a cause for concern.\n\n- Dissolve the entire contents by swirling the PegIntron vial with a gentle rotary motion leaving the \nneedle and attached syringe in the vial.\n\n- Do not shake, but gently turn the vial upside down until any powder at the top of the vial is \ndissolved.\n\n- The contents should now be completely dissolved.\n- Stand the vial upright and let any bubbles present in the solution rise to the top of the solution. \n\nOnce all bubbles have risen to the top of the solution, you should have a clear solution with a small \nring of tiny bubbles around the top. Use this solution immediately. If it cannot be used immediately, \nthe solution may be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.\n\n \n\n\n\n126\n\nMeasuring the dose of PegIntron from the reconstituted powder for injection\nTurn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the PegIntron \nreconstituted solution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger \nslowly to draw just more than the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.\nHold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up. Remove the syringe from the long needle \nleaving the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. Take the short needle and \nplace it firmly on to the tip of the syringe. Remove the needle guard from the syringe needle and check \nfor air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe \ngently, with the needle pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. Push up the plunger slowly back \nto the correct dose. Replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface.\n\nBe sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25\u00b0C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe \nbetween your palms. Inspect visually the reconstituted solution prior to administration: do not use if \ndiscolouration (change in the original colour of the solution) or particulate matter is present. You are \nnow ready to inject the dose.\n\nInjecting the solution\nSelect the injection site. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle. \nThese are thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this \nsite) and abdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer \nsurface of the arm for injection.\nChange your injection site each time.\n\nCleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the \nneedle guard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand, hold the syringe as you \nwould a pencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45\u00b0. After the needle \nis inserted, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel. Pull back the \nplunger very slightly with one hand. If blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood \nvessel. Do not inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure. Inject the solution by \npushing the plunger all the way down gently.\nPull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if \nnecessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If there is bleeding, cover with an \nadhesive bandage.\nThe vial, ampoule and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and \nneedles safely in a closed container.\n\n \n\n\n\n127\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nPegIntron 50 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection in pre-filled pen\nPegIntron 80 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection in pre-filled pen\n\nPegIntron 100 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection in pre-filled pen\nPegIntron 120 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection in pre-filled pen\nPegIntron 150 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection in pre-filled pen\n\npeginterferon alfa-2b\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet.

This medicine is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, a viral infection of the \nliver.\n\nAdults\nThe combination of this medicine, ribavirin and boceprevir is recommended for use for some types of \nchronic hepatitis C virus infection (also called HCV infection) in adults 18 years of age and older. It may \nbe used in adults who have not been previously treated for HCV infection or who have previously used \nmedicines called interferons and pegylated interferons.\n\nThe combination of this medicine and ribavirin is recommended for adults 18 years of age and older who \nhave not previously been treated with these medicines. This includes adults also infected with clinically \nstable HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). The combination can also be used to treat adults who have \nalready failed treatment with an interferon alpha or peginterferon alpha in combination with ribavirin or \ninterferon alpha alone.\n\nIf you have a medical condition making use of ribavirin dangerous or if you already have had a problem \ntaking it, your doctor will likely prescribe this medicine alone.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThis medicine is used in combination with ribavirin in children 3 years of age and older and \nadolescents who have not been treated previously for chronic hepatitis C.\n\n \n\n\n\n128\n\n2.

You may develop gum disease, which could lead to loss of teeth. You may develop a dry \nmouth or vomiting, both of which can damage your teeth. It is important to brush your teeth thoroughly \ntwice a day, rinse your mouth out if you vomit, and have regular dental check-ups.\n\nDuring treatment, some patients may experience eye problems, or loss of vision in rare instances. \nYour doctor should carry out an eye examination before starting your treatment. In case of any \nchanges in vision, you must tell your doctor and have a prompt and complete eye examination. If you \nhave a medical condition that may lead to future eye problems (e.g. diabetes or high blood pressure), \nyou should receive regular eye exams during therapy. If your eye disorder becomes more severe or if \nyou develop new eye disorders, your treatment will be discontinued.\n\nWhile being treated with PegIntron, your doctor may advise to drink extra fluids to help prevent low \nblood pressure.\n\nYour doctor will test your blood before you begin therapy and throughout the treatment to make sure \nthat the therapy you are getting is safe and effective.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThis medicine is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 3 years.\n\nOther medicines and PegIntron\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you, or the child you are caring for: \n- are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or vitamins/nutritional supplements, \n\nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.\n- are infected with both Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-positive) and Hepatitis C \n\nVirus (HCV) and are being treated with an anti-HIV medicine(s) \u2013 [nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitor (NRTI), and/or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)]. Your \ndoctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions.\no Taking this medicine in combination with ribavirin and an anti-HIV medicine(s) may \n\nincrease the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities: reduction in \nnumber of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood clotting cells called platelets. \nPatients with advanced liver disease receiving HAART may be at increased risk of \nworsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with this medicine alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin may increase their risk.\n\no With zidovudine or stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these \nmedicines work. Therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the HIV \ninfection is not getting worse. If it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not \nyour ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. Additionally, patients treated with this \nmedicine and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of \ndeveloping anaemia (low number of red blood cells). Therefore the use of zidovudine \nwith this medicine and ribavirin combination therapy is not recommended.\n\nReminder: Please read the \u201cOther medicines\u201d section of the Package Leaflet for ribavirin\nbefore using it in combination with this medicine.\n\n- are taking telbivudine. If you take telbivudine with this medicine or any type of injectable \ninterferon product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling and/or \nburning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. These events may also be more severe. \nTherefore, you must not take this medicine at the same time as telbivudine.\n\n \n\n\n\n130\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nPregnancy\nIn studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The effect of this \nmedicine on human pregnancy is not known. Girls or women of childbearing potential need to use \neffective birth control during the treatment with this medicine.\n\nRibavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby. Therefore, you and your partner must take special\nprecautions in sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur:\n- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age who is taking ribavirin:\nyou must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the \n4 months after treatment is stopped. You must use an effective birth control during the time you are \ntaking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment. This should be discussed with your doctor. \n- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin:\ndo not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. If your female partner is not \npregnant but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and \nfor the 7 months after treatment has stopped. You or your partner must use an effective birth control \nduring the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This should be \ndiscussed with your doctor.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk.

Please read the \ninstructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your healthcare provider will instruct you on how \nto give the injections. Do not attempt to administer an injection until you are sure you understand how \nto use the pre-filled pen. Each pre-filled pen is for single use only.\n\nGetting ready\n\uf0b7 Find a well-lit, clean flat work surface such as a table.\n\uf0b7 Take the pre-filled pen out of the refrigerator. Look at the date printed on the carton after EXP to \n\nmake sure that the expiration date has not passed. Do not use if the expiration date has passed. \n\uf0b7 Remove the pre-filled pen from the carton.\n\uf0b7 Lay the pre-filled pen on a flat clean surface and wait until it reaches room temperature (but not \n\nmore than 25oC). This may take up to 20 minutes.\n\uf0b7 Wash your hands well with soap and warm water. Keep your work area, your hands, and the \n\ninjection site clean to decrease the risk of infection.\n\nYou will need the following supplies that are included in the package:\n\n- a pre-filled pen (CLEARCLICK)\n- a needle (\"Push-On Needle\")\n- 2 alcohol swabs\n\n            \n\n1. Mix\n\uf0b7 Hold the pre-filled pen upright with the dial on the bottom.\n\uf0b7 Turn the dial to number 1 (see Figure 1). You may hear a \"click\" sound.\n\nWindow\n\nDial\n\nDevice body\n\nNeedle shield\n\n\"Push-On \nNeedle\"\n\n \n\n\n\n140\n\nFigure 1\n\n\uf0b7 DO NOT SHAKE TO MIX. Gently turn the pre-filled pen up-side-down two times to mix (see \nFigure 2).\n\nFigure 2\n\n\uf0b7 Look in the window. The solution should be clear and colourless before use. Some bubbles may be \npresent, but this is normal. Do not use if it is discoloured or if particles are present.\n\n2. Add needle\n\uf0b7 Turn the dial to number 2 (see Figure 3). You may hear a \"click\" sound.\n\nFigure 3\n\n\uf0b7 Wipe the top of the pre-filled pen where the needle is going to be attached with an alcohol swab (see \nFigure 4).\n\nFigure 4\n\n \n\n\n\n141\n\n\uf0b7 Remove the yellow paper from the needle cap before attaching the needle (\"Push-On Needle\") to \nthe pre-filled pen (see Figure 5),\n\nFigure 5\n\n\uf0b7 Support the pre-filled pen in upright position and push the needle straight down firmly (see Figure \n6). You might hear a soft sound when pushing on the needle.\n\nFigure 6\n\n\uf0b7 Remove the needle cap. You may see some liquid trickle out of the needle (see Figure 7). This is \nnormal.\n\nFigure 7\n\n3. Dial dose\n\uf0b7 Turn the dial to your prescribed dose (see Figure 8). You may hear clicking sounds as you dial. \n\nNote: The needle shield will automatically SNAP UP as you dial (see Figure 9). You may dial up \nor down to any dose prior to injection.\n\n          \nFigure 8                                           Figure 9\n\nSNAP!\n\n \n\n\n\n142\n\nYou are ready to inject\n\uf0b7 Choose an injection site on your stomach area (abdomen) or thigh. Avoid your belly button \n\n(navel) and waistline. If you are very thin, you should only use the thigh for injection. You should \nuse a different place each time you give yourself an injection. Do not inject PegIntron into an area \nwhere the skin is irritated, red, bruised, infected, or has scars, stretch marks, or lumps.\n\n\uf0b7 Wipe the injection site with a new alcohol swab. Let the skin air dry.\n\uf0b7 Pinch a fold of loose skin in the area you have cleaned for injection.\n\uf0b7 Press the pre-filled pen against the skin as shown in Figure 10. The shield will automatically glide \n\nback to allow the needle to inject the medicine.\n\uf0b7 Hold the pre-filled pen against the skin for 15 seconds. Note: The pre-filled pen will make a \n\nclicking sound for up to 10 seconds \u2013 depending on your dose. Additional 5 seconds ensures complete \ndose delivery.\nNote: Once the pre-filled pen is removed from the skin, the needle shield will lock in place.\n\nFigure 10: Thigh injection\n\nDisposal of the injection materials\nThe pre-filled pen, needle and all injection materials are intended for single use and must be discarded \nafter the injection. Dispose of the used pre-filled pen safely in a closed container. Ask your healthcare \nprovider or pharmacist for an appropriate container.\n\n15 SEC\n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

current or previous infection with the hepatitis b virus, since your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. reminder: please read the \"warnings and precautions\" section of the package leaflet for ribavirin before using it in combination with this medicine. teeth and mouth problems have been reported in patients receiving this medicine in combination with ribavirin. you may develop gum disease, which could lead to loss of teeth. you may develop a dry mouth or vomiting, both of which can damage your teeth. it is important to brush your teeth thoroughly twice a day, rinse your mouth out if you vomit, and have regular dental check-ups. during treatment, some patients may experience eye problems, or loss of vision in rare instances. your doctor should carry out an eye examination before starting your treatment. in case of any changes in vision, you must tell your doctor and have a prompt and complete eye examination. if you have a medical condition that may lead to future eye problems (e.g. diabetes or high blood pressure), you should receive regular eye exams during therapy. if your eye disorder becomes more severe or if you develop new eye disorders, your treatment will be discontinued. while being treated with pegintron, your doctor may advise to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure. your doctor will test your blood before you begin therapy and throughout the treatment to make sure that the therapy you are getting is safe and effective. children and adolescents this medicine is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 3 years.

anti-hiv medicine(s) [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nrti), and/or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart)]. your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions. o taking this medicine in combination with ribavirin and an anti-hiv medicine(s) may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities: reduction in number of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood clotting cells called platelets. patients with advanced liver disease receiving haart may be at increased risk of worsening liver function, therefore adding treatment with this medicine alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase their risk. o with zidovudine or stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work. therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the hiv infection is not getting worse. if it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed. additionally, patients treated with this medicine and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells). therefore the use of zidovudine with this medicine and ribavirin combination therapy is not recommended. reminder: please read the \"other medicines\" section of the package leaflet for ribavirin before using it in combination with this medicine. - are taking telbivudine. if you take telbivudine with this medicine or any type of injectable interferon product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy

prepare and give the injection. detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided at the end of this leaflet (see section \"how to self-inject pegintron\"). water for injection and pegintron powder are provided in separate ampoules. prepare the dose by adding water for injection to pegintron powder just before you intend to inject it and use it 117 immediately. look carefully at the solution you prepared before you use it. the solution should be clear and colourless. do not use the solution if it is discoloured (changed its colour from the original) or if there are bits of particles in the solution. discard any solution that is left in the vial after you give yourself the injection. for disposal instructions, see section 5 \"how to store pegintron\". inject this medicine once each week on the same day. injecting it at the same time of day each week will help you not to forget to take it. always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. do not

kidney function. your doctor will determine the correct dose for you. use in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents pegintron will be given in combination with ribavirin. the dose of pegintron is determined by a calculation accounting for both height and weight. your doctor will determine the correct dose for you, or the child you are caring for. the duration of treatment is up to 1 year based on the doctor's judgement for you, or the child you are caring for. all patients if you are injecting this medicine yourself, please be sure that the dose that has been prescribed is clearly provided on the package of medicine you receive. if you use more pegintron than you should tell your doctor or healthcare professional or the doctor or healthcare professional of the child you are caring for as soon as possible. if you forget to take pegintron take/administer the dose of this medicine as soon as you remember, but only if within 1-2 days after the forgotten dose. if it is very close to your next injection, do not double the dose to make up for the forgotten dose, but continue your treatment as usual. if you are uncertain, contact your doctor or pharmacist or the doctor or pharmacist of the child you are caring for.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "pegintron", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "this medicine", "Type": "TREATMENT",
