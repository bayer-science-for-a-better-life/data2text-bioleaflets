NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n \nHumira 20 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n \nEach 0.2 ml single dose pre-filled syringe contains 20 mg of adalimumab.  \n \nAdalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nSolution for injection. (injection) \n \nClear, colourless solution.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nHumira in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or \nmore disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Humira can be given as monotherapy in case \nof intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for the \nefficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Humira has not been studied in patients aged less than 2 years. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and \nolder, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see section \n5.1). \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from \n4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical therapy \nand phototherapies. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease  \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or \nhave contraindications for such therapies. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nPaediatric Uveitis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients from \n2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, or in \nwhom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration   \n \nHumira treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of conditions for which Humira is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised to consult with \nan appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Humira (see section 4.4). Patients treated with \nHumira should be given the Patient Reminder Card. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Humira if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.  \n \nDuring treatment with Humira, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n \nPosology \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years \nof age is based on body weight (Table 1). Humira is administered every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection. \n \n\nTable 1. Humira Dose for Patients with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis  \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n10 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued \ntherapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in patients aged less than 2 years for this indication. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis from 6 years of age is based \non body weight (Table 2). Humira is administered every other week via subcutaneous injection.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 2. Humira Dose for Patients with Enthesitis-Related Arthritis  \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nHumira has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 years. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe recommended Humira dose for patients with plaque psoriasis from 4 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 3). Humira is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \n\nTable 3. Humira Dose for Paediatric Patients with Plaque Psoriasis  \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg Initial dose of 20 mg, followed by \n20 mg given every other week \n\nstarting one week after the initial \ndose \n\n≥ 30 kg Initial dose of 40 mg, followed by \n40 mg given every other week \n\nstarting one week after the initial \ndose \n\n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient not responding within this \ntime period. \n \nIf retreatment with Humira is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration should be \nfollowed. \n \nThe safety of Humira in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean of \n13 months. \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 4 years for this indication. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with Crohn’s disease from 6 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 4). Humira is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nTable 4. Humira Dose for Paediatric Patients with Crohn’s disease \n\n \nPatient \nWeight \n\nInduction Dose Maintenance \nDose \n\nStarting at \nWeek 4\n\n< 40 kg  40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2 \n \n\nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with the \nawareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with use of the \nhigher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2\n\n20 mg every \nother week \n\n≥ 40 kg  80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2 \n \n\nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with the \nawareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with use of the \nhigher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2\n\n40 mg every \nother week \n\n \nPatients who experience insufficient response may benefit from an increase in dosage: \n < 40 kg: 20 mg every week \n ≥ 40 kg: 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week \n \nContinued therapy should be carefully considered in a subject not responding by week 12. \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 6 years for this indication. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nPaediatric Uveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for paediatric patients with uveitis from 2 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 5). Humira is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \nIn paediatric uveitis, there is no experience in the treatment with Humira without concomitant treatment \nwith methotrexate. \n \n\nTable 5. Humira Dose for Paediatric Patients with Uveitis \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n< 30 kg 20 mg every other week in \ncombination with methotrexate \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week in \ncombination with methotrexate \n\n \nWhen Humira therapy is initiated, a loading dose of 40 mg for patients < 30 kg or 80 mg for patients \n≥ 30 kg may be administered one week prior to the start of maintenance therapy. No clinical data are \navailable on the use of a Humira loading dose in children < 6 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 2 years in this indication. \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n \nHumira has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nHumira is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the package \nleaflet. \n \nHumira is available in other strengths and presentations. \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients taking TNF -antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function may \nincrease the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for infections, \nincluding tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Humira. Because the elimination of \nadalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period. \n \nTreatment with Humira should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \nlocalised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis and \npatients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with Humira \nshould be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Humira should be monitored \nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Humira should be discontinued if \na patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis and appropriate antimicrobial or antifungal therapy \nshould be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when considering \nthe use of Humira in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which \nmay predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nSerious infections \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving Humira.   \n \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported.  \n \nTuberculosis \n \nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients receiving \nHumira. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) tuberculosis.  \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with Humira, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(“latent”) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of patient \nhistory of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and previous \nand/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest \nX-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the \nconduct and results of these tests are recorded in the Patient Reminder Card. Prescribers are reminded of \nthe risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or \nimmunocompromised.  \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Humira therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully considered. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted.  \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis \ntreatment before the initiation of Humira and in accordance with local recommendations.  \n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of Humira in \npatients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for tuberculosis and \nin patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment \ncannot be confirmed.   \n \nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients \ntreated with Humira. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active tuberculosis have \nredeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with Humira. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \ninfection (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or after \ntherapy with Humira.  \n \nOther opportunistic infections \n \nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nHumira. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-antagonists and \nthis has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal outcomes.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant shock \nan invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Humira should be promptly \ndiscontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made \nin consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive fungal infections.  \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Humira, who are \nchronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal outcome. Patients \nshould be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Humira. For patients who test positive \nfor hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is \nrecommended. \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Humira should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms \nof active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. \nAdequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with \nTNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients who develop HBV \nreactivation, Humira should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be initiated.  \n \nNeurological events  \n \nTNF-antagonists including Humira have been associated in rare instances with new onset or exacerbation \nof clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease \nincluding multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-\nBarré syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Humira in patients with pre-\nexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of \nHumira should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between \nintermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in \npatients with non-infectious intermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of Humira therapy and regularly \nduring treatment to assess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders.  \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nSerious allergic reactions associated with Humira were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious allergic \nreactions associated with Humira were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of serious allergic \nreactions including anaphylaxis have been received following Humira administration. If an anaphylactic \nreaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Humira should be discontinued \nimmediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  \n \nImmunosuppression \n \nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with Humira, there was no evidence of \ndepression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in \nenumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been \nreported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma \n\n\n\n9 \n\nand leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, \nwhich complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of \nlymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including \nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases \nrepresented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with \nimmunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with \nTNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.  \n \nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated with \nadalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. \nSome of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with Humira have occurred in young adult patients on \nconcomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for inflammatory bowel disease. The \npotential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and Humira should be carefully \nconsidered. A risk for the development of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Humira \ncannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom treatment \nwith Humira is continued following development of malignancy. Thus, additional caution should be \nexercised in considering Humira treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy or \npsoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-\nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Humira. Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma \nhave also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab (see section 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients with \nmoderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung \nor head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients \nhad a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist in \nCOPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking. \n \nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia or \ncolon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma \n(for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), or who had \na prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular intervals before \ntherapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy and biopsies per \nlocal recommendations. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists.  \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with Humira. All patients should be advised to seek \nimmediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. \npersistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Humira. Discontinuation of Humira therapy should be \nconsidered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nVaccinations  \n \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by \nlive vaccines in patients receiving Humira.   \n \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating Humira therapy. \n \nPatients on Humira may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration of live \nvaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for 5 months \nfollowing the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nCongestive heart failure \n \nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality \ndue to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also \nbeen reported in patients receiving Humira. Humira should be used with caution in patients with mild \nheart failure (NYHA class I/II). Humira is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure (see section \n4.3). Treatment with Humira must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms \nof congestive heart failure. \n \nAutoimmune processes \n \nTreatment with Humira may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of long-term \ntreatment with Humira on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient develops \nsymptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Humira and is positive for \nantibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Humira should not be given (see section \n4.8). \n \nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists \n \nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the \nnature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. (See section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDS (e.g, anakinra and abatacept) or \nother TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, \nincluding serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. (See section 4.5). \n \nSurgery \n \nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with Humira. The long half-\nlife of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A patient who \nrequires surgery while on Humira should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions \nshould be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving \nHumira.  \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that Humira does not worsen or cause \nstrictures. \n \nElderly \n \nThe frequency of serious infections among Humira treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) was \nhigher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention \nregarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSee Vaccinations above. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nHumira has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic \narthritis patients taking Humira as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate. Antibody \nformation was lower when Humira was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as \nmonotherapy. Administration of Humira without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of \nantibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe combination of Humira and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent administration \nof biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”).  \n \nThe combination of Humira and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy \nand continue its use for at least five months after the last Humira treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large number (approximately 2100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1500 exposed during the first trimester, \ndoes not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn’s disease (CD) \ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated with \nadalimumab were enrolled.  The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. The \nrate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 (8.7%) in \nthe adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with RA (unadjusted \nOR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women with CD and 3/32 \n(9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). The adjusted OR \n(accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD combined. There were \nno distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for the secondary endpoints \nspontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and serious or opportunistic \n\n\n\n12 \n\ninfections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation of data may be impacted due \nto methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-randomized design. \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n(see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNF, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune \nresponses in the newborn.  Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. \n \nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration of \nlive vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk at \nvery low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% \nof the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and \nhave poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, \nHumira can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \n \nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nHumira may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \nimpairment may occur following administration of Humira (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nHumira was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months or \nmore. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease, \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) as \nwell as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa \nand uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients receiving Humira and 3,801 \npatients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled period. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking Humira and 5.4% for control treated \npatients. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory \ntract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), \nheadache and musculoskeletal pain. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for Humira. TNF-antagonists, such as Humira affect the \nimmune system and their use may affect the body’s defence against infection and cancer. \nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV reactivation \nand various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been reported with use \nof Humira. \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include \nrare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events and reports of \nlupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \nadult patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on postmarketing \nexperience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 6 below: very common \n( 1/10); common ( 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon ( 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); \nand not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest frequency seen among the \nvarious indications has been included.

data \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety profile for patients with uveitis treated with Humira every other week was consistent with the \nknown safety profile of Humira. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9% of patients treated with Humira developed \ninjection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 7.2% of \npatients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate \ndiscontinuation of the medicinal product. \n \nInfections  \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in the \nHumira treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients. The \ninfections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and sinusitis. Most \npatients continued on Humira after the infection resolved.   \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in Humira treated patients and 0.03 per \npatient year in placebo and active control − treated patients.   \n \nIn controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with Humira, serious infections (including fatal \ninfections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including \nmiliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated or \n\n\n\n19 \n\nextrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystis, candidiasis, \naspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first eight months after \ninitiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years during \nHumira trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \nenthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric patients with an \nexposure of 498.1 patient years during Humira trials in paediatric patients with Crohn’s disease. No \nmalignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of 80.0 patient years during a \nHumira trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No malignancies were observed in 60 \npaediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient years during a Humira trial in paediatric patients with \nuveitis. \n \nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal Humira trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in patients \nwith moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s \ndisease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, \nwere observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per 1,000 patient-years among 5,291 \nHumira treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per 1,000 patient-years among 3,444 control \npatients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for Humira and 3.8 months for control-treated \npatients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 \npatient-years among Humira-treated patients and 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among control \npatients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of \n2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among Humira-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-\nyears among control patients. The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per \n1,000 patient-years among Humira-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among \ncontrol patients. \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open label extension \nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over 26,439 \npatient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin \ncancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient years. The observed rate of non-melanoma skin cancers is \napproximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is approximately 1.3 per \n1,000 patient years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.3 \nper 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n \nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with \nadalimumab (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies  \n \nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis studies \nI − V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with Humira and 8.1% of placebo and active \ncontrol − treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at \nWeek 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with Humira in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \nstudies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved \n\n\n\n20 \n\nfollowing discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system \nsymptoms. \n \nHepato-biliary events \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis with a \ncontrol period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.7% of \nHumira-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were \n4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred \nin 6.1% of Humira-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. Most ALT elevations occurred \nwith concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of Humira \nin patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to < 4 years. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis with a control \nperiod ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of Humira-treated \npatients and 0.9% of controlled-treated patients.  \n \nIn the Phase 3 trial of Humira in patients with paediatric Crohn’s disease which evaluated efficacy and \nsafety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted induction \ntherapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of patients of \nwhom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with plaque psoriasis with a control period duration \nranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of Humira-treated patients and \n1.8% of control-treated patients.  \n \nNo ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of Humira in paediatric patients with plaque \npsoriasis. \n \nIn controlled trials of Humira (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week \nstarting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of 166.5 days and \n105.0 days in Humira-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN \noccurred in 2.4% of Humira-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients.  \n \nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been post-\nmarketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, such \nas hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine \n \nIn adult Crohn’s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \nevents were seen with the combination of Humira and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared with \nHumira alone. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has been \nmultiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended dose.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors. \nATC code: L04AB04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.   \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes \nin the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 \nwith an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM).  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects  \n \nAfter treatment with Humira, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after Humira administration. Patients treated with Humira usually \nexperienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with Humira. In \npatients with Crohn’s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing inflammatory markers in the \ncolon including a significant reduction of expression of TNFα was seen. Endoscopic studies in intestinal \nmucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab treated patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis \n \nHumira was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The efficacy and \nsafety of Humira were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. Some \npatients were treated for up to 120 months duration.  \n \nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had \ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) every \nweek and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, 40 or \n80 mg of Humira or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses of \n\n\n\n22 \n\n20 or 40 mg of Humira were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on alternative \nweeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. No other \ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have \nbeen intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first \nreceived placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of Humira every week \nfor 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of Humira every other week with placebo injections on \nalternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension \nphase in which 40 mg of Humira/MTX was administered every other week up to 10 years. \n \nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were  18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic \ndrug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a \nminimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, \nsulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of Humira or placebo every other week \nfor 24 weeks.   \n \nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nHumira 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, Humira 40 mg every other week \nmonotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of progression \nof joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 weeks, 497 \npatients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of Humira was administered every \nother week up to 10 years. \n \nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \npercent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA \nstudy V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at Week 52. RA studies III and V \nhad an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by X-ray \nresults). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life.  \n \nACR response \n \nThe percent of Humira-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent across RA \nstudies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in Table 7.  \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \nTable 7 \n\nACR Responses in Placebo-Controlled Trials \n(Percent of Patients) \n\n \nResponse RA Study Ia** RA Study IIa** RA Study IIIa** \n\n \n Placebo/ \n\nMTXc \nn=60 \n\nHumirab/ MTXc\n\nn=63 \nPlacebo \nn=110 \n\nHumirab \nn=113 \n\nPlacebo/ \nMTXc \nn=200 \n\nHumirab/ MTXc\n\nn=207 \n\nACR 20    \n 6 months 13.3% 65.1% 19.1% 46.0% 29.5% 63.3%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 24.0% 58.9%\nACR 50    \n 6 months 6.7% 52.4% 8.2% 22.1% 9.5% 39.1%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 9.5% 41.5%\nACR 70    \n 6 months 3.3% 23.8% 1.8% 12.4% 2.5% 20.8%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 4.5% 23.2%\na RA study I at 24 weeks, RA study II at 26 weeks , and RA study III at 24 and 52 weeks \nb 40 mg Humira administered every other week \nc MTX = methotrexate \n**p < 0.01, Humira versus placebo \n\n \nIn RA studies I-IV, all individual components of the ACR response criteria (number of tender and swollen \njoints, physician and patient assessment of disease activity and pain, disability index (HAQ) scores and \nCRP (mg/dl) values) improved at 24 or 26 weeks compared to placebo. In RA study III, these \nimprovements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained \nresponse when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to Humira 40 mg every \nother week, 114 patients continued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 5 years. Among those, 86 \npatients (75.4%) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2%) had ACR 50 responses; and 41 patients \n(36%) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on Humira 40 mg every other week \nfor 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0%) had ACR 20 responses; 56 patients (69.1%) had ACR 50 \nresponses; and 43 patients (53.1%) had ACR 70 responses. \n \nIn RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with Humira plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p < 0.001).   \n \nIn RA studies I-IV, Humira-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 responses \ncompared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. \n \nIn RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination therapy \nwith Humira and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than methotrexate \nmonotherapy and Humira monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at Week 104 (see Table \n8). \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nTable 8 \n\nACR Responses in RA Study V \n(percent of patients) \n\n \n\nResponse \nMTX \nn=257 \n\nHumira \nn=274 \n\nHumira/MTX \nn=268 \n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nACR 20   \n Week \n52 \n\n62.6% 54.4% 72.8% 0.013 < 0.001 0.043 \n\n Week \n104 \n\n56.0% 49.3% 69.4% 0.002 < 0.001 0.140 \n\nACR 50   \n Week \n52 \n\n45.9% 41.2% 61.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.317 \n\n Week \n104 \n\n42.8% 36.9% 59.0% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.162 \n\nACR 70   \n Week \n52 \n\n27.2% 25.9% 45.5% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.656 \n\n Week \n104 \n\n28.4% 28.1% 46.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.864 \n\na. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \n\nb. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \n\nc.   p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n\n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study V, ACR response rates were maintained when followed for up to \n10 years. Of 542 patients who were randomised to Humira 40 mg every other week, 170 patients \ncontinued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 154 patients (90.6%) had ACR \n20 responses; 127 patients (74.7%) had ACR 50 responses; and 102 patients (60.0%) had ACR 70 \nresponses. \n \nAt Week 52, 42.9% of patients who received Humira/methotrexate combination therapy achieved clinical \nremission (DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6) compared to 20.6% of patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy and \n23.4% of patients receiving Humira monotherapy. Humira/methotrexate combination therapy was \nclinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and Humira monotherapy (p < 0.001) in \nachieving a low disease state in patients with recently diagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. \nThe response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447). Of 342 subjects originally \nrandomized to Humira monotherapy or Humira/methotrexate combination therapy who entered the open-\nlabel extension study, 171 subjects completed 10 years of Humira treatment. Among those, 109 subjects \n(63.7%) were reported to be in remission at 10 years. \n \nRadiographic response \n \nIn RA study III, where Humira treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in \nmodified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score. \nHumira/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients \nreceiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 9).   \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nIn the open-label extension of RA Study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is \nmaintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated with \n40 mg Humira every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients showed no \nprogression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. At \n10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg Humira every other week were evaluated \nradiographically. Among those, 40 patients showed no progression of structural damage defined by a \nchange from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. \n \n\nTable 9 \n Radiographic Mean Changes Over 12 Months in RA Study III \n\n \n Placebo/ \n\nMTXa \nHumira/MTX \n40 mg every \nother week \n\nPlacebo/MTX-\nHumira/MTX (95% \n\nConfidence \nIntervalb)\n\np-value \n\nTotal Sharp Score 2.7 0.1 2.6 (1.4, 3.8) < 0.001c \n\nErosion score 1.6 0.0 1.6 (0.9, 2.2) < 0.001 \nJSNd score 1.0 0.1 0.9 (0.3, 1.4)   0.002 \n\namethotrexate \nb95% confidence intervals for the differences in change scores between methotrexate and Humira.  \ncBased on rank analysis  \ndJoint Space Narrowing \n \nIn RA study V, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified \nTotal Sharp Score (see Table 10). \n \n\nTable 10 \n  Radiographic Mean Changes at Week 52 in RA Study V \n\n \n\n \n\nMTX \nn=257 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval) \n\nHumira \nn=274 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval)\n\nHumira/MTX \nn=268 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval)\n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nTotal Sharp \nScore \n\n5.7 (4.2-7.3) 3.0 (1.7-4.3) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) < 0.001 0.0020 < 0.001 \n\nErosion score 3.7 (2.7-4.7) 1.7 (1.0-2.4) 0.8 (0.4-1.2) < 0.001 0.0082 < 0.001\nJSN score 2.0 (1.2-2.8) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) 0.5 (0-1.0) < 0.001 0.0037 0.151\n\na p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \n\nb p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test  \n\nc p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n\n \nFollowing 52 weeks and 104 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients without progression (change \nfrom baseline in modified Total Sharp Score  0.5) was significantly higher with Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy (63.8% and 61.2% respectively) compared to methotrexate monotherapy (37.4% and \n33.5% respectively, p < 0.001) and Humira monotherapy (50.7%, p < 0.002 and 44.5%, p < 0.001 \nrespectively). \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA study V, the mean change from baseline at Year 10 in the modified \nTotal Sharp Score was 10.8, 9.2 and 3.9 in patients originally randomized to methotrexate monotherapy, \n\n\n\n26 \n\nHumira monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate combination therapy, respectively. The corresponding \nproportions of patients with no radiographic progression were 31.3%, 23.7% and 36.7% respectively. \n \nQuality of life and physical function  \n \nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the Health \nAssessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, which was a \npre-specified primary endpoint at Week 52 in RA study III. All doses/schedules of Humira in all four \nstudies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the HAQ from \nbaseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was seen at Week 52. Results from \nthe Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of Humira in all four studies support these \nfindings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically \nsignificant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other week dose. A statistically significant \ndecrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was \nseen in all three studies in which it was assessed (RA studies I, III, IV). \n \nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued treatment \nmaintained improvement through Week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. Improvement in \nquality of life was measured up to Week 156 (36 months) and improvement was maintained through that \ntime. \n \nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for Humira/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and Humira monotherapy at Week 52, which was maintained through \nWeek 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in \nphysical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment. \n \nAdult plaque psoriasis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis ( 10% \nBSA involvement and PASI  12 or  10) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy in \nrandomised, double-blind studies. 73% of patients enrolled in Psoriasis Studies I and II had received prior \nsystemic therapy or phototherapy. The safety and efficacy of Humira were also studied in adult patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with concomitant hand and/or foot psoriasis who were \ncandidates for systemic therapy in a randomised double-blind study (Psoriasis Study III).   \n \nPsoriasis Study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, patients \nreceived placebo or Humira at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one \nweek after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least a PASI 75 response \n(PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline), entered period B and received open-label \n40 mg Humira every other week. Patients who maintained PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were \noriginally randomised to active therapy in Period A, were re-randomised in period C to receive 40 mg \nHumira every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups, the mean \nbaseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline PGA score ranged from “moderate” (53% of subjects \nincluded) to “severe” (41%) to “very severe” (6%). \n \nPsoriasis Study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of Humira versus methotrexate and \nplacebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg and thereafter dose \nincreases up to Week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by \n40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for 16 weeks. There are no data available \ncomparing Humira and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. Patients receiving MTX who achieved a \nPASI 50 response at Week 8 and/or 12 did not receive further dose increases. Across all treatment \n\n\n\n27 \n\ngroups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the baseline PGA score ranged from “mild” (<1%) to \n“moderate” (48%) to “severe” (46%) to “very severe” (6%). \n \nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an open-label \nextension trial, where Humira was given for at least an additional 108 weeks. \n \nIn Psoriasis Studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 \nresponse from baseline at Week 16 (see Tables 11 and 12). \n \n\nTable 11 \nPs Study I (REVEAL)  - Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n \nPlacebo \nN=398 \nn (%) \n\nHumira 40 mg eow \nN=814 \nn (%) \n\n     PASI 75a 26 (6.5) 578 (70.9)b \n    PASI 100 3 (0.8) 163 (20.0)b \n    PGA: Clear/minimal 17 (4.3) 506 (62.2)b \na Percent of patients achieving PASI75 response was calculated as centre-\nadjusted rate \nb p < 0.001, Humira vs. Placebo\n\n \n\nTable 12 \n Ps Study II (CHAMPION) Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n Placebo \nN=53 \nn (%) \n\nMTX \nN=110 \nn (%) \n\nHumira 40 mg eow \nN=108 \nn (%) \n\n     PASI 75 10 (18.9) 39 (35.5) 86 (79.6) a, b \n    PASI 100 1 (1.9) 8 (7.3) 18 (16.7) c, d \n    PGA: \nClear/minimal \n\n6 (11.3) 33 (30.0) 79 (73.1) a, b \n\na p < 0.001 Humira vs. placebo \nb p < 0.001 Humira vs. methotrexate \nc p < 0.01 Humira vs. placebo \nd p < 0.05 Humira vs. methotrexate\n\n \nIn Psoriasis Study I, 28% of patients who were PASI 75 responders and were re-randomised to placebo at \nWeek 33 compared to 5% continuing on Humira, p < 0.001, experienced “loss of adequate response” \n(PASI score after Week 33 and on or before Week 52 that resulted in a <PASI 50 response relative to \nbaseline with a minimum of a 6-point increase in PASI score relative to Week 33). Of the patients who \nlost adequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into the open-label extension \ntrial, 38% (25/66) and 55% (36/66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and 24 weeks of re-treatment, \nrespectively. \n \nA total of 233 PASI 75 responders at Week 16 and Week 33 received continuous Humira therapy for \n52 weeks in Psoriasis Study I, and continued Humira in the open-label extension trial. PASI 75 and PGA \nof clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7% and 59.0%, respectively, after an \nadditional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all patients who \ndropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, were considered \nnon-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 69.6% and \n55.7%, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label \nextension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a median \ntime to relapse (decline to PGA “moderate” or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of these patients \nexperienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of patients who entered the \nretreatment period had a response of PGA “clear” or “minimal” after 16 weeks of retreatment, irrespective \nof whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1%[123/178] and 88.8% [95/107] for patients who \nrelapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, respectively). A similar safety profile was \nobserved during retreatment as before withdrawal. \n \nSignificant improvements at Week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (Studies I and II) and MTX \n(Study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In Study I, improvements in \nthe physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also significant compared to \nplacebo. \n \nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to 40 mg \nweekly due to a PASI response below 50%, 26.4% (92/349) and 37.8% (132/349) of patients achieved \nPASI 75 response at Week 12 and 24, respectively. \n \nPsoriasis Study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of Humira versus placebo in 72 patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients received an \ninitial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) \nor placebo for 16 weeks. At Week 16, a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients who \nreceived Humira achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands and/or feet compared to patients \nwho received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively [P = 0.014]). \n \nPsoriasis Study IV compared efficacy and safety of Humira versus placebo in 217 adult patients with \nmoderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by 40 mg \nevery other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label \nHumira treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included the Modified Nail \nPsoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician’s Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) \nand the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 13). Humira demonstrated a treatment benefit in \nnail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin involvement (BSA≥10% (60% of patients) and \nBSA<10% and ≥5% (40% of patients)). \n \n\nTable 13 \nPs Study IV Efficacy Results at 16, 26 and 52 Weeks \n\nEndpoint Week 16 \nPlacebo-Controlled\n\nWeek 26 \nPlacebo-Controlled\n\nWeek 52 \nOpen-label \n\nPlacebo \nN=108 \n\nHumira \n40 mg eow \n\nN=109\n\nPlacebo\nN=108 \n\nHumira \n40 mg eow \n\nN=109\n\nHumira \n40 mg eow  \n\nN=80 \n≥ mNAPSI 75 (%) 2.9 26.0a 3.4 46.6a 65.0 \nPGA-F \nclear/minimal and \n≥2-grade \nimprovement (%) \n\n2.9 29.7a 6.9 48.9a 61.3 \n\nPercent Change in \nTotal Fingernail \nNAPSI (%) \n\n-7.8 -44.2 a -11.5 -56.2a -72.2 \n\na p<0.001, Humira vs. placebo  \n \nHumira treated patients showed statistically significant improvements at Week 26 compared with placebo \nin the DLQI.  \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n \nAdult Crohn’s disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in over 1500 patients with moderately to severely active \nCrohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI)  220 and  450) in randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80% of patients continued to receive at least one of these \nmedications.  \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD Study I \n(CLASSIC I) and CD Study II (GAIN). In CD Study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were \nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg Humira at Week 0 and \n80 mg at Week 2, 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. In \nCD Study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to \nreceive either 160 mg Humira at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. The primary \nnon-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD Study III, 854 patients \nreceived open-label 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. At Week 4 patients were randomised to \n40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks. Patients in \nclinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at Week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those \nnot in clinical response at Week 4. Corticosteroid taper was permitted after Week 8.  \n \nCD study I and CD study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 14. \n \n\nTable 14 \nInduction of Clinical Remission and Response \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n\n CD Study I: Infliximab Naive \nPatients \n\nCD Study II: Infliximab \nExperienced Patients \n\n Placebo \nN=74 \n\nHumira \n80/40 mg \n\nN = 75 \n\nHumira  \n160/80 mg \n\nN=76 \n\nPlacebo \nN=166 \n\nHumira  \n160/80 mg \n\nN=159 \n\nWeek 4      \n\nClinical remission 12% 24% 36%* 7% 21%* \n\nClinical response (CR-\n100) \n\n24% 37% 49%** 25% 38%** \n\nAll p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for Humira versus placebo \n* p < 0.001 \n** p < 0.01 \n\n \nSimilar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by Week 8 and \nadverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group. \n \nIn CD Study III, at Week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the \nprimary analysis. Of those in clinical response at Week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to other TNF-\nantagonists. Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 15.

These results suggest that some patients who \nhave not responded by Week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through Week 12. Therapy \ncontinued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section 4.2).   \n \n117/276 patients from CD study I and 272/777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed through \nat least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy. 88 and 189 patients, respectively, continued to be in \nclinical remission. Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and 233 patients, respectively. \n \nQuality of life \n \nIn CD Study I and CD Study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific inflammatory \nbowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at Week 4 in patients randomised to Humira \n80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at Weeks 26 and 56 in CD Study III as well \namong the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. \n \nAdult Uveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious intermediate, \nposterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomised, double-\nmasked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or Humira at an initial dose of \n80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. Concomitant stable \ndoses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted.  \n \nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of prednisone \n60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid \ndiscontinuation by Week 15.  \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment (oral \nprednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent a \nmandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19.  \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was ´time to treatment failure´. Treatment failure was \ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal \nvascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected visual \nacuity (BCVA).  \n \nPatients who completed Studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term \nextension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on \nstudy medication beyond Week 78 until they had access to Humira. \n \nClinical Response \n \nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in \npatients treated with Humira versus patients receiving placebo (See Table 16). Both studies demonstrated \nan early and sustained effect of Humira on the treatment failure rate versus placebo (see Figure 1).  \n \n\nTable 16  \nTime to Treatment Failure in Studies UV I and UV II \n\n \nAnalysis \n Treatment \n\nN Failure \nN (%) \n\nMedian Time to \nFailure (months) \n\nHRa CI 95% \nfor HRa \n\nP Value b \n\nTime to Treatment Failure At or After Week 6 in Study UV I   \nPrimary analysis (ITT)   \n Placebo 107 84 (78.5) 3.0 -- -- -- \n Adalimumab 110 60 (54.5) 5.6 0.50 0.36, 0.70  < 0.001\nTime to Treatment Failure At or After Week 2 in Study UV II \nPrimary analysis (ITT)   \n Placebo 111 61 (55.0) 8.3 -- -- -- \n Adalimumab 115 45 (39.1) NEc 0.57 0.39, 0.84 0.004 \n\nNote: Treatment failure at or after Week 6 (Study UV I), or at or after Week 2 (Study UV II), was counted \nas event.

In Study UV II, statistically significant differences were observed \nfor visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of adalimumab. \n \nOf the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of Studies UV I and UV II, 60 \nsubjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to complications secondary to diabetic \nretinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary analysis of \nefficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of open-label \nadalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3%) were in quiescence (no active \ninflammatory lesions, AC cell grade  ≤ 0.5+, VH grade ≤ 0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose ≤ 7.5 mg \nper day, and 178 (66.2%) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA was either improved or maintained (< 5 \nletters deterioration) in 88.6% of the eyes at week 78. Data beyond Week 78 were generally consistent \n\n\n\n33 \n\nwith these results but the number of enrolled subjects declined after this time. Overall, among the patients \nwho discontinued the study, 18% discontinued due to adverse events, and 8% due to insufficient response \nto adalimumab treatment. \n \nQuality of Life \n \nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, \nusing the NEI VFQ-25. Humira was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with statistically \nsignificant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and total score in \nStudy UV I, and for general vision and mental health in Study UV II. Vision related effects were not \nnumerically in favour of Humira for colour vision in Study UVI and for colour vision, peripheral vision \nand near vision in Study UV II. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nFormation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of \nadalimumab. There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and the \noccurrence of adverse events. \n \nIn patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 4 to 17 years, anti-adalimumab \nantibodies were identified in 15.8% (27/171) of patients treated with adalimumab. In patients not given \nconcomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 25.6% (22/86) compared to 5.9% (5/85) when adalimumab \nwas used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were \n2 to < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing <15 kg, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in \n7% (1/15) of patients, and the one patient was receiving concomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with enthesitis-related arthritis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 10.9% (5/46) of \npatients treated with adalimumab. In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was \n13.6% (3/22), compared to 8.3% (2/24) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. \n \nPatients in rheumatoid arthritis studies I, II and III were tested at multiple time points for anti-adalimumab \nantibodies during the 6 to 12 month period. In the pivotal trials, anti-adalimumab antibodies were \nidentified in 5.5% (58/1053) of patients treated with adalimumab, compared to 0.5% (2/370) on placebo. \nIn patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when \nadalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate.   \n \nIn patients with paediatric psoriasis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 5/38 subjects (13%) \ntreated with 0.8 mg/kg adalimumab monotherapy. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 77/920 subjects (8.4%) \ntreated with adalimumab monotherapy. \n \nIn adult plaque psoriasis patients on long term adalimumab monotherapy who participated in a withdrawal \nand retreatment study, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment (11 of 482 subjects, 2.3%) \nwas similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal (11 of 590 subjects, 1.9%). \n \nIn patients with moderately to severely active paediatric Crohn’s disease, the rate of anti-adalimumab \nantibody development in patients receiving adalimumab was 3.3%.  \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7/269 subjects (2.6%). \n \nIn adult patients with non-infectious uveitis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 4.8% (12/249) \nof patients treated with adalimumab. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \nBecause immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody rates with those from \nother products is not appropriate. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with active \npolyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA onset types \n(most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis). \n \npJIA I \n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \nparallel − group study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in \nphase (OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or non-MTX-treated. \nPatients who were in the non-MTX stratum were either naïve to or had been withdrawn from MTX at \nleast two weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on stable doses of non-steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and or prednisone ( 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). In the \nOL LI phase all patients received 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg Humira every other week for \n16 weeks. The distribution of patients by age and minimum, median and maximum dose received during \nthe OL LI phase is presented in Table 17. \n \n\nTable 17 \nDistribution of patients by age and adalimumab dose received during the OL LI phase \n\n \nAge Group Number of patients at Baseline \n\nn (%) \nMinimum, median and maximum \ndose\n\n4 to 7 years 31 (18.1) 10, 20 and 25 mg \n\n8 to 12 years 71 (41.5) 20, 25 and 40 mg \n13 to 17 years 69 (40.4) 25, 40 and 40 mg \n\n \nPatients demonstrating a Paediatric ACR 30 response at Week 16 were eligible to be randomised into the \ndouble blind (DB) phase and received either Humira 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg, or placebo \nevery other week for an additional 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare criteria were defined as a \nworsening of  30% from baseline in  3 of 6 Paediatric ACR core criteria,  2 active joints, and \nimprovement of  30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at disease flare, patients \nwere eligible to enrol into the open label extension phase.  \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nTable 18 \nPed ACR 30 Responses in the JIA study \n\n \nStratum MTX Without MTX \nPhase  \nOL-LI 16 weeks  \n\nPed ACR 30 \nresponse (n/N) \n\n94.1% (80/85) 74.4% (64/86) \n\n                                                           Efficacy Outcomes\nDouble Blind 32 weeks Humira /MTX \n\n(N = 38) \n \n\nPlacebo / MTX \n(N = 37) \n\nHumira  \n(N = 30) \n\nPlacebo \n(N = 28) \n\nDisease flares at \nthe end of \n32 weeksa (n/N)\n\n36.8% (14/38) 64.9% (24/37)b 43.3% (13/30) 71.4% \n(20/28)c \n\nMedian time to \ndisease flare \n\n>32 weeks 20 weeks >32 weeks 14 weeks \n\n \n\na Ped ACR 30/50/70 responses Week 48 significantly greater than those of placebo treated patients  \nb p = 0.015 \nc p = 0.031 \n \n\nAmongst those who responded at Week 16 (n=144), the Paediatric ACR 30/50/70/90 responses were \nmaintained for up to six years in the OLE phase in patients who received Humira throughout the study. \nOver all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of the baseline age group 13 to \n17 years were treated 6 years or longer. \n \nOverall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with the \ncombination of Humira and MTX compared to Humira alone. Taking these results into consideration, \nHumira is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as monotherapy in patients for \nwhom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2). \n \npJIA II \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children \n(2 - < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg) with moderately to severely active polyarticular \nJIA. The patients received 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of Humira up to a maximum of 20 mg \nevery other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During the study, most subjects \nused concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. \n \nAt Week 12 and Week 24, PedACR30 response was 93.5% and 90.0%, respectively, using the observed \ndata approach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR50/70/90 at Week 12 and Week 24 were \n90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Amongst those who responded (Paediatric \nACR 30) at Week 24 (n=27 out of 30 patients), the Paediatric ACR 30 responses were maintained for up \nto 60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received Humira throughout this time period. Overall, \n20 subjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study in 46 \npaediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were randomised \nto receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of Humira up to a maximum of 40 mg, or placebo \nevery other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-label (OL) period during \n\n\n\n36 \n\nwhich patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of Humira up to a maximum of 40 mg every other week \nsubcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change from \nBaseline to Week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints \nwith loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with mean percent decrease of -\n62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the Humira group compared to -11.6% (median \npercent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo group. Improvement in number of active joints with \narthritis was maintained during the OL period through Week 156 for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the \nHumira group who remained in the study. Although not statistically significant, the majority of patients \ndemonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender \njoint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), Paediatric ACR 50 response, and Paediatric ACR 70 \nresponse. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis  \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of Humira was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of 114 paediatric \npatients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a Physician’s Global \nAssessment (PGA) ≥ 4 or >  20% BSA involvement or > 10% BSA involvement with very thick lesions or \nPsoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 20 or ≥ 10 with clinically relevant facial, genital, or hand/ foot \ninvolvement) who were inadequately controlled with topical therapy and heliotherapy or phototherapy.  \n \nPatients received Humira 0.8 mg/kg eow (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg/kg eow (up to 20 mg), or methotrexate \n0.1-0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg). At Week 16, more patients randomised to Humira 0.8 mg/kg had \npositive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those randomised to 0.4 mg/kg eow or MTX.   \n \n\nTable 19:  Paediatric Plaque Psoriasis Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n \n\n \nMTXa \nN=37 \n\nHumira 0.8 mg/kg eow \nN=38  \n\n PASI 75b 12 (32.4%) 22 (57.9%) \n PGA: Clear/minimalc 15 (40.5%) 23 (60.5%) \na MTX = methotrexate \nb P=0.027, Humira 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX \nc P=0.083, Humira 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX\n \n\nPatients who achieved PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal were withdrawn from treatment for up to \n36 weeks and monitored for loss of disease control (i.e. a worsening of PGA by at least 2 grades). Patients \nwere then re-treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for an additional 16 weeks and response rates \nobserved during retreatment were similar to the previous double-blind period: PASI 75 response of 78.9% \n(15 of 19 subjects) and PGA clear or minimal of 52.6% (10 of 19 subjects). \n \nIn the open label period of the study, PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal responses were maintained for \nup to an additional 52 weeks with no new safety findings. \n \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease  \n \n\nHumira was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the \nefficacy and safety of induction and maintenance treatment with doses dependent on body weight (< 40 kg \nor ≥ 40 kg) in 192 paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 (inclusive) years, with moderate to \nsevere Crohn´s disease (CD) defined as Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score > 30. \nSubjects had to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator) \nfor CD. Subjects may also have previously lost response or been intolerant to infliximab.  \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nAll subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their Baseline body weight: 160 mg \nat Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 for subjects ≥ 40 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for subjects \n< 40 kg. \n \nAt Week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the Low Dose or \nStandard Dose maintenance regimens as shown in Table 20. \n \n\nTable 20 \nMaintenance regimen\n\nPatient \nWeight \n\nLow dose Standard \ndose \n\n< 40 kg 10 mg eow 20 mg eow\n≥ 40 kg 20 mg eow 40 mg eow\n\n \nEfficacy results \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was clinical remission at Week 26, defined as PCDAI score  10. \n \nClinical remission and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI score of at least 15 points from \nBaseline) rates are presented in Table 21.

After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0% (37/50) of the 50 patients remaining in the \nstudy continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0% (46/50) of patients continued to be in clinical \nresponse per PCDAI. \n \nPaediatric Uveitis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in a randomized, double-masked, controlled study of 90 \npaediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated noninfectious anterior uveitis \nwho were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received either placebo or \n20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if ≥ 30 kg) every other week in combination with \ntheir baseline dose of methotrexate.  \n \nThe primary endpoint was ‘time to treatment failure’. The criteria determining treatment failure were \nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with development \nof sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted use of \nconcomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. \n \nClinical Response \n \nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (See Figure 2, \nP < 0.0001 from log rank test).The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects treated \nwith placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects treated with \nadalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. Adalimumab \nsignificantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown by the hazard \nratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]). \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier Curves Summarizing Time to Treatment Failure in the Paediatric Uveitis \nStudy \n\n \n\nP\nR\n\nO\nB\n\nA\nB\n\nIL\nIT\n\nY\n O\n\nF\n F\n\nA\nIL\n\nIN\nG\n\n T\nR\n\nE\nA\n\nT\nM\n\nE\nN\n\nT\n \n\n TIME (WEEKS) \n Treatment Placebo  Adalimumab \n Note: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); H = HUMIRA (Number at Risk).\n\n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npatients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean trough \nsteady-state (values measured from Week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was 5.6 ± 5.6 µg/ml \n(102% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 ± 5.2 µg/ml (47.7% CV) with \nconcomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg \ndosed with adalimumab 24 mg/m2 , the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations was \n6.0 ± 6.1 µg/ml (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 7.9 ± 5.6 µg/ml \n(71.2% CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npatients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state (values \nmeasured at Week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 ± 6.6 μg/ml for adalimumab without \nconcomitant methotrexate and 11.8 ± 4.3 μg/ml with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npaediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean ± SD steady-state adalimumab trough \nconcentration was approximately 7.4 ± 5.8 µg/ml (79% CV). \n \nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at Weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. At \nWeek 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose \n(20/10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (±SD) serum \nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at Week 4 were 15.7 ± 6.6 g/ml for patients ≥ 40 kg \n(160/80 mg) and 10.6 ± 6.1 g/ml for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg).  \n \nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (±SD) adalimumab trough concentrations \nat Week 52 were 9.5 ± 5.6 g/ml for the Standard Dose group and 3.5 ± 2.2 g/ml for the Low Dose \ngroup. The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to receive adalimumab \ntreatment eow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from eow to weekly regimen, the mean \n(±SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at Week 52 were 15.3 ± 11.4 μg/ml (40/20 mg, weekly) and \n6.7 ± 3.5 μg/ml (20/10 mg, weekly).  \n \nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. The \npredicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an initial \nincrease in systemic exposure. \n \nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response relationship \nwas established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent adalimumab \nplasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 response (EC50) was \n3 μg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 μg/ml).  \n \nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, \nrespectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab concentrations, \nboth with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 μg/ml (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and 1.9-10.5, \nrespectively). \n \nAdults \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab was \nslow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The average \nabsolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 to \n15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-life \nwas approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several rheumatoid \narthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 g/ml (without \nconcomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 g/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. The serum \nadalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following 20, 40 and \n80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 g/ml during \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 40 mg Humira \non Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 g/ml during the \ninduction period. A loading dose of 160 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 80 mg Humira on Week 2 \nachieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 g/ml during the induction period. \nMean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 g/ml were observed in Crohn’s disease patients who \nreceived a maintenance dose of 40 mg Humira every other week. \n \nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week starting at Week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \napproximately 8 to 10 g/ml. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation predicted \ncomparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other week when \ncompared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, patients with \nadolescent HS, and paediatric patients ≥ 40 kg with CD). \n \nElimination \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum levels \nof free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower in \npatients with measurable AAA. \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \nHumira has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, repeated \ndose toxicity, and genotoxicity.   \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of harm \nto the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of fertility \nand postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models for an \nantibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralising antibodies in \nrodents.  \n \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nHumira in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or \nmore disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Humira can be given as monotherapy in case \nof intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for the \nefficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Humira has not been studied in patients aged less than 2 years.  \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and \nolder, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see section \n5.1). \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from \n4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical therapy \nand phototherapies. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa) \nin adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy (see \nsections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease  \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or \nhave contraindications for such therapies. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \ncorticosteroids and/or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have \nmedical contraindications for such therapies. \n \nPaediatric Uveitis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients from \n2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, or in \nwhom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration   \n \nHumira treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of conditions for which Humira is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised to consult with \nan appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Humira (see section 4.4). Patients treated with \nHumira should be given the Patient Reminder Card. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Humira if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.  \n \nDuring treatment with Humira, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n \nPosology \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years \nof age is based on body weight (Table 1). Humira is administered every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection. \n \n\nTable 1. Humira Dose for Patients with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis  \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n10 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued \ntherapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in patients aged less than 2 years for this indication. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis from 6 years of age is based \non body weight (Table 2).  Humira is administered every other week via subcutaneous injection. \n\n \nTable 2. Humira Dose for Patients with Enthesitis-Related Arthritis  \n\n \nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nHumira has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 years. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe recommended Humira dose for patients with plaque psoriasis from 4 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 3). Humira is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \n\nTable 3. Humira Dose for Paediatric Patients with Plaque Psoriasis  \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg Initial dose of 20 mg, followed by \n20 mg given every other week \n\nstarting one week after the initial \ndose \n\n≥ 30 kg Initial dose of 40 mg, followed by \n40 mg given every other week \n\nstarting one week after the initial \ndose \n\n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient not responding within this \ntime period. \n \nIf retreatment with Humira is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration should be \nfollowed. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nThe safety of Humira in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean of \n13 months. \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 4 years for this indication. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg) \n \nThere are no clinical trials with Humira in adolescent patients with HS.   \n \nThe posology of Humira in these patients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling and \nsimulation (see section 5.2). \n \nThe recommended Humira dose is 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at \nWeek 1 via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nIn adolescent patients with inadequate response to Humira 40 mg every other week, an increase in dosage \nto 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be considered. \n \nAntibiotics may be continued during treatment with Humira if necessary. It is recommended that the \npatient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with \nHumira.  \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement \nwithin this time period.   \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Humira may be re-introduced as appropriate. \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see adult data in \nsection 5.1). \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 12 years in this indication. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with Crohn’s disease from 6 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 4). Humira is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \n\nTable 4.

Humira is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \n\nTable 5. Humira Dose for Paediatric Patients with Ulcerative Colitis  \n\nPatient Weight Induction Dose \nMaintenance Dose \n\nStarting at Week 4* \n< 40 kg • 80 mg at Week 0 (given as two 40 \n\nmg injections in one day) and \n• 40 mg at Week 2 (given as one 40 \n\nmg injection)\n\n• 40 mg every other week \n\n≥ 40 kg • 160 mg at Week 0 (given as four \n40 mg injections in one day or \ntwo 40 mg injections per day for \ntwo consecutive days) and \n\n• 80 mg at Week 2 (given as two 40 \nmg injections in one day)\n\n• 80 mg every other week \n\n* Paediatric patients who turn 18 years of age while on Humira should continue their prescribed \nmaintenance dose. \n\n  \n\nContinued therapy beyond 8 weeks should be carefully considered in patients not showing signs of \nresponse within this time period. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 6 years in this indication. \n \nHumira may be available in different strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds.  \n \nPaediatric Uveitis  \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for paediatric patients with uveitis from 2 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 6). Humira is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \nIn paediatric uveitis, there is no experience in the treatment with Humira without concomitant treatment \nwith methotrexate. \n \n\nTable 6. Humira Dose for Paediatric Patients with Uveitis \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n< 30 kg 20 mg every other week in \ncombination with methotrexate \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week in \ncombination with methotrexate \n\n \nWhen Humira therapy is initiated, a loading dose of 40 mg for patients < 30 kg or 80 mg for patients ≥ 30 \nkg may be administered one week prior to the start of maintenance therapy. No clinical data are available \non the use of a Humira loading dose in children < 6 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 2 years in this indication.  \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n \nHumira has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nHumira is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the package \nleaflet. \n \nHumira is available in other strengths and presentations. \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use   \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function may \nincrease the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for infections, \nincluding tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Humira. Because the elimination of \nadalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period. \n \nTreatment with Humira should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \nlocalised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis and \npatients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with Humira \nshould be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Humira should be monitored \nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Humira should be discontinued if \na patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or antifungal therapy \nshould be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when considering \nthe use of Humira in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which \nmay predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. \n \nSerious infections \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving Humira.   \n \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported.  \n \nTuberculosis \n \nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients receiving \nHumira. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) tuberculosis.  \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with Humira, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(“latent”) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of patient \nhistory of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and previous \nand/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest \nX-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the \nconduct and results of these tests are recorded in the Patient Reminder Card. Prescribers are reminded of \nthe risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or \nimmunocompromised.  \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Humira therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully considered. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted.   \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis \ntreatment before the initiation of Humira, and in accordance with local recommendations.  \n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of Humira in \npatients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for tuberculosis and \nin patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment \ncannot be confirmed.   \n \nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients \ntreated with Humira. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active tuberculosis have \nredeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with Humira. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \ninfection (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or after \ntherapy with Humira.  \n \nOther opportunistic infections \n \nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nHumira. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-antagonists and \nthis has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal outcomes.  \n \nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant shock \nan invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Humira should be promptly \ndiscontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made \nin consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive fungal infections. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Humira, who are \nchronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal outcome. Patients \nshould be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Humira. For patients who test positive \nfor hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is \nrecommended. \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Humira should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms \nof active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. \nAdequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with \nTNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients who develop HBV \nreactivation, Humira should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be initiated.  \n \nNeurological events  \n \nTNF-antagonists including Humira have been associated in rare instances with new onset or exacerbation \nof clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease \nincluding multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-\nBarré syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Humira in patients with pre-\n\n\n\n52 \n\nexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of \nHumira should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between \nintermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in \npatients with non-infectious intermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of Humira therapy and regularly \nduring treatment to assess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders.  \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nSerious allergic reactions associated with Humira were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious allergic \nreactions associated with Humira were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of serious allergic \nreactions including anaphylaxis have been received following Humira administration. If an anaphylactic \nreaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Humira should be discontinued \nimmediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n \nImmunosuppression \n \nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with Humira, there was no evidence of \ndepression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in \nenumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been \nreported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma \nand leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, \nwhich complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of \nlymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including \nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases \nrepresented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with \nimmunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with \nTNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.  \n \nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated with \nadalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. \nSome of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with Humira have occurred in young adult patients on \nconcomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for inflammatory bowel disease. The \npotential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and Humira should be carefully \nconsidered. A risk for the development of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Humira \ncannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom treatment \nwith Humira is continued following development of malignancy. Thus, additional caution should be \nexercised in considering Humira treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy or \npsoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-\nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Humira. Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma \n\n\n\n53 \n\nhave also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab (see section 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients with \nmoderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung \nor head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients \nhad a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist in \nCOPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking. \n \nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia or \ncolon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma \n(for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), or who had \na prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular intervals before \ntherapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy and biopsies per \nlocal recommendations. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with Humira. All patients should be advised to seek \nimmediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. \npersistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Humira. Discontinuation of Humira therapy should be \nconsidered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n \nVaccinations \n \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by \nlive vaccines in patients receiving Humira.   \n \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating Humira therapy. \n \nPatients on Humira may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration of live \nvaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for 5 months \nfollowing the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nCongestive heart failure \n \nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality \ndue to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also \nbeen reported in patients receiving Humira. Humira should be used with caution in patients with mild \nheart failure (NYHA class I/II). Humira is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure (see section \n4.3). Treatment with Humira must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms \nof congestive heart failure. \n \nAutoimmune processes \n \nTreatment with Humira may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of long-term \ntreatment with Humira on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient develops \nsymptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Humira and is positive for \n\n\n\n54 \n\nantibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Humira should not be given (see section \n4.8). \n \nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists \n \nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the \nnature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. (See section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDS (e.g, anakinra and abatacept) or \nother TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, \nincluding serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. (See section 4.5). \n \nSurgery \n \nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with Humira. The long half-\nlife of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A patient who \nrequires surgery while on Humira should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions \nshould be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving \nHumira.  \n \nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that Humira does not worsen or cause \nstrictures. \n \nElderly \n \nThe frequency of serious infections among Humira treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) was \nhigher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention \nregarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSee Vaccinations above. \n \nExcipients with known effects \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nHumira has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic \narthritis patients taking Humira as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate. Antibody \nformation was lower when Humira was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as \nmonotherapy. Administration of Humira without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of \nantibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1).  \n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nThe combination of Humira and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent administration \nof biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”).  \n \nThe combination of Humira and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy \nand continue its use for at least five months after the last Humira treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large number (approximately 2100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1500 exposed during the first trimester, \ndoes not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn’s disease (CD) \ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated with \nadalimumab were enrolled.  The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. The \nrate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 (8.7%) in \nthe adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with RA (unadjusted \nOR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women with CD and 3/32 \n(9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). The adjusted OR \n(accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD combined. There were \nno distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for the secondary endpoints \nspontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and serious or opportunistic \ninfections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation of data may be impacted due \nto methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-randomized design. \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n(see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNF, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune \nresponses in the newborn.  Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. \n \nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration of \nlive vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk at \nvery low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% \nof the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and \nhave poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, \nHumira can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nHumira may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \nimpairment may occur following administration of Humira (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nHumira was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months or \nmore. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease, \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) as \nwell as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa \nand uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients receiving Humira and 3,801 \npatients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled period. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking Humira and 5.4% for control treated \npatients. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory \ntract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), \nheadache and musculoskeletal pain. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for Humira. TNF-antagonists, such as Humira affect the \nimmune system and their use may affect the body’s defence against infection and cancer. \nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV reactivation \nand various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been reported with use \nof Humira. \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include \nrare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events and reports of \nlupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \nadult patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on postmarketing \nexperience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 7 below: very common \n( 1/10); common ( 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon ( 1/1,000 to< 1/100); rare ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); \nand not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest frequency seen among the \nvarious indications has been included.

uveitis treated with Humira every other week was consistent with the \nknown safety profile of Humira. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9% of patients treated with Humira developed \ninjection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 7.2% of \npatients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate \ndiscontinuation of the medicinal product.  \n \nInfections  \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in the \nHumira treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients. The \ninfections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and sinusitis. Most \npatients continued on Humira after the infection resolved.   \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in Humira treated patients and 0.03 per \npatient year in placebo and active control − treated patients.   \n \nIn controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with Humira, serious infections (including fatal \ninfections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including \nmiliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated or \nextrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystis, candidiasis, \naspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first eight months after \ninitiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years during \nHumira trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \nenthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric patients with an \nexposure of 498.1 patient years during Humira trials in paediatric patients with Crohn’s disease. No \nmalignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of 80.0 patient years during a \nHumira trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No malignancies were observed in 93 \npaediatric patients with an exposure of 65.3 patient years during a Humira trial in paediatric patients with \nulcerative colitis. No malignancies were observed in 60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 \npatient years during a Humira trial in paediatric patients with uveitis. \n \n\n\n\n63 \n\nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal Humira trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in patients \nwith moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s \ndisease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, \nwere observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5)  per 1,000 patient-years among 5,291 \nHumira treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per 1,000 patient-years among 3,444 control \npatients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for Humira and 3.8 months for control-treated \npatients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 \npatient-years among Humira-treated patients and 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among control \npatients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of \n2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among Humira-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-\nyears among control patients. The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per \n1,000 patient-years among Humira-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among \ncontrol patients. \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open label extension \nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over 26,439 \npatient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin \ncancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient years. The observed rate of non-melanoma skin cancers is \napproximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is approximately 1.3 per \n1,000 patient years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.3 \nper 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n \nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with \nadalimumab (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies  \n \nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis studies \nI − V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with Humira and 8.1% of placebo and active \ncontrol − treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at \nWeek 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with Humira in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \nstudies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved \nfollowing discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system \nsymptoms. \n \nHepato-biliary events \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis with a \ncontrol period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.7% of \nHumira-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were \n4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred \nin 6.1% of Humira-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. Most ALT elevations occurred \nwith concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of Humira \nin patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to <4 years. \n \n\n\n\n64 \n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis with a control \nperiod ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of Humira-treated \npatients and 0.9% of controlled-treated patients.  \n \nIn the Phase 3 trial of Humira in patients with paediatric Crohn’s disease which evaluated efficacy and \nsafety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted induction \ntherapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of patients of \nwhom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with plaque psoriasis with a control period duration \nranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of Humira-treated patients and \n1.8% of control-treated patients.  \n \nNo ALT elevations ≥ 3 X ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of Humira in paediatric patients with plaque \npsoriasis. \n \nIn controlled trials of Humira (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg \nevery week starting at Week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control period duration \nranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of Humira-treated patients and \n0.6% of control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled trials of Humira (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week \nstarting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of 166.5 days and \n105.0 days in Humira-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN \noccurred in 2.4% of Humira-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients.  \nIn the controlled Phase 3 trial of Humira in patients with paediatric ulcerative colitis (N=93) which \nevaluated efficacy and safety of a maintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every other week \n(N=31) and a maintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every Week (N=32), following body \nweight adjusted induction dosing of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0 and Week 1, and 1.2 \nmg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2 (N=63), or an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) \nat Week 0, placebo at Week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2 (N=30), ALT elevations ≥ \n3 X ULN occurred in 1.1% (1/93) of patients. \n \nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been post-\nmarketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, such \nas hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine \n \nIn adult Crohn’s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \nevents were seen with the combination of Humira and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared with \nHumira alone. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has been \nmultiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended dose.   \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors. \nATC code: L04AB04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.   \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes \nin the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 \nwith an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM).  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects  \n \nAfter treatment with Humira, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after Humira administration. Patients treated with Humira usually \nexperienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with Humira. In \npatients with Crohn’s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing inflammatory markers in the \ncolon including a significant reduction of expression of TNFα was seen. Endoscopic studies in intestinal \nmucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab treated patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis \n \nHumira was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The efficacy and \nsafety of Humira were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. Some \npatients were treated for up to 120 months duration.  \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were  18 \nyears old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had insufficient \nefficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) every week and \nwhose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of \nHumira or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were  18 \nyears old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses of 20 or \n40 mg of Humira were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on alternative \nweeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. No other \ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were  18 \nyears old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have been \nintolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first received \nplacebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of Humira every week for \n52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of Humira every other week with placebo injections on \nalternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension \nphase in which 40 mg of Humira/MTX was administered every other week up to 10 years. \n \nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were  18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic \ndrug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a \nminimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, \nsulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of Humira or placebo every other week \nfor 24 weeks.   \n \nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nHumira 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, Humira 40 mg every other week \nmonotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of progression \nof joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 weeks, 497 \npatients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of Humira was administered every \nother week up to 10 years. \n \nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \npercent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA \nstudy V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at Week 52. RA studies III and V \nhad an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by X-ray \nresults). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life.  \n \nACR response \n \nThe percent of Humira-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent across RA \nstudies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in Table 8.  \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \nTable 8 ACR Responses in Placebo-Controlled Trials \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n \n\nResponse RA Study Ia** RA Study IIa** RA Study IIIa** \n \n\n Placebo/ \nMTXc \nn=60 \n\nHumirab/ MTXc\n\nn=63 \nPlacebo \nn=110 \n\nHumirab \nn=113 \n\nPlacebo/ \nMTXc \nn=200 \n\nHumirab/ MTXc\n\nn=207 \n\nACR 20    \n 6 months 13.3% 65.1% 19.1% 46.0% 29.5% 63.3%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 24.0% 58.9%\nACR 50    \n 6 months 6.7% 52.4% 8.2% 22.1% 9.5% 39.1%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 9.5% 41.5%\nACR 70    \n 6 months 3.3% 23.8% 1.8% 12.4% 2.5% 20.8%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 4.5% 23.2%\na RA  study I at 24 weeks, RA study II at 26 weeks , and RA study III at 24 and 52 weeks \nb 40 mg Humira administered every other week \nc MTX = methotrexate \n**p < 0.01, Humira versus placebo \n\n \nIn RA studies I-IV, all individual components of the ACR response criteria (number of tender and swollen \njoints, physician and patient assessment of disease activity and pain, disability index (HAQ) scores and \nCRP (mg/dl) values) improved at 24 or 26 weeks compared to placebo. In RA study III, these \nimprovements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained \nresponse when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to Humira 40 mg every \nother week, 114 patients continued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 5 years. Among those, 86 \npatients (75.4%) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2%) had ACR 50 responses; and 41 patients \n(36%) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on Humira 40 mg every other week \nfor 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0%) had ACR 20 responses; 56 patients (69.1%) had ACR 50 \nresponses; and 43 patients (53.1%) had ACR 70 responses. \n \nIn RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with Humira plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p < 0.001).   \n \nIn RA studies I-IV, Humira-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 responses \ncompared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. \n \nIn RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination therapy \nwith Humira and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than methotrexate \nmonotherapy and Humira monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at Week 104 (see Table \n9). \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \nTable 9 ACR Responses in RA Study V \n\n(percent of patients) \n \n\nResponse \nMTX \nn=257 \n\nHumira \nn=274 \n\nHumira/MTX \nn=268 \n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nACR 20  \n Week 52 62.6% 54.4% 72.8% 0.013 < 0.001 0.043\n Week 104 56.0% 49.3% 69.4% 0.002 < 0.001 0.140\nACR 50  \n Week 52 45.9% 41.2% 61.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.317\n Week 104 42.8% 36.9% 59.0% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.162\nACR 70  \n Week 52 27.2% 25.9% 45.5% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.656\n Week 104 28.4% 28.1% 46.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.864\na p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \n\ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \nb p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \n\ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \nc p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy using \n\nthe Mann-Whitney U test \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study V, ACR response rates were maintained when followed for up to \n10 years. Of 542 patients who were randomised to Humira 40 mg every other week, 170 patients \ncontinued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 154 patients (90.6%) had ACR \n20 responses; 127 patients (74.7%) had ACR 50 responses; and 102 patients (60.0%) had ACR 70 \nresponses. \n \nAt Week 52, 42.9% of patients who received Humira/methotrexate combination therapy achieved clinical \nremission (DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6) compared to 20.6% of patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy and \n23.4% of patients receiving Humira monotherapy. Humira/methotrexate combination therapy was \nclinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and Humira monotherapy (p < 0.001) in \nachieving a low disease state in patients with recently diagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. \nThe response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447). Of 342 subjects originally \nrandomized to Humira monotherapy or Humira/methotrexate combination therapy who entered the open-\nlabel extension study, 171 subjects completed 10 years of Humira treatment. Among those, 109 subjects \n(63.7%) were reported to be in remission at 10 years. \n \nRadiographic response \n \nIn RA study III, where Humira treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in \nmodified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score. \nHumira/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients \nreceiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 10).  \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA Study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is \nmaintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated with \n40 mg Humira every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients showed no \nprogression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. At \n10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg Humira every other week were evaluated \nradiographically. Among those, 40 patients showed no progression of structural damage defined by a \nchange from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \nTable 10 Radiographic Mean Changes Over 12 Months in RA Study III \n\n \n Placebo/ \n\nMTXa \nHumira/MTX \n40 mg every \nother week \n\nPlacebo/MTX-\nHumira/MTX (95% \n\nConfidence \nIntervalb)\n\np-value \n\nTotal Sharp Score 2.7 0.1 2.6 (1.4, 3.8) < 0.001c \n\nErosion score 1.6 0.0 1.6 (0.9, 2.2) < 0.001 \nJSNd score 1.0 0.1 0.9 (0.3, 1.4)   0.002 \n\namethotrexate \nb95% confidence intervals for the differences in change scores between methotrexate and Humira.  \ncBased on rank analysis  \ndJoint Space Narrowing \n \nIn RA study V, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified \nTotal Sharp Score (see Table 11). \n \n\nTable 11 Radiographic Mean Changes at Week 52 in RA Study V \n \n\n \n\nMTX \nn=257 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval) \n\nHumira \nn=274 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval)\n\nHumira/MTX \nn=268 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval)\n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nTotal Sharp \nScore \n\n5.7 (4.2-7.3) 3.0 (1.7-4.3) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) < 0.001 0.0020 < 0.001 \n\nErosion score 3.7 (2.7-4.7) 1.7 (1.0-2.4) 0.8 (0.4-1.2) < 0.001 0.0082 < 0.001\nJSN score 2.0 (1.2-2.8) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) 0.5 (0-1.0) < 0.001 0.0037 0.151\n\na p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \n\nb p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test  \n\nc p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n\n \nFollowing 52 weeks and 104 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients without progression (change \nfrom baseline in modified Total Sharp Score  0.5) was significantly higher with Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy (63.8% and 61.2% respectively) compared to methotrexate monotherapy (37.4% and \n33.5% respectively, p < 0.001) and Humira monotherapy (50.7%, p < 0.002 and 44.5%, p < 0.001 \nrespectively). \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA study V, the mean change from baseline at Year 10 in the modified \nTotal Sharp Score was 10.8, 9.2 and 3.9 in patients originally randomized to methotrexate monotherapy, \nHumira monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate combination therapy, respectively. The corresponding \nproportions of patients with no radiographic progression were 31.3%, 23.7% and 36.7% respectively. \n \nQuality of life and physical function \n \nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the Health \nAssessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, which was a \npre-specified primary endpoint at Week 52 in RA study III. All doses/schedules of Humira in all four \nstudies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the HAQ from \n\n\n\n70 \n\nbaseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was seen at Week 52. Results from \nthe Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of Humira in all four studies support these \nfindings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically \nsignificant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other week dose. A statistically significant \ndecrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was \nseen in all three studies in which it was assessed (RA studies I, III, IV). \n \nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued treatment \nmaintained improvement through Week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. Improvement in \nquality of life was measured up to Week 156 (36 months) and improvement was maintained through that \ntime. \n \nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for Humira/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and Humira monotherapy at Week 52, which was maintained through \nWeek 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in \nphysical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment. \n \nAdult plaque psoriasis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis ( 10% \nBSA involvement and PASI  12 or  10) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy in \nrandomised, double-blind studies. 73% of patients enrolled in Psoriasis Studies I and II had received prior \nsystemic therapy or phototherapy. The safety and efficacy of Humira were also studied in adult patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with concomitant hand and/or foot psoriasis who were \ncandidates for systemic therapy in a randomised double-blind study (Psoriasis Study III).   \n \nPsoriasis Study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, patients \nreceived placebo or Humira at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one \nweek after the initial dose. After 16weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least a PASI 75 response \n(PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline), entered period B and received open-label \n40 mg Humira every other week. Patients who maintained PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were \noriginally randomised to active therapy in Period A, were re-randomised in period C to receive 40 mg \nHumira every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups, the mean \nbaseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline PGA score ranged from “moderate” (53% of subjects \nincluded) to “severe” (41%) to “very severe” (6%). \n \nPsoriasis Study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of Humira versus methotrexate and \nplacebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg and thereafter dose \nincreases up to Week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by \n40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for 16 weeks. There are no data available \ncomparing Humira and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. Patients receiving MTX who achieved a \nPASI 50 response at Week 8 and/or 12 did not receive further dose increases. Across all treatment \ngroups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the baseline PGA score ranged from “mild” (<1%) to \n“moderate” (48%) to “severe” (46%) to “very severe” (6%). \n \nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an open-label \nextension trial, where Humira was given for at least an additional 108 weeks. \n \nIn Psoriasis Studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 \nresponse from baseline at Week 16 (see Tables 12 and 13). \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \nTable 12 \n\nPs Study I (REVEAL)  - Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n \nPlacebo \nN=398 \nn (%) \n\nHumira 40 mg eow \nN=814 \nn (%) \n\n    PASI 75a 26 (6.5) 578 (70.9)b \n    PASI 100 3 (0.8) 163 (20.0)b \n    PGA: Clear/minimal 17 (4.3) 506 (62.2)b \na Percent of patients achieving PASI75 response was calculated as centre-\nadjusted rate \nb p<0.001, Humira vs. placebo\n\n \n\nTable 13 \n Ps Study II (CHAMPION) Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n Placebo \nN=53 \nn (%)\n\nMTX \nN=110 \nn (%)\n\nHumira 40 mg eow \nN=108 \nn (%) \n\n    PASI 75 10 (18.9) 39 (35.5) 86 (79.6) a, b \n    PASI 100 1 (1.9) 8 (7.3) 18 (16.7) c, d \n    PGA: \nClear/minimal \n\n6 (11.3) 33 (30.0) 79 (73.1) a, b \n\na p<0.001 Humira vs. placebo \nb p<0.001 Humira vs. methotrexate \nc p<0.01 Humira vs. placebo \nd p<0.05 Humira vs. methotrexate\n\n \nIn Psoriasis Study I, 28% of patients who were PASI 75 responders and were re-randomised to placebo at \nWeek 33 compared to 5% continuing on Humira, p<0.001, experienced “loss of adequate response” (PASI \nscore after Week 33 and on or before Week 52 that resulted in a <PASI 50 response relative to baseline \nwith a minimum of a 6-point increase in PASI score relative to Week 33). Of the patients who lost \nadequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into the open-label extension trial, \n38% (25/66) and 55% (36/66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and 24 weeks of re-treatment, \nrespectively. \n \nA total of 233 PASI 75 responders at Week 16 and Week 33 received continuous Humira therapy for \n52 weeks in Psoriasis Study I, and continued Humira in the open-label extension trial. PASI 75 and PGA \nof clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7% and 59.0%, respectively, after an \nadditional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all patients who \ndropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, were considered \nnon-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 69.6% and \n55.7%, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). \n \nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label \nextension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a median \ntime to relapse (decline to PGA “moderate” or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of these patients \nexperienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of patients who entered the \nretreatment period had a response of PGA “clear” or “minimal” after 16 weeks of retreatment, irrespective \nof whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1%[123/178] and 88.8% [95/107] for patients who \nrelapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, respectively). A similar safety profile was \nobserved during retreatment as before withdrawal. \n \n\n\n\n72 \n\nSignificant improvements at Week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (Studies I and II) and MTX \n(Study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In Study I, improvements in \nthe physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also significant compared to \nplacebo. \n \nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to 40 mg \nweekly due to a PASI response below 50%, 26.4% (92/349) and 37.8% (132/349) of patients achieved \nPASI 75 response at Week 12 and 24, respectively. \n \nPsoriasis Study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of Humira versus placebo in 72 patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients received an \ninitial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) \nor placebo for 16 weeks. At Week 16, a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients who \nreceived Humira achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands and/or feet compared to patients \nwho received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively [P = 0.014]). \n \nPsoriasis Study IV compared efficacy and safety of Humira versus placebo in 217 adult patients with \nmoderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by 40 mg \nevery other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label \nHumira treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included the Modified Nail \nPsoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician’s Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) \nand the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 14). Humira demonstrated a treatment benefit in \nnail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin involvement (BSA≥10% (60% of patients) and \nBSA<10% and ≥5% (40% of patients)).     \n \n\nTable 14 \nPs Study IV Efficacy Results at 16, 26 and 52 Weeks \n\nEndpoint Week 16 \nPlacebo-Controlled\n\nWeek 26 \nPlacebo-Controlled\n\nWeek 52 \nOpen-label\n\nPlacebo \nN=108 \n\nHumira \n40 mg eow \n\nN=109\n\nPlacebo\nN=108 \n\nHumira \n40 mg eow \n\nN=109\n\nHumira \n40 mg eow  \n\nN=80 \n≥ mNAPSI 75 (%) 2.9 26.0a 3.4 46.6a 65.0 \nPGA-F clear/minimal and \n≥2-grade improvement (%) \n\n2.9 29.7a 6.9 48.9a 61.3 \n\nPercent Change in Total \nFingernail NAPSI (%) \n\n-7.8 -44.2 a -11.5 -56.2a -72.2 \n\na p<0.001, Humira vs. placebo  \n \nHumira treated patients showed statistically significant improvements at Week 26 compared with placebo \nin the DLQI.  \n \nAdult hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies \nand an open-label extension study in adult patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) \nwho were intolerant, had a contraindication or an inadequate response to at least a 3-month trial of \nsystemic antibiotic therapy. The patients in HS-I and HS-II had Hurley Stage II or III disease with at least \n3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. \n \nStudy HS-I (PIONEER I) evaluated 307 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients received \nplacebo or Humira at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every week \nstarting at Week 4 to Week 11. Concomitant antibiotic use was not allowed during the study. After \n\n\n\n73 \n\n12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received Humira in Period A were re-randomised in Period B to 1 \nof 3 treatment groups (Humira 40 mg every week, Humira 40 mg every other week, or placebo from Week \n12 to Week 35). Patients who had been randomised to placebo in Period A were assigned to receive \nHumira 40 mg every week in Period B. \n \nStudy HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients received \nplacebo or Humira at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 and 40 mg every week \nstarting at Week 4 to Week 11. 19.3% of patients had continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the \nstudy.  After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received Humira in Period A were re-randomised in \nPeriod B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (Humira 40 mg every week, Humira 40 mg every other week, or \nplacebo from Week 12 to Week 35). Patients who had been randomised to placebo in Period A were \nassigned to receive placebo in Period B. \n \nPatients participating in Studies HS-I and HS-II were eligible to enrol into an open-label extension study \nin which Humira 40mg was administered every week. Mean exposure in all adalimumab population was \n762 days. Throughout all 3 studies patients used topical antiseptic wash daily. \n \nClinical Response \n \nReduction of inflammatory lesions and prevention of worsening of abscesses and draining fistulas was \nassessed using Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR; at least a 50% reduction in total \nabscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining \nfistula count relative to Baseline). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating \nScale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 point scale.  \n \nAt Week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with Humira versus placebo achieved \nHiSCR.   At Week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients in Study HS-II experienced a clinically \nrelevant decrease in HS-related skin pain (see Table 15). Patients treated with Humira had significantly \nreduced risk of disease flare during the initial 12 weeks of treatment. \n \n\nTable 15:  Efficacy Results at 12 Weeks, HS Studies I and II \n \n\n \n\nHS Study I HS Study II \n\nPlacebo\nHumira 40 mg \n\nWeekly Placebo  \nHumira 40 mg \n\nWeekly \n\nHidradenitis Suppurativa \nClinical Response (HiSCR)a   \n\nN = 154 \n40 (26.0%) \n\nN = 153 \n64 (41.8%) * \n\nN=163 \n45 (27.6%) \n\nN=163 \n96 (58.9%) *** \n\n≥30% Reduction in Skin \nPainb \n\nN = 109 \n27 (24.8%)\n\nN = 122 \n34 (27.9%)\n\nN=111 \n23 (20.7%) \n\nN=105 \n48 (45.7%) ***\n\n* P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, Humira versus placebo  \na Among all randomised patients. \nb Among patients with baseline HS-related skin pain assessment ≥ 3, based on Numeric Rating \n\nScale 0 – 10; 0 = no skin pain, 10 = skin pain as bad as you can imagine.\n \nTreatment with Humira 40 mg every week significantly reduced the risk of worsening of abscesses and \ndraining fistulas. Approximately twice the proportion of patients in the placebo group in the first 12 weeks \nof Studies HS-I and HS-II, compared with those in the Humira group experienced worsening of abscesses \n(23.0% vs 11.4%, respectively) and draining fistulas (30.0% vs 13.9%, respectively). \n \nGreater improvements at Week 12 from baseline compared to placebo were demonstrated in skin-specific \nhealth-related quality of life, as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; Studies HS-I \nand HS-II), patient global satisfaction with medication treatment as measured by the Treatment \n\n\n\n74 \n\nSatisfaction Questionnaire - medication (TSQM; Studies HS-I and HS-II), and physical health as \nmeasured by the physical component summary score of the SF-36 (Study HS-I). \n \nIn patients with at least a partial response to Humira 40 mg weekly at Week 12, the HiSCR rate at Week \n36 was higher in patients who continued weekly Humira than in patients in whom dosing frequency was \nreduced to every other week, or in whom treatment was withdrawn (see Table 16).   \n \n\nTable 16:  Proportion of Patientsa Achieving HiSCRb at Weeks 24 and 36 After  \nTreatment Reassignment from Weekly Humira at Week 12 \n\n \n\n \n\nPlacebo\n(treatment \n\nwithdrawal) \nN = 73 \n\nHumira 40 mg \nevery other week \n\nN = 70 \n\nHumira 40 mg \nweekly \nN = 70 \n\nWeek 24 24 (32.9%) 36 (51.4%) 40 (57.1%) \nWeek 36 22 (30.1%) 28 (40.0%) 39 (55.7%) \n\na Patients with at least a partial response to Humira 40 mg weekly after 12 \nweeks of treatment. \n\nb Patients meeting protocol-specified criteria for loss of response or no \nimprovement were required to discontinue from the studies and were \ncounted as nonresponders.\n\n   \nAmong patients who were at least partial responders at Week 12, and who received continuous weekly \nHumira therapy, the HiSCR rate at Week 48 was 68.3% and at Week 96 was 65.1%. Longer term \ntreatment with Humira 40 mg weekly for 96 weeks identified no new safety findings. \n \nAmong patients whose Humira treatment was withdrawn at Week 12 in Studies HS-I and HS-II, the \nHiSCR rate 12 weeks after re-introduction of Humira 40 mg weekly returned to levels similar to that \nobserved before withdrawal (56.0 %). \n \nAdult Crohn’s disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in over 1500 patients with moderately to severely active \nCrohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI)  220 and  450) in randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80% of patients continued to receive at least one of these \nmedications.  \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD Study I \n(CLASSIC I) and CD Study II (GAIN). In CD Study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were \nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg Humira at Week 0 and \n80 mg at Week 2, 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. In \nCD Study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to \nreceive either 160 mg Humira at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. The primary \nnon-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD Study III, 854 patients \nreceived open-label 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. At Week 4 patients were randomised to \n40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks. Patients in \nclinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at Week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those \nnot in clinical response at Week 4. Corticosteroid taper was permitted after Week 8.  \n \nCD study I and CD study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 17. \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \nTable 17 \n\nInduction of Clinical Remission and Response \n(Percent of Patients) \n\n CD Study I: Infliximab Naive \nPatients \n\nCD Study II: Infliximab \nExperienced Patients \n\n Placebo \nN=74 \n\nHumira \n80/40 mg \n\nN = 75 \n\nHumira  \n160/80 mg \n\nN=76 \n\nPlacebo \nN=166 \n\nHumira  \n160/80 mg \n\nN=159 \n\nWeek 4      \n\nClinical remission 12% 24% 36%* 7% 21%* \n\nClinical response (CR-\n100) \n\n24% 37% 49%** 25% 38%** \n\nAll p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for Humira versus placebo \n* p < 0.001 \n** p < 0.01 \n\n \nSimilar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by Week 8 and \nadverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group. \n \nIn CD Study III, at Week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the \nprimary analysis. Of those in clinical response at Week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to other TNF-\nantagonists. Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 18. Clinical remission \nresults remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF-antagonist exposure. \n \nDisease-related hospitalisations and surgeries were statistically significantly reduced with adalimumab \ncompared with placebo at Week 56. \n \n\nTable 18 \nMaintenance of Clinical Remission and Response \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n\n Placebo 40 mg Humira \nevery other week \n\n40 mg Humira\nevery week \n\nWeek 26 N=170 N=172 N=157 \n\nClinical remission 17% 40%* 47%* \n\nClinical response (CR-100) 27% 52%* 52%* \n\nPatients in steroid-free remission  \nfor >=90 daysa \n\n3% (2/66) 19% (11/58)** 15% (11/74)** \n\nWeek 56 N=170 N=172 N=157 \n\nClinical remission 12% 36%* 41%* \n\nClinical response (CR-100) 17% 41%* 48%* \n\nPatients in steroid-free remission  \nfor >=90 daysa \n\n5% (3/66) 29% (17/58)* 20% (15/74)** \n\n* p < 0.001 for Humira versus placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions \n** p < 0.02 for Humira versus placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions \na Of those receiving corticosteroids at baseline \n\n \n\n\n\n76 \n\nAmong patients who were not in response at Week 4, 43% of Humira maintenance patients responded by \nWeek 12 compared to 30% of placebo maintenance patients. These results suggest that some patients who \nhave not responded by Week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through Week 12. Therapy \ncontinued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section 4.2).   \n \n117/276 patients from CD study I and 272/777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed through \nat least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy. 88 and 189 patients, respectively, continued to be in \nclinical remission. Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and 233 patients, respectively. \n \nQuality of life \n \nIn CD Study I and CD Study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific inflammatory \nbowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at Week 4 in patients randomised to Humira \n80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at Weeks 26 and 56 in CD Study III as well \namong the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. \n \nAdult Uveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious intermediate, \nposterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomised, double-\nmasked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or Humira at an initial dose of \n80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. Concomitant stable \ndoses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted.  \n \nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of prednisone \n60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid \ndiscontinuation by Week 15.  \n \nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment (oral \nprednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent a \nmandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19.  \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was ´time to treatment failure´. Treatment failure was \ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal \nvascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected visual \nacuity (BCVA).  \n \nPatients who completed Studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term \nextension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on \nstudy medication beyond Week 78 until they had access to Humira. \n \nClinical Response \n \nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in \npatients treated with Humira versus patients receiving placebo (See Table 19). Both studies demonstrated \nan early and sustained effect of Humira on the treatment failure rate versus placebo (see Figure 1).  \n \n\n\n\n77 \n\nTable 19 \nTime to Treatment Failure in Studies UV I and UV II \n\n \nAnalysis \n Treatment \n\nN Failure \nN (%) \n\nMedian Time to \nFailure (months) \n\nHRa CI 95% \nfor HRa \n\nP Value b \n\nTime to Treatment Failure At or After Week 6 in Study UV I   \nPrimary analysis (ITT)   \n Placebo 107 84 (78.5) 3.0 -- -- -- \n Adalimumab 110 60 (54.5) 5.6 0.50 0.36, 0.70  < 0.001\nTime to Treatment Failure At or After Week 2 in Study UV II \nPrimary analysis (ITT)   \n Placebo 111 61 (55.0) 8.3 -- -- -- \n Adalimumab 115 45 (39.1) NEc 0.57 0.39, 0.84 0.004 \n\nNote: Treatment failure at or after Week 6 (Study UV I), or at or after Week 2 (Study UV II), was counted \nas event.

In Study UV II, statistically significant differences were observed \nfor visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of adalimumab. \n \nOf the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of Studies UV I and UV II, 60 \nsubjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to complications secondary to diabetic \nretinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary analysis of \nefficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of open-label \nadalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3%) were in quiescence (no active \ninflammatory lesions, AC cell grade  ≤ 0.5+, VH grade ≤ 0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose ≤ 7.5 mg \nper day, and 178 (66.2%) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA was either improved or maintained (< 5 \nletters deterioration) in 88.6% of the eyes at week 78. Data beyond Week 78 were generally consistent \nwith these results but the number of enrolled subjects declined after this time. Overall, among the patients \nwho discontinued the study, 18% discontinued due to adverse events, and 8% due to insufficient response \nto adalimumab treatment. \n \nQuality of Life \n \nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, \nusing the NEI VFQ-25. Humira was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with statistically \nsignificant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and total score in \nStudy UV I, and for general vision and mental health in Study UV II. Vision related effects were not \nnumerically in favour of Humira for colour vision in Study UVI and for colour vision, peripheral vision \nand near vision in Study UV II. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nFormation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of \nadalimumab. There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and the \noccurrence of adverse events. \n \n\n\n\n79 \n\nIn patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 4 to 17 years, anti- adalimumab \nantibodies were identified in 15.8% (27/171) of patients treated with adalimumab. In patients not given \nconcomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 25.6% (22/86) compared to 5.9% (5/85) when adalimumab \nwas used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were \n2 to < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing <15 kg, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in \n7% (1/15) of patients, and the one patient was receiving concomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with enthesitis-related arthritis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 10.9% (5/46) of \npatients treated with adalimumab. In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was \n13.6% (3/22), compared to 8.3% (2/24) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. \n \nPatients in rheumatoid arthritis studies I, II and III were tested at multiple time points for anti-adalimumab \nantibodies during the 6 to 12 month period. In the pivotal trials, anti-adalimumab antibodies were \nidentified in 5.5% (58/1053) of patients treated with adalimumab, compared to 0.5% (2/370) on placebo. \nIn patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when \nadalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate.   \n \nIn patients with paediatric psoriasis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 5/38 subjects (13%) \ntreated with 0.8 mg/kg adalimumab monotherapy. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 77/920 subjects (8.4%) \ntreated with adalimumab monotherapy. \n \nIn adult plaque psoriasis patients on long term adalimumab monotherapy who participated in a withdrawal \nand retreatment study, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment (11 of 482 subjects, 2.3%) \nwas similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal (11 of 590 subjects, 1.9%). \n \nIn patients with moderately to severely active paediatric Crohn’s disease, the rate of anti-adalimumab \nantibody development in patients receiving adalimumab was 3.3%.  \n \nIn adult patients with Crohn’s disease, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7/269 subjects \n(2.6%). \n \nIn adult patients with non-infectious uveitis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 4.8% (12/249) \nof patients treated with adalimumab. \n \nIn patients with moderately to severely active paediatric ulcerative colitis, the rate of anti-adalimumab \nantibody development in patients receiving adalimumab was 3%. \n \nBecause immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody rates with those from \nother products is not appropriate. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with active \npolyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA onset types \n(most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis). \n \npJIA I \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \nparallel − group study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in \nphase (OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or non- MTX-treated. \nPatients who were in the non-MTX stratum were either naïve to or had been withdrawn from MTX at \nleast two weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on stable doses of non-steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and or prednisone ( 0.2 mg /kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). In the \nOL LI phase all patients received 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg Humira every other week for \n16 weeks. The distribution of patients by age and minimum, median and maximum dose received during \nthe OL LI phase is presented in Table 20. \n \n\nTable 20 \nDistribution of patients by age and adalimumab dose received during the OL LI phase \n\n \nAge Group Number of patients at Baseline \n\nn (%) \nMinimum, median and \nmaximum dose \n\n4 to 7 years 31 (18.1) 10, 20 and 25 mg \n8 to 12 years 71 (41.5) 20, 25 and 40 mg \n13 to 17 years 69 (40.4) 25, 40 and 40 mg \n\n \nPatients demonstrating a Paediatric ACR 30 response at Week 16 were eligible to be randomised into the \ndouble blind (DB) phase and received either Humira 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg, or placebo \nevery other week for an additional 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare criteria were defined as a \nworsening of  30% from baseline in  3 of 6 Paediatric ACR core criteria,  2 active joints, and \nimprovement of  30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at disease flare, patients \nwere eligible to enrol into the open label extension phase.  \n \n\nTable 21 \nPed ACR 30 Responses in the JIA study \n\n \nStratum MTX Without MTX \nPhase  \nOL-LI 16 weeks  \n\nPed ACR 30 \nresponse (n/N) \n\n94.1% (80/85) 74.4% (64/86) \n\n                                                          Efficacy Outcomes\nDouble Blind 32 weeks Humira / MTX \n\n(N = 38) \n \n\nPlacebo / MTX \n(N = 37) \n\nHumira  \n(N = 30) \n\nPlacebo \n(N = 28) \n\nDisease flares at \nthe end of \n32weeksa (n/N) \n\n36.8% (14/38) 64.9% (24/37)b 43.3% (13/30) 71.4% \n(20/28)c \n\nMedian time to \ndisease flare \n\n>32 weeks 20 weeks >32 weeks 14 weeks \n\n \n\na Ped ACR 30/50/70 responses Week 48 significantly greater than those of placebo treated patients  \nb p = 0.015 \nc p = 0.031 \n \n\nAmongst those who responded at Week 16 (n=144), the Paediatric ACR 30/50/70/90 responses were \nmaintained for up to six years in the OLE phase in patients who received Humira throughout the study. \n\n\n\n81 \n\nOver all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of the baseline age group 13 to \n17 years were treated 6 years or longer. \n \nOverall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with the \ncombination of Humira and MTX compared to Humira alone. Taking these results into consideration, \nHumira is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as monotherapy in patients for \nwhom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2).  \n \npJIA II \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children (2 - \n<4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg) with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. \nThe patients received 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of Humira up to a maximum of 20 mg every \nother week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During the study, most subjects used \nconcomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. \n \nAt Week 12 and Week 24, PedACR30 response was 93.5% and 90.0%, respectively, using the observed \ndata approach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR50/70/90 at Week 12 and Week 24 were \n90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Amongst those who responded (Paediatric \nACR 30) at Week 24 (n=27 out of 30 patients), the Paediatric ACR 30 responses were maintained for up \nto 60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received Humira throughout this time period. Overall, 20 \nsubjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study in 46 \npaediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were randomised \nto receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of Humira up to a maximum of 40 mg, or placebo \nevery other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-label (OL) period during \nwhich patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of Humira up to a maximum of 40 mg every other week \nsubcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change from \nBaseline to Week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints \nwith loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with mean percent decrease of -\n62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the Humira group compared to -11.6% (median \npercent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo group. Improvement in number of active joints with \narthritis was maintained during the OL period through Week 156 for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the \nHumira group who remained in the study. Although not statistically significant, the majority of patients \ndemonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender \njoint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), Paediatric ACR 50 response, and Paediatric ACR 70 \nresponse. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of Humira was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of 114 paediatric \npatients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a Physician’s Global \nAssessment (PGA) ≥ 4 or > 20% BSA involvement or > 10% BSA involvement with very thick lesions or \nPsoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 20 or ≥ 10 with clinically relevant facial, genital, or hand/ foot \ninvolvement) who were inadequately controlled with topical therapy and heliotherapy or phototherapy.  \n \nPatients received Humira 0.8 mg/kg eow (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg/kg eow (up to 20 mg), or methotrexate 0.1 \n– 0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg). At week 16, more patients randomised to Humira 0.8 mg/kg had \npositive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those randomised to 0.4 mg/kg eow or MTX.   \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \nTable 22: Paediatric Plaque Psoriasis Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n \n\n \nMTXa \nN=37 \n\nHumira 0.8 mg/kg eow \nN=38  \n\n PASI 75b 12 (32.4%) 22 (57.9%) \n PGA: Clear/minimalc 15 (40.5%) 23 (60.5%) \na MTX = methotrexate \nb P=0.027, Humira 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX \nc P=0.083, Humira 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX\n\n \nPatients who achieved PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal were withdrawn from treatment for up to \n36 weeks and monitored for loss of disease control (i.e. a worsening of PGA by at least 2 grades). Patients \nwere then re-treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for an additional 16 weeks and response rates \nobserved during retreatment were similar to the previous double-blind period:  PASI 75 response of 78.9% \n(15 of 19 subjects) and PGA clear or minimal of 52.6% (10 of 19 subjects). \n \nIn the open label period of the study, PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal responses were maintained for \nup to an additional 52 weeks with no new safety findings. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThere are no clinical trials with Humira in adolescent patients with HS. Efficacy of adalimumab for the \ntreatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and exposure-\nresponse relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, pathophysiology, and \ndrug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure levels. Safety of the \nrecommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on cross-indication safety \nprofile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more frequent doses (see section \n5.2). \n \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease \n \nHumira was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the \nefficacy and safety of induction and maintenance treatment with doses dependent on body weight \n(< 40 kg or ≥ 40 kg) in 192 paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 (inclusive) years, with \nmoderate to severe Crohn´s disease (CD) defined as Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) \nscore > 30. Subjects had to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunomodulator) for CD. Subjects may also have previously lost response or been intolerant to \ninfliximab.  \n \nAll subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their Baseline body weight: 160 mg \nat Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 for subjects ≥ 40 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for subjects \n< 40 kg. \n \nAt Week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the Low Dose or \nStandard Dose maintenance regimens as shown in Table 23. \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \nTable 23 \n\nMaintenance regimen\nPatient \nWeight \n\nLow dose Standard \ndose \n\n< 40 kg 10 mg eow 20 mg eow\n≥ 40 kg 20 mg eow 40 mg eow\n\n \nEfficacy results \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was clinical remission at Week 26, defined as PCDAI score  10. \n \nClinical remission and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI score of at least 15 points from \nBaseline) rates are presented in Table 24.

After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0% (37/50) of the 50 patients remaining in the \nstudy continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0% (46/50) of patients continued to be in clinical \nresponse per PCDAI. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, trial in 93 \npaediatric patients from 5 to 17 years of age with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 \nwith endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 points, confirmed by centrally read endoscopy) who had an inadequate \nresponse or intolerance to conventional therapy. Approximately 16% of patients in the study had failed \nprior anti-TNF treatment. Patients who received corticosteroids at enrollment were allowed to taper their \ncorticosteroid therapy after Week 4. \n \nIn the induction period of the study, 77 patients were randomized 3:2 to receive double-blind treatment \nwith Humira at an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0 and Week 1, and 1.2 \nmg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2; or an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week \n0, placebo at Week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2. Both groups received 0.6 mg/kg \n(maximum of 40 mg) at Week 4 and Week 6. Following an amendment to the study design, the remaining \n16 patients who enrolled in the induction period received open-label treatment with Humira at the \ninduction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0 and Week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of \n80 mg) at Week 2.  \n \nAt Week 8, 62 patients who demonstrated clinical response per Partial Mayo Score (PMS; defined as a \ndecrease in PMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline) were randomized equally to receive double-blind \nmaintenance treatment with Humira at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every week (ew), or a \nmaintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every other week (eow). Prior to an amendment to \nthe study design, 12 additional patients who demonstrated clinical response per PMS were randomized to \nreceive placebo but were not included in the confirmatory analysis of efficacy. \n \nDisease flare was defined as an increase in PMS of at least 3 points (for patients with PMS of 0 to 2 at \nWeek 8), at least 2 points (for patients with PMS of 3 to 4 at Week 8), or at least 1 point (for patients with \nPMS of 5 to 6 at Week 8).  \n \nPatients who met criteria for disease flare at or after Week 12 were randomized to receive a re-induction \ndose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) or a dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) and continued to \nreceive their respective maintenance dose regimen afterwards.  \n \n\nEfficacy Results \n\n \n\nThe co-primary endpoints of the study were clinical remission per PMS (defined as PMS ≤ 2 and no \nindividual subscore > 1) at Week 8, and clinical remission per FMS (Full Mayo Score) (defined as a Mayo \nScore ≤ 2 and no individual subscore > 1) at Week 52 in patients who achieved clinical response per PMS \nat Week 8. \n \nClinical remission rates per PMS at Week 8 for patients in each of the Humira

safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in a randomized, double-masked, controlled study of 90 \npaediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated noninfectious anterior uveitis \nwho were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received either placebo or \n20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if ≥ 30 kg) every other week in combination with \ntheir baseline dose of methotrexate.  \n \nThe primary endpoint was ‘time to treatment failure’. The criteria determining treatment failure were \nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with development \nof sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted use of \nconcomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. \n \nClinical Response \n \nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (See Figure 2, \nP < 0.0001 from log rank test).The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects treated \nwith placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects treated with \nadalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure.  Adalimumab \n\n\n\n88 \n\nsignificantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown by the hazard \nratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]). \n \n\nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier Curves Summarizing Time to Treatment Failure in the Paediatric Uveitis \n\nStudy \n\n \n\nP\nR\n\nO\nB\n\nA\nB\n\nIL\nIT\n\nY\n O\n\nF\n F\n\nA\nIL\n\nIN\nG\n\n T\nR\n\nE\nA\n\nT\nM\n\nE\nN\n\nT\n \n\n TIME (WEEKS) \n Treatment Placebo  Adalimumab \n Note: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); H = HUMIRA (Number at Risk).\n\n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npatients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean trough \nsteady-state (values measured from Week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was 5.6 ± 5.6 µg/ml \n(102% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 ± 5.2 µg/ml (47.7% CV) with \nconcomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing <15 kg dosed \nwith adalimumab 24 mg/m2, the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations was \n\n\n\n89 \n\n6.0 ± 6.1 µg/ml (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 7.9 ± 5.6 µg/ml \n(71.2% CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npatients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state (values \nmeasured at Week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 ± 6.6 μg/ml for adalimumab without \nconcomitant methotrexate and 11.8 ± 4.3 μg/ml with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npaediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean ± SD steady-state adalimumab trough \nconcentration was approximately 7.4 ± 5.8 µg/ml (79% CV). \n \nAdalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). The recommended adolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week. Since exposure to \nadalimumab can be affected by body size, adolescents with higher body weight and inadequate response \nmay benefit from receiving the recommended adult dose of 40 mg every week. \n \nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at Weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. At \nWeek 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose (20/10 \nmg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (±SD) serum adalimumab \ntrough concentrations achieved at Week 4 were 15.7 ± 6.6 g/ml for patients  40 kg (160/80 mg) and \n10.6 ± 6.1 g/ml for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg). \n \nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (±SD) adalimumab trough concentrations \nat Week 52 were 9.5 ± 5.6 g/ml for the Standard Dose group and 3.5 ± 2.2 g/ml for the Low Dose \ngroup. The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to receive adalimumab \ntreatment eow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from eow to weekly regimen, the mean \n(±SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at Week 52 were 15.3 ± 11.4 μg/ml (40/20 mg, weekly) and \n6.7 ± 3.5 μg/ml (20/10 mg, weekly). \n \nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. The \npredicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an initial \nincrease in systemic exposure. \n \nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response relationship \nwas established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent adalimumab \nplasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 response (EC50) was \n3 μg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 μg/ml).  \n \nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, \nrespectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab concentrations, \nboth with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 μg/ml (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and 1.9-10.5, \nrespectively). \n \nAdults \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab was \nslow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The average \nabsolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 to \n15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-life \nwas approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several rheumatoid \narthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 g/ml (without \nconcomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 g/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. The serum \nadalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following 20, 40 and \n80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 μg/ml during \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. \n \nIn adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on \nWeek 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 μg/ml at Week 2 and \nWeek 4.  The mean steady-state trough concentration at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 8 \nto 10 μg/ml during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment.   \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 40 mg Humira \non Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 g/ml during the \ninduction period. A loading dose of 160 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 80 mg Humira on Week 2 \nachieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 g/ml during the induction period. \nMean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 g/ml were observed in Crohn’s disease patients who \nreceived a maintenance dose of 40 mg Humira every other week. \n \nFollowing the subcutaneous administration of body weight-based dosing of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of \n40 mg) every other week to paediatric patients with ulcerative colitis, the mean trough steady-state serum \nadalimumab concentration was 5.01±3.28 µg/ml at Week 52. For patients who received 0.6 mg/kg \n(maximum of 40 mg) every week, the mean (±SD) trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentration \nwas 15.7±5.60 μg/ml at Week 52. \n \nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week starting at Week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \napproximately 8 to 10 g/ml. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation predicted \ncomparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other week when \ncompared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, patients with \nadolescent HS, and paediatric patients ≥ 40 kg with CD and UC). \n \nElimination \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum levels \nof free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower in \npatients with measurable AAA.  \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \nHumira has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, repeated \ndose toxicity, and genotoxicity.   \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of harm \nto the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of fertility \nand postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models for an \nantibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralising antibodies in \nrodents. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nHumira in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: \n \n the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response \n\nto disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate. \n the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated \n\nwith methotrexate. \n \nHumira can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment \nwith methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nHumira has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to \nimprove physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nHumira in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or \nmore disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Humira can be given as monotherapy in case \n\n\n\n94 \n\nof intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for the \nefficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Humira has not been studied in patients aged less than 2 years. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and \nolder, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see section \n5.1). \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an \ninadequate response to conventional therapy. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and / or MRI, who have had an \ninadequate response to, or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the \nresponse to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Humira has \nbeen shown to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients \nwith polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see Section 5.1) and to improve physical function. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who \nare candidates for systemic therapy. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from \n4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical therapy \nand phototherapies. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa) \nin adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS \ntherapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nHumira is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, in adult patients who \nhave not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.  \n \n\n\n\n95 \n\nPaediatric Crohn's disease  \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or \nhave contraindications for such therapies. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nHumira is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who \nhave had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine \n(6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such \ntherapies.  \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \ncorticosteroids and/or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have \nmedical contraindications for such therapies. \n \nUveitis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult \npatients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of corticosteroid-\nsparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. \n \nPaediatric Uveitis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients from \n2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, or in \nwhom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration   \n \nHumira treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of conditions for which Humira is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised to consult with \nan appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Humira (see section 4.4). Patients treated with \nHumira should be given the Patient Reminder Card. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Humira if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.  \n \nDuring treatment with Humira, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n \nPosology \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. Methotrexate should be \ncontinued during treatment with Humira. \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued during \ntreatment with Humira. Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs other than \nmethotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response to Humira 40 mg every other \nweek may benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg every other \nweek.  \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nDose interruption \n \nThere may be a need for dose interruption, for instance before surgery or if a serious infection occurs. \n \nAvailable data suggest that re-introduction of Humira after discontinuation for 70 days or longer resulted \nin the same magnitudes of clinical response and similar safety profile as before dose interruption. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and psoriatic arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of AS and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab administered \nevery other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for adult patients is an initial dose of 80 mg administered \nsubcutaneously, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously given every other week starting one week after the \ninitial dose. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within \nthis time period. \n \nBeyond 16 weeks, patients with inadequate response to Humira 40 mg every other week may benefit from \nan increase in dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. The benefits and risks of continued \n40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with an \ninadequate response after the increase in dosage (see section 5.1). If adequate response is achieved with \n40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week, the dosage may subsequently be reduced to 40 mg every \nother week. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \n\n\n\n97 \n\nThe recommended Humira dose regimen for adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is 160 mg \ninitially at Day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two \nconsecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later at Day 15 (given as two 40 mg injections in one \nday). Two weeks later (Day 29) continue with a dose of 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week \n(given as two 40 mg injections in one day). Antibiotics may be continued during treatment with Humira if \nnecessary. It is recommended that the patient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a \ndaily basis during treatment with Humira. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement \nwithin this time period.   \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Humira 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be re-\nintroduced (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see section 5.1). \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nThe recommended Humira induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderately to severely active \nCrohn’s disease is 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg at Week 2. In case there is a need for a more rapid \nresponse to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at Week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two \n40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg at Week 2 (given as two 40 mg \ninjections in one day), can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher during \ninduction. \n \nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection. \nAlternatively, if a patient has stopped Humira and signs and symptoms of disease recur, Humira may be \nre-administered. There is little experience from re-administration after more than 8 weeks since the \nprevious dose. \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines. \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Humira 40 mg every other week may benefit \nfrom an increase in dosage to 40 mg Humira every week or 80 mg every other week. \n \nSome patients who have not responded by Week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough Week 12. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within \nthis time period. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nThe recommended Humira induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderate to severe ulcerative \ncolitis is 160 mg at Week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day \n\n\n\n98 \n\nfor two consecutive days) and 80 mg at Week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in one day). After \ninduction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines.  \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Humira 40 mg every other week may benefit \nfrom an increase in dosage to 40 mg Humira every week or 80 mg every other week. \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 2-8 weeks of treatment. Humira \ntherapy should not be continued in patients failing to respond within this time period. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for adult patients with uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by \n40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. There is limited experience in the \ninitiation of treatment with Humira alone. Treatment with Humira can be initiated in combination with \ncorticosteroids and/or with other non-biologic immunomodulatory agents. Concomitant corticosteroids \nmay be tapered in accordance with clinical practice starting two weeks after initiating treatment with \nHumira.    \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1).   \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment is required. \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n \nHumira has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years \nof age is based on body weight (Table 1). Humira is administered every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection. \n \n\nTable 1. Humira Dose for Patients with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis  \n \n\n\n\n99 \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n10 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued \ntherapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in patients aged less than 2 years for this indication. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis from 6 years of age is based \non body weight (Table 2). Humira is administered every other week via subcutaneous injection. \n \n\nTable 2. Humira Dose for Patients with Enthesitis-Related Arthritis \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nHumira has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 years. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in the paediatric population for the indications of ankylosing \nspondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe recommended Humira dose for patients with plaque psoriasis from 4 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 3). Humira is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \n\nTable 3. Humira Dose for Paediatric Patients with Plaque Psoriasis \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg Initial dose of 20 mg, followed by \n20 mg given every other week \n\nstarting one week after the initial \ndose \n\n≥ 30 kg Initial dose of 40 mg, followed by \n40 mg given every other week \n\nstarting one week after the initial \ndose \n\n \n\n\n\n100 \n\nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient not responding within this \ntime period. \n \nIf retreatment with Humira is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration should be \nfollowed. \n \nThe safety of Humira in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean of \n13 months. \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 4 years for this indication. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg) \n \nThere are no clinical trials with Humira in adolescent patients with HS.  The posology of Humira in these \npatients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation (see section 5.2). \n \nThe recommended Humira dose is 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at \nWeek 1 via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nIn adolescent patients with inadequate response to Humira 40 mg every other week, an increase in dosage \nto 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be considered. \n \nAntibiotics may be continued during treatment with Humira if necessary.  It is recommended that the \npatient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with \nHumira.  \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement \nwithin this time period.   \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Humira may be re-introduced as appropriate. \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see adult data in \nsection 5.1) \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 12 years in this indication. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with Crohn’s disease from 6 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 4). Humira is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n101 \n\nTable 4.

Humira is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \nIn paediatric uveitis, there is no experience in the treatment with Humira without concomitant treatment \nwith methotrexate. \n \n\nTable 6. Humira Dose for Paediatric Patients with Uveitis \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n< 30 kg 20 mg every other week in \ncombination with methotrexate \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week in \ncombination with methotrexate \n\n \nWhen Humira therapy is initiated, a loading dose of 40 mg for patients < 30 kg or 80 mg for patients ≥ 30 \nkg may be administered one week prior to the start of maintenance therapy. No clinical data are available \non the use of a Humira loading dose in children < 6 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 2 years in this indication. \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nHumira is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the package \nleaflet. \n \nHumira is available in other strengths and presentations. \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n103 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use   \n \nTraceability  \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function may \nincrease the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for infections, \nincluding tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Humira. Because the elimination of \nadalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period. \n \nTreatment with Humira should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \nlocalised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis and \npatients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with Humira \nshould be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Humira should be monitored \nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Humira should be discontinued if \na patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or antifungal therapy \nshould be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when considering \nthe use of Humira in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which \nmay predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. \n \nSerious infections \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving Humira.   \n \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported.  \n \nTuberculosis \n \nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients receiving \nHumira.  Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) tuberculosis.  \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with Humira, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(“latent”) tuberculosis infection.  This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of patient \nhistory of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and previous \nand/or current immunosuppressive therapy.  Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest \nX-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply).  It is recommended that \nthe conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the Patient Reminder Card.  Prescribers are reminded \nof the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or \nimmunocompromised.  \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Humira therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully considered. \n\n\n\n104 \n\n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted.   \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis \ntreatment before the initiation of Humira, and in accordance with local recommendations.  \n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of Humira in \npatients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for tuberculosis and \nin patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment \ncannot be confirmed.   \n \nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients \ntreated with Humira. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active tuberculosis have \nredeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with Humira. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \ninfection (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or after \ntherapy with Humira.  \n \nOther opportunistic infections \n \nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nHumira. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-antagonists and \nthis has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal outcomes.  \n \nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant shock \nan invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Humira should be promptly \ndiscontinued.  Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made \nin consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive fungal infections.  \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Humira, who are \nchronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive).  Some cases have had a fatal outcome. Patients \nshould be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Humira. For patients who test positive \nfor hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is \nrecommended. \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Humira should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms \nof active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. \nAdequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with \nTNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients who develop HBV \nreactivation, Humira should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be initiated.  \n \nNeurological events  \n \nTNF-antagonists including Humira have been associated in rare instances with new onset or exacerbation \nof clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease \nincluding multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-\nBarré syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Humira in patients with pre-\n\n\n\n105 \n\nexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of \nHumira should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between \nintermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in \npatients with non-infectious intermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of Humira therapy and regularly \nduring treatment to assess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders.  \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nSerious allergic reactions associated with Humira were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious allergic \nreactions associated with Humira were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of serious allergic \nreactions including anaphylaxis have been received following Humira administration. If an anaphylactic \nreaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Humira should be discontinued \nimmediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  \n \nImmunosuppression \n \nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with Humira, there was no evidence of \ndepression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in \nenumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been \nreported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma \nand leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, \nwhich complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of \nlymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 22 \nyears of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including adalimumab \nin the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases represented \na variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with \nimmunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with \nTNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.  \n \nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated with \nadalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. \nSome of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with Humira have occurred in young adult patients on \nconcomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for inflammatory bowel disease. The \npotential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and Humira should be carefully \nconsidered. A risk for the development of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Humira \ncannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom treatment \nwith Humira is continued following development of malignancy.  Thus, additional caution should be \nexercised in considering Humira treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy or \npsoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-\n\n\n\n106 \n\nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Humira.  Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma \nhave also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab (see section 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients with \nmoderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung \nor head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients \nhad a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist in \nCOPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking. \n \nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia or \ncolon cancer.  All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon \ncarcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), \nor who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular \nintervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy \nand biopsies per local recommendations. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists.  \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with Humira. All patients should be advised to seek \nimmediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. \npersistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Humira. Discontinuation of Humira therapy should be \nconsidered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n \nVaccinations  \n \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by \nlive vaccines in patients receiving Humira.   \n \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating Humira therapy. \n \nPatients on Humira may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration of live \nvaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for 5 months \nfollowing the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nCongestive heart failure \n \nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality \ndue to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also \nbeen reported in patients receiving Humira. Humira should be used with caution in patients with mild \nheart failure (NYHA class I/II). Humira is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure (see section \n4.3). Treatment with Humira must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms \nof congestive heart failure. \n \nAutoimmune processes \n \nTreatment with Humira may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of long-term \ntreatment with Humira on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient develops \nsymptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Humira and is positive for \n\n\n\n107 \n\nantibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Humira should not be given (see section \n4.8). \n \nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists \n \nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the \nnature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. (See section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDS (e.g, anakinra and abatacept) or \nother TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, \nincluding serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. (See section 4.5). \n \nSurgery \n \nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with Humira. The long half-\nlife of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned.  A patient who \nrequires surgery while on Humira should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions \nshould be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving \nHumira.  \n \nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that Humira does not worsen or cause \nstrictures. \n \nElderly \n \nThe frequency of serious infections among Humira treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) was \nhigher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention \nregarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSee Vaccinations above. \n \nExcipients with known effects \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nHumira has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic \narthritis patients taking Humira as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate.  Antibody \nformation was lower when Humira was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as \nmonotherapy. Administration of Humira without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of \nantibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1).  \n \n\n\n\n108 \n\nThe combination of Humira and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent administration \nof biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”).  \n \nThe combination of Humira and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy \nand continue its use for at least five months after the last Humira treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large number (approximately 2100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1500 exposed during the first trimester, \ndoes not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn’s disease (CD) \ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated with \nadalimumab were enrolled.  The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. The \nrate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 (8.7%) in \nthe adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with RA (unadjusted \nOR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women with CD and 3/32 \n(9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). The adjusted OR \n(accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD combined. There were \nno distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for the secondary endpoints \nspontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and serious or opportunistic \ninfections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation of data may be impacted due \nto methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-randomized design. \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n(see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNF, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune \nresponses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.   \n \nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration of \nlive vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk at \nvery low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% \nof the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and \nhave poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, \nHumira can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \n\n\n\n109 \n\n \nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nHumira may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \nimpairment may occur following administration of Humira (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nHumira was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months or \nmore. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease, \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) as \nwell as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa \nand uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients receiving Humira and \n3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled period. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking Humira and 5.4% for control treated \npatients. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory \ntract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), \nheadache and musculoskeletal pain. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for Humira. TNF-antagonists, such as Humira affect the \nimmune system and their use may affect the body’s defence against infection and cancer. \nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV reactivation \nand various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been reported with use \nof Humira. \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include \nrare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events and reports of \nlupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \nadult patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on postmarketing \nexperience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 7 below: very common \n( 1/10); common ( 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon ( 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); \nand not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest frequency seen among the \nvarious indications has been included.

treated with Humira weekly was consistent with the known safety \nprofile of Humira. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety profile for patients with uveitis treated with Humira every other week was consistent with the \nknown safety profile of Humira. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions   \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9% of patients treated with Humira developed \ninjection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 7.2% of \npatients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate \ndiscontinuation of the medicinal product.  \n \nInfections  \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in the \nHumira treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients. The \ninfections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and sinusitis. Most \npatients continued on Humira after the infection resolved.   \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in Humira treated patients and 0.03 per \npatient year in placebo and active control − treated patients.   \n \nIn controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with Humira, serious infections (including fatal \ninfections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including \nmiliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated or \nextrapulmonary  histoplasmosis,  blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystis,  candidiasis, \naspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first eight months after \ninitiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years during \nHumira trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \nenthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric patients with an \nexposure of 498.1 patient years during Humira trials in paediatric patients with Crohn’s disease. No \nmalignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of 80.0 patient years during a \nHumira trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No malignancies were observed in 93 \npaediatric patients with an exposure of 65.3 patient years during a Humira trial in paediatric patients with \nulcerative colitis. No malignancies were observed in 60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 \npatient years during a Humira trial in paediatric patients with uveitis. \n \nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal Humira trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in patients \nwith moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of AS,  psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s \n\n\n\n116 \n\ndisease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, \nwere observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5)  per 1,000 patient-years among 5,291 \nHumira treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8)  per 1,000 patient-years among 3,444 control \npatients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for Humira and 3.8 months for control-treated \npatients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 \npatient-years among Humira-treated patients and 3.2 (1.3, 7.6)  per 1,000 patient-years among control \npatients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of \n2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among Humira-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-\nyears among control patients. The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per \n1,000 patient-years among Humira-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5)  per 1,000 patient-years among \ncontrol patients. \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open label extension \nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over \n26,439 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient years. The observed rate of non-melanoma \nskin cancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is \napproximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and \n0.3 per 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n \nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with \nadalimumab (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies  \n \nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis studies \nI − V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with Humira and 8.1% of placebo and active \ncontrol − treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at \nWeek 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with Humira in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \nstudies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved \nfollowing discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system \nsymptoms. \n \nHepato-biliary events \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis with a \ncontrol period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.7% of \nHumira-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were \n4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred \nin 6.1% of Humira-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. Most ALT elevations occurred \nwith concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of Humira \nin patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to <4 years. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis with a control \nperiod ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of Humira-treated \npatients and 0.9% of controlled-treated patients.  \n \n\n\n\n117 \n\nIn the Phase 3 trial of Humira in patients with paediatric Crohn’s disease which evaluated efficacy and \nsafety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted induction \ntherapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of patients of \nwhom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with plaque Psoriasis with a control period duration \nranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of Humira-treated patients and \n1.8% of control-treated patients.  \n \nNo ALT elevations ≥3 X ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of Humira in paediatric patients with plaque \npsoriasis. \n \nIn controlled trials of Humira (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg \nevery week starting at Week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control period duration \nranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of Humira-treated patients and \n0.6% of control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled trials of Humira (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week \nstarting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of 166.5 days and \n105.0 days in Humira-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN \noccurred in 2.4% of Humira-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn the controlled Phase 3 trial of Humira in patients with paediatric ulcerative colitis (N=93) which \nevaluated efficacy and safety of a maintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every other week \n(N=31) and a maintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every Week (N=32), following body \nweight adjusted induction dosing of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0 and Week 1, and 1.2 \nmg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2 (N=63), or an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) \nat Week 0, placebo at Week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2 (N=30), ALT elevations ≥ \n3 X ULN occurred in 1.1% (1/93) of patients. \n \nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment.  However, there have also been post-\nmarketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, such \nas hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine \n \nIn adult Crohn’s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \nevents were seen with the combination of Humira and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared with \nHumira alone. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n \n\n\n\n118 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has been \nmultiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended dose.     \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors. \nATC code: L04AB04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.   \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes \nin the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 \nwith an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM).  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects  \n \nAfter treatment with Humira, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after Humira administration. Patients treated with Humira usually \nexperienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with Humira. In \npatients with Crohn’s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing inflammatory markers in the \ncolon including a significant reduction of expression of TNFα was seen. Endoscopic studies in intestinal \nmucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab treated patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nHumira was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The efficacy and \nsafety of Humira were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. Some \npatients were treated for up to 120 months duration.  \n \nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were  18 \nyears old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had insufficient \nefficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) every week and \nwhose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of \nHumira or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were  18 \nyears old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs.  Doses of 20 or \n\n\n\n119 \n\n40 mg of Humira were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on alternative \nweeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration.  No other \ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were  18 \nyears old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have been \nintolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study.  The first received \nplacebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of Humira every week for \n52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of Humira every other week with placebo injections on \nalternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension \nphase in which 40 mg of Humira/MTX was administered every other week up to 10 years. \n \nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were  18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic \ndrug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a \nminimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, \nsulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of Humira or placebo every other week \nfor 24 weeks.   \n \nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nHumira 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, Humira 40 mg every other week \nmonotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of progression \nof joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 weeks, 497 \npatients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of Humira was administered every \nother week up to 10 years. \n \nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \npercent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA \nstudy V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at Week 52. RA studies III and V \nhad an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by X-ray \nresults). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life. \n \nACR response \n \nThe percent of Humira-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent across RA \nstudies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in Table 8.  \n \n\n\n\n120 \n\nTable 8  \nACR Responses in Placebo-Controlled Trials \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n \n\nResponse RA Study Ia** RA Study IIa** RA Study IIIa** \n \n\n Placebo/ \nMTXc \nn=60 \n\nHumirab/ MTXc\n\nn=63 \nPlacebo \nn=110 \n\nHumirab \nn=113 \n\nPlacebo/ \nMTXc \nn=200 \n\nHumirab/ MTXc\n\nn=207 \n\nACR 20    \n 6 months 13.3% 65.1% 19.1% 46.0% 29.5% 63.3%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 24.0% 58.9%\nACR 50    \n 6 months 6.7% 52.4% 8.2% 22.1% 9.5% 39.1%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 9.5% 41.5%\nACR 70    \n 6 months 3.3% 23.8% 1.8% 12.4% 2.5% 20.8%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 4.5% 23.2%\na RA study I at 24 weeks, RA study II at 26 weeks , and RA study III at 24 and 52 weeks \nb 40 mg Humira administered every other week \nc MTX = methotrexate \n**p < 0.01, Humira versus placebo \n\n \nIn RA studies I-IV, all individual components of the ACR response criteria (number of tender and swollen \njoints, physician and patient assessment of disease activity and pain, disability index (HAQ) scores and \nCRP (mg/dl) values) improved at 24 or 26 weeks compared to placebo. In RA study III, these \nimprovements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained \nresponse when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to Humira 40 mg every \nother week, 114 patients continued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 5 years. Among those, 86 \npatients (75.4%) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2%) had ACR 50 responses; and 41 patients \n(36%) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on Humira 40 mg every other week \nfor 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0%) had ACR 20 responses; 56 patients (69.1%) had ACR 50 \nresponses; and 43 patients (53.1%) had ACR 70 responses. \n \nIn RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with Humira plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p < 0.001).   \n \nIn RA studies I-IV, Humira-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 responses \ncompared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. \n \nIn RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination therapy \nwith Humira and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than methotrexate \nmonotherapy and Humira monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at Week 104 (see Table \n9). \n \n\n\n\n121 \n\nTable 9  \nACR Responses in RA Study V \n\n(percent of patients) \n \n\nResponse \nMTX \nn=257 \n\nHumira \nn=274 \n\nHumira/MTX \nn=268 \n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nACR 20   \n Week \n52 \n\n62.6% 54.4% 72.8% 0.013 < 0.001 0.043 \n\n Week \n104 \n\n56.0% 49.3% 69.4% 0.002 < 0.001 0.140 \n\nACR 50   \n Week \n52 \n\n45.9% 41.2% 61.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.317 \n\n Week \n104 \n\n42.8% 36.9% 59.0% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.162 \n\nACR 70   \n Week \n52 \n\n27.2% 25.9% 45.5% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.656 \n\n Week \n104 \n\n28.4% 28.1% 46.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.864 \n\na. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \n\nb. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \n\nc.   p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n\n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study V, ACR response rates were maintained when followed for up to \n10 years. Of 542 patients who were randomised to Humira 40 mg every other week, 170 patients \ncontinued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 154 patients (90.6%) had ACR \n20 responses; 127 patients (74.7%) had ACR 50 responses; and 102 patients (60.0%) had ACR 70 \nresponses. \n \nAt Week 52, 42.9% of patients who received Humira/methotrexate combination therapy achieved clinical \nremission (DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6) compared to 20.6% of patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy and \n23.4% of patients receiving Humira monotherapy. Humira/methotrexate combination therapy was \nclinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and Humira monotherapy (p < 0.001) in \nachieving a low disease state in patients with recently diagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. \nThe response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447).  Of 342 subjects originally \nrandomized to Humira monotherapy or Humira/methotrexate combination therapy who entered the open-\nlabel extension study, 171 subjects completed 10 years of Humira treatment. Among those, 109 subjects \n(63.7%) were reported to be in remission at 10 years. \n \nRadiographic response \n \nIn RA study III, where Humira treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in \nmodified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score.  \nHumira/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients \nreceiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 10).   \n \n\n\n\n122 \n\nIn the open-label extension of RA Study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is \nmaintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated with \n40 mg Humira every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients showed no \nprogression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. At \n10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg Humira every other week were evaluated \nradiographically.

The corresponding \nproportions of patients with no radiographic progression were 31.3%, 23.7% and 36.7% respectively. \n \nQuality of life and physical function  \n \nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the Health \nAssessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, which was a \npre-specified primary endpoint at Week 52 in RA study III. All doses/schedules of Humira in all four \nstudies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the HAQ from \nbaseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was seen at Week 52. Results from \nthe Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of Humira in all four studies support these \nfindings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically \nsignificant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other week dose. A statistically significant \ndecrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was \nseen in all three studies in which it was assessed (RA studies I, III, IV). \n \nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued treatment \nmaintained improvement through Week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. Improvement in \nquality of life was measured up to Week 156 (36 months) and improvement was maintained through that \ntime. \n \nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for Humira/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and Humira monotherapy at Week 52, which was maintained through \nWeek 104.  Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in \nphysical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \n \nHumira 40 mg every other week was assessed in 393 patients in two randomised, 24 week double − blind, \nplacebo − controlled studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (mean baseline score of disease \nactivity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] was 6.3 in all groups) who have \nhad an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Seventy-nine (20.1%) patients were treated \nconcomitantly with disease modifying anti − rheumatic drugs, and 37 (9.4%) patients with \nglucocorticoids. The blinded period was followed by an open − label period during which patients \nreceived Humira 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks. Subjects \n(n=215, 54.7%) who failed to achieve ASAS 20 at Weeks 12, or 16 or 20 received early escape open-label \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously and were subsequently treated as non-responders in \nthe double-blind statistical analyses. \n \nIn the larger AS study I with 315 patients, results showed statistically significant improvement of the signs \nand symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis in patients treated with Humira compared to placebo.

Radiographs of hands, wrists, and \nfeet were obtained at baseline and Week 24 during the double-blind period when patients were on Humira \nor placebo and at Week 48 when all patients were on open-label Humira. A modified Total Sharp Score \n(mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e. not identical to the TSS used for rheumatoid \narthritis), was used. \n \nHumira treatment reduced the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with placebo \ntreatment as measured by change from baseline in mTSS  (mean ± SD) 0.8 ± 2.5 in the placebo group (at \nWeek 24) compared with 0.0 ± 1.9; (p< 0.001) in the Humira group (at Week 48). \n \nIn subjects treated with Humira with no radiographic progression from baseline to Week 48 (n=102), 84% \ncontinued to show no radiographic progression through 144 weeks of treatment. \nHumira treated patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in physical function as assessed \nby HAQ and Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) compared to placebo at Week 24. Improved physical \nfunction continued during the open label extension up to Week 136. \n \nPsoriasis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis ( 10% \nBSA involvement and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)  12 or  10) who were candidates for \nsystemic therapy or phototherapy in randomised, double-blind studies. 73% of patients enrolled in \nPsoriasis Studies I and II had received prior systemic therapy or phototherapy. The safety and efficacy of \nHumira were also studied in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with \nconcomitant hand and/or foot psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy in a randomised double-\nblind study (Psoriasis Study III).   \n \nPsoriasis Study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, patients \nreceived placebo or Humira at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one \nweek after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least a PASI 75 response \n(PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline), entered period B and received open-label \n40 mg Humira every other week. Patients who maintained PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were \noriginally randomised to active therapy in Period A, were re-randomised in period C to receive 40 mg \nHumira every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups, the mean \nbaseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) score ranged from \n“moderate” (53% of subjects included) to “severe” (41%) to “very severe” (6%). \n \nPsoriasis Study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of Humira versus methotrexate and \nplacebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg and thereafter dose \nincreases up to Week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by \n40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for 16 weeks. There are no data available \ncomparing Humira and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. Patients receiving MTX who achieved a \nPASI 50 response at Week 8 and/or 12 did not receive further dose increases. Across all treatment \ngroups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the baseline PGA score ranged from “mild” (<1%) to \n“moderate” (48%) to “severe” (46%) to “very severe” (6%). \n \nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an open-label \nextension trial, where Humira was given for at least an additional 108 weeks. \n \nIn Psoriasis Studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 \nresponse from baseline at Week 16 (see Tables 16 and 17). \n \n\n\n\n129 \n\nTable 16 \nPs Study I (REVEAL)  - Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n \nPlacebo \nN=398 \nn (%) \n\nHumira 40 mg eow \nN=814 \nn (%) \n\n    PASI 75a 26 (6.5) 578 (70.9)b \n    PASI 100 3 (0.8) 163 (20.0)b \n    PGA: Clear/minimal 17 (4.3) 506 (62.2)b \na Percent of patients achieving PASI75 response was calculated as centre-\nadjusted rate \nb p<0.001, Humira vs. Placebo\n\n \n\nTable 17 \n Ps Study II (CHAMPION) Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n Placebo \nN=53 \nn (%) \n\nMTX \nN=110 \nn (%) \n\nHumira 40 mg eow \nN=108 \nn (%) \n\n    PASI 75 10 (18.9) 39 (35.5) 86 (79.6) a, b \n    PASI 100 1 (1.9) 8 (7.3) 18 (16.7) c, d \n    PGA: \nClear/minimal \n\n6 (11.3) 33 (30.0) 79 (73.1) a, b \n\na p<0.001 Humira vs. placebo \nb p<0.001 Humira vs. methotrexate \nc p<0.01 Humira vs. placebo \nd p<0.05 Humira vs. methotrexate\n\n \nIn Psoriasis Study I, 28% of patients who were PASI 75 responders and were re-randomised to placebo at \nWeek 33 compared to 5% continuing on Humira, p<0.001, experienced “loss of adequate response” (PASI \nscore after Week 33 and on or before Week 52 that resulted in a <PASI 50 response relative to baseline \nwith a minimum of a 6-point increase in PASI score relative to Week 33). Of the patients who lost \nadequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into the open-label extension trial, \n38% (25/66) and 55% (36/66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and 24 weeks of re-treatment, \nrespectively. \n \nA total of 233 PASI 75 responders at Week 16 and Week 33 received continuous Humira therapy for \n52 weeks in Psoriasis Study I, and continued Humira in the open-label extension trial.  PASI 75 and PGA \nof clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7% and 59.0%, respectively, after an \nadditional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all patients who \ndropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, were considered \nnon-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 69.6% and \n55.7%, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). \n \nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label \nextension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a median \ntime to relapse (decline to PGA “moderate” or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of these patients \nexperienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of patients who entered the \nretreatment period had a response of PGA “clear” or “minimal” after 16 weeks of retreatment, irrespective \nof whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1%[123/178] and 88.8% [95/107] for patients who \nrelapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, respectively).  A similar safety profile was \nobserved during retreatment as before withdrawal. \n \n\n\n\n130 \n\nSignificant improvements at Week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (Studies I and II) and MTX \n(Study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In Study I, improvements in \nthe physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also significant compared to \nplacebo. \n \nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to 40 mg \nweekly due to a PASI response below 50%, 26.4% (92/349) and 37.8% (132/349) of patients achieved \nPASI 75 response at Week 12 and 24, respectively. \n \nPsoriasis Study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of Humira versus placebo in 72 patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients received an \ninitial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) \nor placebo for 16 weeks. At Week 16, a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients who \nreceived Humira achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands and/or feet compared to patients \nwho received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively [P = 0.014]). \n \nPsoriasis Study IV compared efficacy and safety of Humira versus placebo in 217 adult patients with \nmoderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by 40 mg \nevery other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label \nHumira treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included the Modified Nail \nPsoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician’s Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) \nand the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 18). Humira demonstrated a treatment benefit in \nnail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin involvement (BSA≥10% (60% of patients) and \nBSA<10% and ≥5% (40% of patients)).     \n \n\nTable 18 \nPs Study IV Efficacy Results at 16, 26 and 52 Weeks \n\nEndpoint Week 16 \nPlacebo-Controlled\n\nWeek 26 \nPlacebo-Controlled\n\nWeek 52 \nOpen-label\n\nPlacebo \nN=108 \n\nHumira \n40 mg eow \n\nN=109\n\nPlacebo\nN=108 \n\nHumira \n40 mg eow \n\nN=109\n\nHumira \n40 mg eow  \n\nN=80 \n≥ mNAPSI 75 (%) 2.9 26.0a 3.4 46.6a 65.0 \nPGA-F clear/minimal and \n≥2-grade improvement (%) \n\n2.9 29.7a 6.9 48.9a 61.3 \n\nPercent Change in Total \nFingernail NAPSI (%) \n\n-7.8 -44.2 a -11.5 -56.2a -72.2 \n\na p<0.001, Humira vs. placebo  \n \nHumira treated patients showed statistically significant improvements at Week 26 compared with placebo \nin the DLQI.  \n \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies \nand an open-label extension study in adult patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) \nwho were intolerant, had a contraindication or an inadequate response to at least a 3-month trial of \nsystemic antibiotic therapy. The patients in HS-I and HS-II had Hurley Stage II or III disease with at least \n3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. \n \nStudy HS-I (PIONEER I) evaluated 307 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients received \nplacebo or Humira at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every week \n\n\n\n131 \n\nstarting at Week 4 to Week 11. Concomitant antibiotic use was not allowed during the study.  After \n12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received Humira in Period A were re-randomised in Period B to 1 \nof 3 treatment groups (Humira 40 mg every week, Humira 40 mg every other week, or placebo from \nWeek 12 to Week 35). Patients who had been randomised to placebo in Period A were assigned to receive \nHumira 40 mg every week in Period B. \n \nStudy HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients received \nplacebo or Humira at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 and 40 mg every week \nstarting at Week 4 to Week 11. 19.3% of patients had continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the \nstudy. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received Humira in Period A were re-randomised in \nPeriod B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (Humira 40 mg every week, Humira 40 mg every other week, or \nplacebo from Week 12 to Week 35). Patients who had been randomised to placebo in Period A were \nassigned to receive placebo in Period B. \n \nPatients participating in Studies HS-I and HS-II were eligible to enrol into an open-label extension study \nin which Humira 40mg was administered every week. Mean exposure in all adalimumab population was \n762 days. Throughout all 3 studies patients used topical antiseptic wash daily. \n \nClinical Response \n \nReduction of inflammatory lesions and prevention of worsening of abscesses and draining fistulas was \nassessed using Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR; at least a 50% reduction in total \nabscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining \nfistula count relative to Baseline). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating \nScale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 point scale.  \n \nAt Week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with Humira versus placebo achieved \nHiSCR.   At Week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients in Study HS-II experienced a clinically \nrelevant decrease in HS-related skin pain (see Table 19). Patients treated with Humira had significantly \nreduced risk of disease flare during the initial 12 weeks of treatment. \n \n\nTable 19:  Efficacy Results at 12 Weeks, HS Studies I and II \n\n \n\nHS Study I HS Study II \n\nPlacebo\nHumira 40 mg \n\nWeekly Placebo  \nHumira 40 mg \n\nWeekly \n\nHidradenitis Suppurativa \nClinical Response (HiSCR)a   \n\nN = 154 \n40 (26.0%) \n\nN = 153 \n64 (41.8%) * \n\nN=163 \n45 (27.6%) \n\nN=163 \n96 (58.9%) *** \n\n≥30% Reduction in Skin \nPainb \n\nN = 109 \n27 (24.8%)\n\nN = 122 \n34 (27.9%)\n\nN=111 \n23 (20.7%) \n\nN=105 \n48 (45.7%) ***\n\n* P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, Humira versus placebo  \na Among all randomised patients. \nb Among patients with baseline HS-related skin pain assessment ≥ 3, based on Numeric Rating \n\nScale 0 – 10; 0 = no skin pain, 10 = skin pain as bad as you can imagine.\n \nTreatment with Humira 40 mg every week significantly reduced the risk of worsening of abscesses and \ndraining fistulas.

Longer term \ntreatment with Humira 40 mg weekly for 96 weeks identified no new safety findings. \n \nAmong patients whose Humira treatment was withdrawn at Week 12 in Studies HS-I and HS-II, the \nHiSCR rate 12 weeks after re-introduction of Humira 40 mg weekly returned to levels similar to that \nobserved before withdrawal (56.0 %). \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in over 1500 patients with moderately to severely active \nCrohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI)  220 and  450) in randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80% of patients continued to receive at least one of these \nmedications.  \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD Study I \n(CLASSIC I) and CD Study II (GAIN). In CD Study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were \nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg Humira at Week 0 and \n80 mg at Week 2, 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. In \nCD Study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to \nreceive either 160 mg Humira at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. The primary \nnon-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM).  In CD Study III, 854 patients \nreceived open-label 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. At Week 4 patients were randomised to \n40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks. Patients in \nclinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at Week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those \nnot in clinical response at Week 4. Corticosteroid taper was permitted after Week 8.  \n \n\n\n\n133 \n\nCD study I and CD study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 21. \n \n\nTable 21 \nInduction of Clinical Remission and Response \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n\n CD Study I: Infliximab Naive \nPatients \n\nCD Study II: Infliximab \nExperienced Patients \n\n Placebo \nN=74 \n\nHumira \n80/40 mg \n\nN = 75 \n\nHumira  \n160/80 mg \n\nN=76 \n\nPlacebo \nN=166 \n\nHumira  \n160/80 mg \n\nN=159 \n\nWeek 4      \n\nClinical remission 12% 24% 36%* 7% 21%* \n\nClinical response (CR-\n100) \n\n24% 37% 49%** 25% 38%** \n\nAll p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for Humira versus placebo \n* p < 0.001 \n** p < 0.01 \n\n \nSimilar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by Week 8 and \nadverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group. \n \nIn CD Study III, at Week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the \nprimary analysis. Of those in clinical response at Week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to other TNF-\nantagonists. Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 22.  Clinical remission \nresults remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF-antagonist exposure. \n \nDisease-related hospitalisations and surgeries were statistically significantly reduced with adalimumab \ncompared with placebo at Week 56. \n \n\n\n\n134 \n\nTable 22 \nMaintenance of Clinical Remission and Response \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n\n Placebo 40 mg Humira \nevery other week \n\n40 mg Humira\nevery week \n\nWeek 26 N=170 N=172 N=157 \n\nClinical remission 17% 40%* 47%* \n\nClinical response (CR-100) 27% 52%* 52%* \n\nPatients in steroid-free remission  \nfor >=90 daysa \n\n3% (2/66) 19% (11/58)** 15% (11/74)** \n\nWeek 56 N=170 N=172 N=157 \n\nClinical remission 12% 36%* 41%* \n\nClinical response (CR-100) 17% 41%* 48%* \n\nPatients in steroid-free remission  \nfor >=90 daysa \n\n5% (3/66) 29% (17/58)* 20% (15/74)** \n\n* p < 0.001 for Humira versus placebo pairwise comparisons   of proportions \n** p < 0.02 for Humira versus placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions \na Of those receiving corticosteroids at baseline \n\n \nAmong patients who were not in response at Week 4, 43% of Humira maintenance patients responded by \nWeek 12 compared to 30% of placebo maintenance patients. These results suggest that some patients who \nhave not responded by Week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through Week 12. Therapy \ncontinued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section 4.2).   \n \n117/276 patients from CD study I and 272/777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed through \nat least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy. 88 and 189 patients, respectively, continued to be in \nclinical remission. Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and 233 patients, respectively. \n \nQuality of life \n \nIn CD Study I and CD Study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific inflammatory \nbowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at Week 4 in patients randomised to Humira \n80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at Weeks 26 and 56 in CD Study III as well \namong the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of multiple doses of Humira were assessed in adult patients with moderately to \nseverely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3) in randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies.  \n \nIn study UC-I, 390 TNF-antagonist naïve patients were randomised to receive either placebo at Weeks 0 \nand 2, 160 mg Humira at Week 0  followed by 80 mg at Week 2,  or 80 mg Humira at Week 0  followed \nby 40 mg at Week 2. After Week 2, patients in both adalimumab arms received 40 mg eow. Clinical \nremission (defined as Mayo score ≤ 2 with no subscore > 1) was assessed at Week 8.  \n \nIn study UC-II, 248 patients received 160 mg of Humira at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2 and 40 mg eow \nthereafter, and 246 patients received placebo. Clinical results were assessed for induction of remission at \nWeek 8 and for maintenance of remission at Week 52.  \n \n\n\n\n135 \n\nPatients induced with 160/80 mg Humira achieved clinical remission versus placebo at Week 8 in \nstatistically significantly greater percentages in study UC-I (18% vs. 9% respectively, p=0.031) and study \nUC-II (17% vs. 9% respectively, p=0.019). In study UC-II, among those treated with Humira who were in \nremission at Week 8, 21/41 (51%) were in remission at Week 52. \n \nResults from the overall UC-II study population are shown in Table 23. \n \n\nTable 23 \n\nResponse, Remission and Mucosal Healing in Study UC-II \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n Placebo\n\n \nHumira 40 mg  \n\neow \n\nWeek 52 N=246 N=248 \n  Clinical Response  18%   30%* \n\n  Clinical Remission 9%   17%* \n  Mucosal Healing  15%   25%* \n  Steroid-free remission for ≥ 90 days a  6%  \n\n(N=140) \n     13% * \n(N=150) \n\nWeek 8 and 52 \n  Sustained Response  12%   24%** \n  Sustained Remission  4%   8%* \n  Sustained Mucosal Healing  11%  19%* \nClinical remission is Mayo score ≤ 2 with no subscore > 1; \nClinical response is decrease from baseline in Mayo score ≥3 points and ≥30% plus a \ndecrease in the rectal bleeding subscore [RBS] ≥1 or an absolute RBS of 0 or 1; \n*p<0.05 for Humira vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions  \n**p<0.001 for Humira vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions \na   Of those receiving corticosteroids at baseline\n \nOf those patients who had a response at Week 8, 47% were in response, 29% were in remission, 41% had \nmucosal healing, and 20% were in steroid-free remission for ≥ 90 days at Week 52. \n \nApproximately 40% of patients in study UC-II had failed prior anti-TNF treatment with infliximab. The \nefficacy of adalimumab in those patients was reduced compared to that in anti-TNF naïve patients.  \nAmong patients who had failed prior anti-TNF treatment, Week 52 remission was achieved by 3% on \nplacebo and 10% on adalimumab. \n \nPatients from studies UC-I and UC-II had the option to roll over into an open-label long-term extension \nstudy (UC III). Following 3 years of adalimumab therapy, 75% (301/402) continued to be in clinical \nremission per partial Mayo score.  \n \nHospitalisation rates \n \nDuring 52 weeks of studies UC-I and UC-II, lower rates of all-cause hospitalisations and UC-related \nhospitalisations were observed for the adalimumab-treated arm compared to the placebo arm. The number \nof all cause hospitalisations in the adalimumab treatment group was 0.18 per patient year vs. 0.26 per \n\n\n\n136 \n\npatient year in the placebo group and the corresponding figures for UC-related hospitalisations were 0.12 \nper patient year vs. 0.22 per patient year. \n \nQuality of life \n \nIn study UC-II, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease \nQuestionnaire (IBDQ) score.    \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious intermediate, \nposterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomised, double-\nmasked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or Humira at an initial dose of \n80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. Concomitant stable \ndoses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted.  \n \nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of prednisone \n60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid \ndiscontinuation by Week 15.  \n \nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment (oral \nprednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent a \nmandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19.  \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was ´time to treatment failure´. Treatment failure was \ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal \nvascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected visual \nacuity (BCVA).  \n \nPatients who completed Studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term \nextension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on \nstudy medication beyond Week 78 until they had access to Humira. \n \nClinical Response \n \nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in \npatients treated with Humira versus patients receiving placebo (See Table 24). Both studies demonstrated \nan early and sustained effect of Humira on the treatment failure rate versus placebo (see Figure 2).  \n \n\n\n\n137 \n\nTable 24 \nTime to Treatment Failure in Studies UV I and UV II \n\n \nAnalysis \n Treatment \n\nN Failure \nN (%) \n\nMedian Time to \nFailure (months) \n\nHRa CI 95% \nfor HRa \n\nP Value b \n\nTime to Treatment Failure At or After Week 6 in Study UV I   \nPrimary analysis (ITT)   \n Placebo 107 84 (78.5) 3.0 -- -- -- \n Adalimumab 110 60 (54.5) 5.6 0.50 0.36, 0.70  < 0.001\nTime to Treatment Failure At or After Week 2 in Study UV II \nPrimary analysis (ITT)   \n Placebo 111 61 (55.0) 8.3 -- -- -- \n Adalimumab 115 45 (39.1) NEc 0.57 0.39, 0.84 0.004 \n\nNote:  Treatment failure at or after Week 6 (Study UV I), or at or after Week 2 (Study UV II), was \ncounted as event.

In Study UV II, statistically significant differences were \nobserved for visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of adalimumab. \n \nOf the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of Studies UV I and UV II, 60 \nsubjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to complications secondary to diabetic \nretinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary analysis of \nefficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of open-label \nadalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3%) were in quiescence (no active \ninflammatory lesions, AC cell grade ≤ 0.5+, VH grade ≤ 0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose ≤ 7.5 mg \nper day, and 178 (66.2%) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA was either improved or maintained (< 5 \nletters deterioration) in 88.6% of the eyes at week 78. Data beyond Week 78 were generally consistent \nwith these results but the number of enrolled subjects declined after this time. Overall, among the patients \nwho discontinued the study, 18% discontinued due to adverse events, and 8% due to insufficient response \nto adalimumab treatment. \n \nQuality of Life \n \nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, \nusing the NEI VFQ-25. Humira was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with statistically \nsignificant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and total score in \nStudy UV I, and for general vision and mental health in Study UV II. Vision related effects were not \nnumerically in favour of Humira for colour vision in Study UVI and for colour vision, peripheral vision \nand near vision in Study UV II. \n \nImmunogenicity   \n \nFormation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of \nadalimumab. There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and the \noccurrence of adverse events. \n \n\n\n\n139 \n\nPatients in rheumatoid arthritis studies I, II and III were tested at multiple time points for anti-adalimumab \nantibodies during the 6 to 12 month period. In the pivotal trials, anti-adalimumab antibodies were \nidentified in 5.5% (58/1053) of patients treated with adalimumab, compared to 0.5% (2/370) on placebo.  \nIn patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when \nadalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate.   \n \nIn patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 4 to 17 years, anti-adalimumab \nantibodies were identified in 15.8% (27/171) of patients treated with adalimumab. In patients not given \nconcomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 25.6% (22/86) compared to 5.9% (5/85) when adalimumab \nwas used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were \n2 to <4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing <15 kg, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7% \n(1/15) of patients, and the one patient was receiving concomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with enthesitis-related arthritis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 10.9% (5/46) of \npatients treated with adalimumab. In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was \n13.6% (3/22), compared to 8.3% (2/24) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with psoriatic arthritis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 38/376 subjects (10%) \ntreated with adalimumab. In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 13.5% \n(24/178 subjects), compared to 7% (14 of 198 subjects) when adalimumab was used as add-on to \nmethotrexate. \n \nIn patients with ankylosing spondylitis anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 17/204 subjects \n(8.3%) treated with adalimumab. In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was \n16/185 (8.6%), compared to 1/19 (5.3%) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in \n8/152 subjects (5.3%) who were treated continuously with adalimumab. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7/269 subjects (2.6%) and \nin 19/487 subjects (3.9%) with ulcerative colitis. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 77/920 subjects (8.4%) \ntreated with adalimumab monotherapy. \n \nIn adult plaque psoriasis patients on long term adalimumab monotherapy who participated in a withdrawal \nand retreatment study, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment (11 of 482 subjects, 2.3%) \nwas similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal (11 of 590 subjects, 1.9%). \n \nIn patients with paediatric psoriasis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 5/38 subjects (13%) \ntreated with 0.8 mg/kg adalimumab monotherapy. \n \nIn patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified \nin 10/99 subjects (10.1%) treated with adalimumab. \n \nIn patients with moderately to severely active paediatric Crohn’s disease, the rate of anti-adalimumab \nantibody development in patients receiving adalimumab was 3.3%.  \n \nIn adult patients with non-infectious uveitis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 4.8% (12/249) \nof patients treated with adalimumab. \n \nIn patients with moderately to severely active paediatric ulcerative colitis, the rate of anti-adalimumab \nantibody development in patients receiving adalimumab was 3%. \n\n\n\n140 \n\n \nBecause immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody rates with those from \nother products is not appropriate. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with active \npolyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA onset types \n(most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis). \n \npJIA I \n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \nparallel − group study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in \nphase (OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or non-MTX-treated. \nPatients who were in the non-MTX stratum were either naïve to or had been withdrawn from MTX at \nleast two weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or \nprednisone ( 0.2 mg /kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). In the OL LI phase all patients received 24 mg/m2 \n\nup to a maximum of 40 mg Humira every other week for 16 weeks.  The distribution of patients by age \nand minimum, median and maximum dose received during the OL LI phase is presented in Table 25. \n \n\nTable 25 \nDistribution of patients by age and adalimumab dose received during the OL LI phase \n\n \nAge Group Number of patients at Baseline \n\nn (%) \nMinimum, median and maximum \ndose\n\n4 to 7 years 31 (18.1) 10, 20 and 25 mg \n8 to 12 years 71 (41.5) 20, 25 and 40 mg \n13 to 17 years 69 (40.4) 25, 40 and 40 mg \n\n \nPatients demonstrating a Paediatric ACR 30 response at Week 16 were eligible to be randomised into the \ndouble blind (DB) phase and received either Humira 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg, or placebo \nevery other week for an additional 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare criteria were defined as a \nworsening of  30% from baseline in  3 of 6 Paediatric ACR core criteria,  2 active joints, and \nimprovement of  30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria.  After 32 weeks or at disease flare, patients \nwere eligible to enrol into the open label extension phase. \n \n\n\n\n141 \n\nTable 26 \nPed ACR 30 Responses in the JIA study \n\n \nStratum MTX Without MTX \nPhase  \nOL-LI 16 weeks  \n\nPed ACR 30 \nresponse (n/N) \n\n94.1% (80/85) 74.4% (64/86) \n\n                                                           Efficacy Outcomes\nDouble Blind 32 weeks Humira /MTX \n\n(N = 38) \n \n\nPlacebo / MTX \n(N = 37) \n\nHumira  \n(N = 30) \n\nPlacebo \n(N = 28) \n\nDisease flares at \nthe end of \n32 weeksa (n/N) \n\n36.8% (14/38) 64.9% (24/37)b 43.3% (13/30) 71.4% \n(20/28)c \n\nMedian time to \ndisease flare \n\n>32 weeks 20 weeks >32 weeks 14 weeks \n\n \n\na Ped ACR 30/50/70 responses Week 48 significantly greater than those of placebo treated patients  \nb p = 0.015 \nc p = 0.031 \n \n\nAmongst those who responded at Week 16 (n=144), the Paediatric ACR 30/50/70/90 responses were \nmaintained for up to six years in the OLE phase in patients who received Humira throughout the study. \nOver all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of the baseline age group 13 to \n17 years were treated 6 years or longer. \n \nOverall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with the \ncombination of Humira and MTX compared to Humira alone. Taking these results into consideration, \nHumira is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as monotherapy in patients for \nwhom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2). \n \npJIA II \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children (2 - \n<4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg) with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. \nThe patients received 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of Humira up to a maximum of 20 mg every \nother week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During the study, most subjects used \nconcomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. \n \nAt Week 12 and Week 24, PedACR30 response was 93.5% and 90.0%, respectively, using the observed \ndata approach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR50/70/90 at Week 12 and Week 24 were \n90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Amongst those who responded (Paediatric \nACR 30) at Week 24 (n=27 out of 30 patients), the Paediatric ACR 30 responses were maintained for up \nto 60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received Humira throughout this time period. Overall, 20 \nsubjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study in 46 \npaediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were randomised \nto receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of Humira up to a maximum of 40 mg, or placebo \n\n\n\n142 \n\nevery other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-label (OL) period during \nwhich patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of Humira up to a maximum of 40 mg every other week \nsubcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change from \nBaseline to Week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints \nwith loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with mean percent decrease of -\n62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the Humira group compared to -11.6% (median \npercent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo group. Improvement in number of active joints with \narthritis was maintained during the OL period through Week 156 for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the \nHumira group who remained in the study. Although not statistically significant, the majority of patients \ndemonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender \njoint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), Paediatric ACR 50 response, and Paediatric ACR 70 \nresponse. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis  \n\n \nThe efficacy of Humira was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of 114 paediatric \npatients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a PGA ≥ 4 or > 20% BSA \ninvolvement or > 10% BSA involvement with very thick lesions or PASI ≥ 20 or ≥ 10 with clinically \nrelevant facial, genital, or hand/ foot involvement) who were inadequately controlled with topical therapy \nand heliotherapy or phototherapy.  \n \nPatients received Humira 0.8 mg/kg eow (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg/kg eow (up to 20 mg), or methotrexate 0.1 \n– 0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg).   At Week 16, more patients randomised to Humira 0.8 mg/kg had \npositive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those randomised to 0.4 mg/kg eow or MTX.   \n \n\nTable 27: Paediatric Plaque Psoriasis Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n \n\n \nMTXa \nN=37 \n\nHumira 0.8 mg/kg eow \nN=38  \n\n PASI 75b 12 (32.4%) 22 (57.9%) \n PGA: Clear/minimalc 15 (40.5%) 23 (60.5%) \na MTX = methotrexate \nb P=0.027, Humira 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX \nc P=0.083, Humira 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX\n\n \nPatients who achieved PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal were withdrawn from treatment for up to \n36 weeks and monitored for loss of disease control (i.e. a worsening of PGA by at least 2 grades).  Patients \nwere then re-treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for an additional 16 weeks and response rates \nobserved during retreatment were similar to the previous double-blind period:  PASI 75 response of 78.9% \n(15 of 19 subjects) and PGA clear or minimal of 52.6% (10 of 19 subjects). \n \nIn the open label period of the study, PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal responses were maintained for \nup to an additional 52 weeks with no new safety findings. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThere are no clinical trials with Humira in adolescent patients with HS. Efficacy of adalimumab for the \ntreatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and exposure-\nresponse relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, pathophysiology, and \ndrug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure levels. Safety of the \nrecommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on cross-indication safety \n\n\n\n143 \n\nprofile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more frequent doses (see section \n5.2). \n \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease  \n \n\nHumira was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the \nefficacy and safety of induction and maintenance treatment with doses dependent on body weight \n(< 40 kg or ≥ 40 kg) in 192 paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 (inclusive) years, with \nmoderate to severe Crohn´s disease (CD) defined as Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) \nscore > 30. Subjects had to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunomodulator) for CD. Subjects may also have previously lost response or been intolerant to \ninfliximab.  \n \nAll subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their Baseline body weight: 160 mg \nat Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 for subjects ≥ 40 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for subjects \n< 40 kg. \n \nAt Week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the Low Dose or \nStandard Dose maintenance regimens as shown in Table 28. \n \n\nTable 28 \nMaintenance regimen\n\nPatient \nWeight \n\nLow dose Standard \ndose \n\n< 40 kg 10 mg eow 20 mg eow\n≥ 40 kg 20 mg eow 40 mg eow\n\n \nEfficacy results \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was clinical remission at Week 26, defined as PCDAI score  10. \n \nClinical remission and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI score of at least 15 points from \nBaseline) rates are presented in Table 29.

After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0% (37/50) of the 50 patients remaining in the \nstudy continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0% (46/50) of patients continued to be in clinical \nresponse per PCDAI. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, trial in 93 \npaediatric patients from 5 to 17 years of age with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 \nwith endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 points, confirmed by centrally read endoscopy) who had an inadequate \nresponse or intolerance to conventional therapy. Approximately 16% of patients in the study had failed \nprior anti-TNF treatment. Patients who received corticosteroids at enrollment were allowed to taper their \ncorticosteroid therapy after Week 4. \n\n\n\n145 \n\n \nIn the induction period of the study, 77 patients were randomized 3:2 to receive double-blind treatment \nwith Humira at an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0 and Week 1, and 1.2 \nmg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2; or an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week \n0, placebo at Week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2. Both groups received 0.6 mg/kg \n(maximum of 40 mg) at Week 4 and Week 6. Following an amendment to the study design, the remaining \n16 patients who enrolled in the induction period received open-label treatment with Humira at the \ninduction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0 and Week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of \n80 mg) at Week 2.  \n \nAt Week 8, 62 patients who demonstrated clinical response per Partial Mayo Score (PMS; defined as a \ndecrease in PMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline) were randomized equally to receive double-blind \nmaintenance treatment with Humira at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every week (ew), or a \nmaintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every other week (eow). Prior to an amendment to \nthe study design, 12 additional patients who demonstrated clinical response per PMS were randomized to \nreceive placebo but were not included in the confirmatory analysis of efficacy. \n \nDisease flare was defined as an increase in PMS of at least 3 points (for patients with PMS of 0 to 2 at \nWeek 8), at least 2 points (for patients with PMS of 3 to 4 at Week 8), or at least 1 point (for patients with \nPMS of 5 to 6 at Week 8).  \n \nPatients who met criteria for disease flare at or after Week 12 were randomized to receive a re-induction \ndose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) or a dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) and continued to \nreceive their respective maintenance dose regimen afterwards.  \n \n\nEfficacy Results \n\n \n\nThe co-primary endpoints of the study were clinical remission per PMS (defined as PMS ≤ 2 and no \nindividual subscore > 1) at Week 8, and clinical remission per FMS (Full Mayo Score) (defined as a Mayo \nScore ≤ 2 and no individual subscore > 1) at Week 52 in patients who achieved clinical response per PMS \nat Week 8. \n \nClinical remission rates per PMS at Week 8 for patients in each of the Humira

increases (improvement) from Baseline in \nBody Mass Index were observed for subjects on the high maintenance dose of maximum 40 mg (0.6 \nmg/kg) ew.  \n \nPaediatric Uveitis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in a randomized, double-masked, controlled study of 90 \npaediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated noninfectious anterior uveitis \nwho were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment.  Patients received either placebo or \n20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if ≥ 30 kg) every other week in combination with \ntheir baseline dose of methotrexate.  \n\n\n\n148 \n\n \nThe primary endpoint was ‘time to treatment failure’. The criteria determining treatment failure were \nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with development \nof sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted use of \nconcomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. \n \nClinical Response \n \nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (See Figure 3, \nP < 0.0001 from log rank test).The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects treated \nwith placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects treated with \nadalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure.  Adalimumab \nsignificantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown by the hazard \nratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI:  0.12, 0.49]). \n \n\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier Curves Summarizing Time to Treatment Failure in the Paediatric Uveitis \n\nStudy \n\n \n\nP\nR\n\nO\nB\n\nA\nB\n\nIL\nIT\n\nY\n O\n\nF\n F\n\nA\nIL\n\nIN\nG\n\n T\nR\n\nE\nA\n\nT\nM\n\nE\nN\n\nT\n \n\n TIME (WEEKS) \n Treatment Placebo  Adalimumab \n Note: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); H = HUMIRA (Number at Risk).\n\n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n\n\n149 \n\n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab was \nslow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The average \nabsolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 to \n15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-life \nwas approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several rheumatoid \narthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 g/ml (without \nconcomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 g/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively.  The serum \nadalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following 20, 40 and \n80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week. \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npatients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean trough \nsteady-state (values measured from Week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was 5.6 ± 5.6 µg/ml \n(102% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 ± 5.2 µg/ml (47.7% CV) with \nconcomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing <15 kg dosed \nwith adalimumab 24 mg/m2 , the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations was \n6.0 ± 6.1 µg/ml (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 7.9 ± 5.6 µg/ml \n(71.2% CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npatients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state (values \nmeasured at Week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 ± 6.6 μg/ml for adalimumab without \nconcomitant methotrexate and 11.8 ± 4.3 μg/ml with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult non-\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients, the mean (±SD) trough steady-state concentration at Week \n68 was 8.0 ± 4.6 g/ml. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 g/ml during \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. \n \nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npaediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean ± SD steady-state adalimumab trough \nconcentration was approximately 7.4 ± 5.8 µg/ml (79% CV). \n \nIn adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on \nWeek 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 μg/ml at Week 2 and \nWeek 4.  The mean steady-state trough concentration at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 8 \nto 10 μg/ml during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment.   \n \nAdalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n\n\n\n150 \n\n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). The recommended adolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week. Since exposure to \nadalimumab can be affected by body size, adolescents with higher body weight and inadequate response \nmay benefit from receiving the recommended adult dose of 40 mg every week. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 40 mg Humira \non Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 g/ml during the \ninduction period. A loading dose of 160 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 80 mg Humira on Week 2 \nachieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 g/ml during the induction period. \nMean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 g/ml were observed in Crohn’s disease patients who \nreceived a maintenance dose of 40 mg Humira every other week. \n \nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at Weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg.  At \nWeek 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose \n(20/10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (±SD) serum \nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at Week 4 were 15.7±6.6 g/ml for patients ≥ 40 kg \n(160/80 mg) and 10.6±6.1 g/ml for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg).  \n \nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (±SD) adalimumab trough concentrations \nat Week 52 were 9.5±5.6g/ml for the Standard Dose group and 3.5±2.2 g/ml for the Low Dose group.  \nThe mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to receive adalimumab \ntreatment eow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from eow to weekly regimen, the mean \n(±SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at Week 52 were 15.3±11.4 μg/ml (40/20 mg, weekly) and \n6.7±3.5 μg/ml (20/10 mg, weekly). \n \nIn patients with ulcerative colitis, a loading dose of 160 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 80 mg Humira \non Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 g/ml during the \ninduction period.  Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 8 g/ml were observed in ulcerative \ncolitis patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg Humira every other week.  \n \nFollowing the subcutaneous administration of body weight-based dosing of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of \n40 mg) every other week to paediatric patients with ulcerative colitis, the mean trough steady-state serum \nadalimumab concentration was 5.01±3.28 µg/ml at Week 52. For patients who received 0.6 mg/kg \n(maximum of 40 mg) every week, the mean (±SD) trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentration \nwas 15.7±5.60 μg/ml at Week 52. \n \nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week starting at Week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \napproximately 8 to 10 g/ml. \n \nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. The \npredicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an initial \nincrease in systemic exposure. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation predicted \ncomparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other week when \ncompared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, patients with \nadolescent HS, and paediatric patients ≥ 40 kg with CD and UC). \n \n\n\n\n151 \n\nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \n \nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response relationship \nwas established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent adalimumab \nplasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 response (EC50) was \n3 μg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 μg/ml).  \n \nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, \nrespectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab concentrations, \nboth with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 μg/ml (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and 1.9-10.5, \nrespectively).   \n \nElimination \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance.  The serum \nlevels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower in \npatients with measurable AAA.   \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \nHumira has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, repeated \ndose toxicity, and genotoxicity.   \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of harm \nto the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of fertility \nand postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models for an \nantibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralising antibodies in \nrodents.  \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nHumira in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: \n \n the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response \n\nto disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate. \n the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated \n\nwith methotrexate. \n \nHumira can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment \nwith methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nHumira has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to \nimprove physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. \n \n\n\n\n155 \n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nHumira in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or \nmore disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Humira can be given as monotherapy in case \nof intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for the \nefficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Humira has not been studied in patients aged less than 2 years. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and \nolder, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see section \n5.1). \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an \ninadequate response to conventional therapy. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and / or MRI, who have had an \ninadequate response to, or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the \nresponse to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Humira has \nbeen shown to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients \nwith polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see Section 5.1) and to improve physical function. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who \nare candidates for systemic therapy. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from \n4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical therapy \nand phototherapies. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa) \nin adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS \ntherapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n156 \n\nCrohn’s disease \n \nHumira is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, in adult patients who \nhave not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.  \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease  \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or \nhave contraindications for such therapies. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nHumira is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who \nhave had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine \n(6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such \ntherapies.  \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \ncorticosteroids and/or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have \nmedical contraindications for such therapies. \n \nUveitis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult \npatients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of corticosteroid-\nsparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. \n \nPaediatric Uveitis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients from \n2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, or in \nwhom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration   \n \nHumira treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of conditions for which Humira is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised to consult with \nan appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Humira (see section 4.4). Patients treated with \nHumira should be given the Patient Reminder Card. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Humira if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.  \n \nDuring treatment with Humira, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n \nPosology \n\n\n\n157 \n\n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. Methotrexate should be \ncontinued during treatment with Humira. \n \nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued during \ntreatment with Humira.  Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs other than \nmethotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response to Humira 40 mg every other \nweek may benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg every other \nweek.  \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment.  \nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nDose interruption \n \nThere may be a need for dose interruption, for instance before surgery or if a serious infection occurs. \n \nAvailable data suggest that re-introduction of Humira after discontinuation for 70 days or longer resulted \nin the same magnitudes of clinical response and similar safety profile as before dose interruption. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and psoriatic arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of AS and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab administered \nevery other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment.  \nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for adult patients is an initial dose of 80 mg administered \nsubcutaneously, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously given every other week starting one week after the \ninitial dose. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within \nthis time period. \n \nBeyond 16 weeks, patients with inadequate response to Humira 40 mg every other week may benefit from \nan increase in dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. The benefits and risks of continued \n40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with an \ninadequate response after the increase in dosage (see section 5.1).  If adequate response is achieved with \n40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week, the dosage may subsequently be reduced to 40 mg every \nother week. \n \n\n\n\n158 \n\nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThe recommended Humira dose regimen for adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is 160 mg \ninitially at Day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two \nconsecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later at Day 15 (given as two 40 mg injections in one \nday). Two weeks later (Day 29) continue with a dose of 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week \n(given as two 40 mg injections in one day). Antibiotics may be continued during treatment with Humira if \nnecessary. It is recommended that the patient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a \ndaily basis during treatment with Humira. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement \nwithin this time period.   \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Humira 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be re-\nintroduced (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see section 5.1). \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nThe recommended Humira induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderately to severely active \nCrohn’s disease is 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg at Week 2. In case there is a need for a more rapid \nresponse to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at Week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two \n40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg at Week 2 (given as two 40 mg \ninjections in one day), can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher during \ninduction. \n \nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection. \nAlternatively, if a patient has stopped Humira and signs and symptoms of disease recur, Humira may be \nre-administered. There is little experience from re-administration after more than 8 weeks since the \nprevious dose. \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines. \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Humira 40 mg every other week may benefit \nfrom an increase in dosage to 40 mg Humira every week or 80 mg every other week. \n \nSome patients who have not responded by Week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough Week 12. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within \nthis time period. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \n\n\n\n159 \n\nThe recommended Humira induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderate to severe ulcerative \ncolitis is 160 mg at Week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day \nfor two consecutive days) and 80 mg at Week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in one day). After \ninduction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines.  \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to 40 mg every other week may benefit from an \nincrease in dosage to 40 mg Humira every week or 80 mg every other week. \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 2-8 weeks of treatment.  Humira \ntherapy should not be continued in patients failing to respond within this time period. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for adult patients with uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by \n40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. There is limited experience in the \ninitiation of treatment with Humira alone. Treatment with Humira can be initiated in combination with \ncorticosteroids and/or with other non-biologic immunomodulatory agents. Concomitant corticosteroids \nmay be tapered in accordance with clinical practice starting two weeks after initiating treatment with \nHumira.    \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1).   \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment is required. \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n \nHumira has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years \nof age is based on body weight (Table 1). Humira is administered every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection. \n \n\nTable 1. Humira Dose for Patients with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis  \n\n\n\n160 \n\n \nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n10 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued \ntherapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in patients aged less than 2 years for this indication. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis from 6 years of age is based \non body weight (Table 2).  Humira is administered every other week via subcutaneous injection. \n \n\nTable 2. Humira Dose for Patients with Enthesitis-Related Arthritis  \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nHumira has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 years. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in the paediatric population for the indications of ankylosing \nspondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe recommended Humira dose for patients with plaque psoriasis from 4 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 3). Humira is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \n\n\n\n161 \n\nTable 3. Humira Dose for Paediatric Patients with Plaque Psoriasis  \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg Initial dose of 20 mg, followed by \n20 mg given every other week \n\nstarting one week after the initial \ndose  \n\n≥ 30 kg Initial dose of 40 mg, followed by \n40 mg given every other week \n\nstarting one week after the initial \ndose \n\n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient not responding within this \ntime period. \n \nIf retreatment with Humira is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration should be \nfollowed. \n \nThe safety of Humira in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean of \n13 months. \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 4 years for this indication. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg) \n \nThere are no clinical trials with Humira in adolescent patients with HS.  The posology of Humira in these \npatients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation (see section 5.2). \n \nThe recommended Humira dose is 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week \n1 via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nIn adolescent patients with inadequate response to Humira 40 mg every other week, an increase in dosage \nto 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be considered. \n \nAntibiotics may be continued during treatment with Humira if necessary.  It is recommended that the \npatient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with \nHumira.  \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement \nwithin this time period.   \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Humira may be re-introduced as appropriate. \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see adult data in \nsection 5.1) \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 12 years in this indication. \n\n\n\n162 \n\n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with Crohn’s disease from 6 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 4). Humira is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \n\nTable 4.

No clinical data are \navailable on the use of a Humira loading dose in children < 6 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 2 years in this indication. \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nHumira is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the package \nleaflet. \n \nHumira is available in other strengths and presentations. \n \n\n\n\n164 \n\n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability  \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function may \nincrease the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for infections, \nincluding tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Humira.  Because the elimination of \nadalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period. \n \nTreatment with Humira should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \nlocalised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis and \npatients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with Humira \nshould be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Humira should be monitored \nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Humira should be discontinued if \na patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or antifungal therapy \nshould be initiated until the infection is controlled.  Physicians should exercise caution when considering \nthe use of Humira in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which \nmay predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. \n \nSerious infections \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving Humira.   \n \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported.  \n \nTuberculosis \n \nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients receiving \nHumira.  Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) tuberculosis.  \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with Humira, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(“latent”) tuberculosis infection.  This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of patient \nhistory of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and previous \nand/or current immunosuppressive therapy.  Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest \n\n\n\n165 \n\nX-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply).  It is recommended that \nthe conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the Patient Reminder Card.  Prescribers are reminded \nof the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or \nimmunocompromised.  \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Humira therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully considered. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted.   \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis \ntreatment before the initiation of Humira, and in accordance with local recommendations.  \n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of Humira in \npatients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for tuberculosis and \nin patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment \ncannot be confirmed.   \n \nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients \ntreated with Humira. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active tuberculosis have \nredeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with Humira. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \ninfection (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or after \ntherapy with Humira.  \n \nOther opportunistic infections \n \nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nHumira. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-antagonists and \nthis has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal outcomes.  \n \nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant shock \nan invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Humira should be promptly \ndiscontinued.  Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made \nin consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive fungal infections.  \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Humira, who are \nchronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive).  Some cases have had a fatal outcome. Patients \nshould be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Humira. For patients who test positive \nfor hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is \nrecommended. \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Humira should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms \nof active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. \nAdequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with \nTNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients who develop HBV \n\n\n\n166 \n\nreactivation, Humira should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be initiated.  \n \nNeurological events  \n \nTNF-antagonists including Humira have been associated in rare instances with new onset or exacerbation \nof clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease \nincluding multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-\nBarré syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Humira in patients with pre-\nexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of \nHumira should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between \nintermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in \npatients with non-infectious intermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of Humira therapy and regularly \nduring treatment to assess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders.  \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nSerious allergic reactions associated with Humira were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious allergic \nreactions associated with Humira were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of serious allergic \nreactions including anaphylaxis have been received following Humira administration. If an anaphylactic \nreaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Humira should be discontinued \nimmediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  \n \nImmunosuppression \n \nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with Humira, there was no evidence of \ndepression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in \nenumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been \nreported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma \nand leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, \nwhich complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of \nlymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including \nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases \nrepresented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with \nimmunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with \nTNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.  \n \nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated with \nadalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. \nSome of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with Humira have occurred in young adult patients on \nconcomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for inflammatory bowel disease. The \npotential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and Humira should be carefully \n\n\n\n167 \n\nconsidered. A risk for the development of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Humira \ncannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom treatment \nwith Humira is continued following development of malignancy.  Thus, additional caution should be \nexercised in considering Humira treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy or \npsoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-\nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Humira.  Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma \nhave also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab (see section 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients with \nmoderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung \nor head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients \nhad a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist in \nCOPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking. \n \nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia or \ncolon cancer.  All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon \ncarcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), \nor who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular \nintervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy \nand biopsies per local recommendations. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists.  \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with Humira. All patients should be advised to seek \nimmediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. \npersistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Humira. Discontinuation of Humira therapy should be \nconsidered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n \nVaccinations  \n \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by \nlive vaccines in patients receiving Humira.   \n \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating Humira therapy. \n \nPatients on Humira may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration of live \nvaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for 5 months \nfollowing the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nCongestive heart failure \n \nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality \ndue to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also \nbeen reported in patients receiving Humira. Humira should be used with caution in patients with mild \n\n\n\n168 \n\nheart failure (NYHA class I/II). Humira is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure (see section \n4.3). Treatment with Humira must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms \nof congestive heart failure. \n \nAutoimmune processes \n \nTreatment with Humira may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of long-term \ntreatment with Humira on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient develops \nsymptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Humira and is positive for \nantibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Humira should not be given (see section \n4.8). \n \nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists \n \nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the \nnature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. (See section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDS (e.g, anakinra and abatacept) or \nother TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, \nincluding serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. (See section 4.5). \n \nSurgery \n \nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with Humira. The long half-\nlife of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned.  A patient who \nrequires surgery while on Humira should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions \nshould be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving \nHumira.  \n \nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that Humira does not worsen or cause \nstrictures. \n \nElderly \n \nThe frequency of serious infections among Humira treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) was \nhigher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention \nregarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSee Vaccinations above. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nHumira has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic \narthritis patients taking Humira as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate.  Antibody \nformation was lower when Humira was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as \n\n\n\n169 \n\nmonotherapy. Administration of Humira without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of \nantibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe combination of Humira and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent administration \nof biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”).  \n \nThe combination of Humira and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy \nand continue its use for at least five months after the last Humira treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large number (approximately 2100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1500 exposed during the first trimester, \ndoes not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn’s disease (CD) \ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated with \nadalimumab were enrolled.  The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. The \nrate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 (8.7%) in \nthe adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with RA (unadjusted \nOR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women with CD and 3/32 \n(9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). The adjusted OR \n(accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD combined. There were \nno distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for the secondary endpoints \nspontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and serious or opportunistic \ninfections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation of data may be impacted due \nto methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-randomized design. \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n(see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNF, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune \nresponses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.   \n \nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration of \nlive vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk at \nvery low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% \nof the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and \n\n\n\n170 \n\nhave poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, \nHumira can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \n \nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nHumira may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \nimpairment may occur following administration of Humira (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nHumira was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months or \nmore.  These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease, \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) as \nwell as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa \nand uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients receiving Humira and 3,801 \npatients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled period. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking Humira and 5.4% for control treated \npatients. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory \ntract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), \nheadache and musculoskeletal pain. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for Humira. TNF-antagonists, such as Humira affect the \nimmune system and their use may affect the body’s defence against infection and cancer. \nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV reactivation \nand various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been reported with use \nof Humira. \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include \nrare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events and reports of \nlupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \nadult patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on postmarketing \nexperience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 7 below: very common \n( 1/10); common ( 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon ( 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); \nand not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, \n\n\n\n171 \n\nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest frequency seen among the \nvarious indications has been included.

with HS treated with Humira weekly was consistent with the known safety \nprofile of Humira. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety profile for patients with uveitis treated with Humira every other week was consistent with the \nknown safety profile of Humira. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9% of patients treated with Humira developed \ninjection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 7.2% of \npatients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate \ndiscontinuation of the medicinal product. \n \nInfections  \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in the \nHumira treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients. The \ninfections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and sinusitis. Most \npatients continued on Humira after the infection resolved.   \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in Humira treated patients and 0.03 per \npatient year in placebo and active control − treated patients.   \n \nIn controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with Humira, serious infections (including fatal \ninfections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including \nmiliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated or \nextrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystis, candidiasis, \naspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first eight months after \ninitiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years during \nHumira trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \nenthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric patients with an \nexposure of 498.1 patient years during Humira trials in paediatric patients with Crohn’s disease. No \nmalignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of 80.0 patient years during a \nHumira trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No malignancies were observed in 93 \npaediatric patients with an exposure of 65.3 patient years during a Humira trial in paediatric patients with \nulcerative colitis. No malignancies were observed in 60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 \npatient years during a Humira trial in paediatric patients with uveitis. \n \n\n\n\n177 \n\nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal Humira trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in patients \nwith moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of AS,  psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s \ndisease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, \nwere observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5)  per 1,000 patient-years among 5,291 \nHumira treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per 1,000 patient-years among 3,444 control \npatients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for Humira and 3.8 months for control-treated \npatients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 \npatient-years among Humira-treated patients and 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among control \npatients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of \n2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among Humira-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-\nyears among control patients. The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per \n1,000 patient-years among Humira-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among \ncontrol patients. \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open label extension \nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over 26,439 \npatient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin \ncancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient years. The observed rate of non-melanoma skin cancers is \napproximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is approximately 1.3 per \n1,000 patient years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.3 \nper 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n \nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with \nadalimumab (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies  \n \nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis studies \nI − V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with Humira and 8.1% of placebo and active \ncontrol − treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at \nWeek 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with Humira in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \nstudies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved \nfollowing discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system \nsymptoms. \n \nHepato-biliary events \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis with a \ncontrol period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.7% of \nHumira-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were \n4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred \nin 6.1% of Humira-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. Most ALT elevations occurred \nwith concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of Humira \nin patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to < 4 years. \n \n\n\n\n178 \n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis with a control \nperiod ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of Humira-treated \npatients and 0.9% of controlled-treated patients.  \n \nIn the Phase 3 trial of Humira in patients with paediatric Crohn’s disease which evaluated efficacy and \nsafety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted induction \ntherapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6%  (5/192) of patients of \nwhom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with plaque psoriasis with a control period duration \nranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of Humira-treated patients and \n1.8% of control-treated patients.  \n \nNo ALT elevations ≥ 3 X ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of Humira in paediatric patients with plaque \npsoriasis. \n \nIn controlled trials of Humira (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg \nevery week starting at Week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control period duration \nranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of Humira-treated patients and \n0.6% of control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled trials of Humira (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week \nstarting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of 166.5 days and \n105.0 days in Humira-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN \noccurred in 2.4% of Humira-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn the controlled Phase 3 trial of Humira in patients with paediatric ulcerative colitis (N=93) which \nevaluated efficacy and safety of a maintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every other week \n(N=31) and a maintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every Week (N=32), following body \nweight adjusted induction dosing of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0 and Week 1, and 1.2 \nmg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2 (N=63), or an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) \nat Week 0, placebo at Week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2 (N=30), ALT elevations ≥ \n3 X ULN occurred in 1.1% (1/93) of patients. \n \nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment.  However, there have also been post-\nmarketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, such \nas hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine \n \nIn adult Crohn’s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \nevents were seen with the combination of Humira and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared with \nHumira alone. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \n\n\n\n179 \n\nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has been \nmultiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended dose.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors. \nATC code: L04AB04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.   \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes \nin the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 \nwith an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM).  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects  \n \nAfter treatment with Humira, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after Humira administration. Patients treated with Humira usually \nexperienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with Humira. In \npatients with Crohn’s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing inflammatory markers in the \ncolon including a significant reduction of expression of TNFα was seen. Endoscopic studies in intestinal \nmucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab treated patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nHumira was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The efficacy and \nsafety of Humira were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. Some \npatients were treated for up to 120 months duration. Injection site pain of Humira 40 mg/0.4 ml was \nassessed in two randomised, active control, single-blind, two-period crossover studies.  \n \nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had \ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) every \nweek and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, 40 or \n80 mg of Humira or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs.  Doses of \n20 or 40 mg of Humira were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on alternative \n\n\n\n180 \n\nweeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration.  No other \ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have \nbeen intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study.  The first \nreceived placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of Humira every week \nfor 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of Humira every other week with placebo injections on \nalternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension \nphase in which 40 mg of Humira/MTX was administered every other week up to 10 years. \n \nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were  18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic \ndrug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a \nminimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, \nsulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of Humira or placebo every other week \nfor 24 weeks.   \n \nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nHumira 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, Humira 40 mg every other week \nmonotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of progression \nof joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 weeks, 497 \npatients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of Humira was administered every \nother week up to 10 years. \n \nRA studies VI and VII each evaluated 60 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis \nwho were ≥ 18 years old. Enrolled patients were either current users of Humira 40 mg/0.8 ml and rated \ntheir average injection site pain as at least 3 cm (on a 0-10 cm VAS) or were biologic-naïve subjects who \nwere starting Humira 40 mg/0.8 ml. Patients were randomised to receive a single dose of Humira \n40 mg/0.8 ml or Humira 40 mg/0.4 ml, followed by a single injection of the opposite treatment at their \nnext dose.  \n \nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \npercent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA \nstudy V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at Week 52. RA studies III and V \nhad an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by X-ray \nresults). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life. The primary endpoint in \nRA studies VI and VII was injection site pain immediately after injection as measured by a 0-10 cm VAS. \n \nACR response \n \nThe percent of Humira-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent across RA \nstudies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in Table 8.  \n\n\n\n181 \n\n \nTable 8  \n\nACR Responses in Placebo-Controlled Trials \n(Percent of Patients) \n\n \nResponse RA Study Ia** RA Study IIa** RA Study IIIa** \n\n \n Placebo/ \n\nMTXc \nn=60 \n\nHumirab/ MTXc\n\nn=63 \nPlacebo \nn=110 \n\nHumirab \nn=113 \n\nPlacebo/ \nMTXc \nn=200 \n\nHumirab/ MTXc\n\nn=207 \n\nACR 20    \n 6 months 13.3% 65.1% 19.1% 46.0% 29.5% 63.3%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 24.0% 58.9%\nACR 50    \n 6 months 6.7% 52.4% 8.2% 22.1% 9.5% 39.1%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 9.5% 41.5%\nACR 70    \n 6 months 3.3% 23.8% 1.8% 12.4% 2.5% 20.8%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 4.5% 23.2%\na RA study I at 24 weeks, RA study II at 26 weeks, and RA study III at 24 and 52 weeks \nb 40 mg Humira administered every other week \nc MTX = methotrexate \n**p < 0.01, Humira versus placebo \n\n \nIn RA studies I-IV, all individual components of the ACR response criteria (number of tender and swollen \njoints, physician and patient assessment of disease activity and pain, disability index (HAQ) scores and \nCRP (mg/dl) values) improved at 24 or 26 weeks compared to placebo. In RA study III, these \nimprovements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained \nresponse when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to Humira 40 mg every \nother week, 114 patients continued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 5 years. Among those, 86 \npatients (75.4%) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2%) had ACR 50 responses; and 41 patients \n(36%) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on Humira 40 mg every other week \nfor 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0%) had ACR 20 responses; 56 patients (69.1%) had ACR 50 \nresponses; and 43 patients (53.1%) had ACR 70 responses. \n \nIn RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with Humira plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p < 0.001).   \n \nIn RA studies I-IV, Humira-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 responses \ncompared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. \n \nIn RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination therapy \nwith Humira and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than methotrexate \nmonotherapy and Humira monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at Week 104 (see Table \n9). \n\n\n\n182 \n\n \nTable 9  \n\nACR Responses in RA Study V \n(percent of patients) \n\n \n\nResponse \nMTX \nn=257 \n\nHumira \nn=274 \n\nHumira/MTX \nn=268 \n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nACR 20   \n Week \n52 \n\n62.6% 54.4% 72.8% 0.013 < 0.001 0.043 \n\n Week \n104 \n\n56.0% 49.3% 69.4% 0.002 < 0.001 0.140 \n\nACR 50   \n Week \n52 \n\n45.9% 41.2% 61.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.317 \n\n Week \n104 \n\n42.8% 36.9% 59.0% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.162 \n\nACR 70   \n Week \n52 \n\n27.2% 25.9% 45.5% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.656 \n\n Week \n104 \n\n28.4% 28.1% 46.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.864 \n\na. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \n\nb. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \n\nc.   p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n\n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study V, ACR response rates were maintained when followed for up to \n10 years. Of 542 patients who were randomised to Humira 40 mg every other week, 170 patients \ncontinued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 154 patients (90.6%) had ACR \n20 responses; 127 patients (74.7%) had ACR 50 responses; and 102 patients (60.0%) had ACR 70 \nresponses. \n \nAt Week 52, 42.9% of patients who received Humira/methotrexate combination therapy achieved clinical \nremission (DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6) compared to 20.6% of patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy and \n23.4% of patients receiving Humira monotherapy. Humira/methotrexate combination therapy was \nclinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and Humira monotherapy (p < 0.001) in \nachieving a low disease state in patients with recently diagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. \nThe response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447).  Of 342 subjects originally \nrandomized to Humira monotherapy or Humira/methotrexate combination therapy who entered the open-\nlabel extension study, 171 subjects completed 10 years of Humira treatment. Among those, 109 subjects \n(63.7%) were reported to be in remission at 10 years. \n \nRadiographic response \n \nIn RA study III, where Humira treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in \nmodified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score.  \nHumira/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients \nreceiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 10).   \n \n\n\n\n183 \n\nIn the open-label extension of RA Study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is \nmaintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated with \n40 mg Humira every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients showed no \nprogression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. At \n10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg Humira every other week were evaluated \nradiographically. Among those, 40 patients showed no progression of structural damage defined by a \nchange from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. \n \n\nTable 10 \n Radiographic Mean Changes Over 12 Months in RA Study III \n\n \n Placebo/ \n\nMTXa \nHumira/MTX \n40 mg every \nother week \n\nPlacebo/MTX-\nHumira/MTX (95% \n\nConfidence \nIntervalb)\n\np-value \n\nTotal Sharp Score 2.7 0.1 2.6 (1.4, 3.8) < 0.001c \n\nErosion score 1.6 0.0 1.6 (0.9, 2.2) < 0.001 \nJSNd score 1.0 0.1 0.9 (0.3, 1.4)   0.002 \n\namethotrexate \nb95% confidence intervals for the differences in change scores between methotrexate and Humira.  \ncBased on rank analysis  \ndJoint Space Narrowing \n \nIn RA study V, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified \nTotal Sharp Score (see Table 11). \n \n\nTable 11 \n  Radiographic Mean Changes at Week 52 in RA Study V \n\n \n\n \n\nMTX \nn=257 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval) \n\nHumira \nn=274 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval)\n\nHumira/MTX \nn=268 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval)\n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nTotal Sharp \nScore \n\n5.7 (4.2-7.3) 3.0 (1.7-4.3) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) < 0.001 0.0020 < 0.001 \n\nErosion score 3.7 (2.7-4.7) 1.7 (1.0-2.4) 0.8 (0.4-1.2) < 0.001 0.0082 < 0.001\nJSN score 2.0 (1.2-2.8) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) 0.5 (0-1.0) < 0.001 0.0037 0.151\n\na p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \n\nb p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test  \n\nc p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n\n \nFollowing 52 weeks and 104 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients without progression (change \nfrom baseline in modified Total Sharp Score  0.5) was significantly higher with Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy (63.8% and 61.2% respectively) compared to methotrexate monotherapy (37.4% and \n33.5% respectively, p < 0.001) and Humira monotherapy (50.7%, p < 0.002 and 44.5%, p < 0.001 \nrespectively). \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA study V, the mean change from baseline at Year 10 in the modified \nTotal Sharp Score was 10.8, 9.2 and 3.9 in patients originally randomized to methotrexate monotherapy, \n\n\n\n184 \n\nHumira monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate combination therapy, respectively. The corresponding \nproportions of patients with no radiographic progression were 31.3%, 23.7% and 36.7% respectively. \n \nQuality of life and physical function  \n \nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the Health \nAssessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, which was a \npre-specified primary endpoint at Week 52 in RA study III. All doses/schedules of Humira in all four \nstudies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the HAQ from \nbaseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was seen at Week 52. Results from \nthe Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of Humira in all four studies support these \nfindings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically \nsignificant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other week dose. A statistically significant \ndecrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was \nseen in all three studies in which it was assessed (RA studies I, III, IV). \n \nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued treatment \nmaintained improvement through Week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. Improvement in \nquality of life was measured up to Week 156 (36 months) and improvement was maintained through that \ntime. \n \nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for Humira/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and Humira monotherapy at Week 52, which was maintained through \nWeek 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in \nphysical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment. \n \nInjection site pain \n \nFor the pooled crossover RA studies VI and VII, a statistically significant difference for injection site pain \nimmediately after dosing was observed between Humira 40 mg/0.8 ml and Humira 40 mg/0.4 ml (mean \nVAS of 3.7 cm versus 1.2 cm, scale of 0-10 cm, P < 0.001).  This represented an 84% median reduction in \ninjection site pain. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \n \nHumira 40 mg every other week was assessed in 393 patients in two randomised, 24 week double − blind, \nplacebo − controlled studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (mean baseline score of disease \nactivity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] was 6.3 in all groups) who have \nhad an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Seventy-nine (20.1%) patients were treated \nconcomitantly with disease modifying anti − rheumatic drugs, and 37 (9.4%) patients with \nglucocorticoids.

Radiographs of hands, wrists, and \nfeet were obtained at baseline and Week 24 during the double-blind period when patients were on Humira \nor placebo and at Week 48 when all patients were on open-label Humira. A modified Total Sharp Score \n(mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e. not identical to the TSS used for rheumatoid \narthritis), was used. \n \nHumira treatment reduced the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with placebo \ntreatment as measured by change from baseline in mTSS  (mean ± SD) 0.8 ± 2.5 in the placebo group (at \nWeek 24) compared with 0.0 ± 1.9; (p< 0.001) in the Humira group (at Week 48). \n \nIn subjects treated with Humira with no radiographic progression from baseline to Week 48 (n=102), 84% \ncontinued to show no radiographic progression through 144 weeks of treatment. \nHumira treated patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in physical function as assessed \nby HAQ and Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) compared to placebo at Week 24. Improved physical \nfunction continued during the open label extension up to Week 136. \n \nPsoriasis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis ( 10% \nBSA involvement and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)  12 or  10) who were candidates for \nsystemic therapy or phototherapy in randomised, double-blind studies. 73% of patients enrolled in \nPsoriasis Studies I and II had received prior systemic therapy or phototherapy.  The safety and efficacy of \nHumira were also studied in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with \nconcomitant hand and/or foot psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy in a randomised double-\nblind study (Psoriasis Study III).   \n \nPsoriasis Study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods.  In period A, patients \nreceived placebo or Humira at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one \nweek after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least a PASI 75 response \n(PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline), entered period B and received open-label \n40 mg Humira every other week. Patients who maintained PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were \noriginally randomised to active therapy in Period A, were re-randomised in period C to receive 40 mg \nHumira every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups, the mean \nbaseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) score ranged from \n“moderate” (53% of subjects included) to “severe” (41%) to “very severe” (6%). \n \nPsoriasis Study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of Humira versus methotrexate and \nplacebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg and thereafter dose \nincreases up to Week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by \n40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for 16 weeks. There are no data available \ncomparing Humira and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. Patients receiving MTX who achieved a \nPASI 50 response at Week 8 and/or 12 did not receive further dose increases. Across all treatment \ngroups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the baseline PGA score ranged from “mild” (<1%) to \n“moderate” (48%) to “severe” (46%) to “very severe” (6%). \n \nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an open-label \nextension trial, where Humira was given for at least an additional 108 weeks. \n \nIn Psoriasis Studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 \nresponse from baseline at Week 16 (see Tables 16 and 17). \n\n\n\n190 \n\n \nTable 16 \n\nPs Study I (REVEAL)  - Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n \nPlacebo \nN=398 \nn (%) \n\nHumira 40 mg eow \nN=814 \nn (%) \n\n     PASI 75a 26 (6.5) 578 (70.9)b \n    PASI 100 3 (0.8) 163 (20.0)b \n    PGA: Clear/minimal 17 (4.3) 506 (62.2)b \na Percent of patients achieving PASI75 response was calculated as centre-\nadjusted rate \nb p < 0.001, Humira vs. placebo\n\n \n\nTable 17 \n Ps Study II (CHAMPION) Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n Placebo \n\nN=53 \nn (%) \n\nMTX \nN=110 \nn (%) \n\nHumira 40 mg eow \nN=108 \nn (%) \n\n     PASI 75 10 (18.9) 39 (35.5) 86 (79.6) a, b \n    PASI 100 1 (1.9) 8 (7.3) 18 (16.7) c, d \n    PGA: \nClear/minimal \n\n6 (11.3) 33 (30.0) 79 (73.1) a, b \n\na p < 0.001 Humira vs. placebo \nb p < 0.001 Humira vs. methotrexate \nc p < 0.01 Humira vs. placebo \nd p < 0.05 Humira vs. methotrexate\n\n \nIn Psoriasis Study I, 28% of patients who were PASI 75 responders and were re-randomised to placebo at \nWeek 33 compared to 5% continuing on Humira, p < 0.001, experienced “loss of adequate response” \n(PASI score after Week 33 and on or before Week 52 that resulted in a <PASI 50 response relative to \nbaseline with a minimum of a 6-point increase in PASI score relative to Week 33). Of the patients who \nlost adequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into the open-label extension \ntrial, 38% (25/66) and 55% (36/66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and 24 weeks of re-treatment, \nrespectively. \n \nA total of 233 PASI 75 responders at Week 16 and Week 33 received continuous Humira therapy for \n52 weeks in Psoriasis Study I, and continued Humira in the open-label extension trial.  PASI 75 and PGA \nof clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7% and 59.0%, respectively, after an \nadditional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all patients who \ndropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, were considered \nnon-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 69.6% and \n55.7%, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). \n \nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label \nextension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a median \ntime to relapse (decline to PGA “moderate” or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of these patients \nexperienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of patients who entered the \nretreatment period had a response of PGA “clear” or “minimal” after 16 weeks of retreatment, irrespective \nof whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1%[123/178] and 88.8% [95/107] for patients who \nrelapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, respectively).  A similar safety profile was \nobserved during retreatment as before withdrawal. \n \n\n\n\n191 \n\nSignificant improvements at Week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (Studies I and II) and MTX \n(Study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In Study I, improvements in \nthe physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also significant compared to \nplacebo. \n \nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to 40 mg \nweekly due to a PASI response below 50%, 26.4% (92/349) and 37.8% (132/349) of patients achieved \nPASI 75 response at Week 12 and 24, respectively. \n \nPsoriasis Study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of Humira versus placebo in 72 patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients received an \ninitial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) \nor placebo for 16 weeks. At Week 16, a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients who \nreceived Humira achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands and/or feet compared to patients \nwho received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively [P = 0.014]). \n \nPsoriasis Study IV compared efficacy and safety of Humira versus placebo in 217 adult patients with \nmoderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by 40 mg \nevery other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label \nHumira treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included the Modified Nail \nPsoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician’s Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) \nand the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 18).

The patients in HS-I and HS-II had Hurley Stage II or III disease with at least \n3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. \n \nStudy HS-I (PIONEER I) evaluated 307 patients with 2 treatment periods.  In Period A, patients received \nplacebo or Humira at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every week \nstarting at Week 4 to Week 11.  Concomitant antibiotic use was not allowed during the study.  After \n\n\n\n192 \n\n12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received Humira in Period A were re-randomised in Period B to 1 \nof 3 treatment groups (Humira 40 mg every week, Humira 40 mg every other week, or placebo from Week \n12 to Week 35).  Patients who had been randomised to placebo in Period A were assigned to receive \nHumira 40 mg every week in Period B. \n \nStudy HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods.  In Period A, patients received \nplacebo or Humira at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 and 40 mg every week \nstarting at Week 4 to Week 11.  19.3% of patients had continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the \nstudy.  After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received Humira in Period A were re-randomised in \nPeriod B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (Humira 40 mg every week, Humira 40 mg every other week, or \nplacebo from Week 12 to Week 35).  Patients who had been randomised to placebo in Period A were \nassigned to receive placebo in Period B. \n \nPatients participating in Studies HS-I and HS-II were eligible to enrol into an open-label extension study \nin which Humira 40mg was administered every week.

Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric \nRating Scale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 point \nscale.  \n \nAt Week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with Humira versus placebo achieved \nHiSCR.   At Week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients in Study HS-II experienced a clinically \nrelevant decrease in HS-related skin pain (see Table 19).

Approximately twice the proportion of patients in the placebo group in the first 12 \nweeks of Studies HS-I and HS-II, compared with those in the Humira group experienced worsening of \nabscesses (23.0% vs 11.4%, respectively) and draining fistulas (30.0% vs 13.9%, respectively). \n \nGreater improvements at Week 12 from baseline compared to placebo were demonstrated in skin-specific \nhealth-related quality of life, as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; Studies HS-I \n\n\n\n193 \n\nand HS-II), patient global satisfaction with medication treatment as measured by the Treatment \nSatisfaction Questionnaire - medication (TSQM; Studies HS-I and HS-II), and physical health as \nmeasured by the physical component summary score of the SF-36 (Study HS-I). \n \nIn patients with at least a partial response to Humira 40 mg weekly at Week 12, the HiSCR rate at Week \n36 was higher in patients who continued weekly Humira than in patients in whom dosing frequency was \nreduced to every other week, or in whom treatment was withdrawn (see Table 20).   \n \n\nTable 20:  Proportion of Patientsa Achieving HiSCRb at Weeks 24 and 36 After  \nTreatment Reassignment from Weekly Humira at Week 12 \n\n \n\nPlacebo \n(treatment \n\nwithdrawal) \nN = 73 \n\nHumira 40 mg \nevery other week \n\nN = 70 \n\nHumira 40 mg \nweekly \nN = 70 \n\nWeek 24 24 (32.9%) 36 (51.4%) 40 (57.1%) \n\nWeek 36 22 (30.1%) 28 (40.0%) 39 (55.7%) \na Patients with at least a partial response to Humira 40 mg weekly after 12 \n\nweeks of treatment. \nb Patients meeting protocol-specified criteria for loss of response or no \n\nimprovement were required to discontinue from the studies and were \ncounted as nonresponders.\n\n \nAmong patients who were at least partial responders at Week 12, and who received continuous weekly \nHumira therapy, the HiSCR rate at Week 48 was 68.3% and at Week 96 was 65.1%. Longer term \ntreatment with Humira 40 mg weekly for 96 weeks identified no new safety findings. \n \nAmong patients whose Humira treatment was withdrawn at Week 12 in Studies HS-I and HS-II, the \nHiSCR rate 12 weeks after re-introduction of Humira 40 mg weekly returned to levels similar to that \nobserved before withdrawal (56.0 %). \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in over 1500 patients with moderately to severely active \nCrohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI)  220 and  450) in randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80% of patients continued to receive at least one of these \nmedications.  \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD Study I \n(CLASSIC I) and CD Study II (GAIN). In CD Study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were \nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg Humira at Week 0 and \n80 mg at Week 2, 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. In \nCD Study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to \nreceive either 160 mg Humira at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. The primary \nnon-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM).  In CD Study III, 854 patients \nreceived open-label 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2.  At Week 4 patients were randomised to \n40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks. Patients in \nclinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at Week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those \nnot in clinical response at Week 4.  Corticosteroid taper was permitted after Week 8.  \n \n\n\n\n194 \n\nCD study I and CD study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 21. \n \n\nTable 21 \nInduction of Clinical Remission and Response \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n\n CD Study I: Infliximab Naive \nPatients \n\nCD Study II: Infliximab \nExperienced Patients \n\n Placebo \nN=74 \n\nHumira \n80/40 mg \n\nN = 75 \n\nHumira  \n160/80 mg \n\nN=76 \n\nPlacebo \nN=166 \n\nHumira  \n160/80 mg \n\nN=159 \n\nWeek 4      \n\nClinical remission 12% 24% 36%* 7% 21%* \n\nClinical response (CR-\n100) \n\n24% 37% 49%** 25% 38%** \n\nAll p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for Humira versus placebo \n* p < 0.001 \n** p < 0.01 \n\n \nSimilar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by Week 8 and \nadverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group. \n \nIn CD Study III, at Week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the \nprimary analysis. Of those in clinical response at Week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to other TNF-\nantagonists. Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 22.  Clinical remission \nresults remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF-antagonist exposure. \n \nDisease-related hospitalisations and surgeries were statistically significantly reduced with adalimumab \ncompared with placebo at Week 56. \n\n\n\n195 \n\n \nTable 22 \n\nMaintenance of Clinical Remission and Response \n(Percent of Patients) \n\n Placebo 40 mg Humira \nevery other week \n\n40 mg Humira\nevery week \n\nWeek 26 N=170 N=172 N=157 \n\nClinical remission 17% 40%* 47%* \n\nClinical response (CR-100) 27% 52%* 52%* \n\nPatients in steroid-free remission  \nfor >=90 daysa \n\n3% (2/66) 19% (11/58)** 15% (11/74)** \n\nWeek 56 N=170 N=172 N=157 \n\nClinical remission 12% 36%* 41%* \n\nClinical response (CR-100) 17% 41%* 48%* \n\nPatients in steroid-free remission  \nfor > = 90 daysa \n\n5% (3/66) 29% (17/58)* 20% (15/74)** \n\n* p < 0.001 for Humira versus placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions \n** p < 0.02 for Humira versus placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions \na Of those receiving corticosteroids at baseline \n\n \nAmong patients who were not in response at Week 4, 43% of Humira maintenance patients responded by \nWeek 12 compared to 30% of placebo maintenance patients. These results suggest that some patients who \nhave not responded by Week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through Week 12.  Therapy \ncontinued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section 4.2).   \n \n117/276 patients from CD study I and 272/777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed through \nat least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy.  88 and 189 patients, respectively, continued to be in \nclinical remission.  Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and 233 patients, respectively. \n \nQuality of life \n \nIn CD Study I and CD Study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific inflammatory \nbowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at Week 4 in patients randomised to Humira \n80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at Weeks 26 and 56 in CD Study III as well \namong the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of multiple doses of Humira were assessed in adult patients with moderately to \nseverely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3) in randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies.  \n \nIn study UC-I, 390 TNF-antagonist naïve patients were randomised to receive either placebo at Weeks 0 \nand 2, 160 mg Humira at Week 0 followed by 80 mg at Week 2, or 80 mg Humira at Week 0 followed by \n40 mg at Week 2.  After Week 2, patients in both adalimumab arms received 40 mg eow.  Clinical \nremission (defined as Mayo score ≤ 2 with no subscore > 1) was assessed at Week 8.  \n \nIn study UC-II, 248 patients received 160 mg of Humira at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2 and 40 mg eow \nthereafter, and 246 patients received placebo. Clinical results were assessed for induction of remission at \nWeek 8 and for maintenance of remission at Week 52.  \n\n\n\n196 \n\n \nPatients induced with 160/80 mg Humira achieved clinical remission versus placebo at Week 8 in \nstatistically significantly greater percentages in study UC-I (18% vs. 9% respectively, p=0.031) and study \nUC-II (17% vs. 9% respectively, p=0.019). In study UC-II, among those treated with Humira who were in \nremission at Week 8, 21/41 (51%) were in remission at Week 52. \n \nResults from the overall UC-II study population are shown in Table 23. \n \n\nTable 23 \nResponse, Remission and Mucosal Healing in Study UC-II \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n Placebo\n\n \nHumira 40 mg  \n\neow \n\nWeek 52 N=246 N=248 \n  Clinical Response  18%   30%* \n\n  Clinical Remission 9%   17%* \n  Mucosal Healing  15%   25%* \n  Steroid-free remission for ≥ 90 days a  6%  \n\n(N=140) \n     13% * \n(N=150) \n\nWeek 8 and 52 \n  Sustained Response  12%   24%** \n  Sustained Remission  4%   8%* \n  Sustained Mucosal Healing  11%  19%* \nClinical remission is Mayo score  ≤ 2 with no subscore > 1; \nClinical response is decrease from baseline in Mayo score ≥ 3 points and ≥ 30% plus a \ndecrease in the rectal bleeding subscore [RBS] ≥ 1 or an absolute RBS of 0 or 1; \n*p < 0.05 for Humira vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions  \n**p < 0.001 for Humira vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions \na   Of those receiving corticosteroids at baseline \n \nOf those patients who had a response at Week 8, 47% were in response, 29% were in remission, 41% had \nmucosal healing, and 20% were in steroid-free remission for ≥ 90 days at Week 52. \n \nApproximately 40% of patients in study UC-II had failed prior anti-TNF treatment with infliximab. The \nefficacy of adalimumab in those patients was reduced compared to that in anti-TNF naïve patients.  \nAmong patients who had failed prior anti-TNF treatment, Week 52 remission was achieved by 3% on \nplacebo and 10% on adalimumab. \n \nPatients from studies UC-I and UC-II had the option to roll over into an open-label long-term extension \nstudy (UC III). Following 3 years of adalimumab therapy, 75% (301/402) continued to be in clinical \nremission per partial Mayo score.  \n \nHospitalisation rates \n \nDuring 52 weeks of studies UC-I and UC-II, lower rates of all-cause hospitalisations and UC-related \nhospitalisations were observed for the adalimumab-treated arm compared to the placebo arm. The number \nof all cause hospitalisations in the adalimumab treatment group was 0.18 per patient year vs. 0.26 per \n\n\n\n197 \n\npatient year in the placebo group and the corresponding figures for UC-related hospitalisations were 0.12 \nper patient year vs. 0.22 per patient year. \n \nQuality of life \n \nIn study UC-II, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease \nQuestionnaire (IBDQ) score.  \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious intermediate, \nposterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomised, double-\nmasked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or Humira at an initial dose of \n80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. Concomitant stable \ndoses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted.  \n \nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of prednisone \n60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid \ndiscontinuation by Week 15.  \n \nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment (oral \nprednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent a \nmandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19.  \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was ´time to treatment failure´. Treatment failure was \ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal \nvascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected visual \nacuity (BCVA).  \n \nPatients who completed Studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term \nextension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on \nstudy medication beyond Week 78 until they had access to Humira. \n \nClinical Response \n \nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in \npatients treated with Humira versus patients receiving placebo (See Table 24). Both studies demonstrated \nan early and sustained effect of Humira on the treatment failure rate versus placebo (see Figure 2).  \n \n\n\n\n198 \n\nTable 24 \nTime to Treatment Failure in Studies UV I and UV II \n\n \nAnalysis \n Treatment \n\nN Failure \nN (%) \n\nMedian Time to \nFailure (months) \n\nHRa CI 95% \nfor HRa \n\nP Value b \n\nTime to Treatment Failure At or After Week 6 in Study UV I   \nPrimary analysis (ITT)   \n Placebo 107 84 (78.5) 3.0 -- -- -- \n Adalimumab 110 60 (54.5) 5.6 0.50 0.36, 0.70  < 0.001\nTime to Treatment Failure At or After Week 2 in Study UV II \nPrimary analysis (ITT)   \n Placebo 111 61 (55.0) 8.3 -- -- -- \n Adalimumab 115 45 (39.1) NEc 0.57 0.39, 0.84 0.004 \n\nNote:  Treatment failure at or after Week 6 (Study UV I), or at or after Week 2 (Study UV II), was \ncounted as event.

In Study UV II, statistically significant differences were \nobserved for visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of adalimumab. \n \nOf the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of Studies UV I and UV II, 60 \nsubjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to complications secondary to diabetic \nretinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary analysis of \nefficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of open-label \nadalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3%) were in quiescence (no active \ninflammatory lesions, AC cell grade  ≤ 0.5+, VH grade ≤ 0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose ≤ 7.5 mg \nper day, and 178 (66.2%) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA was either improved or maintained (< 5 \nletters deterioration) in 88.6% of the eyes at week 78. Data beyond Week 78 were generally consistent \nwith these results but the number of enrolled subjects declined after this time. Overall, among the patients \nwho discontinued the study, 18% discontinued due to adverse events, and 8% due to insufficient response \nto adalimumab treatment. \n \nQuality of Life \n \nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, \nusing the NEI VFQ-25. Humira was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with statistically \nsignificant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and total score in \nStudy UV I, and for general vision and mental health in Study UV II. Vision related effects were not \nnumerically in favour of Humira for colour vision in Study UVI and for colour vision, peripheral vision \nand near vision in Study UV II. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nFormation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of \nadalimumab. There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and the \noccurrence of adverse events. \n \n\n\n\n200 \n\nPatients in rheumatoid arthritis studies I, II and III were tested at multiple time points for anti-adalimumab \nantibodies during the 6 to 12 month period. In the pivotal trials, anti-adalimumab antibodies were \nidentified in 5.5% (58/1053) of patients treated with adalimumab, compared to 0.5% (2/370) on placebo.  \nIn patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when \nadalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate.   \n \nIn patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 4 to 17 years, anti-adalimumab \nantibodies were identified in 15.8% (27/171) of patients treated with adalimumab. In patients not given \nconcomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 25.6% (22/86) compared to 5.9% (5/85) when adalimumab \nwas used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were \n2 to <4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing <15 kg, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7% \n(1/15) of patients, and the one patient was receiving concomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with enthesitis-related arthritis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 10.9% (5/46) of \npatients treated with adalimumab. In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was \n13.6% (3/22), compared to 8.3% (2/24) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with psoriatic arthritis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 38/376 subjects (10%) \ntreated with adalimumab. In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 13.5% \n(24/178 subjects), compared to 7% (14 of 198 subjects) when adalimumab was used as add-on to \nmethotrexate. \n \nIn patients with ankylosing spondylitis anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 17/204 subjects \n(8.3%) treated with adalimumab. In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was \n16/185 (8.6%), compared to 1/19 (5.3%) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in \n8/152 subjects (5.3%) who were treated continuously with adalimumab. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7/269 subjects (2.6%) and \nin 19/487 subjects (3.9%) with ulcerative colitis. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 77/920 subjects (8.4%) \ntreated with adalimumab monotherapy. \n \nIn adult plaque psoriasis patients on long term adalimumab monotherapy who participated in a withdrawal \nand retreatment study, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment (11 of 482 subjects, 2.3%) \nwas similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal (11 of 590 subjects, 1.9%). \n \nIn patients with paediatric psoriasis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 5/38 subjects (13%) \ntreated with 0.8 mg/kg adalimumab monotherapy. \n \nIn patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified \nin 10/99 subjects (10.1%) treated with adalimumab. \n \nIn patients with moderately to severely active paediatric Crohn’s disease, the rate of anti-adalimumab \nantibody development in patients receiving adalimumab was 3.3%.  \n \nIn adult patients with non-infectious uveitis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 4.8% (12/249) \nof patients treated with adalimumab. \n \nIn patients with moderately to severely active paediatric ulcerative colitis, the rate of anti-adalimumab \nantibody development in patients receiving adalimumab was 3%. \n\n\n\n201 \n\n \nBecause immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody rates with those from \nother products is not appropriate. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with active \npolyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA onset types \n(most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis). \n \npJIA I \n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \nparallel − group study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in \nphase (OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or non-MTX-treated. \nPatients who were in the non-MTX stratum were either naïve to or had been withdrawn from MTX at \nleast two weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or \nprednisone ( 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). In the OL LI phase all patients received 24 mg/m2 \n\nup to a maximum of 40 mg Humira every other week for 16 weeks.  The distribution of patients by age \nand minimum, median and maximum dose received during the OL LI phase is presented in Table 25. \n \n\nTable 25  \nDistribution of patients by age and adalimumab dose received during the OL LI phase \n\n \nAge Group Number of patients at Baseline \n\nn (%) \nMinimum, median and maximum \ndose\n\n4 to 7 years 31 (18.1) 10, 20 and 25 mg \n\n8 to 12 years 71 (41.5) 20, 25 and 40 mg \n13 to 17 years 69 (40.4) 25, 40 and 40 mg \n\n \nPatients demonstrating a Paediatric ACR 30 response at Week 16 were eligible to be randomised into the \ndouble blind (DB) phase and received either Humira 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg, or placebo \nevery other week for an additional 32 weeks or until disease flare.

Taking these results into consideration, \nHumira is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as monotherapy in patients for \nwhom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2). \n \npJIA II \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children \n(2 - < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg) with moderately to severely active polyarticular \nJIA. The patients received 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of Humira up to a maximum of 20 mg \nevery other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During the study, most subjects \nused concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. \n \nAt Week 12 and Week 24, PedACR30 response was 93.5% and 90.0%, respectively, using the observed \ndata approach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR50/70/90 at Week 12 and Week 24 were \n90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Amongst those who responded (Paediatric \nACR 30) at Week 24 (n=27 out of 30 patients), the Paediatric ACR 30 responses were maintained for up \nto 60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received Humira throughout this time period. Overall, \n20 subjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study in 46 \npaediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were randomised \nto receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of Humira up to a maximum of 40 mg, or placebo \nevery other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-label (OL) period during \n\n\n\n203 \n\nwhich patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of Humira up to a maximum of 40 mg every other week \nsubcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change from \nBaseline to Week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints \nwith loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with mean percent decrease of -\n62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the Humira group compared to -11.6% (median \npercent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo group. Improvement in number of active joints with \narthritis was maintained during the OL period through Week 156 for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the \nHumira group who remained in the study. Although not statistically significant, the majority of patients \ndemonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender \njoint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), Paediatric ACR 50 response, and Paediatric ACR 70 \nresponse. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis  \n \nThe efficacy of Humira was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of 114 paediatric \npatients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a PGA ≥ 4 or > 20% BSA \ninvolvement or > 10% BSA involvement with very thick lesions or PASI ≥ 20 or ≥ 10 with clinically \nrelevant facial, genital, or hand/ foot involvement) who were inadequately controlled with topical therapy \nand heliotherapy or phototherapy.  \n \nPatients received Humira 0.8 mg/kg eow (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg/kg eow (up to 20 mg), or methotrexate \n0.1- 0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg).   At Week 16, more patients randomised to Humira 0.8 mg/kg had \npositive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those randomised to 0.4 mg/kg eow or MTX.   \n \n\nTable 27:  Paediatric Plaque Psoriasis Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n \nMTXa \nN=37 \n\nHumira 0.8 mg/kg eow \nN=38  \n\n PASI 75b 12 (32.4%) 22 (57.9%) \n PGA: Clear/minimalc 15 (40.5%) 23 (60.5%) \na MTX = methotrexate \nb P=0.027, Humira 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX \nc P=0.083, Humira 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX\n\n \nPatients who achieved PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal were withdrawn from treatment for up to \n36 weeks and monitored for loss of disease control (i.e. a worsening of PGA by at least 2 grades).  Patients \nwere then re-treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for an additional 16 weeks and response rates \nobserved during retreatment were similar to the previous double-blind period:  PASI 75 response of 78.9% \n(15 of 19 subjects) and PGA clear or minimal of 52.6% (10 of 19 subjects). \n \nIn the open label period of the study, PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal responses were maintained for \nup to an additional 52 weeks with no new safety findings. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThere are no clinical trials with Humira in adolescent patients with HS.  Efficacy of adalimumab for the \ntreatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and exposure-\nresponse relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, pathophysiology, and \ndrug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure levels. Safety of the \nrecommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on cross-indication safety \nprofile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more frequent doses (see section \n5.2). \n \n\n\n\n204 \n\nPaediatric Crohn’s disease  \n \n\nHumira was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the \nefficacy and safety of induction and maintenance treatment with doses dependent on body weight (< 40 kg \nor ≥ 40 kg) in 192 paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 (inclusive) years, with moderate to \nsevere Crohn´s disease (CD) defined as Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score > 30.  \nSubjects had to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator) \nfor CD. Subjects may also have previously lost response or been intolerant to infliximab.  \n \nAll subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their Baseline body weight: 160 mg \nat Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 for subjects ≥ 40 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for subjects \n< 40 kg. \n \nAt Week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the Low Dose or \nStandard Dose maintenance regimens as shown in Table 28. \n \n\nTable 28 \nMaintenance regimen\n\nPatient \nWeight \n\nLow dose Standard \ndose \n\n< 40 kg 10 mg eow 20 mg eow\n≥ 40 kg 20 mg eow 40 mg eow\n\n \nEfficacy results \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was clinical remission at Week 26, defined as PCDAI score  10. \n \nClinical remission and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI score of at least 15 points from \nBaseline) rates are presented in Table 29.

After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0% (37/50) of the 50 patients remaining in the \nstudy continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0% (46/50) of patients continued to be in clinical \nresponse per PCDAI. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, trial in 93 \npaediatric patients from 5 to 17 years of age with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 \nwith endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 points, confirmed by centrally read endoscopy) who had an inadequate \nresponse or intolerance to conventional therapy. Approximately 16% of patients in the study had failed \nprior anti-TNF treatment. Patients who received corticosteroids at enrollment were allowed to taper their \ncorticosteroid therapy after Week 4. \n \nIn the induction period of the study, 77 patients were randomized 3:2 to receive double-blind treatment \nwith Humira at an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0 and Week 1, and 1.2 \nmg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2; or an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week \n0, placebo at Week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2. Both groups received 0.6 mg/kg \n(maximum of 40 mg) at Week 4 and Week 6. Following an amendment to the study design, the remaining \n16 patients who enrolled in the induction period received open-label treatment with Humira at the \ninduction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0 and Week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of \n80 mg) at Week 2.  \n \nAt Week 8, 62 patients who demonstrated clinical response per Partial Mayo Score (PMS; defined as a \ndecrease in PMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline) were randomized equally to receive double-blind \nmaintenance treatment with Humira at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every week (ew), or a \nmaintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every other week (eow). Prior to an amendment to \n\n\n\n206 \n\nthe study design, 12 additional patients who demonstrated clinical response per PMS were randomized to \nreceive placebo but were not included in the confirmatory analysis of efficacy. \n \nDisease flare was defined as an increase in PMS of at least 3 points (for patients with PMS of 0 to 2 at \nWeek 8), at least 2 points (for patients with PMS of 3 to 4 at Week 8), or at least 1 point (for patients with \nPMS of 5 to 6 at Week 8).  \n \nPatients who met criteria for disease flare at or after Week 12 were randomized to receive a re-induction \ndose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) or a dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) and continued to \nreceive their respective maintenance dose regimen afterwards.  \n \n\nEfficacy Results \n\n \n\nThe co-primary endpoints of the study were clinical remission per PMS (defined as PMS ≤ 2 and no \nindividual subscore > 1) at Week 8, and clinical remission per FMS (Full Mayo Score) (defined as a Mayo \nScore ≤ 2 and no individual subscore > 1) at Week 52 in patients who achieved clinical response per PMS \nat Week 8. \n \nClinical remission rates per PMS at Week 8 for patients in each of the

\nClinically meaningful increases (improvement) from Baseline in height velocity were observed for the \ngroups treated with adalimumab, and clinically meaningful increases (improvement) from Baseline in \nBody Mass Index were observed for subjects on the high maintenance dose of maximum 40 mg (0.6 \nmg/kg) ew.  \n \nPaediatric Uveitis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in a randomized, double-masked, controlled study of 90 \npaediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated noninfectious anterior uveitis \nwho were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment.  Patients received either placebo or \n20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if ≥ 30 kg) every other week in combination with \ntheir baseline dose of methotrexate.  \n\n\n\n209 \n\n \nThe primary endpoint was ‘time to treatment failure’. The criteria determining treatment failure were \nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with development \nof sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted use of \nconcomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. \n \nClinical Response \n \nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (See Figure 3, \nP < 0.0001 from log rank test).The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects treated \nwith placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects treated with \nadalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure.  Adalimumab \nsignificantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown by the hazard \nratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI:  0.12, 0.49]). \n \n\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier Curves Summarizing Time to Treatment Failure in the Paediatric Uveitis \n\nStudy \n\n \n\nP\nR\n\nO\nB\n\nA\nB\n\nIL\nIT\n\nY\n O\n\nF\n F\n\nA\nIL\n\nIN\nG\n\n T\nR\n\nE\nA\n\nT\nM\n\nE\nN\n\nT\n \n\n TIME (WEEKS) \n Treatment Placebo  Adalimumab \n Note: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); H = HUMIRA (Number at Risk).\n\n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n\n\n210 \n\n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab was \nslow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The average \nabsolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 to \n15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-life \nwas approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several rheumatoid \narthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 g/ml (without \nconcomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 g/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively.  The serum \nadalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following 20, 40 and \n80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week. \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npatients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean trough \nsteady-state (values measured from Week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was 5.6 ± 5.6 µg/ml \n(102% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 ± 5.2 µg/ml (47.7% CV) with \nconcomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg \ndosed with adalimumab 24 mg/m2 , the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations was \n6.0  ±  6.1 µg/ml (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 7.9 ± 5.6 µg/ml \n(71.2% CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npatients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state (values \nmeasured at Week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 ± 6.6 μg/ml for adalimumab without \nconcomitant methotrexate and 11.8 ± 4.3 μg/ml with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult non-\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients, the mean (±SD) trough steady-state concentration at \nWeek 68 was 8.0 ± 4.6 g/ml. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 g/ml during \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. \n \nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to \npaediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean ± SD steady-state adalimumab trough \nconcentration was approximately 7.4 ± 5.8 µg/ml (79% CV). \n \nIn adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on \nWeek 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 μg/ml at Week 2 and \nWeek 4.  The mean steady-state trough concentration at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 8 \nto 10 μg/ml during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment.   \n \nAdalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related \n\n\n\n211 \n\narthritis). The recommended adolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week. Since exposure to \nadalimumab can be affected by body size, adolescents with higher body weight and inadequate response \nmay benefit from receiving the recommended adult dose of 40 mg every week. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 40 mg Humira \non Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 g/ml during the \ninduction period. A loading dose of 160 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 80 mg Humira on Week 2 \nachieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 g/ml during the induction period. \nMean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 g/ml were observed in Crohn’s disease patients who \nreceived a maintenance dose of 40 mg Humira every other week. \n \nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at Weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg.  At \nWeek 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose \n(20/10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (±SD) serum \nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at Week 4 were 15.7 ± 6.6 g/ml for patients ≥ 40 kg \n(160/80 mg) and 10.6 ± 6.1 g/ml for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg).  \n \nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (±SD) adalimumab trough concentrations \nat Week 52 were 9.5 ± 5.6 g/ml for the Standard Dose group and 3.5 ± 2.2 g/ml for the Low Dose \ngroup.  The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to receive adalimumab \ntreatment eow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from eow to weekly regimen, the mean \n(±SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at Week 52 were 15.3 ± 11.4 μg/ml (40/20 mg, weekly) and \n6.7 ± 3.5 μg/ml (20/10 mg, weekly). \n \nIn patients with ulcerative colitis, a loading dose of 160 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 80 mg Humira \non Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 g/ml during the \ninduction period.  Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 8 g/ml were observed in ulcerative \ncolitis patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg Humira every other week.  \n \nFollowing the subcutaneous administration of body weight-based dosing of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of \n40 mg) every other week to paediatric patients with ulcerative colitis, the mean trough steady-state serum \nadalimumab concentration was 5.01±3.28 µg/ml at Week 52. For patients who received 0.6 mg/kg \n(maximum of 40 mg) every week, the mean (±SD) trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentration \nwas 15.7±5.60 μg/ml at Week 52.  \n \nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week starting at Week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \napproximately 8 to 10 g/ml. \n \nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. The \npredicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an initial \nincrease in systemic exposure. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation predicted \ncomparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other week when \ncompared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, patients with \nadolescent HS, and paediatric patients ≥ 40 kg with CD and UC). \n \nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \n\n\n\n212 \n\nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response relationship \nwas established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent adalimumab \nplasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 response (EC50) was \n3 μg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 μg/ml).  \n \nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, \nrespectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab concentrations, \nboth with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 μg/ml (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and 1.9-10.5, \nrespectively).   \n \nElimination \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance.  The serum \nlevels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower in \npatients with measurable AAA. \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \nHumira has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, repeated \ndose toxicity, and genotoxicity.   \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of harm \nto the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of fertility \nand postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models for an \nantibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralising antibodies in \nrodents.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nSolution for injection. (injection) \nClear, colourless solution.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nHumira in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: \n \n the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response \n\nto disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate. \n the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated \n\nwith methotrexate. \n \nHumira can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment \nwith methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nHumira has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to \nimprove physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who \nare candidates for systemic therapy. \n \n\n\n\n216 \n\nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa) \nin adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS \ntherapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nHumira is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, in adult patients who \nhave not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.  \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease  \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or \nhave contraindications for such therapies. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nHumira is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who \nhave had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine \n(6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such \ntherapies.  \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \ncorticosteroids and/or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have \nmedical contraindications for such therapies. \n \nUveitis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult \npatients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of corticosteroid-\nsparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. \n \nPaediatric Uveitis \n \nHumira is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients from \n2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, or in \nwhom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration   \n \nHumira treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of conditions for which Humira is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised to consult with \nan appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Humira (see section 4.4). Patients treated with \nHumira should be given the Patient Reminder Card. \n \n\n\n\n217 \n\nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Humira if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.  \n \nDuring treatment with Humira, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n \nPosology \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. Methotrexate should be \ncontinued during treatment with Humira. \n \nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or analgesics can be \ncontinued during treatment with Humira.  Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic \ndrugs other than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response to Humira 40 mg every other \nweek may benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg every other \nweek.  \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment.  \nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for adult patients is an initial dose of 80 mg administered \nsubcutaneously, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously given every other week starting one week after the \ninitial dose. Humira 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and/or pre-filled pen is available for \nthe maintenance dose. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within \nthis time period. \n \nBeyond 16 weeks, patients with inadequate response to Humira 40 mg every other week may benefit from \nan increase in dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. The benefits and risks of continued \n40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with an \ninadequate response after the increase in dosage (see section 5.1). If adequate response is achieved with \n40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week, the dosage may subsequently be reduced to 40 mg every \nother week. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThe recommended Humira dose regimen for adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is 160 mg \ninitially at Day 1 (given as two 80 mg injections in one day or as one 80 mg injection per day for two \nconsecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later at Day 15. Two weeks later (Day 29) continue with \n\n\n\n218 \n\na dose of 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. Antibiotics may be continued during treatment \nwith Humira if necessary. It is recommended that the patient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their \nHS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with Humira.  \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement \nwithin this time period.   \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Humira 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be re-\nintroduced (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see section 5.1). \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nThe recommended Humira induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderately to severely active \nCrohn’s disease is 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg at Week 2. In case there is a need for a more rapid \nresponse to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at Week 0 (given as two 80 mg injections in one day or as one \n80 mg injection per day for two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg at Week 2, can be used with the \nawareness that the risk for adverse events is higher during induction. \n \nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection. \nAlternatively, if a patient has stopped Humira and signs and symptoms of disease recur, Humira may be \nre-administered. There is little experience from re-administration after more than 8 weeks since the \nprevious dose.  \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines. \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Humira 40 mg every other week may benefit \nfrom an increase in dosage to 40 mg Humira every week or 80 mg every other week. \n \nSome patients who have not responded by Week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough Week 12. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within \nthis time period. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nThe recommended Humira induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderate to severe ulcerative \ncolitis is 160 mg at Week 0 (given as two 80 mg injections in one day or as one 80 mg injection per day \nfor two consecutive days) and 80 mg at Week 2. After induction treatment, the recommended dose is \n40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines.  \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to 40 mg every other week may benefit from an \nincrease in dosage to 40 mg Humira every week or 80 mg every other week. \n\n\n\n219 \n\n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 2-8 weeks of treatment.  Humira \ntherapy should not be continued in patients failing to respond within this time period. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for adult patients with uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by \n40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. Humira 40 mg solution for injection \nin pre-filled syringe and/or pre-filled pen is available for the maintenance dose. There is limited \nexperience in the initiation of treatment with Humira alone. Treatment with Humira can be initiated in \ncombination with corticosteroids and/or with other non-biologic immunomodulatory agents. Concomitant \ncorticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice starting two weeks after initiating \ntreatment with Humira. \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1).   \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment is required. \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n \nHumira has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira in children aged 4-17 years have been established for plaque psoriasis. \nThe recommended Humira dose is up to a maximum of 40 mg per dose.   \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg) \n \nThere are no clinical trials with Humira in adolescent patients with HS.  The posology of Humira in these \npatients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation (see section 5.2). \n \nThe recommended Humira dose is 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at \nWeek 1 via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nIn adolescent patients with inadequate response to Humira 40 mg every other week, an increase in dosage \nto 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be considered.  \n \n\n\n\n220 \n\nAntibiotics may be continued during treatment with Humira if necessary. It is recommended that the \npatient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with \nHumira.  \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement \nwithin this time period.   \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Humira may be re-introduced as appropriate. \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see adult data in \nsection 5.1) \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 12 years in this indication. \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira for patients with Crohn’s disease from 6 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 1). Humira is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \n\nTable 1.

Humira is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \nIn paediatric uveitis, there is no experience in the treatment with Humira without concomitant treatment \nwith methotrexate. \n\n \nTable 3. Humira Dose for Paediatric Patients with Uveitis \n\n \nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n< 30 kg 20 mg every other week in \ncombination with methotrexate \n\n≥ 30 kg 40 mg every other week in \ncombination with methotrexate \n\n \nWhen Humira therapy is initiated, a loading dose of 40 mg for patients < 30 kg or 80 mg for patients \n≥ 30 kg may be administered one week prior to the start of maintenance therapy. No clinical data are \navailable on the use of a Humira loading dose in children < 6 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nThere is no relevant use of Humira in children aged less than 2 years in this indication. \n \n\n\n\n222 \n\nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nHumira may be available in other strengths and/or presentations depending on the individual treatment \nneeds. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nHumira is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the package \nleaflet. \n \nHumira is available in other strengths and presentations. \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability  \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function may \nincrease the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for infections, \nincluding tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Humira.  Because the elimination of \nadalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period. \n \nTreatment with Humira should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \nlocalised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis and \npatients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with Humira \nshould be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Humira should be monitored \nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Humira should be discontinued if \na patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or antifungal therapy \nshould be initiated until the infection is controlled.  Physicians should exercise caution when considering \nthe use of Humira in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which \nmay predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. \n \n\n\n\n223 \n\nSerious infections \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving Humira.   \n \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported.  \n \nTuberculosis \n \nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients receiving \nHumira.  Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) tuberculosis.  \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with Humira, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(“latent”) tuberculosis infection.  This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of patient \nhistory of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and previous \nand/or current immunosuppressive therapy.  Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest \nX-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply).  It is recommended that \nthe conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the Patient Reminder Card.  Prescribers are reminded \nof the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or \nimmunocompromised.  \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Humira therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully considered. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted.   \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis \ntreatment before the initiation of Humira, and in accordance with local recommendations.  \n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of Humira in \npatients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for tuberculosis and \nin patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment \ncannot be confirmed.   \n \nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients \ntreated with Humira. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active tuberculosis have \nredeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with Humira. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \ninfection (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or after \ntherapy with Humira.  \n \nOther opportunistic infections \n \nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nHumira. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-antagonists and \nthis has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal outcomes.  \n \n\n\n\n224 \n\nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant shock \nan invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Humira should be promptly \ndiscontinued.  Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made \nin consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive fungal infections.  \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Humira, who are \nchronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive).  Some cases have had a fatal outcome. Patients \nshould be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Humira. For patients who test positive \nfor hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is \nrecommended. \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Humira should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms \nof active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. \nAdequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with \nTNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients who develop HBV \nreactivation, Humira should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be initiated.  \n \nNeurological events  \n \nTNF-antagonists including Humira have been associated in rare instances with new onset or exacerbation \nof clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease \nincluding multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-\nBarré syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Humira in patients with pre-\nexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of \nHumira should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between \nintermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in \npatients with non-infectious intermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of Humira therapy and regularly \nduring treatment to assess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders.  \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nSerious allergic reactions associated with Humira were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious allergic \nreactions associated with Humira were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of serious allergic \nreactions including anaphylaxis have been received following Humira administration. If an anaphylactic \nreaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Humira should be discontinued \nimmediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  \n \nImmunosuppression \n \nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with Humira, there was no evidence of \ndepression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in \nenumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been \nreported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma \n\n\n\n225 \n\nand leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, \nwhich complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of \nlymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including \nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases \nrepresented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with \nimmunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with \nTNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.  \n \nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated with \nadalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. \nSome of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with Humira have occurred in young adult patients on \nconcomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for inflammatory bowel disease. The \npotential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and Humira should be carefully \nconsidered. A risk for the development of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Humira \ncannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom treatment \nwith Humira is continued following development of malignancy.  Thus, additional caution should be \nexercised in considering Humira treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy or \npsoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-\nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Humira.  Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma \nhave also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab (see section 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients with \nmoderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung \nor head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients \nhad a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist in \nCOPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking. \n \nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia or \ncolon cancer.  All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon \ncarcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), \nor who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular \nintervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy \nand biopsies per local recommendations. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists.  \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with Humira. All patients should be advised to seek \nimmediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. \npersistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Humira. Discontinuation of Humira therapy should be \nconsidered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n \nVaccinations  \n \n\n\n\n226 \n\nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by \nlive vaccines in patients receiving Humira.   \n \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating Humira therapy. \n \nPatients on Humira may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration of live \nvaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for 5 months \nfollowing the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nCongestive heart failure \n \nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality \ndue to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also \nbeen reported in patients receiving Humira. Humira should be used with caution in patients with mild \nheart failure (NYHA class I/II). Humira is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure (see section \n4.3). Treatment with Humira must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms \nof congestive heart failure. \n \nAutoimmune processes \n \nTreatment with Humira may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of long-term \ntreatment with Humira on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient develops \nsymptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Humira and is positive for \nantibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Humira should not be given (see section \n4.8). \n \nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists \n \nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the \nnature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. (See section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDS (e.g, anakinra and abatacept) or \nother TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, \nincluding serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. (See section 4.5). \n \nSurgery \n \nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with Humira. The long half-\nlife of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned.  A patient who \nrequires surgery while on Humira should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions \nshould be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving \nHumira.  \n \n\n\n\n227 \n\nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that Humira does not worsen or cause \nstrictures. \n \nElderly \n \nThe frequency of serious infections among Humira treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) was \nhigher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention \nregarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSee Vaccinations above. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nHumira has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic \narthritis patients taking Humira as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate.  Antibody \nformation was lower when Humira was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as \nmonotherapy. Administration of Humira without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of \nantibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe combination of Humira and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent administration \nof biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”).  \n \nThe combination of Humira and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy \nand continue its use for at least five months after the last Humira treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large number (approximately 2100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1500 exposed during the first trimester, \ndoes not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn’s disease (CD) \ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated with \nadalimumab were enrolled.  The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. The \nrate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 (8.7%) in \nthe adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with RA (unadjusted \nOR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women with CD and 3/32 \n(9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). The adjusted OR \n(accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD combined. There were \nno distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for the secondary endpoints \nspontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and serious or opportunistic \n\n\n\n228 \n\ninfections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation of data may be impacted due \nto methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-randomized design. \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n(see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNF, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune \nresponses in the newborn.  Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. \n \nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration of \nlive vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk at \nvery low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% \nof the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and \nhave poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, \nHumira can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \n \nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nHumira may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \nimpairment may occur following administration of Humira (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nHumira was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months or \nmore.  These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease, \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) as \nwell as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa \nand uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients receiving Humira and 3,801 \npatients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled period. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking Humira and 5.4% for control treated \npatients. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory \ntract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), \nheadache and musculoskeletal pain. \n \n\n\n\n229 \n\nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for Humira. TNF-antagonists, such as Humira affect the \nimmune system and their use may affect the body’s defence against infection and cancer. \nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV reactivation \nand various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been reported with use \nof Humira. \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include \nrare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events and reports of \nlupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \nadult patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on postmarketing \nexperience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 4 below: very common \n( 1/10); common ( 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon ( 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); \nand not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest frequency seen among the \nvarious indications has been included.

including spontaneous reporting data \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThe safety profile for patients with HS treated with Humira weekly was consistent with the known safety \nprofile of Humira. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety profile for patients with uveitis treated with Humira every other week was consistent with the \nknown safety profile of Humira. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9% of patients treated with Humira developed \ninjection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 7.2% of \npatients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate \ndiscontinuation of the medicinal product. \n \nInfections  \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in the \nHumira treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients. The \ninfections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and sinusitis. Most \npatients continued on Humira after the infection resolved. \n \n\n\n\n235 \n\nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in Humira treated patients and 0.03 per \npatient year in placebo and active control − treated patients. \n \nIn controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with Humira, serious infections (including fatal \ninfections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including \nmiliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated or \nextrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystis, candidiasis, \naspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first eight months after \ninitiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years during \nHumira trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \nenthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric patients with an \nexposure of 498.1 patient years during Humira trials in paediatric patients with Crohn’s disease. No \nmalignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of 80.0 patient years during a \nHumira trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No malignancies were observed in 93 \npaediatric patients with an exposure of 65.3 patient years during a Humira trial in paediatric patients with \nulcerative colitis. No malignancies were observed in 60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 \npatient years during a Humira trial in paediatric patients with uveitis. \n \nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal Humira trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in patients \nwith moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of AS,  psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s \ndisease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, \nwere observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5)  per 1,000 patient-years among 5,291 \nHumira treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per 1,000 patient-years among 3,444 control \npatients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for Humira and 3.8 months for control-treated \npatients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 \npatient-years among Humira-treated patients and 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among control \npatients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of \n2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among Humira-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-\nyears among control patients. The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per \n1,000 patient-years among Humira-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among \ncontrol patients. \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open label extension \nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over 26,439 \npatient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin \ncancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient years. The observed rate of non-melanoma skin cancers is \napproximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is approximately 1.3 per \n1,000 patient years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.3 \nper 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n \nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with \nadalimumab (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies  \n\n\n\n236 \n\n \nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis studies \nI − V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with Humira and 8.1% of placebo and active \ncontrol − treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at \nWeek 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with Humira in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \nstudies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved \nfollowing discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system \nsymptoms. \n \nHepato-biliary events \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis with a \ncontrol period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.7% of \nHumira-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were \n4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred \nin 6.1% of Humira-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. Most ALT elevations occurred \nwith concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of Humira \nin patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to < 4 years. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis with a control \nperiod ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of Humira-treated \npatients and 0.9% of controlled-treated patients.  \n \nIn the Phase 3 trial of Humira in patients with paediatric Crohn’s disease which evaluated efficacy and \nsafety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted induction \ntherapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6%  (5/192) of patients of \nwhom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with plaque psoriasis with a control period duration \nranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of Humira-treated patients and \n1.8% of control-treated patients.  \n \nNo ALT elevations ≥ 3 X ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of Humira in paediatric patients with plaque \npsoriasis. \n \nIn controlled trials of Humira (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg \nevery week starting at Week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control period duration \nranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of Humira-treated patients and \n0.6% of control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled trials of Humira (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week \nstarting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of 166.5 days and \n105.0 days in Humira-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN \noccurred in 2.4% of Humira-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn the controlled Phase 3 trial of Humira in patients with paediatric ulcerative colitis (N=93) which \nevaluated efficacy and safety of a maintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every other week \n(N=31) and a maintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every Week (N=32), following body \nweight adjusted induction dosing of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0 and Week 1, and 1.2 \nmg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2 (N=63), or an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) \n\n\n\n237 \n\nat Week 0, placebo at Week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2 (N=30), ALT elevations ≥ \n3 X ULN occurred in 1.1% (1/93) of patients. \n \nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment.  However, there have also been post-\nmarketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, such \nas hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine \n \nIn adult Crohn’s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \nevents were seen with the combination of Humira and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared with \nHumira alone. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has been \nmultiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended dose.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors. \nATC code: L04AB04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.   \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes \nin the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 \nwith an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM).  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects  \n \nAfter treatment with Humira, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after Humira administration. Patients treated with Humira usually \nexperienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with Humira. In \n\n\n\n238 \n\npatients with Crohn’s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing inflammatory markers in the \ncolon including a significant reduction of expression of TNFα was seen. Endoscopic studies in intestinal \nmucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab treated patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nHumira was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The efficacy and \nsafety of Humira were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. Some \npatients were treated for up to 120 months duration. Injection site pain of Humira 40 mg/0.4 ml was \nassessed in two randomised, active control, single-blind, two-period crossover studies.  \n \nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had \ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) every \nweek and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, 40 or \n80 mg of Humira or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs.  Doses of \n20 or 40 mg of Humira were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on alternative \nweeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration.  No other \ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have \nbeen intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study.  The first \nreceived placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of Humira every week \nfor 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of Humira every other week with placebo injections on \nalternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension \nphase in which 40 mg of Humira/MTX was administered every other week up to 10 years. \n \nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were  18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic \ndrug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a \nminimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, \nsulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of Humira or placebo every other week \nfor 24 weeks.   \n \nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nHumira 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, Humira 40 mg every other week \nmonotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of progression \nof joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 weeks, 497 \npatients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of Humira was administered every \nother week up to 10 years. \n \nRA studies VI and VII each evaluated 60 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis \nwho were ≥ 18 years old. Enrolled patients were either current users of Humira 40 mg/0.8 ml and rated \ntheir average injection site pain as at least 3 cm (on a 0-10 cm VAS) or were biologic-naïve subjects who \nwere starting Humira 40 mg/0.8 ml. Patients were randomised to receive a single dose of Humira \n\n\n\n239 \n\n40 mg/0.8 ml or Humira 40 mg/0.4 ml, followed by a single injection of the opposite treatment at their \nnext dose.  \n \nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \npercent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA \nstudy V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at Week 52. RA studies III and V \nhad an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by X-ray \nresults). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life. The primary endpoint in \nRA studies VI and VII was injection site pain immediately after injection as measured by a 0-10 cm VAS. \n \nACR response \n \nThe percent of Humira-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent across RA \nstudies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in Table 5.  \n \n\nTable 5 \nACR Responses in Placebo-Controlled Trials \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n \n\nResponse RA Study Ia** RA Study IIa** RA Study IIIa** \n \n\n Placebo/ \nMTXc \nn=60 \n\nHumirab/ MTXc\n\nn=63 \nPlacebo \nn=110 \n\nHumirab \nn=113 \n\nPlacebo/ \nMTXc \nn=200 \n\nHumirab/ MTXc\n\nn=207 \n\nACR 20    \n 6 months 13.3% 65.1% 19.1% 46.0% 29.5% 63.3%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 24.0% 58.9%\nACR 50    \n 6 months 6.7% 52.4% 8.2% 22.1% 9.5% 39.1%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 9.5% 41.5%\nACR 70    \n 6 months 3.3% 23.8% 1.8% 12.4% 2.5% 20.8%\n 12 months NA NA NA NA 4.5% 23.2%\na RA study I at 24 weeks, RA study II at 26 weeks , and RA study III at 24 and 52 weeks \nb 40 mg Humira administered every other week \nc MTX = methotrexate \n**p < 0.01, Humira versus placebo \n\n \nIn RA studies I-IV, all individual components of the ACR response criteria (number of tender and swollen \njoints, physician and patient assessment of disease activity and pain, disability index (HAQ) scores and \nCRP (mg/dl) values) improved at 24 or 26 weeks compared to placebo. In RA study III, these \nimprovements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained \nresponse when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to Humira 40 mg every \nother week, 114 patients continued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 5 years. Among those, 86 \npatients (75.4%) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2%) had ACR 50 responses; and 41 patients \n(36%) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on Humira 40 mg every other week \nfor 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0%) had ACR 20 responses; 56 patients (69.1%) had ACR 50 \nresponses; and 43 patients (53.1%) had ACR 70 responses. \n \nIn RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with Humira plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p < 0.001).   \n\n\n\n240 \n\n \nIn RA studies I-IV, Humira-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 responses \ncompared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. \n \nIn RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination therapy \nwith Humira and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than methotrexate \nmonotherapy and Humira monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at Week 104 (see Table \n6). \n \n\nTable 6 \nACR Responses in RA Study V \n\n(percent of patients) \n \n\nResponse \nMTX \nn=257 \n\nHumira \nn=274 \n\nHumira/MTX \nn=268 \n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nACR 20   \n Week \n52 \n\n62.6% 54.4% 72.8% 0.013 < 0.001 0.043 \n\n Week \n104 \n\n56.0% 49.3% 69.4% 0.002 < 0.001 0.140 \n\nACR 50   \n Week \n52 \n\n45.9% 41.2% 61.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.317 \n\n Week \n104 \n\n42.8% 36.9% 59.0% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.162 \n\nACR 70   \n Week \n52 \n\n27.2% 25.9% 45.5% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.656 \n\n Week \n104 \n\n28.4% 28.1% 46.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.864 \n\na. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \n\nb. p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \n\nc.   p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n\n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study V, ACR response rates were maintained when followed for up to \n10 years. Of 542 patients who were randomised to Humira 40 mg every other week, 170 patients \ncontinued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 154 patients (90.6%) had ACR \n20 responses; 127 patients (74.7%) had ACR 50 responses; and 102 patients (60.0%) had ACR 70 \nresponses. \n \nAt Week 52, 42.9% of patients who received Humira/methotrexate combination therapy achieved clinical \nremission (DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6) compared to 20.6% of patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy and \n23.4% of patients receiving Humira monotherapy. Humira/methotrexate combination therapy was \nclinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and Humira monotherapy (p < 0.001) in \nachieving a low disease state in patients with recently diagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. \nThe response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447).  Of 342 subjects originally \nrandomized to Humira monotherapy or Humira/methotrexate combination therapy who entered the open-\nlabel extension study, 171 subjects completed 10 years of Humira treatment. Among those, 109 subjects \n(63.7%) were reported to be in remission at 10 years. \n \n\n\n\n241 \n\nRadiographic response \n \nIn RA study III, where Humira treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in \nmodified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score.  \nHumira/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients \nreceiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 7). \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA Study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is \nmaintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated with \n40 mg Humira every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients showed no \nprogression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. At \n10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg Humira every other week were evaluated \nradiographically. Among those, 40 patients showed no progression of structural damage defined by a \nchange from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. \n \n\nTable 7 \n Radiographic Mean Changes Over 12 Months in RA Study III \n\n \n Placebo/ \n\nMTXa \nHumira/MTX \n40 mg every \nother week \n\nPlacebo/MTX-\nHumira/MTX (95% \n\nConfidence \nIntervalb)\n\np-value \n\nTotal Sharp Score 2.7 0.1 2.6 (1.4, 3.8) < 0.001c \n\nErosion score 1.6 0.0 1.6 (0.9, 2.2) < 0.001 \nJSNd score 1.0 0.1 0.9 (0.3, 1.4)   0.002 \n\namethotrexate \nb95% confidence intervals for the differences in change scores between methotrexate and Humira.  \ncBased on rank analysis  \ndJoint Space Narrowing \n \nIn RA study V, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified \nTotal Sharp Score (see Table 8). \n \n\nTable 8 \n  Radiographic Mean Changes at Week 52 in RA Study V \n\n \n\n \n\nMTX \nn=257 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval) \n\nHumira \nn=274 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval)\n\nHumira/MTX \nn=268 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval)\n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nTotal Sharp \nScore \n\n5.7 (4.2-7.3) 3.0 (1.7-4.3) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) < 0.001 0.0020 < 0.001 \n\nErosion score 3.7 (2.7-4.7) 1.7 (1.0-2.4) 0.8 (0.4-1.2) < 0.001 0.0082 < 0.001\nJSN score 2.0 (1.2-2.8) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) 0.5 (0-1.0) < 0.001 0.0037 0.151\n\na p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \n\nb p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test  \n\nc p-value is from the pairwise comparison of Humira monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n\n \n\n\n\n242 \n\nFollowing 52 weeks and 104 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients without progression (change \nfrom baseline in modified Total Sharp Score  0.5) was significantly higher with Humira/methotrexate \ncombination therapy (63.8% and 61.2% respectively) compared to methotrexate monotherapy (37.4% and \n33.5% respectively, p < 0.001) and Humira monotherapy (50.7%, p < 0.002 and 44.5%, p < 0.001 \nrespectively). \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA study V, the mean change from baseline at Year 10 in the modified \nTotal Sharp Score was 10.8, 9.2 and 3.9 in patients originally randomized to methotrexate monotherapy, \nHumira monotherapy and Humira/methotrexate combination therapy, respectively. The corresponding \nproportions of patients with no radiographic progression were 31.3%, 23.7% and 36.7% respectively. \n \nQuality of life and physical function  \n \nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the Health \nAssessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, which was a \npre-specified primary endpoint at Week 52 in RA study III. All doses/schedules of Humira in all four \nstudies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the HAQ from \nbaseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was seen at Week 52. Results from \nthe Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of Humira in all four studies support these \nfindings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically \nsignificant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other week dose. A statistically significant \ndecrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was \nseen in all three studies in which it was assessed (RA studies I, III, IV). \n \nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued treatment \nmaintained improvement through Week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. Improvement in \nquality of life was measured up to Week 156 (36 months) and improvement was maintained through that \ntime. \n \nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for Humira/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and Humira monotherapy at Week 52, which was maintained through \nWeek 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in \nphysical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment. \n \nInjection site pain \n \nFor the pooled crossover RA studies VI and VII, a statistically significant difference for injection site pain \nimmediately after dosing was observed between Humira 40 mg/0.8 ml and Humira 40 mg/0.4 ml (mean \nVAS of 3.7 cm versus 1.2 cm, scale of 0-10 cm, P < 0.001).  This represented an 84% median reduction in \ninjection site pain. \n \nPsoriasis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis ( 10% \nBSA involvement and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)  12 or  10) who were candidates for \nsystemic therapy or phototherapy in randomised, double-blind studies. 73% of patients enrolled in \nPsoriasis Studies I and II had received prior systemic therapy or phototherapy.  The safety and efficacy of \nHumira were also studied in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with \nconcomitant hand and/or foot psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy in a randomised double-\nblind study (Psoriasis Study III).   \n \n\n\n\n243 \n\nPsoriasis Study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods.  In period A, patients \nreceived placebo or Humira at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one \nweek after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least a PASI 75 response \n(PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline), entered period B and received open-label \n40 mg Humira every other week. Patients who maintained PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were \noriginally randomised to active therapy in Period A, were re-randomised in period C to receive 40 mg \nHumira every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups, the mean \nbaseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) score ranged from \n“moderate” (53% of subjects included) to “severe” (41%) to “very severe” (6%). \n \nPsoriasis Study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of Humira versus methotrexate and \nplacebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg and thereafter dose \nincreases up to Week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by \n40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for 16 weeks. There are no data available \ncomparing Humira and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. Patients receiving MTX who achieved a \nPASI 50 response at Week 8 and/or 12 did not receive further dose increases. Across all treatment \ngroups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the baseline PGA score ranged from “mild” (<1%) to \n“moderate” (48%) to “severe” (46%) to “very severe” (6%). \n \nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an open-label \nextension trial, where Humira was given for at least an additional 108 weeks. \n \nIn Psoriasis Studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 \nresponse from baseline at Week 16 (see Tables 9 and 10). \n \n\nTable 9 \nPs Study I (REVEAL)  - Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n \nPlacebo \nN=398 \nn (%) \n\nHumira 40 mg eow \nN=814 \nn (%) \n\n     PASI 75a 26 (6.5) 578 (70.9)b \n    PASI 100 3 (0.8) 163 (20.0)b \n    PGA: Clear/minimal 17 (4.3) 506 (62.2)b \na Percent of patients achieving PASI75 response was calculated as centre-\nadjusted rate \nb p < 0.001, Humira vs. Placebo\n\n \nTable 10 \n\n Ps Study II (CHAMPION) Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n Placebo \nN=53 \nn (%) \n\nMTX \nN=110 \nn (%) \n\nHumira 40 mg eow \nN=108 \nn (%) \n\n     PASI 75 10 (18.9) 39 (35.5) 86 (79.6) a, b \n    PASI 100 1 (1.9) 8 (7.3) 18 (16.7) c, d \n    PGA: \nClear/minimal \n\n6 (11.3) 33 (30.0) 79 (73.1) a, b \n\na p < 0.001 Humira vs. placebo \nb p < 0.001 Humira vs. methotrexate \nc p < 0.01 Humira vs. placebo \nd p < 0.05 Humira vs. methotrexate\n\n \n\n\n\n244 \n\nIn Psoriasis Study I, 28% of patients who were PASI 75 responders and were re-randomised to placebo at \nWeek 33 compared to 5% continuing on Humira, p < 0.001, experienced “loss of adequate response” \n(PASI score after Week 33 and on or before Week 52 that resulted in a <PASI 50 response relative to \nbaseline with a minimum of a 6-point increase in PASI score relative to Week 33). Of the patients who \nlost adequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into the open-label extension \ntrial, 38% (25/66) and 55% (36/66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and 24 weeks of re-treatment, \nrespectively. \n \nA total of 233 PASI 75 responders at Week 16 and Week 33 received continuous Humira therapy for \n52 weeks in Psoriasis Study I, and continued Humira in the open-label extension trial.  PASI 75 and PGA \nof clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7% and 59.0%, respectively, after an \nadditional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all patients who \ndropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, were considered \nnon-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 69.6% and \n55.7%, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). \n \nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label \nextension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a median \ntime to relapse (decline to PGA “moderate” or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of these patients \nexperienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of patients who entered the \nretreatment period had a response of PGA “clear” or “minimal” after 16 weeks of retreatment, irrespective \nof whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1%[123/178] and 88.8% [95/107] for patients who \nrelapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, respectively).  A similar safety profile was \nobserved during retreatment as before withdrawal. \n \nSignificant improvements at Week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (Studies I and II) and MTX \n(Study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In Study I, improvements in \nthe physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also significant compared to \nplacebo. \n \nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to 40 mg \nweekly due to a PASI response below 50%, 26.4% (92/349) and 37.8% (132/349) of patients achieved \nPASI 75 response at Week 12 and 24, respectively. \n \nPsoriasis Study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of Humira versus placebo in 72 patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients received an \ninitial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) \nor placebo for 16 weeks. At Week 16, a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients who \nreceived Humira achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands and/or feet compared to patients \nwho received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively [P = 0.014]). \n \nPsoriasis Study IV compared efficacy and safety of Humira versus placebo in 217 adult patients with \nmoderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg Humira followed by 40 mg \nevery other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label \nHumira treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included the Modified Nail \nPsoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician’s Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) \nand the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 11). Humira demonstrated a treatment benefit in \nnail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin involvement (BSA≥10% (60% of patients) and \nBSA<10% and ≥5% (40% of patients)).     \n \n\n\n\n245 \n\nTable 11 \nPs Study IV Efficacy Results at 16, 26 and 52 Weeks \n\nEndpoint Week 16 \nPlacebo-Controlled\n\nWeek 26 \nPlacebo-Controlled\n\nWeek 52 \nOpen-label\n\nPlacebo \nN=108 \n\nHumira \n40 mg eow \n\nN=109\n\nPlacebo\nN=108 \n\nHumira \n40 mg eow \n\nN=109\n\nHumira \n40 mg eow  \n\nN=80 \n≥ mNAPSI 75 (%) 2.9 26.0a 3.4 46.6a 65.0 \nPGA-F clear/minimal and \n≥2-grade improvement (%) \n\n2.9 29.7a 6.9 48.9a 61.3 \n\nPercent Change in Total \nFingernail NAPSI (%) \n\n-7.8 -44.2 a -11.5 -56.2a -72.2 \n\na p<0.001, Humira vs. placebo  \n \nHumira treated patients showed statistically significant improvements at Week 26 compared with placebo \nin the DLQI.  \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies \nand an open-label extension study in adult patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) \nwho were intolerant, had a contraindication or an inadequate response to at least a 3-month trial of \nsystemic antibiotic therapy.  The patients in HS-I and HS-II had Hurley Stage II or III disease with at least \n3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. \n \nStudy HS-I (PIONEER I) evaluated 307 patients with 2 treatment periods.  In Period A, patients received \nplacebo or Humira at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every week \nstarting at Week 4 to Week 11.  Concomitant antibiotic use was not allowed during the study.  After \n12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received Humira in Period A were re-randomised in Period B to 1 \nof 3 treatment groups (Humira 40 mg every week, Humira 40 mg every other week, or placebo from Week \n12 to Week 35).  Patients who had been randomised to placebo in Period A were assigned to receive \nHumira 40 mg every week in Period B. \n \nStudy HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods.  In Period A, patients received \nplacebo or Humira at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 and 40 mg every week \nstarting at Week 4 to Week 11.  19.3% of patients had continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the \nstudy.  After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received Humira in Period A were re-randomised in \nPeriod B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (Humira 40 mg every week, Humira 40 mg every other week, or \nplacebo from Week 12 to Week 35).  Patients who had been randomised to placebo in Period A were \nassigned to receive placebo in Period B. \n \nPatients participating in Studies HS-I and HS-II were eligible to enrol into an open-label extension study \nin which Humira 40mg was administered every week. Mean exposure in all adalimumab population was \n762 days.  Throughout all 3 studies patients used topical antiseptic wash daily. \n \nClinical Response \n \nReduction of inflammatory lesions and prevention of worsening of abscesses and draining fistulas was \nassessed using Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR; at least a 50% reduction in total \nabscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining \nfistula count relative to Baseline).  Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric \nRating Scale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 point \nscale.  \n\n\n\n246 \n\n \nAt Week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with Humira versus placebo achieved \nHiSCR.   At Week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients in Study HS-II experienced a clinically \nrelevant decrease in HS-related skin pain (see Table 12).  Patients treated with Humira had significantly \nreduced risk of disease flare during the initial 12 weeks of treatment. \n \n\nTable 12:  Efficacy Results at 12 Weeks, HS Studies I and II \n\n \n\n \n\nHS Study I HS Study II \n\nPlacebo\nHumira 40 mg \n\nWeekly Placebo  \nHumira 40 mg \n\nWeekly \n\nHidradenitis Suppurativa \nClinical Response (HiSCR)a   \n\nN = 154 \n40 (26.0%) \n\nN = 153 \n64 (41.8%) * \n\nN=163 \n45 (27.6%) \n\nN=163 \n96 (58.9%) *** \n\n≥30% Reduction in Skin \nPainb \n\nN = 109 \n27 (24.8%)\n\nN = 122 \n34 (27.9%)\n\nN=111 \n23 (20.7%) \n\nN=105 \n48 (45.7%) ***\n\n* P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, Humira versus placebo  \na Among all randomised patients. \nb Among patients with baseline HS-related skin pain assessment ≥ 3, based on Numeric Rating \n\nScale 0 – 10; 0 = no skin pain, 10 = skin pain as bad as you can imagine.\n \nTreatment with Humira 40 mg every week significantly reduced the risk of worsening of abscesses and \ndraining fistulas.  Approximately twice the proportion of patients in the placebo group in the first 12 \nweeks of Studies HS-I and HS-II, compared with those in the Humira group experienced worsening of \nabscesses (23.0% vs 11.4%, respectively) and draining fistulas (30.0% vs 13.9%, respectively). \n \nGreater improvements at Week 12 from baseline compared to placebo were demonstrated in skin-specific \nhealth-related quality of life, as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; Studies HS-I \nand HS-II), patient global satisfaction with medication treatment as measured by the Treatment \nSatisfaction Questionnaire - medication (TSQM; Studies HS-I and HS-II), and physical health as \nmeasured by the physical component summary score of the SF-36 (Study HS-I). \n \nIn patients with at least a partial response to Humira 40 mg weekly at Week 12, the HiSCR rate at Week \n36 was higher in patients who continued weekly Humira than in patients in whom dosing frequency was \nreduced to every other week, or in whom treatment was withdrawn (see Table 13). \n \n\nTable 13:  Proportion of Patientsa Achieving HiSCRb at Weeks 24 and 36 After \nTreatment Reassignment from Weekly Humira at Week 12 \n\n \n\nPlacebo \n(treatment \n\nwithdrawal) \nN = 73 \n\nHumira 40 mg \nevery other week \n\nN = 70 \n\nHumira 40 mg \nweekly \nN = 70 \n\nWeek 24 24 (32.9%) 36 (51.4%) 40 (57.1%) \n\nWeek 36 22 (30.1%) 28 (40.0%) 39 (55.7%) \na Patients with at least a partial response to Humira 40 mg weekly after 12 \n\nweeks of treatment. \nb Patients meeting protocol-specified criteria for loss of response or no \n\nimprovement were required to discontinue from the studies and were \ncounted as nonresponders.\n\n \n\n\n\n247 \n\nAmong patients who were at least partial responders at Week 12, and who received continuous weekly \nHumira therapy, the HiSCR rate at Week 48 was 68.3% and at Week 96 was 65.1%. Longer term \ntreatment with Humira 40 mg weekly for 96 weeks identified no new safety findings. \n \nAmong patients whose Humira treatment was withdrawn at Week 12 in Studies HS-I and HS-II, the \nHiSCR rate 12 weeks after re-introduction of Humira 40 mg weekly returned to levels similar to that \nobserved before withdrawal (56.0 %). \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in over 1500 patients with moderately to severely active \nCrohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI)  220 and  450) in randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80% of patients continued to receive at least one of these \nmedications.  \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD Study I \n(CLASSIC I) and CD Study II (GAIN). In CD Study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were \nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg Humira at Week 0 and \n80 mg at Week 2, 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. In \nCD Study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to \nreceive either 160 mg Humira at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. The primary \nnon-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM).  In CD Study III, 854 patients \nreceived open-label 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2.  At Week 4 patients were randomised to \n40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks. Patients in \nclinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at Week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those \nnot in clinical response at Week 4.  Corticosteroid taper was permitted after Week 8.  \n \nCD study I and CD study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 14. \n \n\nTable 14 \nInduction of Clinical Remission and Response \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n\n CD Study I: Infliximab Naive \nPatients \n\nCD Study II: Infliximab \nExperienced Patients \n\n Placebo \nN=74 \n\nHumira \n80/40 mg \n\nN = 75 \n\nHumira  \n160/80 mg \n\nN=76 \n\nPlacebo \nN=166 \n\nHumira  \n160/80 mg \n\nN=159 \n\nWeek 4      \n\nClinical remission 12% 24% 36%* 7% 21%* \n\nClinical response (CR-\n100) \n\n24% 37% 49%** 25% 38%** \n\nAll p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for Humira versus placebo \n* p < 0.001 \n** p < 0.01 \n\n \nSimilar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by Week 8 and \nadverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group. \n\n\n\n248 \n\n \nIn CD Study III, at Week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the \nprimary analysis. Of those in clinical response at Week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to other TNF-\nantagonists. Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 15.

These results suggest that some patients who \nhave not responded by Week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through Week 12.  Therapy \ncontinued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section 4.2).   \n \n117/276 patients from CD study I and 272/777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed through \nat least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy.  88 and 189 patients, respectively, continued to be in \nclinical remission.  Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and 233 patients, respectively. \n \nQuality of life \n \nIn CD Study I and CD Study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific inflammatory \nbowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at Week 4 in patients randomised to Humira \n80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at Weeks 26 and 56 in CD Study III as well \namong the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of multiple doses of Humira were assessed in adult patients with moderately to \nseverely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3) in randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies.  \n \n\n\n\n249 \n\nIn study UC-I, 390 TNF-antagonist naïve patients were randomised to receive either placebo at Weeks 0 \nand 2, 160 mg Humira at Week 0 followed by 80 mg at Week 2, or 80 mg Humira at Week 0 followed by \n40 mg at Week 2.  After Week 2, patients in both adalimumab arms received 40 mg eow.  Clinical \nremission (defined as Mayo score ≤ 2 with no subscore > 1) was assessed at Week 8.  \n \nIn study UC-II, 248 patients received 160 mg of Humira at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2 and 40 mg eow \nthereafter, and 246 patients received placebo. Clinical results were assessed for induction of remission at \nWeek 8 and for maintenance of remission at Week 52.  \n \nPatients induced with 160/80 mg Humira achieved clinical remission versus placebo at Week 8 in \nstatistically significantly greater percentages in study UC-I (18% vs. 9% respectively, p=0.031) and study \nUC-II (17% vs. 9% respectively, p=0.019). In study UC-II, among those treated with Humira who were in \nremission at Week 8, 21/41 (51%) were in remission at Week 52. \n \nResults from the overall UC-II study population are shown in Table 16. \n \n\nTable 16 \nResponse, Remission and Mucosal Healing in Study UC-II \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n Placebo\n\n \nHumira 40 mg  \n\neow \n\nWeek 52 N=246 N=248 \n  Clinical Response  18%   30%* \n\n  Clinical Remission 9%   17%* \n  Mucosal Healing  15%   25%* \n  Steroid-free remission for ≥ 90 days a  6%  \n\n(N=140) \n     13% * \n(N=150) \n\nWeek 8 and 52 \n  Sustained Response  12%   24%** \n  Sustained Remission  4%   8%* \n  Sustained Mucosal Healing  11%  19%* \nClinical remission is Mayo score  ≤ 2 with no subscore > 1; \nClinical response is decrease from baseline in Mayo score ≥ 3 points and ≥ 30% plus a \ndecrease in the rectal bleeding subscore [RBS] ≥ 1 or an absolute RBS of 0 or 1; \n*p < 0.05 for Humira vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions  \n**p < 0.001 for Humira vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions \na   Of those receiving corticosteroids at baseline \n \nOf those patients who had a response at Week 8, 47% were in response, 29% were in remission, 41% had \nmucosal healing, and 20% were in steroid-free remission for ≥ 90 days at Week 52. \n \nApproximately 40% of patients in study UC-II had failed prior anti-TNF treatment with infliximab. The \nefficacy of adalimumab in those patients was reduced compared to that in anti-TNF naïve patients.  \nAmong patients who had failed prior anti-TNF treatment, Week 52 remission was achieved by 3% on \nplacebo and 10% on adalimumab. \n \nPatients from studies UC-I and UC-II had the option to roll over into an open-label long-term extension \nstudy (UC III). Following 3 years of adalimumab therapy, 75% (301/402) continued to be in clinical \nremission per partial Mayo score.  \n\n\n\n250 \n\n \nHospitalisation rates \n \nDuring 52 weeks of studies UC-I and UC-II, lower rates of all-cause hospitalisations and UC-related \nhospitalisations were observed for the adalimumab-treated arm compared to the placebo arm. The number \nof all cause hospitalisations in the adalimumab treatment group was 0.18 per patient year vs. 0.26 per \npatient year in the placebo group and the corresponding figures for UC-related hospitalisations were 0.12 \nper patient year vs. 0.22 per patient year. \n \nQuality of life \n \nIn study UC-II, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease \nQuestionnaire (IBDQ) score.  \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious intermediate, \nposterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomised, double-\nmasked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or Humira at an initial dose of \n80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. Concomitant stable \ndoses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted.  \n \nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of prednisone \n60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid \ndiscontinuation by Week 15.  \n \nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment (oral \nprednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent a \nmandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19.  \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was ´time to treatment failure´. Treatment failure was \ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal \nvascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected visual \nacuity (BCVA).  \n \nPatients who completed Studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term \nextension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on \nstudy medication beyond Week 78 until they had access to Humira. \n \nClinical Response \n \nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in \npatients treated with Humira versus patients receiving placebo (See Table 17).

In Study UV II, statistically significant differences were \nobserved for visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of adalimumab. \n \nOf the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of Studies UV I and UV II, 60 \nsubjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to complications secondary to diabetic \nretinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary analysis of \nefficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of open-label \nadalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3%) were in quiescence (no active \ninflammatory lesions, AC cell grade ≤ 0.5+, VH grade ≤ 0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose ≤ 7.5 mg \nper day, and 178 (66.2%) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA was either improved or maintained (< 5 \nletters deterioration) in 88.6% of the eyes at week 78. Data beyond Week 78 were generally consistent \nwith these results but the number of enrolled subjects declined after this time. Overall, among the patients \nwho discontinued the study, 18% discontinued due to adverse events, and 8% due to insufficient response \nto adalimumab treatment. \n \nQuality of Life \n \nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, \nusing the NEI VFQ-25. Humira was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with statistically \nsignificant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and total score in \nStudy UV I, and for general vision and mental health in Study UV II. Vision related effects were not \nnumerically in favour of Humira for colour vision in Study UVI and for colour vision, peripheral vision \nand near vision in Study UV II. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nFormation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of \nadalimumab. There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and the \noccurrence of adverse events. \n \n\n\n\n253 \n\nPatients in rheumatoid arthritis studies I, II and III were tested at multiple time points for anti-adalimumab \nantibodies during the 6 to 12 month period. In the pivotal trials, anti-adalimumab antibodies were \nidentified in 5.5% (58/1053) of patients treated with adalimumab, compared to 0.5% (2/370) on placebo.  \nIn patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when \nadalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate.   \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7/269 subjects (2.6%) and \nin 19/487 subjects (3.9%) with ulcerative colitis. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 77/920 subjects (8.4%) \ntreated with adalimumab monotherapy. \n \nIn adult plaque psoriasis patients on long term adalimumab monotherapy who participated in a withdrawal \nand retreatment study, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment (11 of 482 subjects, 2.3%) \nwas similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal (11 of 590 subjects, 1.9%). \n \nIn patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified \nin 10/99 subjects (10.1%) treated with adalimumab. \n \nIn patients with moderately to severely active paediatric Crohn’s disease, the rate of anti-adalimumab \nantibody development in patients receiving adalimumab was 3.3%.  \n \nIn adult patients with non-infectious uveitis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 4.8% (12/249) \nof patients treated with adalimumab. \n \nIn patients with moderately to severely active paediatric ulcerative colitis, the rate of anti-adalimumab \nantibody development in patients receiving adalimumab was 3%. \n \nBecause immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody rates with those from \nother products is not appropriate. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThere are no clinical trials with Humira in adolescent patients with HS.  Efficacy of adalimumab for the \ntreatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and exposure-\nresponse relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, pathophysiology, and \ndrug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure levels. Safety of the \nrecommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on cross-indication safety \nprofile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more frequent doses (see section \n5.2). \n \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease  \n \nHumira was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the \nefficacy and safety of induction and maintenance treatment with doses dependent on body weight (< 40 kg \nor ≥ 40 kg) in 192 paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 (inclusive) years, with moderate to \nsevere Crohn´s disease (CD) defined as Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score > 30.  \nSubjects had to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator) \nfor CD. Subjects may also have previously lost response or been intolerant to infliximab.  \n \n\n\n\n254 \n\nAll subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their Baseline body weight: 160 mg \nat Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2 for subjects ≥ 40 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for subjects \n< 40 kg. \n \nAt Week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the Low Dose or \nStandard Dose maintenance regimens as shown in Table 18. \n \n\nTable 18 \nMaintenance regimen\n\nPatient \nWeight \n\nLow dose Standard \ndose \n\n< 40 kg 10 mg eow 20 mg eow\n≥ 40 kg 20 mg eow 40 mg eow\n\n \nEfficacy results \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was clinical remission at Week 26, defined as PCDAI score  10. \n \nClinical remission and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI score of at least 15 points from \nBaseline) rates are presented in Table 19.

After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0% (37/50) of the 50 patients remaining in the \nstudy continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0% (46/50) of patients continued to be in clinical \nresponse per PCDAI. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Humira was assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, trial in 93 \npaediatric patients from 5 to 17 years of age with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 \nwith endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 points, confirmed by centrally read endoscopy) who had an inadequate \nresponse or intolerance to conventional therapy. Approximately 16% of patients in the study had failed \nprior anti-TNF treatment. Patients who received corticosteroids at enrollment were allowed to taper their \ncorticosteroid therapy after Week 4. \n \nIn the induction period of the study, 77 patients were randomized 3:2 to receive double-blind treatment \nwith Humira at an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0 and Week 1, and 1.2 \nmg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2; or an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week \n0, placebo at Week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2. Both groups received 0.6 mg/kg \n(maximum of 40 mg) at Week 4 and Week 6. Following an amendment to the study design, the remaining \n16 patients who enrolled in the induction period received open-label treatment with Humira at the \ninduction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0 and Week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of \n80 mg) at Week 2.  \n \nAt Week 8, 62 patients who demonstrated clinical response per Partial Mayo Score (PMS; defined as a \ndecrease in PMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline) were randomized equally to receive double-blind \nmaintenance treatment with Humira at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every week (ew), or a \nmaintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every other week (eow). Prior to an amendment to \n\n\n\n256 \n\nthe study design, 12 additional patients who demonstrated clinical response per PMS were randomized to \nreceive placebo but were not included in the confirmatory analysis of efficacy. \n \nDisease flare was defined as an increase in PMS of at least 3 points (for patients with PMS of 0 to 2 at \nWeek 8), at least 2 points (for patients with PMS of 3 to 4 at Week 8), or at least 1 point (for patients with \nPMS of 5 to 6 at Week 8).  \n \nPatients who met criteria for disease flare at or after Week 12 were randomized to receive a re-induction \ndose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) or a dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) and continued to \nreceive their respective maintenance dose regimen afterwards.  \n \n\nEfficacy Results \n\n \n\nThe co-primary endpoints of the study were clinical remission per PMS (defined as PMS ≤ 2 and no \nindividual subscore > 1) at Week 8, and clinical remission per FMS (Full Mayo Score) (defined as a Mayo \nScore ≤ 2 and no individual subscore > 1) at Week 52 in patients who achieved clinical response per PMS \nat Week 8. \n \nClinical remission rates per PMS at Week 8 for patients in each of the

efficacy of Humira was assessed in a randomized, double-masked, controlled study of 90 \npaediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated noninfectious anterior uveitis \nwho were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment.  Patients received either placebo or \n20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if ≥ 30 kg) every other week in combination with \ntheir baseline dose of methotrexate.  \n\n\n\n259 \n\n \nThe primary endpoint was ‘time to treatment failure’. The criteria determining treatment failure were \nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with development \nof sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted use of \nconcomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. \n \nClinical Response \n \nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (See Figure 2, \nP < 0.0001 from log rank test).The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects treated \nwith placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects treated with \nadalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure.  Adalimumab \nsignificantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown by the hazard \nratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI:  0.12, 0.49]). \n \n\nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier Curves Summarizing Time to Treatment Failure in the Paediatric Uveitis \n\nStudy \n\n \n\nP\nR\n\nO\nB\n\nA\nB\n\nIL\nIT\n\nY\n O\n\nF\n F\n\nA\nIL\n\nIN\nG\n\n T\nR\n\nE\nA\n\nT\nM\n\nE\nN\n\nT\n \n\n TIME (WEEKS) \n Treatment Placebo  Adalimumab \n Note: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); H = HUMIRA (Number at Risk).\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n260 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab was \nslow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The average \nabsolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 to \n15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-life \nwas approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several rheumatoid \narthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 g/ml (without \nconcomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 g/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively.  The serum \nadalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following 20, 40 and \n80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 g/ml during \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. \n \nIn adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on \nWeek 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 μg/ml at Week 2 and \nWeek 4.  The mean steady-state trough concentration at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 8 \nto 10 μg/ml during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment.   \n \nAdalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). The recommended adolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week. Since exposure to \nadalimumab can be affected by body size, adolescents with higher body weight and inadequate response \nmay benefit from receiving the recommended adult dose of 40 mg every week. \n \nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 40 mg Humira \non Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 g/ml during the \ninduction period. A loading dose of 160 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 80 mg Humira on Week 2 \nachieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 g/ml during the induction period. \nMean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 g/ml were observed in Crohn’s disease patients who \nreceived a maintenance dose of 40 mg Humira every other week. \n \nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at Weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg.  At \nWeek 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose \n(20/10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (±SD) serum \nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at Week 4 were 15.7 ± 6.6 g/ml for patients ≥ 40 kg \n(160/80 mg) and 10.6 ± 6.1 g/ml for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg).  \n \nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (±SD) adalimumab trough concentrations \nat Week 52 were 9.5 ± 5.6 g/ml for the Standard Dose group and 3.5 ± 2.2 g/ml for the Low Dose \ngroup.  The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to receive adalimumab \ntreatment eow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from eow to weekly regimen, the mean \n\n\n\n261 \n\n(±SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at Week 52 were 15.3 ± 11.4 μg/ml (40/20 mg, weekly) and \n6.7 ± 3.5 μg/ml (20/10 mg, weekly). \n \nIn patients with ulcerative colitis, a loading dose of 160 mg Humira on Week 0 followed by 80 mg Humira \non Week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 g/ml during the \ninduction period.  Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 8 g/ml were observed in ulcerative \ncolitis patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg Humira every other week.  \n \nFollowing the subcutaneous administration of body weight-based dosing of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of \n40 mg) every other week to paediatric patients with ulcerative colitis, the mean trough steady-state serum \nadalimumab concentration was 5.01±3.28 µg/ml at Week 52. For patients who received 0.6 mg/kg \n(maximum of 40 mg) every week, the mean (±SD) trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentration \nwas 15.7±5.60 μg/ml at Week 52. \n \nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week starting at Week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \napproximately 8 to 10 g/ml. \n \nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. The \npredicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an initial \nincrease in systemic exposure. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation predicted \ncomparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other week when \ncompared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, patients with \nadolescent HS, and paediatric patients ≥ 40 kg with CD and UC). \n \nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response relationship \nwas established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent adalimumab \nplasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 response (EC50) was \n3 μg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 μg/ml).  \n \nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, \nrespectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab concentrations, \nboth with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 μg/ml (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and 1.9-10.5, \nrespectively).   \n \nElimination \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance.  The serum \nlevels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower in \npatients with measurable AAA. \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \nHumira has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n\n\n\n262 \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, repeated \ndose toxicity, and genotoxicity.   \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of harm \nto the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of fertility \nand postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models for an \nantibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralising antibodies in \nrodents.  \n \n \n6.

Injecting Humira \n \n \n1. What Humira is and what it is used for \n  \nHumira contains the active substance adalimumab. \n \nHumira is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below: \n\n Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n Enthesitis-related arthritis \n Paediatric plaque psoriasis \n Paediatric Crohn’s disease \n Paediatric uveitis \n\n \nThe active ingredient in Humira, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies \nare proteins that attach to a specific target. \n \nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved in the \nimmune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By \nattaching to TNFα, Humira decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints that usually first appears \nin childhood. \n \n\n\n\n330 \n\nHumira is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients from 2 years of age. Your child \nmay first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not \nwork well enough, your child will be given Humira to treat his/her polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis. \n \nYour doctor will decide if Humira should be used with methotrexate or alone. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints and the places where tendons join the \nbone. \n \nHumira is used to treat enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from 6 years of age. Your child may first be \ngiven other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not work well \nenough, your child will be given Humira to treat his/her enthesitis-related arthritis. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis  \n \nPlaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery \nscales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away \nfrom the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the body’s \nimmune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. \n \nHumira is used to treat severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for \nwhom topical therapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n \n\nPaediatric Crohn’s disease \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n \nHumira is used to treat moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. \n \nYour child may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, your child \nwill be given Humira to reduce the signs and symptoms of his/her disease. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. \n \nHumira is used to treat children with chronic non-infectious uveitis from 2 years of age with inflammation \naffecting the front of the eye  \n \nThis inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or \nwispy lines that move across the field of vision). Humira works by reducing this inflammation. \n \nYour child may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, your child \nwill be given Humira to reduce the signs and symptoms of his/her disease. \n \n \n\n\n\n331 \n\n2. What you need to know before your child uses Humira \n \nDo not use Humira: \n \n\n If your child is allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).  \n\n \n If your child has active tuberculosis or other severe infections (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n\nIt is important that you tell your doctor if your child has symptoms of infections, for example, \nfever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems. \n\n \n If your child has moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if your child \n\nhas had or has a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Humira. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \n\n If your child gets allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \nswelling or rash do not inject more Humira and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare \ncases, these reactions can be life threatening. \n\n \nInfections \n \n\n If your child has an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the body \n(for example, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Humira. If you are unsure, contact \nyour doctor.  \n\n \n Your child might get infections more easily while he/she is receiving Humira treatment. This risk \n\nmay increase if your child has problems with his/her lungs. These infections may be serious and \ninclude:  \n\n tuberculosis \n infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria \n severe infection in the blood (sepsis) \n\n \nIn rare cases, these infections can be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if your \nchild gets symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may tell \nyou to stop using Humira for some time. \n \n\n Tell your doctor if your child lives or travels in regions where fungal infections (for example, \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis) are very common. \n\n \n Tell your doctor if your child has had infections which keep coming back or other conditions that \n\nincrease the risk of infections. \n \n\n Your child and his/her doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while your child is \nbeing treated with Humira. It is important to tell your doctor if your child gets symptoms of \ninfections, such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \n\n\n\n332 \n\nTuberculosis \n \n\n As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Humira, your doctor will \ncheck your child for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Humira. This will include \na thorough medical evaluation including your child’s medical history and appropriate screening \ntests (for example, chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should \nbe recorded on your child’s Patient Reminder Card.  \n\n \n It is very important that you tell your doctor if your child has ever had tuberculosis, or if \n\nyour child has been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If your child \nhas active tuberculosis, do not use Humira. \n\n Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if your child has received treatment for the \nprevention of tuberculosis.  \n\n If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack \nof energy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your \ndoctor immediately. \n \n\nHepatitis B \n \n\n Tell your doctor if your child is a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if he/she has active HBV \nor if you think he/she might be at risk of getting HBV.  \n\n Your doctor should test your child for HBV. In people who carry HBV, Humira can cause \nthe virus to become active again. \n\n In some rare cases, especially if your child is taking other medicines that suppress the \nimmune system, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.   \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n\n If your child is about to have surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that your \nchild is taking Humira. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Humira.  \n\n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n\n If your child has or develops a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer \naround the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if he/she should receive or \ncontinue to receive Humira. Tell your doctor immediately if your child experiences symptoms like \nchanges in vision, weakness in arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of the body. \n\n \nVaccinations \n \n\n Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving Humira.  \n \n\n Check with your doctor before your child receives any vaccines.  \n It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled vaccinations for \n\ntheir age before they start treatment with Humira. \n If your child received Humira while she was pregnant, her baby may be at higher risk for \n\ngetting such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last Humira dose \nshe received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell her baby's doctors and other \nhealth care professionals about your child’s Humira use during her pregnancy so they can \ndecide when her baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \n\n\n\n333 \n\nHeart failure \n \n\n If your child has mild heart failure and is being treated with Humira, his/her heart failure status \nmust be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if your child has had \nor has a serious heart condition. If he/she develops new or worsening symptoms of heart failure \n(e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. \nYour doctor will decide if your child should receive Humira. \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\n In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or \nhelp your child to stop bleeding. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. If your child develops \na fever that does not go away, develops light bruises or bleeds very easily or looks very pale, call \nyour doctor right away. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\n There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking \nHumira or other TNF blockers.   \n\n \n People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time \n\nmay have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph \nsystem) and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow).  \n\n If your child takes Humira the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may \nincrease. On rare occasions, an uncommon and severe type of lymphoma, has been seen in \npatients taking Humira. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6-\nmercaptopurine.  \n\n Tell your doctor if your child is taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Humira.  \n Cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Humira.  \n If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, \n\ntell your doctor. \n \n\n There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker. \nIf your child has COPD, or is a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether \ntreatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for your child. \n\n \nAutoimmune disease \n \n\n On rare occasions, treatment with Humira could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n \n\nOther medicines and Humira \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nYour child should not take Humira with medicines containing the following active substances due to \nincreased risk of serious infection: \n\n anakinra \n abatacept. \n\n \n\n\n\n334 \n\nHumira can be taken together with: \n methotrexate \n certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (for example, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, \n\nleflunomide and injectable gold preparations) \n steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n\n \nIf you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\n Your child should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue \nits use for at least 5 months after the last Humira treatment. \n\n If your child is pregnant, thinks she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask her doctor \nfor advice about taking this medicine. \n\n Humira should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived Humira during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive Humira. \n\n Humira can be used during breast-feeding. \n If your child received Humira during her pregnancy, her baby may have a higher risk for getting \n\nan infection. \n It is important that you tell her baby’s doctor and other health care professionals about her Humira \n\nuse during her pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information on vaccines \nsee the “Warnings and precautions” section. \n \n\nDriving and using machines \n \nHumira may have a small effect on your child’s ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation and vision disturbances may occur after taking Humira. \n \n \n3. How to use Humira \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.

Never recap a needle. \n \n\n Do not recycle or throw the pre-filled syringe in the household waste \n Always keep the pre-filled syringe and the special disposal container out of the sight and \n\nreach of children \n \n\nThe needle cover, alcohol pad, cotton ball or gauze pad, blister and packaging may be put in your \nhousehold waste. \n\n  \n\n\n\n347 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nHumira 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection \nadalimumab \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before your child starts using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information. \n Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n Your doctor will also give you a Patient Reminder Card, which contains important safety \n\ninformation that you need to be aware of before your child is given Humira and during treatment \nwith Humira. Keep this Patient Reminder Card with you or your child. \n\n If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n This medicine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as your child's. \n If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet (see section 4). \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Humira is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before your child uses Humira \n3. How to use Humira \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Humira \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Humira is and what it is used for \nHumira contains the active substance adalimumab. \n \nHumira is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below: \n\n Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n Enthesitis-related arthritis \n Paediatric plaque psoriasis \n Adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n Paediatric Crohn’s disease \n Paediatric ulcerative colitis \n Paediatric uveitis \n\n \nThe active ingredient in Humira, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies \nare proteins that attach to a specific target. \n \nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved in the \nimmune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By \nattaching to TNFα, Humira decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases. \n \nHumira is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis. Your child \nmay first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not \n\n\n\n348 \n\nwork well enough, your child will be given Humira to treat his/her polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nPlaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery \nscales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away \nfrom the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the body’s \nimmune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. \n \nHumira is used to treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years in whom \ntopical therapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable.   \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory skin \ndisease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It most \ncommonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and \nbuttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nHumira is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adolescents from 12 years of age. Humira can reduce \nthe number of nodules and abscesses you have and the pain that is often associated with the disease. You \nmay first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Humira. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease  \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. Humira is indicated for the treatment of \nCrohn's disease in children aged 6 to 17 years. Your child may first be given other medicines. If these \nmedicines do not work well enough, your child will be given Humira to reduce the signs and symptoms of \nhis/her disease. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis  \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine. Humira is used to treat moderate to \nsevere ulcerative colitis in children aged 6 to 17 years. Your child may first be given other medicines. If \nthese medicines do not work well enough, your child will be given Humira to reduce the signs and \nsymptoms of his/her disease. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. \n \nHumira is used to treat children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation \naffecting the front of the eye. This inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of \nfloaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). Humira works by \nreducing this inflammation. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before your child uses Humira \n \nDo not use Humira  \n \n\n\n\n349 \n\n If your child is allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).  \n\n \n If your child has a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see “Warnings and \n\nprecautions”). It is important that you tell your doctor if your child has symptoms of infections, \ne.g. fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems. \n \n\n If your child has moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if your child \nhas had or has a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist before using Humira \n \n\n If your child experiences allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, \ndizziness, swelling or rash do not inject more Humira and contact your doctor immediately since, \nin rare cases, these reactions can be life threatening. \n \n\n If your child has an infection, including long-term or localized infection (for example, leg ulcer) \nconsult your doctor before starting Humira. If you are unsure, contact your doctor.  \n \n\n Your child might get infections more easily while receiving Humira treatment. This risk may \nincrease if his/her lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other opportunistic \ninfections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor \nif your child gets symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor \nmay recommend temporary discontinuation of Humira. \n \n\n As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Humira, your doctor will \ncheck your child for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Humira. This will include \na thorough medical evaluation including your child’s medical history and appropriate screening \ntests (for example chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should \nbe recorded on your child's Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor \nif your child has ever had tuberculosis, or if he/she has been in close contact with someone who \nhas had tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if your child has received \npreventative treatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight \nloss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n \n Advise your doctor if your child resides or travels in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic. \n \n\n Advise your doctor if your child has a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that \nincrease the risk of infections. \n\n \n Advise your doctor if your child is a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if he/she has active \n\nHBV or if you think he/she might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your child’s doctor should test \nyour child for HBV. Humira can cause reactivation of HBV in people who carry this virus. In \nsome rare cases, especially if your child is taking other medicines that suppress the immune \nsystem, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.  \n \n\n\n\n350 \n\n It is important to tell your doctor if your child gets symptoms of infections, such as fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired or dental problems. \n \n\n If your child is about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that \nhe/she is taking Humira. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation. \n \n\n If your child has or develops a demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will \ndecide if he/she should receive or continue to receive Humira. Tell your doctor immediately if \nyour child experiences symptoms like changes in vision, weakness in arms or legs or numbness or \ntingling in any part of the body. \n\n \n Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving Humira.  Please \n\ncheck with your doctor before your child receives any vaccines. It is recommended that children, \nif possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation \nguidelines prior to initiating Humira therapy. If you received Humira while you were pregnant, \nyour baby may be at higher risk for getting such an infection for up to approximately five months \nafter the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors \nand other health care professionals about your Humira use during your pregnancy so they can \ndecide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n \n\n If your child has mild heart failure and is being treated with Humira, his/her heart failure status \nmust be closely monitored by your doctor.  It is important to tell your doctor if your child has had \nor has a serious heart condition.  If he/she develops new or worsening symptoms of heart failure \n(e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of his/her feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. \nYour doctor will decide if your child should receive Humira.   \n \n\n In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your child's \nbody fight infections or help him/her to stop bleeding.  If your child develops a fever that does not \ngo away, bruises or bleeds very easily or looks very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor \nmay decide to stop treatment. \n\n \n There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking \n\nHumira or other TNF blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the \ndisease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that \naffects the lymph system) and leukemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow). If your \nchild takes Humira the risk of getting lymphoma, leukemia, or other cancers may increase. On \nrare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma, has been observed in patients taking \nHumira. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine. Tell \nyour doctor if your child is taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Humira. In addition \ncases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Humira. If new skin \nlesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n \n There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \n\ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker. \nIf your child has COPD, or is a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether \ntreatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for your child. \n \n\n On rare occasions, treatment with Humira could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n\n \nOther medicines and Humira \n \n\n\n\n351 \n\nTell your child’s doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nHumira can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or pain \nmedications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \nYour child should not take Humira with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept \ndue to increased risk of serious infection. If you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\n Your child should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue \nits use for at least 5 months after the last Humira treatment. \n\n If your child is pregnant, thinks she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask her doctor \nfor advice about taking this medicine. \n\n Humira should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived Humira during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive Humira. \n\n Humira can be used during breast-feeding. \n If your child receives Humira during her pregnancy, her baby may have a higher risk for getting \n\nan infection. \n It is important that you tell her baby’s doctor and other health care professionals about her Humira \n\nuse during her pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information on vaccines, \nsee the “Warnings and precautions” section. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nHumira may have a minor influence on the ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation and vision disturbances may occur after taking Humira. \n \nHumira contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Humira \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your child’s doctor or pharmacist has instructed. Check with your \nchild’s doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure about any of the instructions or if you have any questions. \nYour doctor may prescribe another strength of Humira if your child needs a different dose. \n \nChildren and adolescents with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nChildren and adolescents from 2 years of age weighing 10 kg to less than 30 kg \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira is 20 mg every other week. \n \nChildren and adolescents from 2 years of age weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira is 40 mg every other week. \n\n\n\n352 \n\n \nChildren, adolescents and adults with enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nChildren and adolescents from 6 years of age weighing 15 kg to less than 30 kg \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira is 20 mg every other week. \n \nChildren, adolescents and adults from 6 years of age weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira is 40 mg every other week. \n \nChildren and adolescents with psoriasis \n \nChildren and adolescents from 4 to 17 years of age weighing 15 kg to less than 30 kg \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira is an initial dose of 20 mg, followed by 20 mg one week later. \nThereafter, the usual dose is 20 mg every other week. \n \nChildren and adolescents from 4 to 17 years of age weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira is an initial dose of 40 mg, followed by 40 mg one week later. \nThereafter, the usual dose is 40 mg every other week. \n \nAdolescents with hidradenitis suppurativa from 12 to 17 years of age, weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira is an initial dose of 80 mg (as two 40 mg injections in one day), \nfollowed by 40 mg every other week starting one week later.

If you don’t know the amount, \n\nSTOP HERE and contact your doctor for further instruction. \n\n\n\n354 \n\n \n You will need a special container for waste, such as a sharps container or as instructed by your \n\nnurse, doctor or pharmacist. Place the container on your work surface. \n \n Wash your hands thoroughly \n\n \n Remove one box containing, one syringe, one vial adapter, one vial, two alcohol pads and one \n\nneedle from the carton. If there is a second box in the carton for a future injection, place it back in \nthe refrigerator immediately. \n \n\n Look at the expiry date on the box to be used. DO NOT use any item after the date shown on the \nbox. \n  \n\n Set up the following items on a clean surface, DO NOT take them out of their individual packaging \nyet. \n\n \no One 1 ml syringe (1)  \no One vial adapter (2)  \no One vial for paediatric use of Humira for injection (3) \no Two alcohol pads (4) \no One needle (5) \n\n   \n\n \n \n\n Humira is a liquid that is clear and colourless. DO NOT use if the liquid is cloudy, discoloured or \nhas flakes or particles in it. \n\n \n2)  Preparing the Humira dose for injection  \n \n General handling: DO NOT dispose of any waste items until after the injection is completed. \n \n Prepare the needle by partially peeling the package open from the end closest to the yellow syringe \n\nconnector. Peel the package just far enough to expose the yellow syringe connector.  \nSet the package down with the clear side of the package facing up. \n\n \n\n\n\n355 \n\n \n \n\n \n Pop off the white plastic cap from the vial to see the top of the vial stopper. \n \n\n \n \n Use one of the alcohol pads to wipe the vial stopper. DO NOT touch the vial stopper after wiping \n\nwith the alcohol pad. \n \n Peel the cover off the vial adapter package but do not take out the vial adapter.    \n \n\n \n \n Hold the vial with the vial stopper facing up. \n \n With the vial adapter still in the clear package, attach it to the vial stopper by pushing down until the \n\nvial adapter snaps in place.   \n \n When you are sure the adapter is attached to the vial, lift off the package from the vial adapter.  \n \n\n\n\n356 \n\n Gently set the vial with vial adapter down on your clean work surface. Be careful that it does not fall \nover. DO NOT touch the vial adapter.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n Prepare the syringe by partially peeling the package open from the end closest to white plunger rod. \n \n\n Peel the clear package just far enough to expose the white plunger rod, but do not take the syringe \nout of the package.   \n\n \n Hold the syringe package and SLOWLY pull the white plunger rod out to 0.1 ml beyond the \n\nprescribed dose (For example, if the prescribed dose is 0.5 ml, pull the white plunger rod to 0.6 ml). \nNEVER pull past the 0.9 ml position regardless of prescribed dose. \n\n \n You will set the volume to the prescribed dose in a later step. \n \n DO NOT pull the white plunger rod completely out of the syringe. \n \nNOTE:  \n \nIf the white plunger rod is pulled completely out of the syringe, discard the syringe and contact your \nHumira provider for a replacement. DO NOT try to reinsert the white plunger rod. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDose + 0.1 ml \n\n \n DO NOT use the white plunger rod to remove the syringe from the package. Hold the syringe on \n\nthe graduated area and pull the syringe from its package. DO NOT set the syringe down at any \ntime. \n\n \n While holding the vial adapter firmly, insert the syringe tip into the vial adapter and twist the \n\nsyringe clockwise with one hand until firm. DO NOT over-tighten.  \n\n\n\n357 \n\n \n\n \n \n While holding the vial, push the white plunger rod all the way down. This step is important to get \n\nthe proper dose. Hold the white plunger rod in and turn the vial and syringe upside down. \n \n\n \n \n\n SLOWLY pull the white plunger rod out to 0.1 ml beyond the prescribed dose. This is important to \nget the proper dose. You will set the volume to the prescribed dose in step 4, Dose Preparation. If \nthe prescribed dose is 0.5 ml, pull the white plunger rod out to 0.6 ml. You will see the liquid \nmedication from the vial go into the syringe. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n Push the white plunger rod all the way back in to push the liquid medication back into the vial. \nAgain, SLOWLY pull the white plunger rod out to 0.1 ml beyond the prescribed dose, this is \nimportant to get the proper dose and important in order to prevent air bubbles or air gaps in the \nliquid medication. You will set the volume to the prescribed dose in step 4, Dose Preparation. \n\n \n\n\n\n358 \n\n \n \n If you see remaining air bubbles or air gaps in the liquid medication in the syringe, you may repeat \n\nthis process up to 3 times. DO NOT shake the syringe. \n \n\n \nNOTE:  \n \nIf the white plunger rod is pulled completely out of the syringe, discard the syringe and contact your \nHumira provider for a replacement. DO NOT try to reinsert the white plunger rod. \n \n While still holding the syringe upright at the graduated area, remove the vial adapter with the vial by \n\ntwisting the vial adapter off with the other hand. Be sure to remove the vial adapter with the vial \nfrom the syringe. DO NOT touch the tip of the syringe. \n\n \n\n \n \n If a large air bubble or air gap can be seen near the syringe tip, SLOWLY push the white plunger \n\nrod into the syringe until fluid begins to enter the syringe tip. DO NOT push the white plunger rod \npast the dose position. \n\n \n For example, if the prescribed dose is 0.5 ml, DO NOT push the white plunger rod past the 0.5 ml \n\nposition. \n \n Check to see that the fluid remaining in the syringe is at least the prescribed dose volume. If the \n\nremaining volume is less than the prescribed dose volume, DO NOT use the syringe and contact \nyour healthcare provider. \n\n \n With your free hand, pick up the needle package with the yellow syringe connector facing down. \n \n Keeping the syringe up, insert the syringe tip into the yellow syringe connector and twist the syringe \n\nas indicated by the arrow in the picture until firm. The needle is now attached to the syringe. \n\n\n\n359 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n Pull the needle package off, but DO NOT remove the clear needle cap. \n \n Place the syringe on your clean work surface. Continue with injection site and dose preparation \n\nimmediately. \n \n\n3)  Choosing and preparing an injection site \n \n Choose a site on your thigh or stomach. DO NOT use the same site that was used for the last \n\ninjection. \n The new injection site should be given at least 3 cm from the last injection site. \n \n\n \n \n\n DO NOT inject in an area where the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard. This may mean there is an \ninfection and therefore you should contact your doctor. \n\n To reduce the chance of infection, wipe the injection site with the other alcohol pad. DO NOT touch \nthe area again before injecting. \n \n\n4)  Dose Preparation  \n\n \n Pick up the syringe with the needle pointing up. \n Use your other hand to flip the pink needle cover down toward the syringe. \n\n\n\n360 \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n Remove the clear needle cap by pulling it straight up with your other hand. \n \n\n \n \n\n The needle is clean. \n DO NOT touch the needle. \n DO NOT set the syringe down at any time after the clear needle cap is off. \n DO NOT try to put the clear needle cap back on the needle. \n \n Hold the syringe at eye-level with the needle pointing up to see the amount clearly. Be careful not \n\nto squirt the liquid medication into your eye. \n Recheck the prescribed medication amount. \n Push the white plunger rod gently into the syringe until the syringe contains the prescribed amount \n\nof liquid. Excess liquid may come out of the needle while the white plunger rod is being pushed. DO \nNOT wipe off the needle or the syringe. \n\n \n5)  Injecting Humira \n \n With the free hand, gently grasp the cleaned area of skin and hold firmly.  \n With the other hand, hold syringe at 45-degree angle to skin.  \n With one quick, short motion, push needle all the way into skin. \n Let go of the skin in your hand. \n Push the white plunger rod to inject the liquid medication until the syringe is empty. \n When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from skin, being careful to pull it out at the same \n\nangle as when it was inserted. \n\n\n\n361 \n\n \n \n Gently flip the pink needle cover up, over the needle and snap into place and set the syringe with \n\nneedle on the work surface. DO NOT put the clear needle cap back on the needle. \n \n\n \n \n Using a piece of gauze, apply pressure over the injection site for 10 seconds. A little bleeding may \n\noccur. DO NOT rub the injection site. Use a plaster if you want to.  \n \n6)  Throwing away supplies \n\n \n You will need a special container for waste, such as a sharps container or as instructed by your nurse, \n\ndoctor or pharmacist. \n Put the syringe with needle, vial and vial adapter into a special sharps container. DO NOT put these \n\nitems into regular household waste. \n The syringe, needle, vial and vial adapter MUST NEVER be reused. \n Keep the special container out of the sight and reach of children at all times. \n Throw away all other used items into your regular household waste. \n \nIf you use more Humira than you should \n \nIf you accidentally inject a larger amount of Humira liquid, or if you inject Humira more frequently than \ntold to by your doctor, call your doctor and tell him/her that your child has taken more. Always take the \nouter carton or the vial of the medicine with you, even if it is empty.  \n \nIf you use less Humira than you should \n \nIf you accidentally inject a smaller amount of Humira liquid, or if you inject Humira less frequently than \ntold to by your child’s doctor or pharmacist, you should call your child’s doctor or pharmacist and tell \nhim/her that your child has taken less. Always take the outer carton or the vial of the medicine with you, \neven if it is empty. \n\n\n\n362 \n\n \nIf you forget to use Humira \n \nIf you forget to give your child a Humira injection, you should inject the Humira dose as soon as you \nremember. Then administer your child's next dose as you would have on the originally scheduled day, had \nyou not forgotten a dose.  \n \nIf your child stops using Humira \n \nThe decision to stop using Humira should be discussed with your child’s doctor. Your child’s symptoms \nmay return upon discontinuation. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

What Humira is and what it is used for \n \nHumira contains the active substance adalimumab.  \n \nHumira is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below: \n Rheumatoid arthritis,  \n Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,  \n Enthesitis-related arthritis,  \n Ankylosing spondylitis,  \n Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis,  \n Psoriatic arthritis,  \n Psoriasis, \n Hidradenitis suppurativa,  \n Crohn’s disease,  \n Ulcerative colitis and  \n Non-infectious uveitis \n \nThe active ingredient in Humira, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies \nare proteins that attach to a specific target. \n \nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved in the \nimmune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By \nattaching to TNFα, Humira decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases. \n \n\n\n\n370 \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n \nHumira is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid \narthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not \nrespond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Humira to treat your rheumatoid arthritis.   \n \nHumira can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n \nHumira has been shown to slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the \ndisease and to improve physical function. \n \nUsually, Humira is used with methotrexate. If your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, \nHumira can be given alone. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases. \n \nHumira is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 \nyears and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. You may first be given \nother disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these \nmedicines, you will be given Humira to treat your polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-\nrelated arthritis. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine. \n \nHumira is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of \nankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not \nrespond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Humira to reduce the signs and symptoms of \nyour disease. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis. \n \nHumira is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Humira has been shown to slow down the damage to \nthe cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function. \n \nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children  \n \nPlaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery \nscales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away \nfrom the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the body’s \nimmune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. \n \n\n\n\n371 \n\nHumira is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Humira is also used to treat severe \nplaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom topical therapy and \nphototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory skin \ndisease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It most \ncommonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and \nbuttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nHumira is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. Humira \ncan reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have and the pain that is often associated with the \ndisease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, \nyou will be given Humira. \n \nCrohn’s disease in adults and children \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n \nHumira is used to treat Crohn’s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have Crohn’s \ndisease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you \nwill be given Humira to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn’s disease. \n \nUlcerative colitis in adults and children \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine. \n \nHumira is used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If \nyou have ulcerative colitis you may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to \nthese medicines, you will be given Humira to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n Adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye \n Children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the \n\nfront of the eye  \n \nThis inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or \nwispy lines that move across the field of vision). Humira works by reducing this inflammation. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humira \n \nDo not use Humira \n \n\n If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6).  \n\n \n\n\n\n372 \n\n If you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see Warnings and precautions”). It is \nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, feeling \ntired, dental problems. \n\n \n If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \n\nhave a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Humira \n \n\n If you experience allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \nswelling or rash do not inject more Humira and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare \ncases, these reactions can be life threatening.  \n \n\n If you have an infection, including long-term or localized infection (for example, leg ulcer) \nconsult your doctor before starting Humira. If you are unsure, contact your doctor.  \n \n\n You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Humira treatment. This risk may \nincrease if your lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other opportunistic \ninfections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor \nif you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may \nrecommend temporary discontinuation of Humira. \n\n \n As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Humira, your doctor will \n\ncheck you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Humira. This will include a \nthorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate screening tests (for \nexample chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be \nrecorded on your Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you \nhave ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had \ntuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventative \ntreatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, \nmild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately.  \n \n\n Advise your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic. \n\n \n Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase \n\nthe risk of infections. \n \n\n Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV or \nif you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you for HBV. \nHumira can cause reactivation of HBV in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, \nespecially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of \nHBV can be life-threatening.  \n\n \n If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Humira. You and \n\nyour doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with \nHumira. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \n\n\n\n373 \n\n If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures, please inform your doctor that you are \ntaking Humira. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Humira. \n\n \n If you have or develop demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide if \n\nyou should receive or continue to receive Humira. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience \nsymptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in \nany part of your body. \n\n \n Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving Humira. Please \n\ncheck with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, if \npossible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation \nguidelines prior to initiating Humira therapy. If you received Humira while you were pregnant, \nyour baby may be at higher risk for getting such an infection for up to approximately five months \nafter the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors \nand other health care professionals about your Humira use during your pregnancy so they can \ndecide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \n If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Humira, your heart failure status \n\nmust be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. \nshortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your \ndoctor will decide if you should receive Humira. \n\n \n In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body fight \n\ninfections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, bruise or \nbleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment. \n\n \n There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking \n\nHumira or other TNF blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the \ndisease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that \naffects the lymph system) and leukemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow). If you \ntake Humira the risk of getting lymphoma, leukemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare \noccasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking Humira. \nSome of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor \nif you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Humira. In addition, cases of non-\nmelanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Humira. If new skin lesions appear \nduring or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n \n There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \n\ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker. \nIf you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment \nwith a TNF blocker is appropriate for you.  \n \n\n On rare occasions, treatment with Humira could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \n\n Vaccinations: if possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Humira. \n Do not give Humira to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of 2 \n\nyears. \n \n\n\n\n374 \n\nOther medicines and Humira \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nHumira can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or pain \nmedications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \nYou should not take Humira with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept due to \nincreased risk of serious infection. If you have questions, please ask your doctor.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\n You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use \nfor at least 5 months after the last Humira treatment. \n\n If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice about taking this medicine. \n\n Humira should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived Humira during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive Humira. \n\n Humira can be used during breast-feeding \n If you receive Humira during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection. \n It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nHumira use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information on \nvaccines see the “Warnings and precautions” section). \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nHumira may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation and vision disturbances may occur after taking Humira. \n \nHumira contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Humira \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor may prescribe another strength of Humira if you need a \ndifferent dose. \n \nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis \n \nHumira is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use).

What you need to know before you use Humira \n3. How to use Humira \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store Humira \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Humira is and what it is used for \n \nHumira contains the active substance adalimumab.  \n \nHumira is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below: \n Rheumatoid arthritis,  \n Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,  \n Enthesitis-related arthritis,  \n Ankylosing spondylitis,  \n Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis,  \n Psoriatic arthritis,  \n Psoriasis, \n Hidradenitis suppurativa,  \n Crohn’s disease,  \n Ulcerative colitis and  \n Non-infectious uveitis \n \nThe active ingredient in Humira, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies \nare proteins that attach to a specific target. \n \nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved in the \nimmune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By \nattaching to TNFα, Humira decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases. \n \n\n\n\n389 \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n \nHumira is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid \narthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not \nrespond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Humira to treat your rheumatoid arthritis.   \n \nHumira can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n \nHumira has been shown to slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the \ndisease and to improve physical function.  \nUsually, Humira is used with methotrexate. If your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, \nHumira can be given alone.  \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases. \n \nHumira is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 \nyears and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. You may first be given \nother disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these \nmedicines, you will be given Humira to treat your polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-\nrelated arthritis. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine. \n \nHumira is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of \nankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other medicines. If you do not \nrespond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Humira to reduce the signs and symptoms of \nyour disease. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis. \n \nHumira is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Humira has been shown to slow down the damage to \nthe cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function. \n \nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children  \n \nPlaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery \nscales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away \nfrom the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the body’s \nimmune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. \n \n\n\n\n390 \n\nHumira is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Humira is also used to treat severe \nplaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom topical therapy and \nphototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory skin \ndisease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It most \ncommonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and \nbuttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nHumira is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age.  Humira \ncan reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have and the pain that is often associated with the \ndisease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, \nyou will be given Humira. \n \nCrohn’s disease in adults and children \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n \nHumira is used to treat Crohn’s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have Crohn’s \ndisease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you \nwill be given Humira to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn’s disease. \n \nUlcerative colitis in adults and children \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine. \n \nHumira is used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If \nyou have ulcerative colitis you may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to \nthese medicines, you will be given Humira to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n Adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye  \n Children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the \n\nfront of the eye \n \nThis inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or \nwispy lines that move across the field of vision). Humira works by reducing this inflammation. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humira \n \nDo not use Humira \n \n\n If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6).  \n\n \n\n\n\n391 \n\n If you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see “Warnings and precautions”). It \nis important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired, dental problems. \n\n \n If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \n\nhave a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Humira \n \n\n If you experience allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \nswelling or rash do not inject more Humira and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare \ncases, these reactions can be life threatening. \n \n\n If you have an infection, including long-term or localized infection (for example, leg ulcer) \nconsult your doctor before starting Humira. If you are unsure, contact your doctor.  \n \n\n You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Humira treatment. This risk may \nincrease if your lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other opportunistic \ninfections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor \nif you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may \nrecommend temporary discontinuation of Humira. \n\n \n As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Humira, your doctor will \n\ncheck you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Humira. This will include a \nthorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate screening tests (for \nexample chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be \nrecorded on your Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you \nhave ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had \ntuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventative \ntreatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, \nmild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n Advise your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic. \n \n\n Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase \nthe risk of infections. \n \n\n Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV or \nif you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you for HBV. \nHumira can cause reactivation of HBV in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, \nespecially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of \nHBV can be life-threatening.   \n\n \n If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Humira. You and \n\nyour doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with \nHumira. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n \n\n\n\n392 \n\n If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures, please inform your doctor that you are \ntaking Humira. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Humira.  \n \n\n If you have or develop demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide if \nyou should receive or continue to receive Humira. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience \nsymptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in \nany part of your body. \n \n\n Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving Humira. Please \ncheck with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, if \npossible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation \nguidelines prior to initiating Humira therapy. If you received Humira while you were pregnant, \nyour baby may be at higher risk for getting such an infection for up to approximately five months \nafter the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors \nand other health care professionals about your Humira use during your pregnancy so they can \ndecide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n \n\n If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Humira, your heart failure status \nmust be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. \nshortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your \ndoctor will decide if you should receive Humira. \n \n\n In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body fight \ninfections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, bruise or \nbleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment. \n \n\n There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking \nHumira or other TNF blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the \ndisease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that \naffects the lymph system) and leukemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow). If you \ntake Humira the risk of getting lymphoma, leukemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare \noccasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking Humira. \nSome of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor \nif you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Humira. In addition, cases of non-\nmelanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Humira. If new skin lesions appear \nduring or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, tell your doctor. \n \n\n There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker. \nIf you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment \nwith a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. \n \n\n On rare occasions, treatment with Humira could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \n\n Vaccinations: if possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Humira. \n Do not give Humira to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of 2 \n\nyears. \n\n\n\n393 \n\n \nOther medicines and Humira \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nHumira can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or pain \nmedications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \nYou should not take Humira with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept due to \nincreased risk of serious infection. If you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\n You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use \nfor at least 5 months after the last Humira treatment. \n\n If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice about taking this medicine. \n\n Humira should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived Humira during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive Humira. \n\n Humira can be used during breast-feeding. \n If you receive Humira during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection. \n It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nHumira use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine.  For more information \non vaccines see the “Warnings and precautions” section). \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nHumira may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation and vision disturbances may occur after taking Humira. \n \nHumira contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Humira \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor may prescribe another strength of Humira if you need a \ndifferent dose. \n \nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis \n \nHumira is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use). The usual dose for adults with rheumatoid arthritis, \nankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis \nand for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab given every other week as a single dose.   \n \n\n\n\n394 \n\nIn rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is continued while using Humira. If your doctor determines that \nmethotrexate is inappropriate, Humira can be given alone.  \n \nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis and you do not receive methotrexate with your Humira therapy, your \ndoctor may decide to give 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg every other week. \n \nChildren, adolescents and adults with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nChildren and adolescents from 2 years of age weighing 10 kg to less than 30 kg \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira is 20 mg every other week. \n \nChildren, adolescents and adults from 2 years of age weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira is 40 mg every other week. \n \nChildren, adolescents and adults with enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nChildren and adolescents from 6 years of age weighing 15 kg to less than 30 kg \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira is 20 mg every other week. \n \nChildren, adolescents and adults from 6years of age weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe recommended dose of Humira is 40 mg every other week. \n \nAdults with psoriasis \n \nThe usual dose for adults with psoriasis is an initial dose of 80 mg (as two 40 mg injections in one day), \nfollowed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose.

Depending on your response, your doctor may \nincrease the dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. \n \nAdults with ulcerative colitis \n \nThe usual Humira dose for adults with ulcerative colitis is 160 mg (as four 40 mg injections in one day or \ntwo 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days) at Week 0 and 80 mg (as two 40 mg injections in \none day) at Week 2 and thereafter 40 mg every other week. Depending on your response, your doctor may \nincrease the dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week.     \n \nChildren and adolescents with ulcerative colitis \n \nChildren and adolescents from 6 years of age weighing less than 40 kg \n \nThe usual Humira dose is 80 mg (as two 40 mg injections in one day) initially followed by 40 mg (as one \n40 mg injection) two weeks later. Thereafter, the usual dose is 40 mg every other week.  \n \n\n\n\n396 \n\nPatients who turn 18 years of age while on 40 mg every other week, should continue their prescribed dose. \n \nChildren and adolescents from 6 years of age weighing 40 kg or more \n \nThe usual Humira dose is 160 mg (as four 40 mg injections in one day or two 40 mg injections per day for \ntwo consecutive days) initially, followed by 80 mg (as two 40 mg injections in one day) two weeks later. \nThereafter the usual dose is 80 mg every other week.  \n \nPatients who turn 18 years of age while on 80 mg every other week, should continue their prescribed dose. \n \nAdults with non-infectious uveitis \n \nThe usual dose for adults with non-infectious uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg (as two injections in one \nday), followed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. You should \ncontinue to inject Humira for as long as your doctor has told you. \n \nIn non-infectious uveitis, corticosteroids or other medicines that influence the immune system may be \ncontinued while using Humira. Humira can also be given alone. \n \nChildren and adolescents with chronic non-infectious uveitis from 2 years of age \n \nChildren and adolescents from 2 years of age weighing less than 30 kg \n \nThe usual dose of Humira is 20 mg every other week with methotrexate. \n \nYour doctor may also prescribe an initial dose of 40 mg which may be administered one week prior to the \nstart of the usual dose. \n \nChildren and adolescents from 2 years of age weighing 30 kg or more \n \nThe usual dose of Humira is 40 mg every other week with methotrexate. \n \nYour doctor may also prescribe an initial dose of 80 mg which may be administered one week prior to the \nstart of the usual dose. \n \nMethod and route of administration \n \nHumira is administered by injection under the skin (by subcutaneous injection). \n \nInjecting Humira yourself \n \nThe following instructions explain how to give yourself an injection of Humira using the pre-filled pen. \nPlease read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. You will be instructed by your doctor \nor his/her assistant on the technique of self-injection. Do not attempt to self-inject until you are sure that \nyou understand how to prepare and give the injection. After proper training, the injection can be self-\nadministered or given by another person, for example a family member or friend. \n \nWhat should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Humira? \n \n\n\n\n397 \n\n1. Wash your hands thoroughly.  \n2.  Take one dose tray containing a pre-filled pen of Humira from the refrigerator.  \n3.  Do not shake or drop the pre-filled pen. \n4.  Set up the following items on a clean surface. \n \n\nOne pre-filled pen of Humira  \nOne alcohol pad \n \n\n \n \nPad \n \n \nWindow \n\n \n5.  Check the expiry date on the pre-filled pen label (EXP:) Do not use the product if the date has \n\npassed the month and year shown. \n \n6.  Hold the pre-filled pen with the grey cap (labelled ‘1’) pointing up. Check the appearance of the \n\nHumira solution through the window on the sides of the pre-filled pen. It must be clear and \ncolourless. If it is cloudy or discoloured or has flakes or particles in it, you must not use it. Do not \nuse a pre-filled pen that is frozen or if it has been left in direct sunlight. Only remove both the grey \ncap and the plum cap immediately before injection \n\n \n \n \n \nWindow \n \nClear Liquid in Syringe \n\n \nWhere should I give my injection?   \n \n1.  Choose a site on the top of your thigh or stomach (except the area around the navel). \n\n\n\n398 \n\n \n\n \n \n2.  Change the place that you inject each time so that you do not become sore in one area. Each new \n\ninjection should be given at least 3 cm from the last injection site.  \n \n3.  Do not inject in an area where the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard. This may mean there is an \n\ninfection.   \n \n\nHow do I give my injection? \n \n1.  Wipe your skin by using the enclosed alcohol pad, using a circular motion. Do not touch the area \n\nagain before injecting.     \n \n2. Only remove both the grey cap and the plum cap immediately before injection. Hold the grey body \n\nof the pre-filled pen with one hand. Place hand on the middle of the pen so that neither the grey cap \n(1) nor the plum cap (2) is covered. Hold the pre-filled pen with the grey cap (1) pointing up. With \nyour other hand, pull the grey cap (1) straight off, check that the small black needle cover of the \nsyringe has been removed with the cap, then discard cap. If a few small drops of liquid come out of \nthe needle, that is okay. The white needle sleeve will now be exposed. Do not try to touch the needle \nhoused in the barrel. DO NOT RECAP as you may damage the needle inside.  \n\n \n\n \n \n3.  Pull the plum safety cap (labelled ‘2’) straight off to expose the plum coloured activation button. \n\nThe pre-filled pen is now ready to use. Do not press the plum activation button until properly \npositioned as this will result in discharge of medication. DO NOT RECAP as this could cause the \nunit to discharge. \n\n \n\n\n\n399 \n\nGiving the injection \n \n1.  With your free hand, gently grasp a sizable area of the cleaned skin at the injection site and hold \n\nfirmly (see below).   \n2.   Place the white end of the pre-filled pen at a right angle (90 degrees) to the skin, so that you can see \n\nthe window. The presence of one or more bubbles in the window is normal. \n3.  Holding the barrel of the pre-filled pen, press down slightly onto the injection site (holding in place \n\nwithout moving).  \n4.  With your index finger or your thumb, press the plum coloured button on top once you are ready to \n\nbegin the injection (see below). You will then hear a loud ‘click’ as the needle is released and you \nwill feel a small prick as the needle advances.  \n\n5.  Keep pressing and continue to hold the pre-filled pen with steady pressure in place for about 10 \nseconds to ensure a complete injection. Do not remove the pre-filled pen while the injection is \nbeing given.  \n\n \n\n \n \n6.  You will see a yellow indicator move into the window during the injection. The injection is \n\ncomplete when the yellow indicator stops moving. The yellow indicator is part of the plunger of the \npre-filled pen. If the yellow indicator is not shown in the window, the plunger has not advanced \nadequately and the injection is not complete.   \n\n \n7.  Lift the pre-filled pen straight up from the injection site. The white needle sleeve will move down \n\nover the needle and lock into place over the needle tip. Do not try to touch the needle. The white \nneedle sleeve is there to protect you from touching the needle.    \n\n \n\n \n\n \nWhite Needle \nSleeve \n\n \n\n \n \n \nWindow \n \nYellow Indicator \nVisible \n \n\n \n8.  You may notice a spot of blood at the injection site. You can press a cotton ball or a piece of gauze \n\nover the injection site for 10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. Use a plaster if you want to. \n \nThrowing away supplies \n \nOnly use each pre-filled pen for one injection. Do not put either of the caps back on the pre-filled pen. \n\n\n\n400 \n\nAfter injecting Humira, immediately throw away the used pre-filled pen in a special container as \ninstructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist \nKeep this container out of the sight and reach of children \n \nIf you use more Humira than you should \n \nIf you accidentally inject Humira more frequently than told to by your doctor or pharmacist, call your \ndoctor or pharmacist and tell him/her that you have taken more. Always take the outer carton of the \nmedicine with you, even if it is empty.  \n \nIf you forget to use Humira \n \nIf you forget to give yourself an injection, you should inject the next dose of Humira as soon as you \nremember. Then take your next dose as you would have on your originally scheduled day, had you not \nforgotten a dose.  \n \nIf you stop using Humira \n \nThe decision to stop using Humira should be discussed with your doctor. Your symptoms may return upon \ndiscontinuation. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away \nfrom the nail bed which can be painful. \n \nHumira is used to treat \n\n moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults and  \n severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom topical \n\ntherapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa  \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory skin \ndisease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It most \ncommonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and \nbuttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and \n moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.  \n\n \nHumira can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses caused by the disease and the pain that is often \nassociated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to \nthese medicines, you will be given Humira. \n \nCrohn’s disease  \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n \nHumira is used to treat \n\n moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in adults and  \n moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years \n \n\nYou may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Humira. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and \n moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years  \n\n \nYou may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Humira. \n \nNon-infectious uveitis \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n\n\n410 \n\n adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye \n children with chronic non-infectious uveitis from 2 years of age with inflammation affecting the \n\nfront of the eye  \n \nThis inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or \nwispy lines that move across the field of vision). Humira works by reducing this inflammation. \n \nYou may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Humira. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humira \n \nDo not use Humira: \n \n\n If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6).  \n\n \n If you have active tuberculosis or other severe infections (see “Warnings and precautions”). It is \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, for example, fever, \nwounds, feeling tired, dental problems. \n \n\n If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Humira. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \n\n If you get allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling \nor rash do not inject more Humira and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these \nreactions can be life threatening. \n \n\nInfections \n \n\n If you have an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the body (for \nexample, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Humira. If you are unsure, contact your \ndoctor.  \n\n \n You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Humira treatment. This risk may \n\nincrease if you have problems with your lungs. These infections may be serious and include:  \n tuberculosis \n infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria \n severe infection in the blood (sepsis) \n\n \nIn rare cases, these infections can be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get \nsymptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may tell you to \nstop using Humira for some time. \n \n\n\n\n411 \n\n Tell your doctor if you live or travel in regions where fungal infections (for example, \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis) are very common. \n\n \n Tell your doctor if you have had infections which keep coming back or other conditions that \n\nincrease the risk of infections. \n \n\n If you are over 65 years you may be more likely to get infections while taking Humira. You and \nyour doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with \nHumira. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \nTuberculosis \n \n\n It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been \nin close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If you have active tuberculosis, do not \nuse Humira. \n\n \n As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Humira, your doctor \n\nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Humira. This will \ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate \nscreening tests (for example, chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of \nthese tests should be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card.  \n\n Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received treatment for the \nprevention of tuberculosis.  \n\n If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack \nof energy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your \ndoctor immediately.  \n\n \nHepatitis B \n \n\n Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV or if \nyou think you might be at risk of getting HBV.  \n\n Your doctor should test you for HBV. In people who carry HBV, Humira can cause the \nvirus to become active again. \n\n In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune \nsystem, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.   \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n\n If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures, please inform your doctor that you are \ntaking Humira. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Humira.  \n \n\nDemyelinating disease \n \n\n If you have or develop a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \nthe nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue to \nreceive Humira. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms like changes in your \nvision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. \n \n\nVaccinations \n \n\n Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving Humira.  \n\n\n\n412 \n\n \n Check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines.  \n It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled vaccinations for \n\ntheir age before they start treatment with Humira. \n If you received Humira while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for \n\ngetting such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last Humira dose \nyou received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other \nhealth care professionals about your Humira use during your pregnancy so they can \ndecide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \nHeart failure \n \n\n If you have mild heart failure and are being treated with Humira, your heart failure status must be \nclosely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a \nserious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness \nof breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor will \ndecide if you should receive Humira. \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\n In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or \nhelp you to stop bleeding. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. If you develop a fever that \ndoes not go away, develop light bruises or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor \nright away.  \n\n \nCancer \n \n\n There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking \nHumira or other TNF blockers.   \n\n \n People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time \n\nmay have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph \nsystem) and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow).  \n\n If you take Humira the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may \nincrease. On rare occasions, an uncommon and severe type of lymphoma, has been seen in \npatients taking Humira. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6-\nmercaptopurine.  \n\n Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Humira.  \n Cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Humira. \n If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, \n\ntell your doctor. \n \n\n There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker. \nIf you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment \nwith a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. \n \n\nAutoimmune disease \n \n\n On rare occasions, treatment with Humira could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n\n \n\n\n\n413 \n\nChildren and adolescents \n \n\n Vaccinations: if possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Humira. \n \n\nOther medicines and Humira \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nYou should not take Humira with medicines containing the following active substances due to increased \nrisk of serious infection: \n\n anakinra \n abatacept. \n\n \nHumira can be taken together with: \n\n methotrexate \n certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (for example, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, \n\nleflunomide and injectable gold preparations) \n steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n\n \nIf you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\n You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use \nfor at least 5 months after the last Humira treatment. \n\n If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice about taking this medicine. \n\n Humira should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived Humira during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive Humira. \n\n Humira can be used during breast-feeding. \n If you receive Humira during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection. \n It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nHumira use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information on \nvaccines see the “Warnings and precautions” section. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nHumira may have a small effect on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines.

It is \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, for example, fever, \nwounds, feeling tired, dental problems. \n\n \n If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \n\nhave a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Humira. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \n\n If you get allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling \nor rash do not inject more Humira and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these \nreactions can be life threatening. \n\n \nInfections \n \n\n If you have an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the body (for \nexample, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Humira. If you are unsure, contact your \ndoctor.  \n\n \n You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Humira treatment. This risk may \n\nincrease if you have problems with your lungs. These infections may be serious and include:  \n tuberculosis \n infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria \n severe infection in the blood (sepsis) \n\n \nIn rare cases, these infections can be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get \nsymptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may tell you to \nstop using Humira for some time. \n \n\n\n\n433 \n\n Tell your doctor if you live or travel in regions where fungal infections (for example, \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis) are very common. \n\n \n Tell your doctor if you have had infections which keep coming back or other conditions that \n\nincrease the risk of infections. \n \n\n If you are over 65 years you may be more likely to get infections while taking Humira. You and \nyour doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with \nHumira. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \nTuberculosis \n \n\n It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been \nin close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If you have active tuberculosis, do not \nuse Humira. \n\n \n As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Humira, your doctor \n\nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Humira. This will \ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate \nscreening tests (for example, chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of \nthese tests should be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card.  \n\n Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received treatment for the \nprevention of tuberculosis.  \n\n If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack \nof energy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your \ndoctor immediately. \n \n\nHepatitis B \n \n\n Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV or if \nyou think you might be at risk of getting HBV.  \n\n Your doctor should test you for HBV. In people who carry HBV, Humira can cause the \nvirus to become active again. \n\n In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune \nsystem, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.   \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n\n If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures, please inform your doctor that you are \ntaking Humira. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Humira.  \n\n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n\n If you have or develop a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \nthe nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue to \nreceive Humira. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms like changes in your \nvision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. \n\n \nVaccinations \n \n\n Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving Humira.  \n\n\n\n434 \n\n \n Check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines.  \n It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled vaccinations for \n\ntheir age before they start treatment with Humira. \n If you received Humira while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for \n\ngetting such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last Humira dose \nyou received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other \nhealth care professionals about your Humira use during your pregnancy so they can \ndecide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \nHeart failure \n \n\n If you have mild heart failure and are being treated with Humira, your heart failure status must be \nclosely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a \nserious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness \nof breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor will \ndecide if you should receive Humira. \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\n In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off \ninfections or help you to stop bleeding. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. If you \ndevelop a fever that does not go away, develop light bruises or bleed very easily or look very \npale, call your doctor right away. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\n There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking \nHumira or other TNF blockers.   \n\n \n People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time \n\nmay have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph \nsystem) and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow).  \n\n If you take Humira the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may \nincrease. On rare occasions, an uncommon and severe type of lymphoma, has been seen in \npatients taking Humira. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6-\nmercaptopurine.  \n\n Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Humira.  \n Cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Humira.  \n If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, \n\ntell your doctor. \n \n\n There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker. \nIf you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment \nwith a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. \n\n \nAutoimmune disease \n \n\n On rare occasions, treatment with Humira could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n\n \n\n\n\n435 \n\nChildren and adolescents \n \n\n Vaccinations: if possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Humira. \n \n\nOther medicines and Humira \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nYou should not take Humira with medicines containing the following active substances due to increased \nrisk of serious infection: \n\n anakinra \n abatacept. \n\n \nHumira can be taken together with: \n\n methotrexate \n certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (for example, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, \n\nleflunomide and injectable gold preparations) \n steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n\n \nIf you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\n You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use \nfor at least 5 months after the last Humira treatment. \n\n If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice about taking this medicine. \n\n Humira should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived Humira during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive Humira. \n\n Humira can be used during breast-feeding. \n If you receive Humira during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection. \n It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nHumira use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information on \nvaccines see the “Warnings and precautions” section. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nHumira may have a small effect on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines.

Monoclonal antibodies \nare proteins that attach to a specific target. \n \nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved in the \nimmune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By \nattaching to TNFα, Humira decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases. \n \n\n\n\n451 \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n \nHumira is used to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults. You may first be given other \ndisease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, \nyou will be given Humira. \n \nHumira can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n \nHumira can slow down the damage to the joints caused by the inflammatory disease and can help them \nmove more freely.  \n \nYour doctor will decide if Humira should be used with methotrexate or alone.  \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n \nHumira is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients from 2 years of age. You may \nfirst be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough \nto these medicines, you will be given Humira. \n \nYour doctor will decide if Humira should be used with methotrexate or alone. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints and the places where tendons join the \nbone. \n \nHumira is used to treat enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from 6 years of age. You may first be given \nother disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these \nmedicines, you will be given Humira. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis are inflammatory diseases of the spine. \n \nHumira is used to treat severe ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of ankylosing spondylitis in adults. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not \nrespond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Humira. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints that is usually associated with psoriasis. \n \nHumira is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Humira can slow down the damage to the joints caused \nby the disease and can help them move more freely. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not \nrespond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Humira. \n \n\n\n\n452 \n\nPlaque psoriasis  \n \nPlaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery \nscales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away \nfrom the nail bed which can be painful.   \n \nHumira is used to treat \n\n moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults and  \n severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom topical \n\ntherapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n \n\nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory skin \ndisease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It most \ncommonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and \nbuttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and \n moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.  \n\n \nHumira can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses caused by the disease and the pain that is often \nassociated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to \nthese medicines, you will be given Humira. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n \nHumira is used to treat \n\n moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in adults and  \n moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years \n \n\nYou may first be given other medicines.

Humira works by reducing this inflammation. \n \nYou may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Humira. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humira \n \nDo not use Humira: \n \n\n If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6).  \n\n \n If you have active tuberculosis or other severe infections (see “Warnings and precautions”). It is \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, for example, fever, \nwounds, feeling tired, dental problems. \n\n \n If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \n\nhave a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Humira. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \n\n If you get allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling \nor rash do not inject more Humira and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these \nreactions can be life threatening. \n\n \nInfections \n \n\n If you have an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the body (for \nexample, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Humira. If you are unsure, contact your \ndoctor.  \n\n \n You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Humira treatment. This risk may \n\nincrease if you have problems with your lungs. These infections may be serious and include:  \n tuberculosis \n infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria \n severe infection in the blood (sepsis) \n\n \nIn rare cases, these infections can be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get \nsymptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may tell you to \nstop using Humira for some time. \n \n\n\n\n454 \n\n Tell your doctor if you live or travel in regions where fungal infections (for example, \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis) are very common. \n\n \n Tell your doctor if you have had infections which keep coming back or other conditions that \n\nincrease the risk of infections. \n \n\n If you are over 65 years you may be more likely to get infections while taking Humira. You and \nyour doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with \nHumira. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \nTuberculosis \n \n\n It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been \nin close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If you have active tuberculosis, do not \nuse Humira. \n\n \n As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Humira, your doctor \n\nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Humira. This will \ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate \nscreening tests (for example, chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of \nthese tests should be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card.  \n\n Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received treatment for the \nprevention of tuberculosis.  \n\n If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack \nof energy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your \ndoctor immediately. \n \n\nHepatitis B \n \n\n Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV or if \nyou think you might be at risk of getting HBV.  \n\n Your doctor should test you for HBV. In people who carry HBV, Humira can cause the \nvirus to become active again. \n\n In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune \nsystem, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.   \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n\n If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures, please inform your doctor that you are \ntaking Humira. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Humira.  \n\n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n\n If you have or develop a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \nthe nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue to \nreceive Humira. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms like changes in your \nvision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. \n\n \nVaccinations \n \n\n Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving Humira.  \n\n\n\n455 \n\n \n Check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines.  \n It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled vaccinations for \n\ntheir age before they start treatment with Humira. \n If you received Humira while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for \n\ngetting such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last Humira dose \nyou received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other \nhealth care professionals about your Humira use during your pregnancy so they can \ndecide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \nHeart failure \n \n\n If you have mild heart failure and are being treated with Humira, your heart failure status must be \nclosely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a \nserious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness \nof breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor will \ndecide if you should receive Humira. \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\n In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off \ninfections or help you to stop bleeding. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. If you \ndevelop a fever that does not go away, develop light bruises or bleed very easily or look very \npale, call your doctor right away. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\n There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking \nHumira or other TNF blockers.   \n\n \n People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time \n\nmay have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph \nsystem) and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow).  \n\n If you take Humira the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may \nincrease. On rare occasions, an uncommon and severe type of lymphoma, has been seen in \npatients taking Humira. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6-\nmercaptopurine.  \n\n Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Humira.  \n Cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Humira.  \n If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, \n\ntell your doctor. \n \n\n There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker. \nIf you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment \nwith a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. \n\n \nAutoimmune disease \n \n\n On rare occasions, treatment with Humira could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n\n \n\n\n\n456 \n\nChildren and adolescents \n \n\n Vaccinations: if possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Humira. \n \n\nOther medicines and Humira \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nYou should not take Humira with medicines containing the following active substances due to increased \nrisk of serious infection: \n\n anakinra \n abatacept. \n\n \nHumira can be taken together with: \n\n methotrexate \n certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (for example, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, \n\nleflunomide and injectable gold preparations) \n steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n\n \nIf you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\n You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use \nfor at least 5 months after the last Humira treatment. \n\n If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice about taking this medicine. \n\n Humira should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived Humira during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive Humira. \n\n Humira can be used during breast-feeding. \n If you receive Humira during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection. \n It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nHumira use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information on \nvaccines see the “Warnings and precautions” section. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nHumira may have a small effect on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines.

What Humira is and what it is used for \n \nHumira contains the active substance adalimumab. \n \nHumira is used to treat \n\n Rheumatoid arthritis \n Plaque psoriasis \n Hidradenitis suppurativa \n Crohn’s disease \n Ulcerative colitis \n Non-infectious uveitis \n\n \nThe active ingredient in Humira, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies \nare proteins that attach to a specific target. \n \nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved in the \nimmune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By \nattaching to TNFα, Humira decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n \n\n\n\n472 \n\nHumira is used to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults. You may first be given other \ndisease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, \nyou will be given Humira. \n \nHumira can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n \nHumira can slow down the damage to the joints caused by the inflammatory disease and can help them \nmove more freely.  \n \nYour doctor will decide if Humira should be used with methotrexate or alone. \n \nPlaque psoriasis  \n \nPlaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery \nscales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away \nfrom the nail bed which can be painful.   \n \nHumira is used to treat moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults.   \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory skin \ndisease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It most \ncommonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and \nbuttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and \n moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adolescents aged 12to 17 years. \n \n\nHumira can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses caused by the disease and the pain that is often \nassociated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to \nthese medicines, you will be given Humira. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in adults and  \n moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years.  \n\n \nYou may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Humira. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and  \n moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years \n\n\n\n473 \n\n \nYou may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Humira. \n \nNon-infectious uveitis \n\n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye  \n children with chronic non-infectious uveitis from 2 years of age with inflammation affecting the \n\nfront of the eye  \n \n\nThis inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or \nwispy lines that move across the field of vision). Humira works by reducing this inflammation. You may \nfirst be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given \nHumira. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humira \n \nDo not use Humira: \n \n\n If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6).  \n\n \n If you have active tuberculosis or other severe infections (see “Warnings and precautions”). It is \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, for example, fever, \nwounds, feeling tired, dental problems. \n\n \n If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \n\nhave a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Humira. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \n\n If you get allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling \nor rash do not inject more Humira and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these \nreactions can be life threatening.  \n\n \nInfections \n \n\n If you have an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the body (for \nexample, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Humira. If you are unsure, contact your \ndoctor.  \n\n \n You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Humira treatment. This risk may \n\nincrease if you have problems with your lungs. These infections may be serious and include: \n tuberculosis \n\n\n\n474 \n\n infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria \n severe infection in the blood (sepsis) \n\n \nIn rare cases, these infections can be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get \nsymptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may tell you to \nstop using Humira for some time. \n\n \n Tell your doctor if you live or travel in regions where fungal infections (for example, \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis) are very common. \n \n\n Tell your doctor if you have had infections which keep coming back or other conditions that \nincrease the risk of infections. \n\n \n If you are over 65 years you may be more likely to get infections while taking Humira. You and \n\nyour doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with \nHumira. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \nTuberculosis \n \n\n It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been \nin close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If you have active tuberculosis, do not \nuse Humira. \n\n \n As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Humira, your doctor \n\nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Humira. This will \ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate \nscreening tests (for example, chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of \nthese tests should be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card.   \n\n Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received treatment for the \nprevention of tuberculosis.  \n\n If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack \nof energy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your \ndoctor immediately.  \n\n \nHepatitis B \n \n\n Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV or if \nyou think you might be at risk of getting HBV.   \n\n \n Your doctor should test you for HBV. In people who carry HBV, Humira can cause the \n\nvirus to become active again.  \n In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune \n\nsystem, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.  \n \nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n\n If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures, please inform your doctor that you are \ntaking Humira. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Humira. \n\n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n\n\n\n475 \n\n If you have or develop a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \nthe nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue to \nreceive Humira. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms like changes in your \nvision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. \n\n \nVaccinations \n \n\n Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving Humira.   \n \n\n Check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines.  \n It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled vaccinations for \n\ntheir age before they start treatment with Humira.  \n If you received Humira while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for \n\ngetting such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last Humira dose \nyou received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other \nhealth care professionals about your Humira use during your pregnancy so they can \ndecide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \nHeart failure \n \n\n If you have mild heart failure and are being treated with Humira, your heart failure status must be \nclosely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a \nserious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness \nof breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor will \ndecide if you should receive Humira. \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\n In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or \nhelp you to stop bleeding. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. If you develop a fever that \ndoes not go away, develop light bruises or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor \nright away. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\n There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking \nHumira or other TNF blockers.  \n\n \n People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time \n\nmay have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph \nsystem) and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow).  \n\n If you take Humira the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may \nincrease. On rare occasions, an uncommon and severe type of lymphoma has been seen in \npatients taking Humira. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6- \nmercaptopurine.  \n\n Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Humira.  \n Cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Humira.  \n If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, \n\ntell your doctor. \n \n\n There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker. \n\n\n\n476 \n\nIf you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment \nwith a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. \n\n \nAutoimmune disease \n \n\n On rare occasions, treatment with Humira could result in lupus-like syndrome.

Monoclonal antibodies \nare proteins that attach to a specific target. \n \nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved in the \nimmune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By \nattaching to TNFα, Humira decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n \n\n\n\n492 \n\nHumira is used to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults. You may first be given other \ndisease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, \nyou will be given Humira. \n \nHumira can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n \nHumira can slow down the damage to the joints caused by the inflammatory disease and can help them \nmove more freely.  \n \nYour doctor will decide if Humira should be used with methotrexate or alone. \n \nPlaque psoriasis  \n \nPlaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery \nscales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away \nfrom the nail bed which can be painful.   \n \nHumira is used to treat moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults.   \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory skin \ndisease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It most \ncommonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and \nbuttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and \n moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adolescents aged 12to 17 years. \n \n\nHumira can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses caused by the disease and the pain that is often \nassociated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to \nthese medicines, you will be given Humira. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in adults and  \n moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years.  \n\n \nYou may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Humira. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and  \n moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years \n\n\n\n493 \n\n \nYou may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Humira. \n \nNon-infectious uveitis \n\n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye  \n children with chronic non-infectious uveitis from 2 years of age with inflammation affecting the \n\nfront of the eye  \n \n\nThis inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or \nwispy lines that move across the field of vision). Humira works by reducing this inflammation. You may \nfirst be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given \nHumira. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humira \n \nDo not use Humira: \n \n\n If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6).  \n\n \n If you have active tuberculosis or other severe infections (see “Warnings and precautions”). It is \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, for example, fever, \nwounds, feeling tired, dental problems. \n\n \n If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \n\nhave a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Humira. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \n\n If you get allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling \nor rash do not inject more Humira and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these \nreactions can be life threatening.  \n\n \nInfections \n \n\n If you have an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the body (for \nexample, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Humira. If you are unsure, contact your \ndoctor.  \n\n \n You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Humira treatment. This risk may \n\nincrease if you have problems with your lungs. These infections may be serious and include: \n \n\n tuberculosis \n\n\n\n494 \n\n infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria \n severe infection in the blood (sepsis) \n\n \nIn rare cases, these infections can be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get \nsymptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may tell you to \nstop using Humira for some time. \n\n \n Tell your doctor if you live or travel in regions where fungal infections (for example, \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis) are very common. \n \n\n Tell your doctor if you have had infections which keep coming back or other conditions that \nincrease the risk of infections. \n\n \n If you are over 65 years you may be more likely to get infections while taking Humira. You and \n\nyour doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with \nHumira. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \nTuberculosis \n \n\n It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been \nin close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If you have active tuberculosis, do not \nuse Humira. \n\n \n As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Humira, your doctor \n\nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Humira. This will \ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate \nscreening tests (for example, chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of \nthese tests should be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card.   \n\n Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received treatment for the \nprevention of tuberculosis.  \n\n If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack \nof energy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your \ndoctor immediately.  \n\n \nHepatitis B \n \n\n Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV or if \nyou think you might be at risk of getting HBV.   \n\n \n Your doctor should test you for HBV. In people who carry HBV, Humira can cause the \n\nvirus to become active again.  \n In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune \n\nsystem, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.  \n \nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n\n If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are taking \nHumira. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Humira. \n\n \n\n\n\n495 \n\nDemyelinating disease \n \n\n If you have or develop a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \nthe nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue to \nreceive Humira. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms like changes in your \nvision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. \n\n \nVaccinations \n \n\n Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving Humira.   \n \n\n Check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines.  \n It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled vaccinations for \n\ntheir age before they start treatment with Humira.  \n If you received Humira while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for \n\ngetting such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last Humira dose \nyou received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other \nhealth care professionals about your Humira use during your pregnancy so they can \ndecide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \nHeart failure \n \n\n If you have mild heart failure and are being treated with Humira, your heart failure status must be \nclosely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a \nserious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness \nof breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor will \ndecide if you should receive Humira. \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\n In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or \nhelp you to stop bleeding. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. If you develop a fever that \ndoes not go away, develop light bruises or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor \nright away. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\n There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking \nHumira or other TNF blockers.  \n\n \n People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time \n\nmay have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph \nsystem) and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow).  \n\n If you take Humira the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may \nincrease. On rare occasions, an uncommon and severe type of lymphoma has been seen in \npatients taking Humira. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6- \nmercaptopurine.  \n\n Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Humira.  \n Cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Humira.  \n If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, \n\ntell your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n496 \n\n There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung \ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker. \nIf you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment \nwith a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. \n\n \nAutoimmune disease \n \n\n On rare occasions, treatment with Humira could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \n\n Vaccinations: if possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Humira. \n \n\nOther medicines and Humira \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nYou should not take Humira with medicines containing the following active substances due to increased \nrisk of serious infection: \n\n anakinra \n abatacept. \n\n \nHumira can be taken together with: \n\n methotrexate  \n certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (for example, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, \n\nleflunomide and injectable gold preparations) \n steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n\n \nIf you have questions, please ask your doctor.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\n You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use \nfor at least 5 months after the last Humira treatment. \n\n If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice about taking this medicine. \n\n Humira should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived Humira during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive Humira. \n\n Humira can be used during breast-feeding. \n If you receive Humira during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection. \n It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nHumira use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine.  For more information \non vaccines see the “Warnings and precautions” section. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nHumira may have a small effect on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning sensation \nand vision disturbances may occur after taking Humira. \n\n\n\n497 \n\n \n \n3.

What Humira is and what it is used for \n \nHumira contains the active substance adalimumab. \n \nHumira is used to treat \n\n Rheumatoid arthritis \n Plaque psoriasis \n Hidradenitis suppurativa \n Crohn’s disease \n Ulcerative colitis \n Non-infectious uveitis \n\n \nThe active ingredient in Humira, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies \nare proteins that attach to a specific target. \n \nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved in the \nimmune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By \nattaching to TNFα, Humira decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n \n\n\n\n512 \n\nHumira is used to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults. You may first be given other \ndisease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, \nyou will be given Humira. \n \nHumira can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n \nHumira can slow down the damage to the joints caused by the inflammatory disease and can help them \nmove more freely.  \n \nYour doctor will decide if Humira should be used with methotrexate or alone. \n \nPlaque psoriasis  \n \nPlaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery \nscales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away \nfrom the nail bed which can be painful.   \n \nHumira is used to treat moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults. \n \n\nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory skin \ndisease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It most \ncommonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and \nbuttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and \n moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.  \n\n \nHumira can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses caused by the disease and the pain that is often \nassociated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to \nthese medicines, you will be given Humira. \n \nCrohn’s disease \n \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n \nHumira is used to treat \n\n moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in adults and  \n moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. \n \n\nYou may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Humira. \n\n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and  \n moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years \n\n\n\n513 \n\n \nYou may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Humira. \n \nNon-infectious uveitis \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. \n \nHumira is used to treat  \n\n adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye  \n children with chronic non-infectious uveitis from 2 years of age with inflammation affecting the \n\nfront of the eye \n \nThis inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or \nwispy lines that move across the field of vision). Humira works by reducing this inflammation. You may \nfirst be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given \nHumira.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humira \n \nDo not use Humira: \n \n\n If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6).  \n\n \n If you have active tuberculosis or other severe infections (see “Warnings and precautions”). It is \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, for example, fever, \nwounds, feeling tired, dental problems. \n\n \n If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \n\nhave a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Humira. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \n\n If you get allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling \nor rash do not inject more Humira and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these \nreactions can be life threatening. \n\n \nInfections \n \n\n If you have an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the body (for \nexample, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Humira. If you are unsure, contact your \ndoctor.  \n\n \n You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Humira treatment. This risk may \n\nincrease if you have problems with your lungs. These infections may be serious and include:  \n tuberculosis \n\n\n\n514 \n\n infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria \n severe infection in the blood (sepsis) \n\n \nIn rare cases, these infections can be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get \nsymptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may tell you to \nstop using Humira for some time. \n \n\n Tell your doctor if you live or travel in regions where fungal infections (for example, \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis) are very common. \n\n \n Tell your doctor if you have had infections which keep coming back or other conditions that \n\nincrease the risk of infections. \n \n\n If you are over 65 years you may be more likely to get infections while taking Humira. You and \nyour doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with \nHumira. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \nTuberculosis \n \n\n It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been \nin close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If you have active tuberculosis, do not \nuse Humira. \n\n \n As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Humira, your doctor \n\nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Humira. This will \ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate \nscreening tests (for example, chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of \nthese tests should be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card.  \n\n Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received treatment for the \nprevention of tuberculosis.  \n\n If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack \nof energy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your \ndoctor immediately. \n \n\nHepatitis B \n \n\n Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV or if \nyou think you might be at risk of getting HBV.  \n\n Your doctor should test you for HBV. In people who carry HBV, Humira can cause the \nvirus to become active again. \n\n In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune \nsystem, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.   \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n\n If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are taking \nHumira. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Humira.  \n\n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n\n\n\n515 \n\n If you have or develop a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \nthe nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue to \nreceive Humira. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms like changes in your \nvision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. \n\n \nVaccinations \n \n\n Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving Humira.  \n \n\n Check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines.  \n It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled vaccinations for \n\ntheir age before they start treatment with Humira. \n If you received Humira while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for \n\ngetting such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last Humira dose \nyou received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other \nhealth care professionals about your Humira use during your pregnancy so they can \ndecide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \nHeart failure \n \n\n If you have mild heart failure and are being treated with Humira, your heart failure status must be \nclosely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a \nserious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness \nof breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor will \ndecide if you should receive Humira. \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\n In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or \nhelp you to stop bleeding. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. If you develop a fever that \ndoes not go away, develop light bruises or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor \nright away. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\n There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking \nHumira or other TNF blockers.   \n\n \n People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time \n\nmay have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph \nsystem) and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow).  \n\n If you take Humira the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may \nincrease. On rare occasions, an uncommon and severe type of lymphoma, has been seen in \npatients taking Humira. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6-\nmercaptopurine.  \n\n Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Humira.  \n Cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Humira.  \n If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, \n\ntell your doctor. \n \n\n There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker. \n\n\n\n516 \n\nIf you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment \nwith a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. \n\n \nAutoimmune disease \n \n\n On rare occasions, treatment with Humira could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \n\n Vaccinations: if possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Humira. \n \n\nOther medicines and Humira \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nYou should not take Humira with medicines containing the following active substances due to increased \nrisk of serious infection: \n\n anakinra \n abatacept. \n\n \nHumira can be taken together with: \n\n methotrexate \n certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (for example, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, \n\nleflunomide and injectable gold preparations) \n steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n\n \nIf you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\n You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use \nfor at least 5 months after the last Humira treatment. \n\n If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice about taking this medicine. \n\n Humira should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived Humira during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive Humira. \n\n Humira can be used during breast-feeding. \n If you receive Humira during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection. \n It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nHumira use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information on \nvaccines see the “Warnings and precautions” section. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nHumira may have a small effect on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning sensation \nand vision disturbances may occur after taking Humira. \n \n \n\n\n\n517 \n\n3. How to use Humira \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended doses for Humira in each of the approved uses are shown in the following table.
