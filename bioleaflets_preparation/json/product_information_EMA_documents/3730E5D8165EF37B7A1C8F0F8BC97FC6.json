PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet \n \nSamsca 7.5 mg tablets \nBlue, rectangular, shallow-convex tablets with dimensions of 7.7 × 4.35 × 2.5 mm, debossed with \n“OTSUKA” and “7.5” on one side. \n \nSamsca 15 mg tablets \nBlue, triangular, shallow-convex tablets with dimensions of 6.58 × 6.2 × 2.7 mm, debossed with \n“OTSUKA” and “15” on one side. \n \nSamsca 30 mg tablets \nBlue, round, shallow-convex tablets with dimensions of Ø8 × 3.0 mm, debossed with “OTSUKA” and \n“30” on one side.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSamsca is indicated in adults for the treatment of hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of \ninappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nDue to the need for a dose titration phase with close monitoring of serum sodium and volume status \n(see section 4.4), treatment with Samsca has to be initiated in hospital. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n \nTolvaptan has to be initiated at a dose of 15 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to a maximum \nof 60 mg once daily as tolerated to achieve the desired level of serum sodium. \n \nFor patients at risk of overly rapid correction of sodium e.g. patients with oncological conditions, very \nlow baseline serum sodium, taking diuretics, or taking sodium supplementation a dose of 7.5 mg \nshould be considered (see section 4.4). \n \nDuring titration, patients must be monitored for serum sodium and volume status (see section 4.4). In \ncase of inadequate improvement in serum sodium levels, other treatment options have to be \nconsidered, either in place of or in addition to tolvaptan. Use of tolvaptan in combination with other \noptions may increase the risk of overly rapid correction of serum sodium (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nFor patients with an appropriate increase in serum sodium, the underlying disease and serum sodium \nlevels must be monitored at regular intervals to evaluate further need of tolvaptan treatment. In the \nsetting of hyponatremia, the treatment duration is determined by the underlying disease and its \ntreatment. Tolvaptan treatment is expected to last until the underlying disease is adequately treated or \nuntil such time that hyponatremia is no longer a clinical issue. \nSamsca must not be taken with grapefruit juice (see section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nTolvaptan is contraindicated in anuric patients (see section 4.3). \nTolvaptan has not been studied in patients with severe renal failure. The efficacy and safety in this \npopulation is not well established. \nBased on the data available, no dose adjustment is required in those with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo information is available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). In these \npatients dosing has to be managed cautiously and electrolytes and volume status must be monitored \n(see section 4.4). No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh classes A and B). \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of tolvaptan in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years have not yet \nbeen established. Samsca is not recommended in the paediatric age group. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \n \nAdministration preferably in the morning, without regard to meals. Tablets must be swallowed without \nchewing with a glass of water. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to \n\nbenzazepine or benzazepine derivatives (see section 4.4) \n• Anuria \n• Volume depletion \n• Hypovolemic hyponatremia \n• Hypernatremia \n\n\n\n4 \n\n• Patients who cannot perceive thirst \n• Pregnancy (see section 4.6) \n• Breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nUrgent need to raise serum sodium acutely \n \nTolvaptan has not been studied in a setting of urgent need to raise serum sodium acutely. For such \npatients, alternative treatment has to be considered. \n \nAccess to water \n \nTolvaptan may cause adverse reactions related to water loss such as thirst, dry mouth and dehydration \n(see section 4.8). Therefore, patients must have access to water and be able to drink sufficient amounts \nof water. If fluid restricted patients are treated with tolvaptan, extra caution has to be exercised to \nensure that patients do not become overly dehydrated. \n \nDehydration \n \nVolume status must be monitored in patients taking tolvaptan because treatment with tolvaptan may \nresult in severe dehydration, which constitutes a risk factor for renal dysfunction. If dehydration \nbecomes evident, take appropriate action which may include the need to interrupt or reduce the dose of \ntolvaptan and increase fluid intake. \n \nUrinary outflow obstruction \n \nUrinary output must be secured. Patients with partial obstruction of urinary outflow, for example \npatients with prostatic hypertrophy or impairment of micturition, have an increased risk of developing \nacute retention. \n \nFluid and electrolyte balance \n \nFluid and electrolyte status has to be monitored in all patients and particularly in those with renal and \nhepatic impairment. Administration of tolvaptan may cause too rapid increases in serum sodium \n(≥ 12 mmol/L per 24 hours, please see below); therefore, monitoring of serum sodium in all patients \nmust start no later than 4-6 hours after treatment initiation. During the first 1-2 days and until the \ntolvaptan dose is stabilised serum sodium and volume status must be monitored at least every 6 hours. \n \nToo rapid correction of serum sodium \n \nPatients with very low baseline serum sodium concentrations may be at greater risk for too rapid \ncorrection of serum sodium. \nToo rapid correction of hyponatremia (increase ≥ 12 mmol/L/24 hours) can cause osmotic \ndemyelination resulting in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic \nquadriparesis, seizures, coma or death. Therefore after initiation of treatment, patients have to be \nclosely monitored for serum sodium and volume status (see above). \nIn order to minimise the risk of too rapid correction of hyponatremia the increase of serum sodium \nshould be less than 10-12 mmol/L/24 hours and less than 18 mmol/L/48 hours. Therefore, more \nprecautionary limits apply during the early treatment phase. \nIf sodium correction exceeds 6 mmol/L during the first 6 hours of administration or 8 mmol/L during \nthe first 6-12 hours, respectively, the possibility that serum sodium correction may be overly rapid \nshould be considered. These patients should be monitored more frequently regarding their serum \nsodium and administration of hypotonic fluid is recommended. In case serum sodium \nincreases ≥ 12 mmol/L within 24 hours or ≥ 18 mmol/L within 48 hours, tolvaptan treatment is to be \ninterrupted or discontinued followed by administration of hypotonic fluid. \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn patients at higher risk of demyelination syndromes, for example those with hypoxia, alcoholism or \nmalnutrition, the appropriate rate of sodium correction may be lower than that in patients without risk \nfactors; these patients should be very carefully managed. \n \nPatients who received other treatment for hyponatremia or medicinal products which increase serum \nsodium concentration (see section 4.5) prior to initiation of treatment with Samsca must be managed \nvery cautiously. These patients may be at higher risk for developing rapid correction of serum sodium \nduring the first 1-2 days of treatment due to potential additive effects. \nCo-administration of Samsca with other treatments for hyponatremia, and medicinal products that \nincrease serum sodium concentration, is not recommended during initial treatment or for other patients \nwith very low baseline serum sodium concentrations (see section 4.5). \n \nDiabetes mellitus \n \nDiabetic patients with an elevated glucose concentration (e.g. in excess of 300 mg/dL) may present \nwith pseudo-hyponatremia. This condition should be excluded prior and during treatment with \ntolvaptan. \nTolvaptan may cause hyperglycemia (see section 4.8). Therefore, diabetic patients treated with \ntolvaptan should be managed cautiously. In particular this applies to patients with inadequately \ncontrolled type II diabetes. \n \nIdiosyncratic hepatic toxicity \n \nLiver injury induced by tolvaptan was observed in clinical trials investigating a different indication \n(autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [ADPKD]) with long-term use of tolvaptan at higher \ndoses than for the approved indication (see section 4.8). \n \nIn post-marketing experience with tolvaptan in ADPKD, acute liver failure requiring liver \ntransplantation has been reported (see section 4.8). \n \nIn these clinical trials, clinically significant increases (greater than 3 × Upper Limit of Normal) in \nserum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), along with clinically significant increases (greater than 2 × \nUpper Limit of Normal) in serum total bilirubin were observed in 3 patients treated with tolvaptan. In \naddition, an increased incidence of significant elevations of ALT was observed in patients treated with \ntolvaptan [4.4 % (42/958)] compared to those receiving placebo [1.0 % (5/484)]. Elevation \n(>3 × ULN) of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was observed in 3.1 % (30/958) of patients on \ntolvaptan and 0.8 % (4/484) patients on placebo. Most of the liver enzyme abnormalities were \nobserved during the first 18 months of treatment. The elevations gradually improved after \ndiscontinuation of tolvaptan. These findings may suggest that tolvaptan has the potential to cause \nirreversible and potentially fatal liver injury. \n \nIn a post-authorisation safety study of tolvaptan in hyponatremia secondary to SIADH, several cases \nof hepatic disorders and elevated transaminases were observed (see section 4.8). \n \nLiver function tests must be promptly performed in patients taking tolvaptan who report symptoms \nthat may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark \nurine or jaundice. If liver injury is suspected, tolvaptan must be promptly discontinued, appropriate \ntreatment has to be instituted, and investigations have to be performed to determine the probable \ncause. Tolvaptan must not be re-initiated in patients unless the cause for the observed liver injury is \ndefinitively established to be unrelated to treatment with tolvaptan. \n \nAnaphylaxis \n \nIn post-marketing experience, anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock and generalised rash) has \nbeen reported very rarely following administration of tolvaptan. Patients have to be carefully \nmonitored during treatment. Patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to benzazepine or \n\n\n\n6 \n\nbenzazepine derivatives (e.g. benazepril, conivaptan, fenoldopam mesylate or mirtazapine) may be at \nrisk for hypersensitivity reaction to tolvaptan (see section 4.3 Contraindications). \n \nIf an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reactions occur, administration of tolvaptan must \nbe discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. Since hypersensitivity is a \ncontraindication (see section 4.3) treatment must never be restarted after an anaphylactic reaction or \nother serious allergic reactions. \n \nLactose and galactose intolerance \n \nSamsca contains lactose as an excipient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCo-administration with other treatments for hyponatremia and medicinal products that increase serum \nsodium concentration \n \nThere is no experience from controlled clinical trials with concomitant use of Samsca and other \ntreatments for hyponatremia such as hypertonic sodium chloride solution, oral sodium formulations, \nand medicinal products that increase serum sodium concentration. Medicinal products with high \nsodium content such as effervescent analgesic preparations and certain sodium containing treatments \nfor dyspepsia may also increase serum sodium concentration. Concomitant use of Samsca with other \ntreatments for hyponatremia or other medicinal products that increase serum sodium concentration \nmay result in a higher risk for developing rapid correction of serum sodium (see section 4.4) and is \ntherefore not recommended during initial treatment or for other patients with very low baseline serum \nsodium concentrations where rapid correction may represent a risk for osmotic demyelination (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \n \nTolvaptan plasma concentrations have been increased by up to 5.4-fold area under time-concentration \ncurve (AUC) after the administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Caution should be exercised in co-\nadministering CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics, diltiazem) with tolvaptan \n(see section 4.4). Co-administration of grapefruit juice and tolvaptan resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in \nexposure to tolvaptan. Patients taking tolvaptan should avoid ingesting grapefruit juice. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \n \nTolvaptan plasma concentrations have been decreased by up to 87 % (AUC) after the administration \nof CYP3A4 inducers. Caution has to be exercised in co-administering CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. \nrifampicin, barbiturates) with tolvaptan. \n \nCYP3A4 substrates \n \nIn healthy subjects, tolvaptan, a CYP3A4 substrate, had no effect on the plasma concentrations of \nsome other CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. warfarin or amiodarone). Tolvaptan increased plasma levels of \nlovastatin by 1.3- to 1.5-fold. Even though this increase has no clinical relevance, it indicates tolvaptan \ncan potentially increase exposure to CYP3A4 substrates. \n \nDiuretics \n \nWhile there does not appear to be a synergistic or additive effect of concomitant use of tolvaptan with \nloop and thiazide diuretics, each class of agent has the potential to lead to severe dehydration, which \nconstitutes a risk factor for renal dysfunction. If dehydration or renal dysfunction becomes evident, \ntake appropriate action which may include the need to interrupt or reduce doses of tolvaptan and/or \n\n\n\n7 \n\ndiuretics, increase fluid intake, evaluate and address other potential causes of renal dysfunction or \ndehydration. \n \nDigoxin \n \nSteady state digoxin concentrations have been increased (1.3-fold increase in maximum observed \nplasma concentration [Cmax] and 1.2-fold increase in area under the plasma concentration-time curve \nover the dosing interval [AUCτ]) when co administered with multiple once daily 60 mg doses of \ntolvaptan. Patients receiving digoxin should therefore be evaluated for excessive digoxin effects when \ntreated with tolvaptan. \n \nCo-administration with vasopressin analogues \n \nIn addition to its renal aquaretic effect, tolvaptan is capable of blocking vascular vasopressin V2-\nreceptors involved in the release of coagulation factors (e.g., von Willebrand factor) from endothelial \ncells. Therefore, the effect of vasopressin analogues such as desmopressin may be attenuated in \npatients using such analogues to prevent or control bleeding when co-administered with tolvaptan. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of tolvaptan in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nSamsca is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Women of childbearing potential have \nto use effective contraception during tolvaptan treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether tolvaptan is excreted in human milk. \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of tolvaptan in breast \nmilk (for details see 5.3). \nThe potential risk for humans is unknown. \nSamsca is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \n \nStudies in animals showed effects on fertility (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSamsca has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, when driving \nor using machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness, asthenia or syncope may \noccur. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe adverse reaction profile of tolvaptan in SIADH is based on a clinical trials database of \n3,294 tolvaptan-treated patients and is consistent with the pharmacology of the active substance. The \npharmaco-dynamically predictable and most commonly reported adverse reactions are thirst, dry \nmouth and pollakiuria occurring in approximately 18 %, 9 % and 6 % of patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThe frequencies of the adverse reactions from clinical trials correspond with very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use cannot be determined as they \nare derived from spontaneous reports. Consequently, the frequency of these adverse reactions is \nqualified as \"not known\". \n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nFrequency \n\n Very common Common Uncommon Not known \nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n   Anaphylactic \nshock, \nGeneralised rash \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n Polydipsia, \nDehydration, \nHyperkalemia, \nHyperglycemia, \nHypoglycemia1, \nHypernatremia1, \nHyperuricemia1, \nDecreased \nappetite \n \n\n  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Syncope1, \nHeadache1, \nDizziness1 \n \n\nDysgeusia  \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Orthostatic \nhypotension \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea Constipation, \nDiarrhoea1, \nDry mouth \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Ecchymosis, \nPruritus \n\nPruritic rash1  \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n Pollakiuria, \nPolyuria \n\nRenal impairment  \n\nGeneral disorders \nand \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nThirst Asthenia, \nPyrexia, \nMalaise1 \n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n   Hepatic disorders2 \nAcute hepatic \nfailure3 \n\nInvestigations  Blood urine \npresent1, \nAlanine \naminotransferase \nincreased (see \nsection 4.4)1, \nAspartate \naminotransferase \nincreased (see \nsection 4.4)1, \nBlood creatinine \n\nBilirubin \nincreased (see \nsection 4.4)1 \n\nElevated \ntransaminases2 \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nFrequency \n\n Very common Common Uncommon Not known \nincreased \n\nSurgical and \nmedical \nprocedures \n\nRapid correction \nof hyponatremia, \nsometimes \nleading to \nneurological \nsymptoms \n\n   \n\n1 observed in clinical trials investigating other indications \n2 from post-authorisation safety study in hyponatremia secondary to SIADH \n3 observed in post-marketing with tolvaptan in ADPKD. Liver transplantation was necessary. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nRapid correction of hyponatremia  \nIn a post-authorisation safety study of tolvaptan in hyponatremia secondary to SIADH, including a \nhigh proportion of patients with tumours (especially Small Cell Lung Cancer), patients with low \nbaseline serum sodium as well as patients with concomitant use of diuretics and/or sodium chloride \nsolution the incidence of rapid correction of hyponatremia was found to be higher than in clinical \ntrials. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSingle doses up to 480 mg and multiple doses up to 300 mg per day for 5 days have been well \ntolerated in clinical trials in healthy volunteers. There is no specific antidote for tolvaptan intoxication. \nThe signs and symptoms of an acute overdose can be anticipated to be those of excessive \npharmacologic effect: a rise in serum sodium concentration, polyuria, thirst and \ndehydration/hypovolemia (profuse and prolonged aquaresis). \n \nIn patients with suspected tolvaptan overdose, assessment of vital signs, electrolyte concentrations, \nECG and fluid status is recommended. Appropriate replacement of water and/or electrolytes must \ncontinue until aquaresis abates. Dialysis may not be effective in removing tolvaptan because of its \nhigh binding affinity for human plasma protein (> 98 %). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Diuretics, vasopressin antagonists, ATC code: C03XA01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTolvaptan is a selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist that specifically blocks the binding of \narginine vasopressin (AVP) at the V2-receptor of the distal portions of the nephron. Tolvaptan affinity \nfor the human V2-receptor is 1.8 times that of native AVP. \n \nIn healthy adult subjects, oral administration of 7.5 to 120 mg doses of tolvaptan produced a increase \nin urine excretion rate within 2 hours of dosing. Following single oral doses of 7.5 to 60 mg, 24-hour \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nurine volume increased dose dependently with daily volumes ranging from 3 to 9 litres. For all doses, \nurine excretion rates returned to baseline levels after 24 hours. For single doses 60 mg to 480 mg, a \nmean of about 7 litres was excreted during 0 to 12 hours, independent of dose. Markedly higher doses \nof tolvaptan produce more sustained responses without affecting the magnitude of excretion, as active \nconcentrations of tolvaptan are present for longer periods of time.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nHyponatremia \nIn 2 pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials, a total of 424 patients with euvolemic or \nhypervolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium < 135 mEq/L) due to a variety of underlying causes (heart \nfailure [HF], liver cirrhosis, SIADH and others) were treated for 30 days with tolvaptan (n = 216) or \nplacebo (n = 208) at an initial dose of 15 mg/day. The dose could be increased to 30 and 60 mg/day \ndepending on response using a 3 day titration scheme. The mean serum sodium concentration at trial \nentry was 129 mEq/L (range 114-136). \n \nThe primary endpoint for these trials was the average daily AUC for change in serum sodium from \nbaseline to Day 4 and baseline to Day 30. Tolvaptan was superior to placebo (p < 0.0001) for both \nperiods in both studies. This effect was seen in all patients, the severe (serum sodium: < 130 mEq/L) \nand mild (serum sodium: 130 -< 135 mEq/L) subsets and for all disease aetiology subsets (e.g. HF, \ncirrhosis, SIADH/other). At 7 days after discontinuing treatment, sodium values decreased to levels of \nplacebo treated patients. \n \nFollowing 3 days of treatment, the pooled analysis of the two trials revealed five-fold more tolvaptan \nthan placebo patients achieved normalisation of serum sodium concentrations (49 % vs. 11 %). This \neffect continued as on Day 30, when more tolvaptan than placebo patients still had normal \nconcentrations (60 % vs. 27 %). These responses were seen in patients independent of the underlying \ndisease. The results of self-assessed health status using the SF-12 Health Survey for the mental scores \nshowed statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements for tolvaptan treatment compared \nto placebo. \n \nData on the long-term safety and efficacy of tolvaptan were assessed for up to 106 weeks in a clinical \ntrial in patients (any aetiology) who had previously completed one of the pivotal hyponatremia trials. \nA total of 111 patients started tolvaptan treatment in an open-label, extension trial, regardless of their \nprevious randomisation. Improvements in serum sodium levels were observed as early as the first day \nafter dosing and continued for on-treatment assessments up to Week 106. When treatment was \ndiscontinued, serum sodium concentrations decreased to approximately baseline values, despite the \nreinstatement of standard care therapy. \n \nIn a pilot, randomized (1:1:1), double-blind trial in 30 patients with hyponatremia secondary to \nSIADH, the pharmacodynamics of tolvaptan following single doses of 3.75, 7.5 and 15 mg were \nassessed. Results were highly variable with large overlap between dose groups; changes were not \nsignificantly correlated with tolvaptan exposure. Mean maximal changes in serum sodium were \nhighest following the 15 mg dose (7.9 mmol/L) but median maximal changes were highest for the \n7.5 mg dose (6.0 mmol/L). Individual maximal increases in serum sodium were negatively correlated \nwith fluid balance; mean change in fluid balance showed a dose dependent decrease. Mean change \nfrom baseline in cumulative urine volume and urine excretion rates was 2-fold higher for the 15 mg \ndose compared to the 7.5 and 3.75 mg doses, which showed similar responses. \n \nHeart failure \nEVEREST (Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study with Tolvaptan) \nwas a long-term outcome, double-blind, controlled clinical trial in patients hospitalised with worsening \nHF and signs and symptoms of volume overload. In the long-term outcome trial, a total of \n2,072 patients received 30 mg tolvaptan with standard of care (SC) and 2,061 received placebo with \nSC. The primary objective of the study was to compare the effects of tolvaptan + SC with placebo + \nSC on the time to all-cause mortality and on the time to first occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) \nmortality or hospitalisation for HF. Tolvaptan treatment had no statistically significant favourable or \n\n\n\n11 \n\nunfavourable effects on overall survival or the combined endpoint of CV mortality or HF \nhospitalisation, and did not provide convincing evidence for clinically relevant benefit. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSamsca in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of dilutional hyponatremia \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration, tolvaptan is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring \nabout 2 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan is about 56 %. Co-administration \nof a 60 mg dose with a high-fat meal increases peak concentrations 1.4 fold with no change in AUC \nand no change in urine output. Following single oral doses of ≥ 300 mg, peak plasma concentrations \nappear to plateau, possibly due to saturation of absorption. \n \nDistribution \n \nTolvaptan binds reversibly (98 %) to plasma proteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTolvaptan is extensively metabolised by the liver. Less than 1 % of intact active substance is excreted \nunchanged in the urine. \n \nElimination \n \nThe terminal elimination half-life is about 8 hours and steady-state concentrations of tolvaptan are \nobtained after the first dose. \n \nRadio labelled tolvaptan experiments showed that 40 % of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine \nand 59 % was recovered in the faeces where unchanged tolvaptan accounted for 32 % of radioactivity. \nTolvaptan is only a minor component in plasma (3 %). \n \nLinearity \n \nTolvaptan has linear pharmacokinetics for doses of 7.5 to 60 mg. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nAge \nClearance of tolvaptan is not significantly affected by age. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of mildly or moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh classes A and B) on the \npharmacokinetics of tolvaptan was investigated in 87 patients with liver disease of various origins. No \nclinically significant changes have been seen in clearance for doses ranging from 5 to 60 mg. Very \nlimited information is available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with hepatic oedema, AUC of tolvaptan in \nseverely (Child-Pugh class C) and mildly or moderately (Child-Pugh classes A and B) hepatic \nimpaired patients were 3.1 and 2.3 times higher than that in healthy subjects. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn an analysis on population pharmacokinetics for patients with heart failure, tolvaptan concentrations \nof patients with mildly (creatinine clearance [Ccr] 50 to 80 mL/min) or moderately (Ccr 20 to \n\n\n\n12 \n\n50 mL/min) impaired renal function were not significantly different to tolvaptan concentrations in \npatients with normal renal function (Ccr 80 to 150 mL/min). The efficacy and safety of tolvaptan in \nthose with a creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min has not been evaluated and is therefore unknown. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential. \n \nTeratogenicity was noted in rabbits given 1,000 mg/kg/day (up to 15 times the exposure in humans at \nthe 60 mg dose, based on AUC). No teratogenic effects were seen in rabbits at 300 mg/kg/day (up to \n5 times the exposure in humans at the 60 mg dose, based on AUC). \nIn a peri-and post-natal study in rats, delayed ossification and reduced pup bodyweight were seen at \nthe high dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day. \nTwo fertility studies in rats showed effects on the parental generation (decreased food consumption \nand body weight gain, salivation), but tolvaptan did not affect reproductive performance in males and \nthere were no effects on the foetuses. In females, abnormal oestrus cycles were seen in both studies. \nThe no observed adverse effects level (NOAEL) for effects on reproduction in females \n(100 mg/kg/day) was about 8-times the total daily dose of 60 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis. \n \n \n6.

What Samsca is and what it is used for \n \nSamsca, which contains the active substance tolvaptan, belongs to a group of medicines called \nvasopressin antagonists. Vasopressin is a hormone that helps prevent the loss of water from the body \nby reducing urine output. Antagonist means that it prevents vasopressin having its effect on water \nretention. This leads to a reduction in the amount of water in the body by increasing urine production \nand as a result it increases the level or concentration of sodium in your blood. \n \nSamsca is used to treat low serum sodium levels in adults. You have been prescribed this medicine \nbecause you have a lowered sodium level in your blood as a result of a disease called “syndrome of \ninappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion” (SIADH) where the kidneys retain too much water. This \ndisease causes an inappropriate production of the hormone vasopressin which has caused the sodium \nlevels in your blood to get too low (hyponatremia). That can lead to difficulties in concentration and \nmemory, or in keeping your balance. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Samsca \n \nDo not take Samsca \n• if you are allergic to tolvaptan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) or if you are allergic to benzazepine or benzazepine derivatives (e.g. benazepril, \nconivaptan, fenoldopam mesylate or mirtazapine) \n\n• if your kidneys do not work (no urine production) \n• if you have a condition which increases the salt in your blood (“hypernatremia”) \n• if you have a condition which is associated with a very low blood volume \n• if you do not realise when you are thirsty \n• if you are pregnant \n• if you are breast-feeding. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Samsca: \n\n\n\n29 \n\n• if you cannot drink enough water or if you are fluid restricted \n• if you have difficulties in urination or have an enlarged prostate \n• if you suffer from liver disease \n• if you had an allergic reaction in the past to benzazepine, tolvaptan or other benzazepine \n\nderivatives (e.g. benazepril, conivaptan, fenoldopam mesylate or mirtazapine), or to any of the \nother ingredients of this medicine  (listed in section 6). \n\n• if you suffer from a kidney disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease \n(ADPKD) \n\n• if you have diabetes. \n \nDrinking enough water \nSamsca causes water loss because it increases your urine production. This water loss may result in side \neffects such as dry mouth and thirst or even more severe side effects like kidney problems (see \nsection 4). It is therefore important that you have access to water and that you are able to drink \nsufficient amounts when you feel thirsty. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nSamsca is not suitable for children and adolescents (under age 18). \n \nOther medicines and Samsca \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes all medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nThe following medicines may increase the effect of this medicine: \n• ketoconazole (against fungal infections), \n• macrolide antibiotics, \n• diltiazem (treatment for high blood pressure and chest pain), \n• other products which increase the salt in your blood or which contain large amounts of salt. \n \nThe following medicines may lower the effect of this medicine: \n• barbiturates (used to treat epilepsy/seizures and some sleep disorders), \n• rifampicin (against tuberculosis). \n \nThis medicine may increase the effect of the following medicines: \n• digoxin (used for treatment of irregularities of heart beat and heart failure). \n \nThis medicine may lower the effect of the following medicines: \n• desmopressin (used to increase blood clotting factors). \n \nIt may still be alright for you to take these medicines and Samsca together. Your doctor will be able to \ndecide what is suitable for you. \n \nSamsca with food and drink \nAvoid drinking grapefruit juice when taking Samsca. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDo not take this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nAdequate contraceptive measures must be used during use of this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSamsca is unlikely to adversely affect your ability to drive or to operate machinery.

How to take Samsca \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n• Treatment with Samsca will be initiated in hospital. \n• For treatment of your low sodium (hyponatremia), your doctor will start with a dose of 15 mg \n\nand may then increase it to a maximum of 60 mg to achieve the desired level of serum sodium. \nTo monitor the effects of Samsca your doctor will do regular blood tests. To achieve the desired \nlevel of serum sodium your doctor can give in some instances a lower dose of 7.5 mg. \n\n• Swallow the tablet without chewing, with a glass of water. \n• Take the tablets once a day preferably in the morning with or without food. \n \nIf you take more Samsca than you should \nIf you have taken more tablets than your prescribed dose, drink plenty of water and contact your \ndoctor or your local hospital immediately.

If you do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Samsca \nIf you stop taking Samsca this may lead to reoccurrence of your low sodium. Therefore, you should \nonly stop taking Samsca if you notice side effects requiring urgent medical attention (see section 4) or \nif your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
