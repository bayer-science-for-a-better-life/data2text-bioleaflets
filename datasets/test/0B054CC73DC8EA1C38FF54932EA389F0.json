NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nProlia 60 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 60 mg of denosumab in 1 mL of solution (60 mg/mL). \n\n \n\nDenosumab is a human monoclonal IgG2 antibody produced in a mammalian cell line (Chinese \n\nhamster ovary cells) by recombinant DNA technology. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains 47 mg sorbitol in each mL of solution. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection (injection). \n\n \n\nClear, colourless to slightly yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fractures. In \n\npostmenopausal women Prolia significantly reduces the risk of vertebral, non-vertebral and hip \n\nfractures. \n\n \n\nTreatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk \n\nof fractures (see section 5.1). In men with prostate cancer receiving hormone ablation, Prolia \n\nsignificantly reduces the risk of vertebral fractures. \n\n \n\nTreatment of bone loss associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy in adult patients at \n\nincreased risk of fracture (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 60 mg denosumab administered as a single subcutaneous injection once \n\nevery 6 months into the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. \n\n \n\nPatients must be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPatients treated with Prolia should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder card. \n\n \n\nThe optimal total duration of antiresorptive treatment for osteoporosis (including both denosumab and \n\nbisphosphonates) has not been established. The need for continued treatment should be re-evaluated \n\nperiodically based on the benefits and potential risks of denosumab on an individual patient basis, \n\nparticularly after 5 or more years of use (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\nElderly (age \u2265 65) \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4 for \n\nrecommendations relating to monitoring of calcium). \n\n \n\nNo data is available in patients with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy and severe renal \n\nimpairment (GFR < 30 ml/min). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe safety and efficacy of denosumab have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nProlia is not recommended in paediatric patients (age < 18) as the safety and efficacy of Prolia in \n\nthese patients have not been established. Inhibition of RANK/RANK ligand (RANKL) in animal \n\nstudies has been coupled to inhibition of bone growth and lack of tooth eruption (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor subcutaneous use. \n\n \n\nAdministration should be performed by an individual who has been adequately trained in injection \n\ntechniques. \n\n \n\nThe instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nHypocalcaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nCalcium and vitamin D supplementation \n\n \n\nAdequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients. \n\n \n\nPrecautions for use \n\n \n\nHypocalcaemia \n\nIt is important to identify patients at risk for hypocalcaemia. Hypocalcaemia must be corrected by \n\nadequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before initiating therapy. Clinical monitoring of calcium \n\nlevels is recommended before each dose and, in patients predisposed to hypocalcaemia within \n\ntwo weeks after the initial dose. If any patient presents with suspected symptoms of hypocalcaemia \n\nduring treatment (see section 4.8 for symptoms) calcium levels should be measured. Patients should \n\nbe encouraged to report symptoms indicative of hypocalcaemia. \n\n \n\nIn the post-marketing setting, severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia (including fatal cases) has been \n\nreported (see section 4.8), with most cases occurring in the first weeks of initiating therapy, but it can \n\noccur later. \n\n \n\nConcomitant glucocorticoid treatment is an additional risk factor for hypocalcaemia. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nPatients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or receiving dialysis are at \n\ngreater risk of developing hypocalcaemia. The risks of developing hypocalcaemia and accompanying \n\nparathyroid hormone elevations increase with increasing degree of renal impairment. Adequate intake \n\nof calcium, vitamin D and regular monitoring of calcium is especially important in these patients, see \n\nabove. \n\n \n\nSkin infections \n\nPatients receiving denosumab may develop skin infections (predominantly cellulitis) leading to \n\nhospitalisation (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they \n\ndevelop signs or symptoms of cellulitis. \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) \n\nONJ has been reported rarely in patients receiving Prolia for osteoporosis (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nThe start of treatment/new treatment course should be delayed in patients with unhealed open soft \n\ntissue lesions in the mouth. A dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual \n\nbenefit-risk assessment is recommended prior to treatment with denosumab in patients with \n\nconcomitant risk factors. \n\n \n\nThe following risk factors should be considered when evaluating a patient\u2019s risk of developing ONJ: \n\n\u2022 potency of the medicinal product that inhibits bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent \n\ncompounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative \n\ndose of bone resorption therapy. \n\n\u2022 cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. \n\n\u2022 concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to \n\nhead and neck. \n\n\u2022 poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease, \n\ninvasive dental procedures e.g. tooth extractions. \n\n \n\nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, receive routine dental check-ups, \n\nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling or non-healing of \n\nsores or discharge during treatment with denosumab. While on treatment, invasive dental procedures \n\nshould be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to denosumab \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\nThe management plan of the patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration \n\nbetween the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary \n\ninterruption of treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk \n\nfactors are mitigated where possible. \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal \n\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with denosumab. Possible risk factors \n\nfor osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk \n\nfactors such as infection or trauma. The possibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal \n\nshould be considered in patients receiving denosumab who present with ear symptoms including \n\nchronic ear infections. \n\n \n\nAtypical fractures of the femur \n\nAtypical femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving denosumab (see section 4.8). \n\nAtypical femoral fractures may occur with little or no trauma in the subtrochanteric and diaphyseal \n\nregions of the femur. Specific radiographic findings characterise these events. Atypical femoral \n\nfractures have also been reported in patients with certain co-morbid conditions (e.g. vitamin D \n\ndeficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophosphatasia) and with use of certain medicinal products (e.g. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nbisphosphonates, glucocorticoids, proton pump inhibitors). These events have also occurred without \n\nantiresorptive therapy. Similar fractures reported in association with bisphosphonates are often \n\nbilateral; therefore, the contralateral femur should be examined in denosumab-treated patients who \n\nhave sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Discontinuation of denosumab therapy in patients suspected \n\nto have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient based on an \n\nindividual benefit-risk assessment. During denosumab treatment, patients should be advised to report \n\nnew or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Patients presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated \n\nfor an incomplete femoral fracture. \n\n \n\nLong-term antiresorptive treatment \n\nLong-term antiresorptive treatment (including both denosumab and bisphosphonates) may contribute \n\nto an increased risk for adverse outcomes such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur \n\nfractures due to significant suppression of bone remodelling (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nConcomitant treatment with other denosumab-containing medicinal products \n\nPatients being treated with denosumab should not be treated concomitantly with other \n\ndenosumab-containing medicinal products (for prevention of skeletal related events in adults with \n\nbone metastases from solid tumours). \n\n \n\nDry natural rubber \n\nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \n\nmay cause allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nWarnings for excipients \n\nThis medicine contains 47 mg sorbitol in each mL of solution. The additive effect of concomitantly \n\nadministered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) \n\nshould be taken into account. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 60 mg that is to say essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nIn an interaction study, denosumab did not affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, which is \n\nmetabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). This indicates that denosumab should not alter the \n\npharmacokinetics of medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4. \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical data on the co-administration of denosumab and hormone replacement therapy \n\n(oestrogen), however the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction is considered to be low. \n\n \n\nIn postmenopausal women with osteoporosis the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of \n\ndenosumab were not altered by previous alendronate therapy, based on data from a transition study \n\n(alendronate to denosumab). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of denosumab in pregnant women. Studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nProlia is not recommended for use in pregnant women and women of child-bearing potential not using \n\ncontraception. Women should be advised not to become pregnant during and for at least 5 months \n\nafter treatment with Prolia. Any effects of Prolia are likely to be greater during the second and third \n\ntrimesters of pregnancy since monoclonal antibodies are transported across the placenta in a linear \n\nfashion as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether denosumab is excreted in human milk. In genetically engineered mice in which \n\nRANKL has been turned off by gene removal (a \u201cknockout mouse\u201d), studies suggest absence of \n\nRANKL (the target of denosumab see section 5.1) during pregnancy may interfere with maturation of \n\nthe mammary gland leading to impaired lactation post-partum (see section 5.3). A decision on \n\nwhether to abstain from breast-feeding or to abstain from therapy with Prolia should be made, taking \n\ninto account the benefit of breast-feeding to the newborn/infant and the benefit of Prolia therapy to \n\nthe woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo data are available on the effect of denosumab on human fertility. Animal studies do not indicate \n\ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nProlia has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most common side effects with denosumab (seen in more than one patient in ten) are \n\nmusculoskeletal pain and pain in the extremity. Uncommon cases of cellulitis, rare cases of \n\nhypocalcaemia, hypersensitivity, osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.8 - description of selected adverse reactions) have been observed in patients taking \n\ndenosumab. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe data in Table 1 below describe adverse reactions reported from Phase II and III clinical trials in \n\npatients with osteoporosis and breast or prostate cancer patients receiving hormone ablation; and/or \n\nspontaneous reporting. \n\n \n\nThe following convention has been used for the classification of the adverse reactions (see table 1): \n\nvery common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), \n\nrare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data). Within each frequency grouping and system organ class, adverse reactions are \n\npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Declines of serum calcium levels (less than \n\n1.88 mmol/l) were not reported in either the two phase III placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients \n\nreceiving hormone ablation or the phase III placebo-controlled clinical trial in men with osteoporosis. \n\n \n\nIn the post-marketing setting, rare cases of severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia have been reported \n\npredominantly in patients at increased risk of hypocalcaemia receiving denosumab, with most cases \n\noccurring in the first weeks of initiating therapy. Examples of the clinical manifestations of severe \n\nsymptomatic hypocalcaemia have included QT interval prolongation, tetany, seizures and altered \n\nmental status (see section 4.4). Symptoms of hypocalcaemia in denosumab clinical studies included \n\nparaesthesias or muscle stiffness, twitching, spasms and muscle cramps. \n\n \n\nSkin infections \n\nIn phase III placebo-controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of skin infections was similar in \n\nthe placebo and the denosumab groups: in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (placebo [1.2%, \n\n50 out of 4,041] versus Prolia [1.5%, 59 out of 4,050]); in men with osteoporosis (placebo [0.8%, \n\n1 out of 120] versus Prolia [0%, 0 out of 120]); in breast or prostate cancer patients receiving \n\nhormone ablation (placebo [1.7%, 14 out of 845] versus Prolia [1.4%, 12 out of 860]). Skin infections \n\nleading to hospitalisation were reported in 0.1% (3 out of 4,041) of postmenopausal women with \n\nosteoporosis receiving placebo versus 0.4% (16 out of 4,050) of women receiving Prolia. These cases \n\nwere predominantly cellulitis. Skin infections reported as serious adverse reactions were similar in the \n\nplacebo (0.6%, 5 out of 845) and the Prolia (0.6%, 5 out of 860) groups in the breast and prostate \n\ncancer studies. \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \n\nONJ has been reported rarely, in 16 patients, in clinical trials in osteoporosis and in breast or prostate \n\ncancer patients receiving hormone ablation including a total of 23,148 patients (see section 4.4). \n\nThirteen of these ONJ cases occurred in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis during the \n\nphase III clinical trial extension following treatment with denosumab for up to 10 years. Incidence of \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nONJ was 0.04% at 3 years, 0.06% at 5 years and 0.44% at 10 years of denosumab treatment. The risk \n\nof ONJ increased with duration of exposure to denosumab. \n\n \n\nAtypical fractures of the femur \n\nIn the osteoporosis clinical trial program, atypical femoral fractures were reported rarely in patients \n\ntreated with denosumab (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nDiverticulitis \n\nIn a single phase III placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with prostate cancer receiving ADT an \n\nimbalance in diverticulitis adverse events was observed (1.2% denosumab, 0% placebo). The \n\nincidence of diverticulitis was comparable between treatment groups in postmenopausal women or \n\nmen with osteoporosis and in women undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy for non-metastatic \n\nbreast cancer. \n\n \n\nDrug-related hypersensitivity reactions \n\nIn the post-marketing setting, rare events of drug-related hypersensitivity, including rash, urticaria, \n\nfacial swelling, erythema, and anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients receiving Prolia. \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal pain \n\nMusculoskeletal pain, including severe cases, has been reported in patients receiving Prolia in the \n\npost-marketing setting. In clinical trials, musculoskeletal pain was very common in both denosumab \n\nand placebo groups. Musculoskeletal pain leading to discontinuation of study treatment was \n\nuncommon. \n\n \n\nLichenoid drug eruptions \n\nLichenoid drug eruptions (e.g. lichen planus-like reactions) have been reported in patients in the post-\n\nmarketing setting. \n\n \n\nOther special populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn clinical studies, patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or \n\nreceiving dialysis were at greater risk of developing hypocalcaemia in the absence of calcium \n\nsupplementation. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment or receiving dialysis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere is no experience with overdose in clinical studies. Denosumab has been administered in clinical \n\nstudies using doses up to 180 mg every 4 weeks (cumulative doses up to 1,080 mg over 6 months), \n\nand no additional adverse reactions were observed. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases \u2013 Other drugs affecting bone \n\nstructure and mineralisation, ATC code: M05BX04 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nDenosumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG2) that targets and binds with high affinity and \n\nspecificity to RANKL, preventing activation of its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclast \n\nprecursors and osteoclasts. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast \n\nformation, function and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption in cortical and trabecular bone. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nProlia treatment rapidly reduced the rate of bone turnover, reaching a nadir for the bone resorption \n\nmarker serum type 1 C-telopeptides (CTX) (85% reduction) by 3 days, with reductions maintained \n\nover the dosing interval. At the end of each dosing interval, CTX reductions were partially attenuated \n\nfrom maximal reduction of \u2265 87% to approximately \u2265 45% (range 45-80%), reflecting the \n\nreversibility of Prolia\u2019s effects on bone remodelling once serum levels diminish. These effects were \n\nsustained with continued treatment. Bone turnover markers generally reached pre-treatment levels \n\nwithin 9 months after the last dose. Upon re-initiation, reductions in CTX by denosumab were similar \n\nto those observed in patients initiating primary denosumab treatment. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, neutralising antibodies have not been observed for denosumab. Using a sensitive \n\nimmunoassay < 1% of patients treated with denosumab for up to 5 years tested positive for non \n\nneutralising binding antibodies with no evidence of altered pharmacokinetics, toxicity, or clinical \n\nresponse. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis \n\n \n\nEfficacy and safety of denosumab administered once every 6 months for 3 years were investigated in \n\npostmenopausal women (7,808 women aged 60-91 years, of which 23.6% had prevalent vertebral \n\nfractures) with baseline bone mineral density (BMD) T-scores at the lumbar spine or total hip \n\nbetween \u20132.5 and \u20134.0 and a mean absolute 10-year fracture probability of 18.60% (deciles: \n\n7.9-32.4%) for major osteoporotic fracture and 7.22% (deciles: 1.4-14.9%) for hip fracture. Women \n\nwith other diseases or on therapies that may affect bone were excluded from this study. Women \n\nreceived calcium (at least 1,000 mg) and vitamin D (at least 400 IU) supplementation daily. \n\n \n\nEffect on vertebral fractures \n\nProlia significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures at 1, 2 and 3 years (p < 0.0001) (see \n\ntable 2). \n\n \n\nTable 2.

These data \n\nindicate that continued treatment with Prolia is required to maintain the effect of the medicinal \n\nproduct. Re-initiation of Prolia resulted in gains in BMD similar to those when Prolia was first \n\nadministered. \n\n \n\nOpen-label extension study in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis \n\nA total of 4,550 women (2,343 Prolia & 2,207 placebo) who missed no more than one dose of \n\ninvestigational product in the pivotal study described above and completed the month 36 study visit \n\nagreed to enrol in a 7-year, multinational, multicentre, open-label, single-arm extension study to \n\nevaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Prolia. All women in the extension study were to receive \n\nProlia 60 mg every 6 months, as well as daily calcium (at least 1 g) and vitamin D (at least 400 IU). A \n\ntotal of 2,626 subjects (58% of the women included in the extension study i.e. 34% of the women \n\nincluded in the pivotal study) completed the extension study. \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with Prolia for up to 10 years, BMD increased from the pivotal study baseline \n\nby 21.7% at the lumbar spine, 9.2% at the total hip, 9.0% at the femoral neck, 13.0% at the trochanter \n\nand 2.8% at the distal 1/3 radius. The mean lumbar spine BMD T-score at the end of the study was -\n\n1.3 in patients treated for 10 years. \n\n \n\nFracture incidence was evaluated as a safety endpoint but efficacy in fracture prevention cannot be \n\nestimated due to high number of discontinuations and open-label design The cumulative incidence of \n\nnew vertebral and non-vertebral fractures were approximately 6.8% and 13.1% respectively, in \n\npatients who remained on denosumab treatment for 10 years (n = 1,278). Patients who did not \n\ncomplete the study for any reason had higher on-treatment fracture rates. \n\n \n\nThirteen adjudicated cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and two adjudicated cases of atypical \n\nfractures of the femur occurred during the extension study. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety in men with osteoporosis \n\n \n\nEfficacy and safety of Prolia once every 6 months for 1 year were investigated in 242 men aged \n\n31-84 years. Subjects with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were excluded from the study. All men \n\nreceived calcium (at least 1,000 mg) and vitamin D (at least 800 IU) supplementation daily. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine BMD, fracture efficacy was not \n\nevaluated. Prolia significantly increased BMD at all clinical sites measured, relative to placebo at \n\n12 months: 4.8% at lumbar spine, 2.0% at total hip, 2.2% at femoral neck, 2.3% at hip trochanter, and \n\n0.9% at distal 1/3 radius (all p < 0.05). Prolia increased lumbar spine BMD from baseline in 94.7% of \n\nmen at 1 year. Significant increases in BMD at lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck and hip \n\ntrochanter were observed by 6 months (p < 0.0001). \n\n \n\nBone histology in postmenopausal women and men with osteoporosis \n\n \n\nBone histology was evaluated in 62 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or with low bone mass \n\nwho were either na\u00efve to osteoporosis therapies or had transitioned from previous alendronate therapy \n\nfollowing 1-3 years treatment with Prolia. Fifty nine women participated in the bone biopsy sub-study \n\nat month 24 (n = 41) and/or month 84 (n = 22) of the extension study in postmenopausal women with \n\nosteoporosis. Bone histology was also evaluated in 17 men with osteoporosis following 1 year \n\ntreatment with Prolia. Bone biopsy results showed bone of normal architecture and quality with no \n\nevidence of mineralisation defects, woven bone or marrow fibrosis. Histomorphometry findings in the \n\nextension study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis showed that the antiresorptive effects of \n\nProlia, as measured by activation frequency and bone formation rates, were maintained over time. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety in patients with bone loss associated with androgen deprivation \n\n \n\nEfficacy and safety of Prolia once every 6 months for 3 years were investigated in men with \n\nhistologically confirmed non-metastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT (1,468 men aged 48-97 years) \n\nwho were at increased risk of fracture (defined as > 70 years, or < 70 years with a BMD T-score at the \n\nlumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck < -1.0 or a history of an osteoporotic fracture.) All men \n\nreceived calcium (at least 1,000 mg) and vitamin D (at least 400 IU) supplementation daily. \n\n \n\nProlia significantly increased BMD at all clinical sites measured, relative to treatment with placebo at \n\n3 years: 7.9% at the lumbar spine, 5.7% at the total hip, 4.9% at the femoral neck, 6.9% at the hip \n\ntrochanter, 6.9% at the distal 1/3 radius and 4.7% at the total body (all p < 0.0001). In a prospectively \n\nplanned exploratory analysis, significant increases in BMD were observed at the lumbar spine, total \n\nhip, femoral neck and the hip trochanter 1 month after the initial dose. \n\n \n\nProlia demonstrated a significant relative risk reduction of new vertebral fractures: 85% (1.6% \n\nabsolute risk reduction) at 1 year, 69% (2.2% absolute risk reduction) at 2 years and 62% (2.4% \n\nabsolute risk reduction) at 3 years (all p < 0.01). \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety in patients with bone loss associated with adjuvant aromatase inhibitor \n\ntherapy \n\n \n\nEfficacy and safety of Prolia once every 6 months for 2 years were investigated in women with \n\nnon-metastatic breast cancer (252 women aged 35-84 years) and baseline BMD T-scores between \n\n-1.0 to -2.5 at the lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck. All women received calcium (at least \n\n1,000 mg) and vitamin D (at least 400 IU) supplementation daily. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine BMD, fracture efficacy was not \n\nevaluated. Prolia significantly increased BMD at all clinical sites measured, relative to treatment with \n\nplacebo at 2 years: 7.6% at lumbar spine, 4.7% at total hip, 3.6% at femoral neck, 5.9% at hip \n\ntrochanter, 6.1% at distal 1/3 radius and 4.2% at total body (all p < 0.0001). \n\n \n\nTreatment of bone loss associated with systemic glucocorticoid therapy \n\n \n\nEfficacy and safety of Prolia were investigated in 795 patients (70% women and 30% men) aged 20 to \n\n94 years treated with \u2265 7.5 mg daily oral prednisone (or equivalent). \n\n \n\nTwo subpopulations were studied: glucocorticoid-continuing (\u2265 7.5 mg daily prednisone or its \n\nequivalent for \u2265 3 months prior to study enrolment; n = 505) and glucocorticoid-initiating (\u2265 7.5 mg \n\ndaily prednisone or its equivalent for < 3 months prior to study enrolment; n = 290). Patients were \n\nrandomised (1:1) to receive either Prolia 60 mg subcutaneously once every 6 months or oral \n\nrisedronate 5 mg once daily (active control) for 2 years. Patients received calcium (at least 1,000 mg) \n\nand vitamin D (at least 800 IU) supplementation daily. \n\n \n\nEffect on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) \n\nIn the glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation, Prolia demonstrated a greater increase in lumbar \n\nspine BMD compared to risedronate at 1 year (Prolia 3.6%, risedronate 2.0%; p < 0.001) and 2 years \n\n(Prolia 4.5%, risedronate 2.2%; p < 0.001). In the glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation, Prolia \n\ndemonstrated a greater increase in lumbar spine BMD compared to risedronate at 1 year (Prolia 3.1%, \n\nrisedronate 0.8%; p < 0.001) and 2 years (Prolia 4.6%, risedronate 1.5%; p < 0.001) \n\n \n\nIn addition, Prolia demonstrated a significantly greater mean percent increase in BMD from baseline \n\ncompared to risedronate at the total hip, femoral neck, and hip trochanter. \n\n \n\nThe study was not powered to show a difference in fractures. At 1 year, the subject incidence of new \n\nradiological vertebral fracture was 2.7% (denosumab) versus 3.2% (risedronate). The subject \n\nincidence of non-vertebral fracture was 4.3% (denosumab) versus 2.5% (risedronate). At 2 years, the \n\ncorresponding numbers were 4.1% versus 5.8% for new radiological vertebral fractures and 5.3% \n\nversus 3.8% for non-vertebral fractures. Most of the fractures occurred in the GC-C subpopulation. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nProlia in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of bone loss associated with sex \n\nhormone ablative therapy, and in subsets of the paediatric population below the age of 2 in the \n\ntreatment of osteoporosis. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration of a 1.0 mg/kg dose, which approximates the approved 60 mg \n\ndose, exposure based on AUC was 78% as compared to intravenous administration at the same dose \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nlevel. For a 60 mg subcutaneous dose, maximum serum denosumab concentrations (Cmax) of \n\n6 mcg/mL (range 1-17 \u03bcg/mL) occurred in 10 days (range 2-28 days). \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nDenosumab is composed solely of amino acids and carbohydrates as native immunoglobulin and is \n\nunlikely to be eliminated via hepatic metabolic mechanisms. Its metabolism and elimination are \n\nexpected to follow the immunoglobulin clearance pathways, resulting in degradation to small peptides \n\nand individual amino acids. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nAfter Cmax, serum levels declined with a half-life of 26 days (range 6-52 days) over a period of \n\n3 months (range 1.5-4.5 months). Fifty-three percent (53%) of patients had no measurable amounts of \n\ndenosumab detected at 6 months post-dose. \n\n \n\nNo accumulation or change in denosumab pharmacokinetics with time was observed upon \n\nsubcutaneous multiple-dosing of 60 mg once every 6 months. Denosumab pharmacokinetics were not \n\naffected by the formation of binding antibodies to denosumab and were similar in men and women. \n\nAge (28-87 years), race and disease state (low bone mass or osteoporosis; prostate or breast cancer) \n\ndo not appear to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of denosumab. \n\n \n\nA trend was observed between higher body weight and lower exposure based on AUC and Cmax. \n\nHowever, the trend is not considered clinically important, since pharmacodynamic effects based on \n\nbone turnover markers and BMD increases were consistent across a wide range of body weight. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nIn dose ranging studies, denosumab exhibited non-linear, dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, with \n\nlower clearance at higher doses or concentrations, but approximately dose-proportional increases in \n\nexposures for doses of 60 mg and greater. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nIn a study of 55 patients with varying degrees of renal function, including patients on dialysis, the \n\ndegree of renal impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of denosumab. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nNo specific study in patients with hepatic impairment was performed. In general, monoclonal \n\nantibodies are not eliminated via hepatic metabolic mechanisms. The pharmacokinetics of denosumab \n\nis not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic profile in paediatric populations has not been assessed. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nIn single and repeated dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, denosumab doses resulting \n\nin 100 to 150 times greater systemic exposure than the recommended human dose had no impact on \n\ncardiovascular physiology, male or female fertility, or produced specific target organ toxicity. \n\n \n\nStandard tests to investigate the genotoxicity potential of denosumab have not been evaluated, since \n\nsuch tests are not relevant for this molecule. However, due to its character it is unlikely that \n\ndenosumab has any potential for genotoxicity. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe carcinogenic potential of denosumab has not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n\n \n\nIn preclinical studies conducted in knockout mice lacking RANK or RANKL, impairment of lymph \n\nnode formation was observed in the foetus. An absence of lactation due to inhibition of mammary \n\ngland maturation (lobulo-alveolar gland development during pregnancy) was also observed in \n\nknockout mice lacking RANK or RANKL. \n\n \n\nIn a study of cynomolgus monkeys dosed with denosumab during the period equivalent to the first \n\ntrimester at AUC exposures up to 99-fold higher than the human dose (60 mg every 6 months), there \n\nwas no evidence of maternal or foetal harm. In this study, foetal lymph nodes were not examined. \n\n \n\nIn another study of cynomolgus monkeys dosed with denosumab throughout pregnancy at AUC \n\nexposures 119-fold higher than the human dose (60 mg every 6 months), there were increased \n\nstillbirths and postnatal mortality; abnormal bone growth resulting in reduced bone strength, reduced \n\nhaematopoiesis, and tooth malalignment; absence of peripheral lymph nodes; and decreased neonatal \n\ngrowth. A no observed adverse effect level for reproductive effects was not established. Following a \n\n6 month period after birth, bone related changes showed recovery and there was no effect on tooth \n\neruption. However, the effects on lymph nodes and tooth malalignment persisted, and minimal to \n\nmoderate mineralisation in multiple tissues was seen in one animal (relation to treatment uncertain). \n\nThere was no evidence of maternal harm prior to labour; adverse maternal effects occurred \n\ninfrequently during labour. Maternal mammary gland development was normal. \n\n \n\nIn preclinical bone quality studies in monkeys on long-term denosumab treatment, decreases in bone \n\nturnover were associated with improvement in bone strength and normal bone histology. Calcium \n\nlevels were transiently decreased and parathyroid hormone levels transiently increased in \n\novariectomised monkeys treated with denosumab. \n\n \n\nIn male mice genetically engineered to express huRANKL (knock-in mice), which were subjected to a \n\ntranscortical fracture, denosumab delayed the removal of cartilage and remodelling of the fracture \n\ncallus compared to control, but biomechanical strength was not adversely affected. \n\n \n\nKnockout mice (see section 4.6) lacking RANK or RANKL exhibited decreased body weight, reduced \n\nbone growth and lack of tooth eruption. In neonatal rats, inhibition of RANKL (target of denosumab \n\ntherapy) with high doses of a construct of osteoprotegerin bound to Fc (OPG-Fc) was associated with \n\ninhibition of bone growth and tooth eruption. These changes were partially reversible in this model \n\nwhen dosing with RANKL inhibitors was discontinued. Adolescent primates dosed with denosumab \n\nat 27 and 150 times (10 and 50 mg/kg dose) the clinical exposure had abnormal growth plates. \n\nTherefore, treatment with denosumab may impair bone growth in children with open growth plates \n\nand may inhibit eruption of dentition. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nProlia 60 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n\ndenosumab \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n- Your doctor will give you a patient reminder card, which contains important safety information \n\nyou need to be aware of before and during your treatment with Prolia. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Prolia is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Prolia \n\n3. How to use Prolia \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Prolia \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Prolia is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Prolia is and how it works \n\n \n\nProlia contains denosumab, a protein (monoclonal antibody) that interferes with the action of another \n\nprotein, in order to treat bone loss and osteoporosis. Treatment with Prolia makes bone stronger and \n\nless likely to break. \n\n \n\nBone is a living tissue and is renewed all the time. Oestrogen helps keep bones healthy. After the \n\nmenopause, oestrogen level drops which may cause bones to become thin and fragile. This can \n\neventually lead to a condition called osteoporosis. Osteoporosis can also occur in men due to a \n\nnumber of causes including ageing and/or a low level of the male hormone, testosterone. It can also \n\noccur in patients receiving glucocorticoids. Many patients with osteoporosis have no symptoms, but \n\nthey are still at risk of breaking bones, especially in the spine, hips and wrists. \n\n \n\nSurgery or medicines that stop the production of oestrogen or testosterone used to treat patients with \n\nbreast or prostate cancer can also lead to bone loss. The bones become weaker and break more easily. \n\n \n\nWhat Prolia is used for \n\n \n\nProlia is used to treat: \n\n\u2022 osteoporosis in women after the menopause (postmenopausal) and men who have an increased \n\nrisk of fracture (broken bones), reducing the risk of spinal, non-spinal and hip fractures. \n\n\u2022 bone loss that results from a reduction in hormone (testosterone) level caused by surgery or \n\ntreatment with medicines in patients with prostate cancer. \n\n\u2022 bone loss that results from long-term treatment with glucocorticoids in patients who have an \n\nincreased risk of fracture. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Prolia \n\n \n\nDo not use Prolia \n\n \n\n\u2022 if you have low calcium levels in the blood (hypocalcaemia). \n\n\u2022 if you are allergic to denosumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Prolia \n\n \n\nWhilst being treated with Prolia you may develop a skin infection with symptoms such as a swollen, \n\nred area of skin, most commonly in the lower leg, that feels hot and tender (cellulitis), and possibly \n\nwith symptoms of fever. Please tell your doctor immediately if you develop any of these symptoms. \n\n \n\nPlease tell your doctor if you have an allergy to latex (the needle cover on the pre-filled syringe \n\ncontains a derivative of latex). \n\n \n\nYou should also take calcium and vitamin D supplements while being on treatment with Prolia. Your \n\ndoctor will discuss this with you. \n\n \n\nYou may have low levels of calcium in your blood while receiving Prolia. Please tell your doctor \n\nimmediately if you notice any of the following symptoms: spasms, twitches, or cramps in your \n\nmuscle, and/or numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth, and/or seizures, \n\nconfusion, or loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had severe kidney problems, kidney failure or have needed \n\ndialysis or are taking medicines called glucocorticoids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone), \n\nwhich may increase your risk of getting low blood calcium if you do not take calcium supplements. \n\n \n\nProblems with your mouth, teeth or jaw \n\nA side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported rarely \n\n(may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) in patients receiving Prolia for osteoporosis. The risk of ONJ \n\nincreases in patients treated for a long time (may affect up to 1 in 200 people if treated for 10 years). \n\nONJ can also occur after stopping treatment. It is important to try to prevent ONJ developing as it \n\nmay be a painful condition that can be difficult to treat. In order to reduce the risk of developing ONJ, \n\ntake the following precautions: \n\n \n\nBefore receiving treatment, tell your doctor or nurse (health care professional) if you: \n\n \n\n\u2022 have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a \n\nplanned tooth extraction. \n\n\u2022 don\u2019t receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check-up for a long time. \n\n\u2022 are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems). \n\n\u2022 have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone disorders). \n\n\u2022 are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone). \n\n\u2022 have cancer. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before you start treatment with Prolia. \n\n \n\nWhile being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene and receive routine dental check-ups. If \n\nyou wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. If you are under dental treatment or will \n\nundergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and \n\ntell your dentist that you are being treated with Prolia. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\nContact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth \n\nsuch as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of \n\nONJ. \n\n \n\nUnusual thigh bone fractures \n\nSome people have developed unusual fractures in their thigh bone while being treated with Prolia. \n\nContact your doctor if you experience new or unusual pain in your hip, groin, or thigh. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n\nProlia is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. The use of Prolia in \n\nchildren and adolescents has not been studied. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Prolia \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. It is especially important that you tell your doctor if you are being treated with another \n\nmedicine containing denosumab. \n\n \n\nYou should not take Prolia together with another medicine containing denosumab. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nProlia has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant; \n\nthink you may be pregnant; or plan to get pregnant. Prolia is not recommended for use if you are \n\npregnant. Women of child-bearing potential should use effective methods of contraception while \n\nbeing treated with Prolia and for at least 5 months after stopping treatment with Prolia. \n\n \n\nIf you become pregnant during treatment with Prolia or less than 5 months after stopping treatment \n\nwith Prolia, please inform your doctor. \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether Prolia is excreted in breast milk. It is important to tell your doctor if you are \n\nbreast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, \n\nor whether to stop taking Prolia, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit \n\nof Prolia to the mother. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding during Prolia treatment, please inform your doctor. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nProlia has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nProlia contains sorbitol \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains 47 mg sorbitol in each mL of solution. \n\n \n\nProlia contains sodium \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 60 mg, that is to say essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n3. How to use Prolia \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is one pre-filled syringe of 60 mg administered once \n\nevery 6 months, as a single injection under the skin (subcutaneous). The best \n\nplaces to inject are the top of your thighs and the abdomen. Your carer can \n\nalso use the outer area of your upper arm. Each pack of Prolia contains a \n\nreminder card with stickers that can be removed from the carton. Use the \n\npeel-off stickers to mark the next injection date on your personal calendar \n\nand/or the reminder card to keep a record of the next injection date. \n\n \n\n \n\nYou should also take calcium and vitamin D supplements while being on treatment with Prolia. Your \n\ndoctor will discuss this with you. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may decide that it is best for you or a carer to inject Prolia. Your doctor or healthcare \n\nprovider will show you or your carer how to use Prolia. For instructions on how to inject Prolia, \n\nplease read the section at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nDo not shake. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Prolia \n\n \n\nIf a dose of Prolia is missed, the injection should be administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, \n\ninjections should be scheduled every 6 months from the date of the last injection. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Prolia \n\n \n\nTo get the most benefit from your treatment, it is important to use Prolia for as long as your doctor \n\nprescribes it for you. Please talk to your doctor before you consider stopping the treatment. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nUncommonly, patients receiving Prolia may develop skin infections (predominantly cellulitis). Please \n\ntell your doctor immediately if you develop any of these symptoms while being on treatment with \n\nProlia: swollen, red area of skin, most commonly in the lower leg, that feels hot and tender, and \n\npossibly with symptoms of fever. \n\n \n\nRarely, patients receiving Prolia may develop pain in the mouth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing \n\nof sores in the mouth or jaw, discharge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of \n\na tooth. These could be signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and \n\ndentist immediately if you experience such symptoms while being treated with Prolia or after \n\nstopping treatment. \n\n \n\nRarely, patients receiving Prolia may have low calcium levels in the blood (hypocalcaemia). \n\nSymptoms include spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles, and/or numbness or tingling in your \n\nfingers, toes or around your mouth and/or seizures, confusion, or loss of consciousness. If any of these \n\napply to you, tell your doctor immediately. Low calcium in the blood may also lead to a change in \n\nheart rhythm called QT prolongation which is seen by electrocardiogram (ECG). \n\n \n\nRarely unusual fractures of the thigh bone may occur in patients receiving Prolia. Contact your \n\ndoctor if you experience new or unusual pain in your hip, groin or thigh as this may be an early \n\nindication of a possible fracture of the thigh bone. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\nRarely, allergic reactions may occur in patients receiving Prolia. Symptoms include swelling of the \n\nface, lips, tongue, throat or other parts of the body; rash, itching or hives on the skin, wheezing or \n\ndifficulty breathing. Please tell your doctor if you develop any of these symptoms while being \n\ntreated with Prolia. \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n \n\n\u2022 bone, joint, and/or muscle pain which is sometimes severe, \n\n\u2022 arm or leg pain (pain in extremity). \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n \n\n\u2022 painful urination, frequent urination, blood in the urine, inability to hold your urine, \n\n\u2022 upper respiratory tract infection, \n\n\u2022 pain, tingling or numbness that moves down your leg (sciatica), \n\n\u2022 constipation, \n\n\u2022 abdominal discomfort, \n\n\u2022 rash, \n\n\u2022 skin condition with itching, redness and/or dryness (eczema), \n\n\u2022 hair loss (alopecia). \n\n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\n \n\n\u2022 fever, vomiting and abdominal pain or discomfort (diverticulitis), \n\n\u2022 ear infection, \n\n\u2022 rash that may occur on the skin or sores in the mouth (lichenoid drug eruptions). \n\n \n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n\n \n\n\u2022 Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear and/or an ear infection. These \n\ncould be signs of bone damage in the ear. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V.

Use a new pre-filled \n\nsyringe and call your doctor or healthcare provider. \n\n Do not attempt to activate the pre-filled syringe prior to injection. \n\n Do not attempt to remove the clear pre-filled syringe safety guard from the pre-filled syringe. \n\nCall your doctor or healthcare provider if you have any questions. \n\n \n\nStep 1: Prepare \n\nA Remove the pre-filled syringe tray from the package and gather the supplies needed for your \n\ninjection: alcohol wipes, a cotton ball or gauze pad, a plaster and a sharps disposal container \n\n(not included). \n\nFor a more comfortable injection, leave the pre-filled syringe at room temperature for about \n\n30 minutes before injecting. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\n \n\nOn a clean, well-lit work surface, place the new pre-filled syringe and the other supplies. \n\n Do not try to warm the syringe by using a heat source such as hot water or microwave. \n\n Do not leave the pre-filled syringe exposed to direct sunlight. \n\n Do not shake the pre-filled syringe. \n\n\u2022  Keep the pre-filled syringe out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nB Open the tray, peeling away the cover. Grab the pre-filled syringe safety guard to remove the \n\npre-filled syringe from the tray. \n\n \n\nGrab here \n\nFor safety reasons: \n\n Do not grasp the plunger. \n\n Do not grasp the grey needle cap. \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nC Inspect the medicine and pre-filled syringe. \n\n Medicine \n\n \n\n Do not use the pre-filled syringe if: \n\n\u2022 The medicine is cloudy or there are particles in it. It must be a clear, colourless to slightly \n\nyellow solution. \n\n\u2022 Any part appears cracked or broken. \n\n\u2022 The grey needle cap is missing or not securely attached. \n\n\u2022 The expiry date printed on the label has passed the last day of the month shown. \n\nIn all cases, call your doctor or healthcare provider. \n\n \n\nStep 2: Get ready \n\nA Wash your hands thoroughly. Prepare and clean your injection site. \n\nYou can use: \n\n \n\nUpper arm \n\n \n \n\nBelly \n\nUpper thigh \n\n\u2022 Upper part of your thigh. \n\n\u2022 Belly, except for a 5 cm (2-inch) area right around your belly button. \n\n\u2022 Outer area of upper arm (only if someone else is giving you the injection). \n\nClean the injection site with an alcohol wipe. Let your skin dry. \n\n Do not touch the injection site before injecting. \n\n Do not\n inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid injecting into \n\nareas with scars or stretch marks. \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nB Carefully pull the grey needle cap straight out and away from your body. \n\n \n\n \n\nC Pinch your injection site to create a firm surface. \n\n \n\n It is important to keep the skin pinched when injecting. \n\n \n\nStep 3: Inject \n\nA Hold the pinch. INSERT the needle into skin. \n\n \n\n Do not touch the cleaned area of the skin. \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nB PUSH the plunger with slow and constant pressure until you feel or hear a \u201csnap\u201d. Push all \n\nthe way down through the snap. \n\n \n\n \n\u201cSNAP\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n It is important to push down through the \u201csnap\u201d to deliver your full dose. \n\n \n\nC RELEASE your thumb. Then LIFT the syringe off skin. \n\n \n\nAfter releasing the plunger, the pre-filled syringe safety guard will safely cover the injection needle. \n\n Do not put the grey needle cap back on used pre-filled syringes. \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nStep 4: Finish \n\nA Discard the used pre-filled syringe and other supplies in a sharps disposal container. \n\n \n\nMedicines should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n\n \n\nKeep the syringe and sharps disposal container out of sight and reach of children. \n\n Do not reuse the pre-filled syringe. \n\n Do not recycle pre-filled syringes or throw them into household waste. \n\n \n\nB Examine the injection site. \n\nIf there is blood, press a cotton ball or gauze pad on your injection site. Do not rub the injection site. \n\nApply a plaster if needed. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\nInstructions for injecting with the Prolia pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\nThis section contains information on how to use the Prolia pre-filled syringe. It is important that \n\nyou or your carer do not give the injection unless training from your doctor or healthcare \n\nprovider has been received. Always wash your hands before every injection. If you have questions \n\nabout how to inject, please ask your doctor or healthcare provider for assistance. \n\n \n\nBefore you begin \n\n \n\nRead all instructions thoroughly before using the pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n\nDO NOT use the pre-filled syringe if the needle cover has been removed. \n\n \n\nHow do you use the Prolia pre-filled syringe? \n\n \n\nYour doctor has prescribed a Prolia pre-filled syringe for injection into the tissue just under the skin \n\n(subcutaneous). You must inject the entire content (1 mL) of the Prolia pre-filled syringe and it should \n\nbe injected once every 6 months as instructed by your doctor. \n\n \n\nEquipment: \n\n \n\nTo give an injection, you will need: \n\n \n\n1. A new Prolia pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\n2. Alcohol wipes or similar. \n\n \n\nWhat to do before you give a subcutaneous injection of Prolia \n\n \n\n1. Remove the pre-filled syringe from the refrigerator. \n\nDO NOT pick up the pre-filled syringe by the plunger or needle cover. This could damage the \n\ndevice. \n\n \n\n2. The pre-filled syringe may be left outside the refrigerator to reach room temperature. This will \n\nmake the injection more comfortable. \n\nDO NOT warm it in any other way, for example, in a microwave or in hot water. \n\nDO NOT leave the syringe exposed to direct sunlight. \n\n \n\n3. DO NOT shake the pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n\n4. DO NOT remove the needle cover from the pre-filled syringe until you are ready to inject. \n\n \n\n5. Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). \n\nDO NOT use it if the date has passed the last day of the month shown. \n\n \n\n6. Check the appearance of Prolia. It must be a clear, colourless to slightly yellow solution. The \n\nsolution should not be injected if it contains particles or if it is discoloured or cloudy. \n\n \n\n7. Find a comfortable, well-lit, clean surface and put all the equipment within reach. \n\n \n\n8. Wash your hands thoroughly. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nWhere should you give the injection? \n\nThe best places to inject are the top of your thighs and the \n\nabdomen. \n\nYour carer can also use the outer area of your upper arms. \n\n \n\n \n\nHow do you give the injection? \n\n \n\n1. Disinfect the skin by using an alcohol wipe. \n\n \n\n2. To avoid bending the needle, gently pull the cover \n\nfrom the needle straight off without twisting, as \n\nshown in pictures 1 and 2. \n\nDO NOT touch the needle or push the plunger. \n\n \n\n3. You may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled \n\nsyringe. You do not have to remove the air bubble \n\nbefore injecting. Injecting the solution with the air \n\nbubble is harmless. \n\n \n\n4. Pinch (without squeezing) the skin between your \n\nthumb and forefinger. Put the needle fully into the \n\nskin as shown by your doctor or healthcare provider. \n\n \n\n5. Push the plunger with a slow constant pressure, always keeping the skin pinched. Push the \n\nplunger all the way down as far as it will go to inject all the solution. \n\n \n\n6. Remove the needle and let go of the skin. \n\n \n\n7. If you notice a spot of blood you may gently dab it away with a cotton ball or tissue. Do not rub \n\nthe injection site. If needed, you may cover the injection site with a plaster. \n\n \n\n8. Only use each pre-filled syringe for one injection. DO NOT use any Prolia that is left in the \n\nsyringe. \n\n \n\nRemember: if you have any problems, please ask your doctor or healthcare provider for help and \n\nadvice. \n\n \n\nDisposing of used syringes \n\n \n\n\u2022 DO NOT put the cover back on used needles. \n\n\u2022 Keep used syringes out of the reach and sight of children. \n\n\u2022 The used syringe should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. Ask your \n\npharmacist how to dispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect \n\nthe environment. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

that interferes with the action of another protein, in order to treat bone loss and osteoporosis. treatment with prolia makes bone stronger and less likely to break. bone is a living tissue and is renewed all the time. oestrogen helps keep bones healthy. after the menopause, oestrogen level drops which may cause bones to become thin and fragile. this can eventually lead to a condition called osteoporosis. osteoporosis can also occur in men due to a number of causes including ageing and/or a low level of the male hormone, testosterone. it can also occur in patients receiving glucocorticoids. many patients with osteoporosis have no symptoms, but they are still at risk of breaking bones, especially in the spine, hips and wrists. surgery or medicines that stop the production of oestrogen or testosterone used to treat patients with breast or prostate cancer can also lead to bone loss. the bones become weaker and break more easily. what prolia is used for prolia is used to treat: osteoporosis in women after the menopause (postmenopausal) and men who have an increased risk of fracture (broken bones), reducing the risk of spinal, non-spinal and hip fractures. bone loss that results from a reduction in hormone (testosterone) level caused by surgery or treatment with medicines in patients with prostate cancer. bone loss that results from long-term treatment with

to know before you use prolia", "Section_Content": "do not use prolia if you have low calcium levels in the blood (hypocalcaemia). if you are allergic to denosumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using prolia whilst being treated with prolia you may develop a skin infection with symptoms such as a swollen, red area of skin, most commonly in the lower leg, that feels hot and tender (cellulitis), and possibly with symptoms of fever. please tell your doctor immediately if you develop any of these symptoms. please tell your doctor if you have an allergy to latex (the needle cover on the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of latex). you should also take calcium and vitamin d supplements while being on treatment with prolia. your doctor will discuss this with you. you may have low levels of calcium in your blood while receiving prolia. please tell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following symptoms: spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscle, and/or numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth, and/or seizures, confusion, or loss of consciousness. tell your doctor if you have or have ever had severe kidney problems, kidney failure or have needed dialysis or are taking medicines called glucocorticoids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone), which may increase your risk of getting low blood calcium if you do not take calcium supplements. problems with your mouth, teeth or jaw a side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (onj) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported rarely (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) in patients receiving prolia for osteoporosis. the risk of onj increases in patients treated for a long time (may affect up to 1 in 200 people if treated for 10 years). onj can also occur after stopping treatment. it is important to try to prevent onj developing as it may be a painful condition that can be difficult to treat. in order to reduce the risk of developing onj, take the following precautions: before receiving treatment, tell your doctor or nurse (health care professional) if you: have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a planned tooth extraction. don't receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check-up for a long time. are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems). have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone disorders). are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone). have cancer. your doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before you start treatment with prolia. while being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene and receive routine dental check-ups. if you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. if you are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with prolia. contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of onj. unusual thigh bone fractures some people have developed unusual fractures in their thigh bone while being treated with prolia. contact your doctor if you experience new or unusual pain in your hip, groin, or thigh. children and adolescents prolia is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. the use of prolia in children and adolescents has not been studied. other medicines and prolia tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. it is especially important that you tell your doctor if you are being treated with another medicine containing denosumab. you should not take prolia together with another medicine containing denosumab. pregnancy and breast-feeding prolia has not been tested in pregnant women. it is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant; think you may be pregnant; or plan to get pregnant. prolia is not recommended for use if you are pregnant. women of child-bearing potential should use effective methods of contraception while being treated with prolia and for at least 5 months after stopping treatment with prolia. if you become pregnant during treatment with prolia or less than 5 months after stopping treatment with prolia, please inform your doctor. it is not known whether prolia is excreted in breast milk. it is important to tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking prolia, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of prolia to the mother. if you are breast-feeding during prolia treatment, please inform your doctor. ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. driving and using machines prolia has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. prolia contains sorbitol this medicine contains 47 mg sorbitol in each ml of solution. prolia contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 60 mg, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "prolia", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 17, "BeginOffset": 11, "EndOffset": 17, "Score":

rarely, patients receiving prolia may develop pain in the mouth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing of sores in the mouth or jaw, discharge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. these could be signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience such symptoms while being treated with prolia or after stopping treatment. rarely, patients receiving prolia may have low calcium levels in the blood (hypocalcaemia). symptoms include spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles, and/or numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth and/or seizures, confusion, or loss of consciousness. if any of these apply to you, tell your doctor immediately. low calcium in the blood may also lead to a change in heart rhythm called qt prolongation which is seen by electrocardiogram (ecg). rarely unusual fractures of the thigh bone may occur in patients receiving prolia. contact your doctor if you experience new or unusual pain in your hip, groin or thigh as this may be an early indication of a possible fracture of the thigh bone. rarely, allergic reactions may occur in patients receiving prolia. symptoms include swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat or other parts of the body; rash, itching or hives on the skin, wheezing or difficulty breathing. please tell your doctor if you develop any of these symptoms while being treated with prolia. very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): bone, joint, and/or muscle pain which is sometimes severe, arm or leg pain (pain in extremity). common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): painful urination, frequent urination, blood in the urine, inability to hold your urine, upper respiratory tract infection, pain, tingling or numbness that moves down your leg (sciatica), constipation, abdominal discomfort, rash, skin condition with itching, redness and/or dryness (eczema), hair loss (alopecia). uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): fever, vomiting and abdominal pain or discomfort (diverticulitis), ear infection, rash that may occur on the skin or sores in the mouth (lichenoid drug eruptions). not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear and/or an ear infection. these could be signs of bone damage in the ear. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can
