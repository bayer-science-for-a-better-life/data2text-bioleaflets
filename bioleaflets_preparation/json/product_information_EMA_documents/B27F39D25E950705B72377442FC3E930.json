NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nZALTRAP 25 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion  \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nOne ml of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 25 mg aflibercept*. \n\n \n\nOne vial of 4 ml of concentrate contains 100 mg of aflibercept. \n\nOne vial of 8 ml of concentrate contains 200 mg of aflibercept. \n\n \n\n* Aflibercept is produced in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K-1 mammalian expression system by \n\nrecombinant DNA technology. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n\nThe concentrate is a clear colourless to pale yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nZALTRAP in combination with irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (FOLFIRI) chemotherapy is \n\nindicated in adults with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) that is resistant to or has progressed after \n\nan oxaliplatin-containing regimen. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nZALTRAP should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of \n\nantineoplastic medicinal products. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of ZALTRAP, administered as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour, is \n\n4 mg / kg of body weight, followed by the FOLFIRI regimen. This is considered as one treatment \n\ncycle. \n\n \n\nThe FOLFIRI regimen to be used is irinotecan 180 mg/m2 intravenous infusion over 90 minutes and \n\nfolinic acid (dl racemic) 400 mg/m² intravenous infusion over 2 hours at the same time on day 1 using \n\na Y-line, followed by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 400 mg / m² intravenous bolus, followed by 5-FU \n\n2400 mg / m² continuous intravenous infusion over 46 hours.   \n\n \n\nThe treatment cycle is repeated every 2 weeks.  \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nZALTRAP treatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.  \n\n \n\nDose modification \n\nZALTRAP should be discontinued for (see section 4.4):  \n\n• Severe haemorrhage  \n\n• Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation  \n\n• Fistula formation  \n\n• Hypertension that is not adequately controlled with anti-hypertensive therapy or occurrence of \n\nhypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy  \n\n• Cardiac failure and ejection fraction decreased \n\n• Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) \n\n• Grade 4 venous thromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism)  \n\n• Nephrotic syndrome or thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)  \n\n• Severe hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, dyspnoea, angioedema, and \n\nanaphylaxis) (see sections 4.3 and 4.4) \n\n• Compromised wound healing requiring medical intervention  \n\n• Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (also known as reversible posterior \n\nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS)) \n\n \n\nZALTRAP should be temporarily suspended for at least 4 weeks prior to elective surgery (see section \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nZALTRAP/FOLFIRI Treatment delay or dose modification \n\nNeutropenia or thrombocytopenia \n\n(see sections 4.4 and 4.8) \n\nAdministration of ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI should be delayed \n\nuntil neutrophil count is 1.5 x 109/L or platelet count is \n\n 75 x 109 /L. \n\nFebrile neutropenia or neutropenic \n\nsepsis \n\nIrinotecan dose should be reduced by 15-20 % in subsequent \n\ncycles.  \n\n \n\nIf recurrence, 5-FU bolus and infusion doses should \n\nadditionally be reduced by 20 % in subsequent cycles.  \n\n \n\nIf recurrence after irinotecan and 5-FU dose reductions, \n\nreduction of ZALTRAP dose to 2 mg/kg could be \n\nconsidered. \n\n \n\nThe use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) \n\nmay be considered. \n\nMild to moderate hypersensitivity \n\nreactions to ZALTRAP (including \n\nflushing, rash, urticaria, and pruritus) \n\n(see section 4.4) \n\nThe infusion should be temporarily suspended until the \n\nreaction resolves. Treatment with corticosteroids and/or \n\nantihistamines can be used as clinically indicated.   \n\n \n\nPre-treatment with corticosteroids and/or antihistamines may \n\nbe considered in subsequent cycles. \n\nSevere hypersensitivity reactions \n\n(including bronchospasm, dyspnoea, \n\nangioedema, and anaphylaxis) \n\n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4) \n\nZALTRAP/FOLFIRI should be discontinued and appropriate \n\nmedical therapy should be administered. \n\n \n\nZALTRAP Treatment delay and dose modification \n\nHypertension \n\n(see section 4.4) \n\nZALTRAP should be temporarily suspended until \n\nhypertension is controlled. \n\n \n\nIn case of recurrent medically significant or severe \n\nhypertension, despite optimal treatment, ZALTRAP should \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nbe suspended until the hypertension is controlled and the \n\ndose reduced to 2 mg / kg for subsequent cycles. \n\n \n\nProteinuria  \n\n(see section 4.4) \n\nZALTRAP should be suspended when proteinuria ≥2 grams \n\nper 24 hours and resumed when proteinuria < 2 grams per \n\n24 hours.  \n\n \n\nIf recurrence, the treatment should be suspended \n\nuntil <2 grams per 24 hours and then the dose reduces to \n\n2 mg/kg. \n\nFOLFIRI Dose modification when used in combination with ZALTRAP \n\nSevere stomatitis and Palmar-Plantar \n\nErythrodysaesthesia syndrome \n\n5-FU bolus should be reduced and the infusion dose reduced \n\nby 20 %.  \n\nSevere diarrhoea \n\n \n\nIrinotecan dose should be reduced by 15-20 %.  \n\n \n\nIf severe diarrhoea recurs on a subsequent cycle, the 5-FU \n\nbolus and infusion dose should also be reduced by 20 %.  \n\n \n\nIf severe diarrhoea persists with both dose reductions, \n\nFOLFIRI should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nTreatment with anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products and \n\nrehydration can be used as needed. \n\n \n\nFor additional toxicities related to irinotecan, 5-FU, or folinic acid, refer to the current respective \n\nsummary of product characteristics. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nIn the pivotal MCRC study, 28.2 % of patients were aged ≥ 65 and < 75 and 5.4 % of patients were \n\naged ≥ 75. No dose adjustments of ZALTRAP is required in the elderly people. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThere have been no formal studies with ZALTRAP in patients with hepatic impairment (see section \n\n5.2). Clinical data suggest that no change in aflibercept dose is required in patients with mild to \n\nmoderate hepatic impairment. There are no data regarding the administration of aflibercept in patients \n\nwith severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThere have been no formal studies with ZALTRAP in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\nClinical data suggest that no change in starting dose is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment. There are very limited data in patients with severe renal impairment; therefore, these \n\npatients should be treated with caution.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of ZALTRAP in the paediatric population for the indication of metastatic \n\ncolorectal cancer. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nZALTRAP is to be administered only as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour. Due to hyperosmolality \n\n(1000 mOsmol/kg) of the ZALTRAP concentrate, undiluted ZALTRAP concentrate must not be \n\nadministered as an intravenous push or bolus. ZALTRAP must not be administered as an intravitreal \n\ninjection (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nEach vial of concentrate for solution for infusion is for single use (single-dose) only. \n\n \n\n \n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product  \n\nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, and on infusion sets for \n\nadministration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nOphthalmic / intravitreal use due to hyperosmotic properties of ZALTRAP (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFor contraindications related to FOLFIRI components (irinotecan, 5-FU, and folinic acid), refer to the \n\ncurrent respective summary of product characteristics.  \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\nAn increased risk of haemorrhage, including severe and sometimes fatal haemorrhagic events has been \n\nreported in patients treated with aflibercept (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of GI bleeding and other severe bleeding. \n\nAflibercept should not be administered to patients with severe haemorrhage (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia has been reported in patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen. \n\nMonitoring of complete blood count (CBC) with platelets is recommended at baseline, prior to \n\ninitiation of each cycle of aflibercept, and as clinically necessary. Administration of the \n\nZALTRAP/FOLFIRI should be delayed until platelet count is 75 x 109 / L (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal perforation  \n\nGI perforation including fatal GI perforation has been reported in patients treated with aflibercept (see \n\nsection 4.8).  \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of GI perforation. Aflibercept treatment should \n\nbe discontinued in patients who experience GI perforation (see section 4.2).   \n\n \n\nFistula formation \n\nFistula formation involving GI and non-GI sites has occurred in patients treated with aflibercept (see \n\nsection 4.8).  \n\n \n\nAflibercept treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop fistula (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nAn increased risk of grade 3-4 hypertension (including hypertension and one case of essential \n\nhypertension) has been observed in patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen (see section \n\n4.8).  \n\n \n\nPre-existing hypertension must be adequately controlled before starting aflibercept. If hypertension \n\ncannot be adequately controlled, treatment with aflibercept should not be initiated. It is recommended \n\nto monitor blood pressure every two weeks, including before each administration or as clinically \n\nindicated during treatment with aflibercept. In the event of hypertension on aflibercept treatment, \n\nblood pressure should be controlled with appropriate anti-hypertensive therapy and blood pressure \n\nshould be monitored regularly. In case of recurrent medically significant or severe hypertension, \n\ndespite optimal treatment, aflibercept should be suspended until the hypertension is controlled and the \n\naflibercept dose should be reduced to 2 mg/kg for subsequent cycles. Aflibercept should be \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\npermanently discontinued if hypertension cannot be adequately managed with appropriate \n\nanti-hypertensive therapy or aflibercept dose reduction, or if hypertensive crisis or hypertensive \n\nencephalopathy occurs (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nHypertension may exacerbate underlying cardiovascular disease. Caution should be exercised when \n\ntreating patients with history of clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery \n\ndisease, or congestive heart failure with ZALTRAP. Patients with NYHA class III or IV congestive \n\nheart failure should not be treated with ZALTRAP. \n\n \n\nAneurysms and artery dissections \n\nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the \n\nformation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating ZALTRAP, this risk should be \n\ncarefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. \n\n \nCardiac failure and ejection fraction decreased \n\nCardiac failure and ejection fraction decreased have been reported in patients treated with ZALTRAP. \n\nBaseline and periodic evaluations of left ventricular function should be considered while the patient is \n\nreceiving Zaltrap. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of cardiac failure and ejection \n\nfraction decreased.  Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients who experience cardiac failure and ejection \n\nfraction decreased. \n\n \n\nThrombotic and embolic events \n\n \n\nArterial thromboembolic events (ATE) \n\nATE (including transient ischaemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, angina pectoris, intracardiac \n\nthrombus, myocardial infarction, arterial embolism, and ischaemic colitis) have been observed in \n\npatients treated with aflibercept (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nAflibercept treatment should be discontinued in patients who experience an ATE (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nVenous thromboembolic events (VTE) \n\nVTE including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (infrequently fatal) have been \n\nreported in patients treated with aflibercept (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nZALTRAP should be discontinued in patients with life-threatening (Grade 4) thromboembolic events \n\n(including pulmonary embolism) (see section 4.2). Patients with Grade 3 DVT should be treated with \n\nanticoagulation as clinically indicated, and aflibercept therapy should be continued. In the event of \n\nrecurrence, despite appropriate anticoagulation, aflibercept treatment should be discontinued. Patients \n\nwith thromboembolic events of Grade 3 or lower need to be closely monitored.  \n\n \n\nProteinuria  \n\nSevere proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) have been observed \n\nin patients treated with aflibercept (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nProteinuria should be monitored by urine dipstick analysis and/or urinary protein creatinine ratio \n\n(UPCR) for the development or worsening of proteinuria before each aflibercept administration. \n\nPatients with a dipstick of  ≥ 2+ for protein or a UPCR > 1 or a protein/creatinine ratio \n\n(PCR)> 100 mg/mmol should undergo a 24-hour urine collection.  \n\n \n\nAflibercept administration should be suspended for ≥ 2 grams of proteinuria/24 hours and restarted \n\nwhen proteinuria is  <2 grams/24 hours. If there is recurrence, the administration should be suspended \n\nuntil  <2 grams/24 hours and then the dose reduced to 2 mg/kg. Aflibercept treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome or TMA (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nNeutropenia and neutropenic complications \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nA higher incidence of neutropenic complications (febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection) has \n\nbeen observed in patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nMonitoring of complete blood count (CBC) with differential count is recommended at baseline and \n\nprior to initiation of each cycle of aflibercept. Administration of ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI should be \n\ndelayed until neutrophil count is  1.5 x 109 / L (see section 4.2). Therapeutic use of G-CSF at first \n\noccurrence of grade  ≥ 3 neutropenia and secondary prophylaxis may be considered in patients who \n\nmay be at increased risk for neutropenia complications. \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea and dehydration \n\nA higher incidence of severe diarrhoea has been observed in patients treated with the \n\nZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nDose modification of FOLFIRI regimen (see section 4.2), anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products, and \n\nrehydration as needed should be instituted.  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nIn the pivotal study of MCRC patients, severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients \n\ntreated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen (see section 4.8).   \n\n \n\nIn the event of a severe hypersensitivity reaction (including bronchospasm, dyspnoea, angioedema, \n\nand anaphylaxis), aflibercept should be discontinued and appropriate medical measures should be \n\nadministered (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nIn the event of a mild to moderate hypersensitivity reaction to ZALTRAP (including flushing, rash, \n\nurticaria, and pruritus), aflibercept should be temporarily suspended until the reaction is resolved. \n\nTreatment with corticosteroids and/or antihistamines can be initiated as clinically indicated. \n\nPre-treatment with corticosteroids and/or antihistamines may be considered in subsequent cycles (see \n\nsection 4.2). Caution should be used when retreating patients with prior hypersensitivity reactions as \n\nrecurrent hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in some patients despite prophylaxis, \n\nincluding corticosteroids. \n\n \n\nCompromised wound healing  \n\nAflibercept impaired wound healing in animal models (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nPotential for compromised wound healing (wound dehiscence, anastomotic leakage) has been reported \n\nwith aflibercept (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nAflibercept should be suspended for at least 4 weeks prior to elective surgery.  \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that aflibercept not be initiated for at least 4 weeks following major surgery and not \n\nuntil the surgical wound is fully healed. For minor surgery such as central venous access port \n\nplacement, biopsy, and tooth extraction, aflibercept may be initiated/restarted once the surgical wound \n\nis fully healed. Aflibercept should be discontinued in patients with compromised wound healing \n\nrequiring medical intervention (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) \n\nCases of ONJ have been reported in cancer patients treated with Zaltrap, several of whom had \n\nreceived prior or concomitant treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates, for which ONJ is an \n\nidentified risk. Caution should be exercised when Zaltrap and intravenous bisphosphonates are \n\nadministered concurrently or sequentially.  \n\nInvasive dental procedures are also an identified risk factor. A dental examination and appropriate \n\npreventive dentistry should be considered prior to starting the treatment with Zaltrap. Invasive dental \n\nprocedures should, if possible, be avoided in patients treated with Zaltrap and who have previously \n\nreceived or are receiving intravenous bisphosphonates (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) \n\nPRES was not reported in the pivotal phase III study of MCRC patients. In other studies, PRES was \n\nreported in patients treated with aflibercept as monotherapy and in combination with other \n\nchemotherapies (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPRES may present with altered mental status, seizure, nausea, vomiting, headache, or visual \n\ndisturbances. The diagnosis of PRES is confirmed by brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).   \n\n \n\nAflibercept should be discontinued in patients that develop PRES (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nElderly patients ≥65 years had an increased risk of diarrhoea, dizziness, asthenia, weight  loss and \n\ndehydration. Careful monitoring is recommended in order to rapidly detect and treat signs and \n\nsymptoms of diarrhoea and dehydration and to minimize potential risk (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThere are very limited data available for patients with severe renal impairment treated with aflibercept. \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for aflibercept (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nPerformance status and co-morbidities \n\nPatients with ECOG performance status  ≥ 2 or having significant co-morbidities may be at greater \n\nrisk for a poor clinical outcome and should be carefully monitored for early clinical deterioration. \n\n \n\nOff-label intravitreal use \n\nZALTRAP is a hyperosmotic solution, which is not formulated for compatibility with the intraocular \n\nenvironment. ZALTRAP must not be administered as an intravitreal injection (see section 4.3).  \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n\n \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics analysis and inter study comparisons did not reveal any pharmacokinetic \n\ndrug-drug interaction between aflibercept and the FOLFIRI regimen. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on ZALTRAP, \n\nand should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus. Women of childbearing potential and \n\nfertile males should use effective contraception during and up to a minimum of 6 months after the last \n\ndose of treatment. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data from the use of aflibercept in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \n\nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As angiogenesis is critical to foetal development, the inhibition \n\nof angiogenesis following administration of ZALTRAP may result in adverse effects on pregnancy. \n\nZALTRAP should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk during pregnancy. If \n\nthe patient becomes pregnant while taking ZALTRAP, she should be informed of the potential hazard \n\nto the foetus.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\nNo studies have been conducted to assess the impact of ZALTRAP on milk production, its presence in \n\nbreast milk or its effects on the breast-fed child.  \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether aflibercept is excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be \n\nexcluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nfrom ZALTRAP therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit \n\nof therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nMale and female fertility are likely to be compromised during treatment with aflibercept based on \n\nstudies in monkeys (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nZALTRAP has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients are \n\nexperiencing symptoms that affect their vision or concentration, or their ability to react, they should be \n\nadvised not to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe safety of ZALTRAP in combination with FOLFIRI was evaluated in 1,216 patients previously \n\ntreated for metastatic colorectal cancer, of which 611 patients were treated with ZALTRAP \n\n4 mg/kg every two weeks (one cycle) and 605 patients were treated with placebo/FOLFIRI in a phase \n\nIII study. Patients received a median number of 9 cycles of the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen.   \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions (all grades, ≥ 20 % incidence) reported at least 2 % greater \n\nincidence for the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen as compared to the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen in order \n\nof decreasing frequency were leucopenia, diarrhoea, neutropenia, proteinuria, increased aspartate \n\naminotransferase (AST), stomatitis, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, increased alanine aminotransferase \n\n(ALT), hypertension, weight loss, decreased appetite, epistaxis, abdominal pain, dysphonia, increased \n\nserum creatinine, and headache (see Table 1). \n\n \n\nThe most common reported grades 3-4 reactions ( ≥5 %  incidence) reported at least 2 % greater \n\nincidence for the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen as compared to the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen in order \n\nof decreasing frequency, were neutropenia, diarrhoea, hypertension, leucopenia, stomatitis, fatigue, \n\nproteinuria, and asthenia (see Table 1). \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in ≥ 1 % of patients treated \n\nwith the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen were vascular disorders (3.8 %) including \n\nhypertension (2.3 %), infections (3.4 %), asthenia/fatigue (1.6 %, 2.1 %),diarrhoea (2.3 %), \n\ndehydration (1 %), stomatitis (1.1 %), neutropenia (1.1 %), proteinuria (1.5 %), and pulmonary \n\nembolism  (1.1 %).  \n\n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in patients treated with the \n\nZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen compared to patients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen are \n\nlisted in Table 1 according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency categories. Adverse \n\nreactions in Table 1 are defined as either any adverse clinical reaction or laboratory abnormality \n\nhaving  ≥ 2 % greater incidence (all grades) in the aflibercept treatment group in comparison to the \n\nplacebo treatment group in the MCRC study including those that do not meet this threshold but were \n\nconsistent with the anti-VEGF class and were seen in any study with aflibercept. Intensity of the \n\nadverse reactions is graded according to NCI CTC version 3.0 (grade ≥ 3 = G ≥ 3). Within each \n\nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. \n\nFrequencies are based on all grades and defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to \n\n< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not \n\nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1 - Adverse reactions reported in patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen from \n\nthe MCRC study \n\n \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reaction \n\nFrequency Category All grades Grades ≥3 \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nVery common Infection (1) Infection (1) \n\nCommon Neutropenic infection/sepsis (1) \n\nUrinary tract infection \n\nNasopharyngitis \n\nNeutropenic infection/sepsis (1) \n\nUncommon  Urinary tract infection \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nVery common Leucopenia (2) \n\nNeutropenia (1),(2) \n\nThrombocytopenia (2) \n\nLeucopenia (2) \n\nNeutropenia (2) \n\n \n\nCommon Febrile neutropenia Febrile neutropenia \n\nThrombocytopenia (2) \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nCommon Hypersensitivity (1)  \n\nUncommon  Hypersensitivity (1) \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nVery common Decreased appetite \n\nWeight loss \n\n \n\nCommon Dehydration (1) Dehydration (1) \n\nDecreased appetite \n\nWeight loss \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nUncommon \n\n \n\nCardiac failure \n\n \n\n \n\nRare Ejection fraction decreased  \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nVery common Headache  \n\nCommon  Headache \n\nUncommon PRES (1),(4) PRES (1),(4) \n\nVascular disorders \n\nVery common Hypertension (1) \n\nHaemorrhage (1) \n\nHypertension \n\nCommon Arterial thromboembolism (1) \n\nVenous thromboembolism (1) \n\nArterial thromboembolism (1) \n\nVenous thromboembolism (1) \n\nHaemorrhage (1) \n\nNot known Aneurysms and artery dissections  \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reaction \n\nFrequency Category All grades Grades ≥3 \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nVery common Dyspnoea \n\nEpistaxis \n\nDysphonia \n\n \n\nCommon Oropharyngeal pain \n\nRhinorrhoea \n\n \n\nUncommon  Dyspnoea \n\nEpistaxis \n\nDysphonia \n\nOropharyngeal pain \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common Diarrhoea (1) \n\nStomatitis \n\nAbdominal pain \n\nAbdominal pain upper \n\nDiarrhoea (1) \n\nStomatitis \n\nCommon Rectal haemorrhage \n\nFistula (1) \n\nAphthous stomatitis \n\nHaemorrhoids \n\nProctalgia \n\nToothache \n\nAbdominal pain \n\nAbdominal pain upper \n\nUncommon GI perforation (1) GI perforation (1) \n\nRectal haemorrhage \n\nFistula (1) \n\nAphthous stomatitis \n\nProctalgia \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nVery common Increased AST (2) \n\nIncreased ALT (2) \n\n \n\nCommon  Increased AST (2) \n\nIncreased ALT (2) \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nVery common Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysaesthesia \n\nsyndrome \n\n \n\nCommon Skin hyperpigmentation Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysaesthesia \n\nsyndrome \n\nUncommon Compromised wound healing (1) Compromised wound healing (1) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nUncommon Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ)  \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reaction \n\nFrequency Category All grades Grades ≥3 \n\nVery common Proteinuria (1),(3) \n\nIncreased serum creatinine \n\n \n\nCommon  Proteinuria (1),(3) \n\nUncommon Nephrotic syndrome (1) \n\nThrombotic microangiopathy (1) \n\nNephrotic syndrome (1) \n\nThrombotic microangiopathy (1) \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nVery common Asthenic conditions Asthenic conditions \n\nNote: Adverse reactions are reported using MedDRA version MEDDRA13.1 and graded using NCI CTC \n\nversion 3.0  \n\n(1) See “Description of selected adverse reactions” in this section \n\n(2) Based on laboratory values (percentages done on patients with laboratory assessments)  \n\n(3) Compilation of clinical and laboratory data \n\n(4) Not reported in MCRC study; however, PRES was reported in patients from other studies treated with \n\naflibercept as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapies other than FOLFIRI \n\n \n\nIn the pivotal MCRC study, anaemia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, alopecia, increased alkaline \n\nphosphatase, and hyperbilirubinaemia occurred in  ≥ 20 % of patients. These were comparable \n\nbetween groups, and the difference between groups did not exceed  ≥ 2 % incidence for the \n\nZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen.  \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\nPatients treated with ZALTRAP have an increased risk of haemorrhage, including severe and \n\nsometimes fatal haemorrhagic events. In the pivotal study of MCRC patients, episodes of \n\nbleeding/haemorrhage (all grades) was reported in 37.8 % of patients treated with the \n\nZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen compared to 19.0 % of patients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI \n\nregimen. The most common reported form of bleeding was minor (grade 1-2) epistaxis occurring in \n\n27.7 % of patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen. Grade 3-4 haemorrhage including \n\nGI haemorrhage, haematuria, and post-procedural haemorrhage was reported in 2.9 % of patients \n\nreceiving the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen compared with 1.7 % of patients receiving the \n\nplacebo/FOLFIRI regimen. In other studies, severe intracranial haemorrhage and pulmonary \n\nhaemorrhage/haemoptysis including fatal events have occurred in patients receiving ZALTRAP (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal perforation  \n\nGI perforation including fatal GI perforation has been reported in patients treated with ZALTRAP. In \n\nthe pivotal study of MCRC patients, GI perforation (all grades) was reported in 3 of 611 patients \n\n(0.5 %) treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen and 3 of 605 patients (0.5 %) treated with the \n\nplacebo/FOLFIRI regimen. Grade 3-4 GI perforation events occurred in all 3 patients (0.5 %) treated \n\nwith the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen and in 2 patients (0.3 %) treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI \n\nregimen. Across the three Phase III placebo-controlled clinical studies (colorectal, pancreatic, and lung \n\ncancer populations), the incidence of GI perforation (all grades) was 0.8 % for patients treated with \n\nZALTRAP and 0.3 % for patients treated with placebo. Grade 3-4 GI perforation events occurred in \n\n0.8 % of patients treated with ZALTRAP and 0.2 % of patients treated with placebo (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFistula formation \n\nFistula formation involving GI and non-GI sites has occurred in patients treated with ZALTRAP. In \n\nthe pivotal study of MCRC patients, fistulas (anal, enterovesical, enterocutaneous, colovaginal, \n\nintestinal sites) were reported in 9 of 611 patients (1.5 %) treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nregimen and 3 of 605 patients (0.5 %) treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen. \n\nGrade 3 GI fistula formation occurred in 2 patients treated with ZALTRAP (0.3 %) and in 1 \n\nplacebo-treated patient (0.2 %). Across the three Phase III placebo-controlled clinical studies \n\n(colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancer populations), the incidence of fistula (all grades) was 1.1 % for \n\npatients treated with ZALTRAP and 0.2 % for patients treated with placebo. Grade  3-4 fistula \n\noccurred in 0.2 % of patients treated with ZALTRAP and 0.1 % of patients treated with placebo (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nIn the pivotal study of MCRC patients, hypertension (all grades) has been reported in 41.2 % of \n\npatients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 10.7 % of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. An \n\nincreased risk of grade  3-4  hypertension (including hypertension and one case of essential \n\nhypertension) has been observed in patients receiving the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen. \n\nGrade 3 hypertension (requiring adjustment in existing anti-hypertensive therapy or treatment with \n\nmore than one medicinal product) was reported in 1.5 % of patients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI \n\nregimen and 19.1 % of patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen. Grade 4 hypertension \n\n(hypertensive crisis) was reported in 1 patient (0.2 %) treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen. \n\nAmong those patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen developing \n\ngrade 3-4 hypertension, 54 % had onset during the first two cycles of treatment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThrombotic and embolic events \n\nArterial thromboembolic events \n\nIn the pivotal study of MCRC patients, ATE (including transient ischaemic attack, cerebrovascular \n\naccident, angina pectoris, intracardiac thrombus, myocardial infarction, arterial embolism, and \n\nischaemic colitis) were reported in 2.6 % of patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen \n\nand 1.5 % of patients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen. Grade 3-4  events occurred in \n\n11 patients (1.8 %) treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen and 3 patients (0.5 %) treated with \n\nthe placebo/FOLFIRI regimen. Across the three Phase III placebo-controlled clinical studies \n\n(colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancer populations), the incidence of ATE (all grades) was 2.3 % for \n\npatients treated with ZALTRAP and 1.7 % for patients treated with placebo. Grade 3-4 ATE occurred \n\nin 1.7 % of patients treated with ZALTRAP and 1.0 % of patients treated with placebo (see section \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nVenous thromboembolic events \n\nVTE include deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. In the pivotal study of MCRC \n\npatients, all grades VTE occurred in 9.3 % of patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen \n\nand 7.3 % of patients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen. Grade 3-4 VTE occurred in 7.9 % of \n\npatients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen and in 6.3 % of  patients treated with the \n\nplacebo/FOLFIRI regimen. Pulmonary embolism occurred in 4.6 % of patients treated with the \n\nZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen and 3.5 % of patients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen. \n\nAcross the three Phase III placebo-controlled clinical studies (colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancer \n\npopulations), the incidence of VTE (all grades) was 7.1 % for patients treated with ZALTRAP and \n\n7.1 % for patients treated with placebo.  \n\n \n\nProteinuria  \n\nIn the pivotal study of MCRC patients, proteinuria (compiled from clinical and laboratory data) was \n\nreported in 62.2 % patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen compared to 40.7 % \n\npatients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen. Grade 3-4 proteinuria occurred in 7.9 % of \n\npatients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen compared to 1.2 % of patients treated with the \n\nplacebo/FOLFIRI regimen. Nephrotic syndrome occurred in 2 patients (0.5 %) treated with the \n\nZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen compared to none of the patients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI \n\nregimen. One patient treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen presenting with proteinuria and \n\nhypertension was diagnosed with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Across the three Phase III \n\nplacebo-controlled clinical studies (colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancer populations), the incidence \n\nof nephrotic syndrome was 0.5 % of patients treated with ZALTRAP and 0.1 % of patients treated \n\nwith placebo (see section 4.4).  \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nNeutropenia and neutropenic complications \n\nIn the pivotal study of MCRC patients, neutropenia (all grades) has been reported in 67.8 % of patients \n\ntreated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 56.3 % of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. \n\nGrade 3-4 neutropenia was observed in 36.7 % of patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI \n\nregimen compared to 29.5 % patients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen. The most common \n\ngrade  3-4 neutropenic complication was the occurrence of febrile neutropenia in 4.3 % of patients \n\ntreated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen compared to 1.7 % of patients treated with the \n\nplacebo/FOLFIRI regimen. Grade 3-4 neutropenic infection/sepsis occurred in 1.5 % of patients \n\ntreated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen and 1.2 % of patients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI \n\nregimen (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInfections \n\nInfections occurred at a higher frequency in patients receiving the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen \n\n(46.2 %, all  grades; 12.3 %, grade  3-4) than in patients receiving the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen \n\n(32.7%, all  grades; 6.9 %, grade 3-4), including urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, upper \n\nrespiratory tract infection, pneumonia, catheter site infection, and tooth infection.  \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea and dehydration \n\nIn the pivotal study of MCRC patients, diarrhoea (all grades) has been observed in 69.2 % of patients \n\ntreated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 56.5 % of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Dehydration \n\n(all grades) has been observed in 9.0 % of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 3.0 % of \n\npatients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3-4 diarrhoea was reported in 19.3 % of patients treated \n\nwith the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen compared to 7.8 % of patients treated with the \n\nplacebo/FOLFIRI regimen. Grade 3-4 dehydration was reported in 4.3 % of patients treated with the \n\nZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen compared to 1.3 % of patients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI \n\nregimen (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nIn the pivotal study of MCRC patients, severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in 0.3 % \n\nof patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen and 0.5 % of patients treated with the \n\nplacebo/FOLFIRI regimen (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCompromised wound healing  \n\nTreatment with ZALTRAP is associated with potential for compromised wound healing \n\n(wound dehiscence, anastomotic leakage). In the pivotal study for MCRC, compromised wound \n\nhealing was reported in 3 patients (0.5 %) treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen and \n\n5 patients (0.8 %) treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen. Grade  3 compromised wound healing \n\nwas reported in 2 patients (0.3 %) treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen and in none of the \n\npatients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen. Across the three Phase III placebo-controlled \n\nclinical studies (colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancer populations), the incidence of compromised \n\nwound healing (all grades) was 0.5 % for patients treated with ZALTRAP and 0.4 % for patients \n\ntreated with placebo. Grade 3-4  compromised wound healing occurred in 0.2 % of patients treated \n\nwith ZALTRAP and none of patients treated with placebo (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) \n\nPRES was not reported in the pivotal Phase III study of MCRC patients. In other studies, PRES was \n\nreported in patients treated with monotherapy ZALTRAP (0.5 %) and in combination with other \n\nchemotherapies (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAdditional adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported with a  ≥5 % difference (all \n\ngrades) in patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen versus the placebo/FOLFIRI \n\nregimen  \n\nThe following adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities were reported with a ≥ 5 % difference \n\n(all grades) in patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen versus the placebo/FOLFIRI \n\nregimen (in order of decreasing frequency): leucopenia (78.3 % versus 72.4 % all grades; 15.6 % \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nversus 12.2 % Grades 3-4), increased AST (57.5 % versus 50.2 % all grades; 3.1 % versus \n\n1.7% Grades 3-4), stomatitis (50.1 % versus 32.9 % all grades; 12.8 % versus 4.6 % Grades 3-4), \n\nfatigue  (47.8 % versus 39.0 % all grades; 12.6 % versus 7.8 % Grade 3-4), thrombocytopenia (47.4 % \n\nversus  33.8 % all grades; 3.3 % versus 1.7 % Grades 3-4), increased ALT (47.3 % versus 37.1 % all \n\ngrades; 2.7 % versus 2.2 % Grades 3-4), decreased appetite (31.9 % versus 23.8 % all grades; 3.4 % \n\nversus  1.8 % Grade 3-4), weight loss (31.9 % versus 14.4 % all grades; 2.6 % versus 0.8 % \n\nGrades 3-4), dysphonia (25.4 % versus 3.3 % all grades; 0.5 % versus 0  Grades 3-4), headache \n\n(22.3 % versus  8.8 % all grades; 1.6 % versus 0.3 % Grades  3-4), asthenia (18.3 % versus 13.2 % all \n\ngrades; 5.1%  versus 3.0 % Grades 3-4), Palmar- Plantar Erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (11.0 % \n\nversus 4.3 % all grades; 2.8 % versus 0.5 % Grades 3-4), and skin hyperpigmentation (8.2 % versus \n\n2.8 % all grades; 0  versus 0 Grades 3-4).   \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety in paediatric patients has not been established. \n\n \n\nOther special populations \n\nElderly \n\nOf the 611 patients treated with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen in the pivotal study of MCRC \n\npatients, 172 (28.2 %) were aged ≥ 65 and < 75 and 33 (5.4 %) were age ≥ 75. Elderly (≥ 65 years \n\nof age) may be more likely to experience adverse reactions. The incidence of diarrhoea, dizziness, \n\nasthenia, weight decrease, and dehydration was increased by ≥5% in elderly compared to younger \n\npatients. Elderly people should be closely monitored for the development of diarrhoea and potential \n\ndehydration (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn patients receiving ZALTRAP, the adverse reactions in patients with mild renal impairment at \n\nbaseline in three Phase III placebo-controlled clinical studies (N = 352) were comparable with those of \n\npatients without renal impairment (N = 642). A limited number of patients having moderate/severe \n\nrenal impairment at baseline (N = 49) were treated with ZALTRAP. In these patients, non-renal events \n\nwere generally comparable between patients with renal impairment and those without renal \n\nimpairment, except a > 10 % higher incidence in dehydration (all grades) was noted (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with ZALTRAP.   \n\n \n\nOverall across all clinical oncology studies, similar incidence of low titre anti-drug antibody (ADA) \n\nresponses (post baseline) in the ADA assay were observed in both patients treated with placebo and \n\nZALTRAP (3.3 % and 3.8 %, respectively). High-titre antibody responses to aflibercept were not \n\ndetected in any patients. Seventeen (17) patients treated with ZALTRAP (1.6 %) and two (2) \n\nplacebo-treated patients (0.2 %) were also positive in the neutralising antibody assay. In the pivotal \n\nstudy of MCRC patients, positive responses in the ADA assay were observed at higher levels in \n\npatients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen [18/526 (3.4 %)] than with the \n\nZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen [8/521 (1.5 %)]. Positive results in the neutralising antibody assay in \n\nthe MCRC pivotal study were also higher in patients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen \n\n[2/526 (0.38 % )] than with the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen [1/521 (0.19 %)]. There was no \n\nobserved impact on the pharmacokinetic profile of aflibercept in patients who were positive in the \n\nimmunogenicity assays. \n\n \n\nGiven the similar ADA assay results in patients treated with placebo or ZALTRAP, the actual \n\nincidence of immunogenicity with ZALTRAP based on these assays is likely to be overestimated.   \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, \n\nthe observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, \n\nincluding sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medicinal products, and \n\nunderlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to ZALTRAP with \n\nthe incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose  \n\n \n\nThere is no information on the safety of aflibercept given at doses exceeding 7 mg/kg every 2 weeks \n\nor 9 mg/kg every 3  weeks. The most commonly observed adverse reactions at these doses were \n\nsimilar to those observed at the therapeutic dose.  \n\n \n\nThere is no specific antidote to ZALTRAP overdose. Cases of overdose should be managed by \n\nappropriate supportive measures particularly with regard to monitoring and treatment of hypertension \n\nand proteinuria. The patient should remain under close medical supervision to monitor any adverse \n\nreactions (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX44 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nVascular endothelial growth factor A and B (VEGF-A, VEGF-B), and placental growth factor (PlGF) \n\nare members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as potent mitogenic, chemotactic, \n\nand vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF-A acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases, \n\nVEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF and VEGF-B bind only to \n\nVEGFR-1, which is also present on the surface of leucocytes. Excessive activation of these receptors \n\nby VEGF-A can result in pathological neovascularisation and excessive vascular permeability. PlGF is \n\nalso linked to pathological neovascularisation and recruitment of inflammatory cells into tumours. \n\n \n\nAflibercept, also known as VEGF TRAP in the scientific literature, is a recombinant fusion protein \n\nconsisting of VEGF-binding portions from the extracellular domains of human VEGF receptors 1 and \n\n2 fused to the Fc portion of the human IgG1. Aflibercept is produced by recombinant DNA technology \n\nin a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K-1 mammalian expression system. Aflibercept is a dimeric \n\nglycoprotein with a protein molecular weight of 97 kilodaltons (kDa) and contains glycosylation, \n\nconstituting an additional 15 % of the total molecular mass, resulting in a total molecular weight of \n\n115 kDa. \n\n \n\nAflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds to VEGF-A, with higher affinity than its native \n\nreceptors, as well as the related ligands PlGF and VEGF-B. By acting as a ligand trap, aflibercept \n\nprevents binding of endogenous ligands to their cognate receptors and thereby blocks receptor \n\nmediated signaling.   \n\n \n\nAflibercept blocks the activation of VEGF receptors and the proliferation of endothelial cells, thereby \n\ninhibiting the growth of new vessels that supply tumours with oxygen and nutrients.  \n\n \n\nAflibercept binds to human VEGF-A (equilibrium dissociation constant KD of 0.5 pM for \n\nVEGF-A165 and 0.36 pM for VEGF-A121), to human PlGF (KD of 39 pM for PlGF-2), and to human \n\nVEGF-B (KD  of 1.92 pM) to form a stable, inert complex which has no detectable biological activity. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects   \n\nAdministration of aflibercept to mice bearing xenotransplant or allotransplant tumours inhibited the \n\ngrowth of various cancer types. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety  \n\nThe efficacy and safety of ZALTRAP were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, \n\nplacebo-controlled study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had previously been treated \n\nwith an oxaliplatin-based treatment with or without prior bevacizumab. A total of 1,226 patients were \n\nrandomised (1:1) to receive either ZALTRAP (N = 612; 4 mg/kg as a 1 hour intravenous infusion on \n\nday 1) or placebo (N = 614), in combination with 5-fluouracil plus irinotecan [FOLFIRI: irinotecan \n\n180 mg/m2 intravenous infusion over 90 minutes and folinic acid (dl racemic) 400 mg/m² intravenous \n\ninfusion over 2 hours at the same time on day 1 using a Y-line, followed by 5-FU 400 mg/m² \n\nintravenous bolus, followed by 5-FU 2,400 mg /m² continuous intravenous infusion over  46-hours]. \n\nThe treatment cycles on both arms were repeated every 2 weeks. Patients were treated until disease \n\nprogression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. Treatment \n\nassignment was stratified by the ECOG performance status (0 versus 1 versus 2) and according to \n\nprior therapy with bevacizumab (yes or no). \n\n \n\nDemographics were well balanced between the treatment arms (age, race, ECOG performance status, \n\nand prior bevacizumab status). Of the 1,226 patients randomised in the study, the median age was \n\n61 years, 58.6 % were male, 97.8 % had a baseline ECOG performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, and \n\n2.2 % had a baseline ECOG performance status (PS) of 2. Among the 1,226 randomised patients, \n\n89.4 % and 90.2 % of patients treated with the placebo/FOLFIRI and ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimens, \n\nrespectively, received prior oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy in the metastatic/advanced \n\nsetting. Approximately 10 % of patients (10.4 % and 9.8 % of patients treated with the \n\nplacebo/FOLFIRI and ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimens, respectively) received prior oxaliplatin-based \n\nadjuvant chemotherapy and progressed on or within 6 months of completion of adjuvant \n\nchemotherapy. Oxaliplatin-based regimens were administered in combination with bevacizumab in \n\n373 patients (30.4 %). \n\n \n\nOverall efficacy results for the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen versus the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen \n\nare summarised in Figure 1 and Table 2. \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nFigure 1 – Overall survival (months) – Kaplan-Meier curves by treatment group – ITT population \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nTable 2 - Main efficacy endpointsa – ITT population \n\n \n\n \n\nPlacebo/FOLFIRI \n\n(N = 614) \n\nZALTRAP/FOLFIRI \n\n(N = 612) \n\nOS    \n\nNumber of death events, n (%) 460 (74.9 %) 403 (65.8 %) \n\nMedian overall survival (95  %  CI) (months) 12.06 (11.07 to 13.08) 13.50 (12.52 to 14.95) \n\nStratified hazard ratio (95 %  CI)  0.817 (0.714 to 0.935) \n\nStratified log-rank test p-value 0.0032 \n\nPFSb    \n\nNumber of events, n (%) 454 (73.9 %) 393 (64.2 %) \n\nMedian PFS (95 %  CI) (months) 4.67 (4.21 to 5.36) 6.90 (6.51 to 7.20) \n\nStratified hazard ratio (95 % CI) 0.758 (0.661 to 0.869) \n\nStratified log-rank test p-value 0.00007  \n\nOverall Response Rate (CR+PR) (95 % CI) (%)c 11.1 (8.5 to 13.8) 19.8 (16.4 to 23.2) \n\nStratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test \n\np-value 0.0001 \na Stratified on ECOG performance status (0 versus 1 versus 2) and prior bevacizumab (yes versus no). \nb PFS (based on tumour assessment by the IRC): Significance threshold is set to 0.0001 \nc Overall objective response rate by IRC  \n\n \n\nOS and PFS by stratification factors were performed.

In patients with \n\nRAS wild type tumours the HR (95 %  CI) for OS was 0.7 (0.5-1.0) with a median OS of  16.0 months \n\nfor patients treated with aflibercept, and 11.7 months for the patients treated with placebo. \n\nCorresponding data in patients with RAS mutant type tumours showed a HR for OS of 0.9 (0.7-1.2) \n\nwith median 12.6 and 11.2 months for aflibercept and placebo, respectively. These data are \n\nexploratory and the statistical interaction test was non-significant (lack of evidence for heterogeneity \n\nin treatment effect between the RAS wild-type and RAS mutant subgroups). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to conduct studies with ZALTRAP in all \n\nsubsets of the paediatric population in adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use).  \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties described below have to a large extent been derived from a population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis with data from 1,507 patients with various types of advanced malignancies.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nAbsorption \n\nIn preclinical tumour models, biologically active doses of aflibercept correlated with those necessary \n\nto produce circulating concentrations of free aflibercept in excess of VEGF-bound aflibercept. \n\nCirculating concentrations of VEGF-bound aflibercept increase with the aflibercept dose until most \n\navailable VEGF is bound. Further increases in the aflibercept dose resulted in dose-related increases in \n\ncirculating free aflibercept concentrations but only small further increases in the VEGF-bound \n\naflibercept concentration.   \n\n \n\nIn patients, ZALTRAP is administered at the dose of 4 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks for \n\nwhich there is an excess of circulating free aflibercept compared to VEGF-bound aflibercept.   \n\n \n\nAt the recommended dose regimen of 4 mg/kg  every two weeks, concentration of free aflibercept \n\nwere near steady-state levels by the second cycle of treatment with essentially no accumulation \n\n(accumulation ratio of 1.2 at steady-state compared to the first administration). \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution of free aflibercept at steady-state is approximately 8 litres.  \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nNo metabolism studies have been conducted with aflibercept since it is a protein. Aflibercept is \n\nexpected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids.  \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nFree aflibercept is primarily cleared by binding to endogenous VEGF to form a stable, inactive \n\ncomplex. As with other large proteins, both free and bound aflibercept, are expected to be cleared, \n\nmore slowly, by other biological mechanisms, such as proteolytic catabolism. \n\nAt doses greater than 2 mg/kg, free aflibercept clearance was approximately 1.0L/day with a terminal \n\nhalf-life of 6 days.  \n\n \n\nHigh molecular weight proteins are not cleared by the renal route, therefore renal elimination of \n\naflibercept is expected to be minimal.   \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nConsistent with target-mediated drug disposition, free aflibercept exhibits a faster (non-linear) \n\nclearance at doses below 2 mg/kg, likely due to the high affinity binding of aflibercept to endogenous \n\nVEGF. Linear clearance observed in the dose range of 2 to 9 mg/kg is likely due to non saturable \n\nbiological mechanisms of elimination such as protein catabolism. \n\n \n\nOther special populations \n\nElderly \n\nThere was no effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of free aflibercept. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nNo effect of race was identified in the population analysis. \n\n \n\nGender \n\nGender was the most significant covariate for explaining the interindividual variability of free \n\naflibercept clearance and volume with a 15.5 % higher clearance and a 20.6 % higher volume of \n\ndistribution in males than in females. These differences do not affect exposure due to weight-based \n\ndosing and no dose modifications based on gender are required.  \n\n \n\nWeight  \n\nWeight had an effect on free aflibercept clearance and volume of distribution resulting with a 29 % \n\nincrease in aflibercept exposure in patients weighing ≥ 100 kg.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThere have been no formal studies with ZALTRAP in patients with hepatic impairment. In a \n\npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis with data from 1,507 patients with various types of advanced \n\nmalignancies receiving ZALTRAP with or without chemotherapy, 63 patients with mild hepatic \n\nimpairment (total bilirubin > 1.0 x – 1.5 x ULN and any AST) and 5 patients with moderate hepatic \n\nimpairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 x – 3 x ULN and any AST) were treated with ZALTRAP. In these \n\nmild and moderate hepatic impairment patients, there was no effect on clearance of aflibercept. There \n\nare no data available for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 x ULN and any \n\nAST). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment  \n\nThere have been no formal studies with ZALTRAP in patients with renal impairment. A population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis was conducted with data from 1,507 patients with various types of advanced \n\nmalignancies receiving ZALTRAP with or without chemotherapy. This population included; \n\n549 patients with mild renal impairment (CL CR between 50-80 ml/min), 96  patients with moderate \n\nrenal impairment (CL CR  between 30-50 ml/min), and 5 patients with severe renal impairment \n\n(CL CR < 30 ml/min). This population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no clinically meaningful \n\ndifferences in clearance or systemic exposure (AUC) of free aflibercept in patients with moderate and \n\nmild renal impairment at the 4 mg/kg dose of ZALTRAP as compared to the overall population \n\nstudied. No conclusion can be drawn for patients with severe renal impairment due to very limited \n\ndata available. In the few patients with severe renal impairment, drug exposure was similar to that \n\nobserved in patients with normal renal function. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAnimal toxicology and pharmacology \n\nWeekly/every two weeks intravenous administration of aflibercept to cynomolgus monkeys for up to \n\n6 months resulted in changes in the bone (effects on growth plate and the axial and appendicular \n\n skeleton), nasal cavity, kidney, ovary, and adrenal gland. Most aflibercept-related findings were noted \n\nfrom the lowest dose tested corresponding to plasma exposures close to those in patients at the \n\ntherapeutic dose. Most aflibercept-induced effects were reversible after a 5-month drug free period \n\nwith the exception of skeletal and nasal cavity findings. Most findings were considered to be related to \n\nthe pharmacological activity of aflibercept.  \n\n \n\nAflibercept administration resulted in a delay in wound healing in rabbits. In full-thickness excisional \n\nand incisional skin wound models, aflibercept administration reduced fibrous response, \n\nneovascularisation, epidermal hyperplasia/re-epithelialisation, and tensile strength. Aflibercept \n\nincreased blood pressure in normotensive rodents. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis and mutagenesis \n\nNo studies have been conducted to evaluate carcinogenicity or mutagenicity of aflibercept. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nNo specific studies with aflibercept have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility.  \n\nHowever, results from a repeat dose toxicity study suggest there is a potential for aflibercept to impair \n\nreproductive function and fertility. In sexually mature female cynomolgus monkeys inhibition of \n\novarian function and follicular development was evidenced. These animals also lost normal menstrual \n\ncycling. In sexually mature male cynomolgus monkeys a decrease in sperm motility and an increase in \n\nincidence of morphological abnormalities of spermatozoa were observed. There was no margin of \n\nexposure to patients in relation to these effects. These effects were fully reversible within 8-18 weeks \n\nafter the last injection.  \n\n \n\nReproductive and developmental toxicology \n\nAflibercept has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic when administered intravenously to \n\npregnant rabbits every 3 days during the organogenesis period (gestation days 6 to18) at doses \n\napproximately 1 to 15 times the human dose of 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Observed effects included \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\ndecreases in maternal body weights, an increased number of foetal resorptions, and an increased \n\nincidence of external, visceral, and skeletal foetal malformations. \n\n \n\n \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n\n \n\nSucrose \n\nSodium chloride  \n\nSodium citrate dihydrate  \n\nCitric acid monohydrate  \n\nPolysorbate 20 \n\nSodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate  \n\nSodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate  \n\nSodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) \n\nWater for injections  \n\n \n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n\n \n\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \n\nproducts or solvents except those mentioned in section 6.6.  \n\n \n\n6.3 Shelf life \n\n \n\nUnopened vial \n\n3 years \n\n \n\nAfter dilution in the infusion bag \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C and for \n\n8 hours at 25°C. \n\n \n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the solution for infusion should be used immediately. \n\nIf not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the \n\nuser and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C unless dilution has taken place in \n\ncontrolled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n\n \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2C – 8C). \n\nStore in the original package in order to protect from light.  \n\n \n\nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.  \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n\n• 4 ml of concentrate in a 5 ml clear borosilicate glass vial (type I) sealed by a flanged stopper \nwith flip-off cap and inserted coated sealing disc. Pack size of 1 vial or 3 vials. \n\n• 8 ml of concentrate in a 10 ml clear borosilicate glass vial (type I) sealed by a flanged stopper \nwith flip-off cap and inserted coated sealing disc. Pack size of 1 vial. \n\n \n\nNot all pack sizes may be marketed.  \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\nZALTRAP is a sterile, preservative-free and non-pyrogenic concentrate, therefore the solution for \n\ninfusion should be prepared by a healthcare professional using safe-handling procedures and aseptic \n\ntechnique. \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when handling ZALTRAP, taking into account the use of containment \n\ndevices, personal protective equipment (e.g. gloves), and preparation procedures. \n\n \n\nPreparation of the infusion solution \n\n• Inspect the ZALTRAP vial visually prior to use. The concentrate solution must be clear and \n\nwithout particles.  \n\n• Based on the required dose for the patient, withdraw the necessary volume of ZALTRAP \nconcentrate from the vial. More than one vial could be needed for the preparation of the \n\ninfusion solution.  \n\n• Dilute it to the required administration volume with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution or \n5 % glucose solution for infusion. The concentration of the final ZALTRAP solution for \n\nintravenous infusion should be kept within the range of 0.6 mg/ml to 8 mg/ml of aflibercept. \n\n• PVC containing DEHP infusion bags or polyolefin infusion bags should be used. \n\n• The diluted solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration \n\nprior to administration. If any discolouration or particulate matter is observed, the \n\nreconstituted solution should be discarded. \n\n• ZALTRAP is a single-use vial. Do not re-enter the vial after the initial puncture. Any unused \nconcentrate should be discarded. \n\n \n\nAdministration of the infusion solution \n\nDiluted solutions of ZALTRAP should be administered using infusion sets containing a 0.2 micron \n\npolyethersulfone filter. \n\n \n\nThe infusion sets should be made of one of the following materials: \n\n• polyvinyl chloride (PVC) containing bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)  \n\n• DEHP free PVC containing trioctyl-trimellitate (TOTM) \n\n• polypropylene  \n\n• polyethylene lined PVC \n\n• polyurethane \n \n\nFilters made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) or nylon must not be used.  \n\n \n\nDisposal \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nZALTRAP 25 mg / ml concentration for solution for infusion \n\naflibercept \n\n \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n\n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again, or provide it to future healthcare providers. \n\n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What ZALTRAP is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given ZALTRAP \n\n3. How ZALTRAP is given \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store ZALTRAP \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What ZALTRAP is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat ZALTRAP is and how it works \n\nZALTRAP contains the active substance aflibercept, a protein that works by blocking the growth of \n\nnew blood vessels within the tumour. The tumour needs nutrients and oxygen from blood in order to \n\ngrow. By blocking the growth of blood vessels, ZALTRAP helps to stop or slow down the growth of \n\nthe tumour. \n\n \n\nWhat ZALTRAP is used for \n\nZALTRAP is a medicine used to treat advanced cancers of the colon or rectum (parts of the large \n\nintestine) in adults. It will be given with other medicines called ‘chemotherapy’, including \n\n‘5-fluorouracil’, ‘folinic acid’, and ‘irinotecan’.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given ZALTRAP \n \n\nDo not use ZALTRAP: \n\n• if you are allergic to aflibercept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n 6).  \n\n• in your eye, since it may severely damage it. \n \n\nPlease also read the package leaflets for the other medicines (‘chemotherapy’) that are part of your \n\ntreatment, to see if they are suitable for you. If you are unsure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if \n\nthere are any reasons why you cannot use these medicines. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given ZALTRAP and during your treatment if: \n\n• you have any bleeding problems or if you notice any bleeding after treatment (see section 4) or if \nyou feel extreme tiredness, weakness, dizziness, or have changes in the colour of your stool. If the \n\nbleeding is severe, your doctor will stop your treatment with ZALTRAP. This is because \n\nZALTRAP may increase the risk of bleeding. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n• you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a \n\nplanned tooth extraction and especially if you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate \n\n(used to treat or prevent bone disorders). A side effect called osteonecrosis (bone damage in the \n\njaw) has been reported in cancer patients treated with ZALTRAP. You may be advised to have a \n\ndental check-up before you start treatment with ZALTRAP. While being treated with ZALTRAP, \n\nyou should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and receive routine \n\ndental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. If you also have \n\npreviously received or are receiving intravenous bisphosphonates dental treatment or dental \n\nsurgery, (e.g. tooth extractions), should be avoided. Inform your doctor about your dental \n\ntreatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with ZALTRAP.  Contact your doctor \n\nand dentist immediately during and after treatment with ZALTRAP if you experience any \n\nproblems with your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or \n\ndischarge, as these could be signs of osteonecrosis of the jaw. \n\n \n\n• you have illnesses where your gut is inflamed, such as an infected section of the bowel wall (also \ncalled ‘diverticulitis’), stomach ulcers or colitis. This is because ZALTRAP may increase the risk \n\nof developing holes in the gut wall. If this should happen to you, your doctor will stop your \n\ntreatment with ZALTRAP. \n\n \n\n• you have had any abnormal tube-like connections or passageways inside the body between \ninternal organs and skin or other tissues (also called ‘fistula’). If you develop such a connection or \n\npassageway during treatment, your doctor will stop your treatment with ZALTRAP. \n\n \n\n• you have high blood pressure. Zaltrap may increase blood pressure (see section 4) and your doctor \nwill need to monitor your blood pressure and may adjust your blood pressure medicines or your \n\ndose of ZALTRAP. It is therefore also important to tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you \n\nhave other heart problems since high blood pressure could make these worse.  \n\n \n\n• you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a tear in \na blood vessel wall. \n\n \n\n• you experience shortness of breath (dyspnea) when you exert yourself or when you lie down, \nexcessive tiredness or leg swelling which may be signs of heart failure. \n\n \n\n• you experience signs of a blood clot (see section 4). The signs of a blood clot may vary depending \non where it appears (e.g. lungs, leg, heart or brain) but may include symptoms such as chest pain, \n\ncoughing, being short of breath or having difficulty breathing. Other signs may include swelling in \n\none or both legs, pain or tenderness in one or both legs, discolouration and warmth of the skin on \n\nthe affected leg or visible veins. It may also present itself as a sudden numb or weak feeling in the \n\nface, arms, or legs. Other signs include feeling confused, problems with sight, walking, \n\ncoordination or balance, problems in saying words or slurring of speech. If you experience any of \n\nthese symptoms, talk to your doctor immediatley since your doctor may want to treat your \n\nsymptoms and stop your treatment with ZALTRAP. \n\n \n\n• you have kidney problems (protein in the urine), since your doctor will monitor your kidney \nfunction and may need to adjust your dose of ZALTRAP. \n\n \n\n• your number of white blood cells is too low. Zaltrap may reduce the number of white cells in your \nblood and your doctor will monitor your white blood cell count and may give you additional \n\nmedicines to increase it. If your white blood cells are low, your doctor may need to delay your \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\n• you have severe or long-lasting diarrhoea, feel sick (nausea) or are being sick (vomiting) - these \ncould cause severe loss of body fluids (called ‘dehydration’). Your doctor may need to treat you \n\nwith other medicines and/or fluids given intravenously. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n• you have ever had any allergies - serious allergic reactions can happen during treatment with \nZALTRAP (see section 4). Your doctor may need to treat the allergic reaction or stop your \n\ntreatment with ZALTRAP. \n\n \n\n• you have had a tooth removed or any form of surgery in the last 4 weeks, or you are going to have \nan operation or a dental or medical procedure, or you have a wound after surgery that has not \n\nhealed. Your doctor will temporarily stop the treatment before and after surgery. \n\n \n\n• you experience fits (seizures). If you experience changes in your vision or confusion, your doctor \nmay stop your treatment with ZALTRAP. \n\n \n\n• you are 65 years of age or older and experience diarrhoea, dizziness, weakness, weight loss, or \nsevere loss of body fluids (called ‘dehydration’). Your doctor should monitor you carefully. \n\n \n\n• your level of everyday activities is limited or worsens on treatment. Your doctor should monitor \nyou carefully. \n\n \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \n\nyou are given ZALTRAP and during your treatment.  \n\n \n\nDuring treatment, your doctor will perform a number of tests to monitor the function of your body and \n\nhow the medicine is working. Tests may include blood and urine tests, x-ray or other scanning \n\ntechniques and/or other tests. \n\n \n\nZALTRAP is given by a drip (infusion) into one of your veins (‘intra-venous’) to treat advanced \n\ncancers of the colon or rectum. ZALTRAP must not be injected into the eye, since it may severely \n\ndamage it. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents  \n\nThis medicine is not for children or adolescents under the age of 18 years because the safety and \n\nbenefit of using ZALTRAP in children and adolescents have not been shown.  \n\n \n\nOther medicines and ZALTRAP \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This may include medicines obtained without a prescription or herbal medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nYou should not use ZALTRAP during pregnancy unless you and your doctor decide that the benefit \n\nfor you is greater than any possible risk to you or your unborn baby. \n\nIf you are a woman that could become pregnant you should use effective contraception (see \n\n“Contraception” section below for details on male and female contraception). This medicine may harm \n\nyour unborn baby since it may stop new blood vessels from forming. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor before being given this medicine if you are breast-feeding. This is because it is not \n\nknown if the medicine passes into breast milk. \n\n \n\nZALTRAP may affect male and female fertility. Talk to your doctor for advice if you plan to have or \n\nfather a child. \n\n \n\nContraception  \n\nMen and women who can father or have children should use effective contraception: \n\n• during treatment with ZALTRAP and  \n\n• for at least 6 months after the last dose of treatment. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nYou may have side effects that affect your sight, concentration or ability to react. If this happens, do \n\nnot drive or use any tools or machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How ZALTRAP is given \n\n \n\nZALTRAP will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse that is experienced in the use of \n\n‘chemotherapy’. It is given by a drip (infusion) into one of your veins (‘intra-venous’). ZALTRAP \n\nmust not be injected into the eye, since it may severely damage it. \n\n \n\nThe medicine must be diluted before it is given. Practical information for handling and administration \n\nof ZALTRAP for doctors, nurses and pharmacists when using this medicine is provided with this \n\nleaflet. \n\n \n\nHow much and how often you will receive treatment \n\n• The drip (infusion) lasts for about 1 hour. \n\n• You will usually be given an infusion once every 2 weeks. \n\n• The recommended dose is 4 mg for each kilogram of your body weight. Your doctor will decide \nthe correct dose for you. \n\n• Your doctor will decide how often you will be given the medicine and if you need a change in the \ndose. \n\n \n\nZALTRAP will be given with other chemotherapy medicines including ‘5-fluorouracil’, ‘folinic acid’, \n\nand ‘irinotecan’. Your doctor will decide the appropriate doses for these other chemotherapy \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nTreatment will continue as long as your doctor thinks the treatment is of benefit to you, and the side \n\neffects are acceptable.  \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nThe side effects listed below were seen when ZALTRAP was given together with chemotherapy.  \n\n \n\nSerious side effects \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor straight away, if you notice any of the following serious side effects - you \n\nmay need urgent medical treatment:  \n\n• Bleeding: Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) - this includes bleeding from the \nnose, but may also include severe bleeding in your gut and other parts of the body, which may lead \n\nto death. Signs may include feeling very tired, weak, and/or dizzy, or having changes in the colour \n\nof your stool. \n\n \n\n• Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores in the mouth or jaw, \n\ndischarge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth: Uncommon \n\n(may affect up to 1 in 100 people) - These symptoms could be signs of bone damage in the jaw \n\n(osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience such symptoms while \n\nbeing treated with ZALTRAP or after stopping treatment. \n\n \n\n• Holes in the gut (also called ‘gastro-intestinal perforation’): Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in \n100 people) - this is a hole in the stomach, food pipe, gut or bowel. This can lead to death. Signs \n\nmay include stomach pain, being sick (vomiting), fever or chills.  \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\n• Connections or passageways inside the body between internal organs and skin or other \ntissues (also called ‘fistula’): Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) - these abnormal \n\ntube-like connections or passageways can form for example, between the gut and your skin. \n\nSometimes, depending on where this happens, you may get an unusual discharge at that place.

The concentrate solution must be clear and \n\nwithout particles.  \n\n• Based on the required dose for the patient, withdraw the necessary volume of ZALTRAP \nconcentrate from the vial. More than one vial could be needed for the preparation of the infusion \n\nsolution.  \n\n• Dilute it to the required administration volume with sodium chloride 9 mg / ml (0.9 %) solution \nor 5 % glucose solution for infusion. The concentration of the final ZALTRAP solution for \n\nintravenous infusion should be kept within the range of 0.6 mg / ml to 8 mg / ml of aflibercept. \n\n• PVC containing DEHP infusion bags or polyolefin infusion bags should be used. \n\n• The diluted solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration \n\nprior to administration. If any discolouration or particulate matter is observed, the \n\nreconstituted solution should be discarded. \n\n• ZALTRAP is a single-use vial. Do not re-enter the vial after the initial puncture. Any unused \n\nconcentrate should be discarded. \n\n \n\nShelf-life after dilution in the infusion bag \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C and for \n\n8 hours at 25°C. \n\n \n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the solution for infusion should be used immediately. \n\nIf not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the \n\nuser and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C unless dilution has taken place in \n\ncontrolled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nZALTRAP is to be administered only as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour. Due to hyperosmolality \n\n(1000 mOsmol / kg) of the ZALTRAP concentrate, undiluted ZALTRAP concentrate must not be \n\nadministered as an intravenous push or bolus. ZALTRAP must not be administered as an intravitreal \n\ninjection (see section 2 of the package leaflet). \n\n \n\nEach vial of concentrate for solution for infusion is for single use (single-dose) only. \n\n \n\nDiluted solutions of ZALTRAP should be administered using infusion sets containing a 0.2 micron \n\npolyethersulfone filter. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\nThe infusion sets should be made of one of the following materials: \n\n• polyvinyl chloride (PVC) containing bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)  \n\n• DEHP free PVC containing trioctyl-trimellitate (TOTM) \n\n• polypropylene  \n\n• polyethylene lined PVC \n\n• polyurethane \n \n\nFilters made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) or nylon must not be used.   \n\n \n\nDisposal \n\nAny unused medicine or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tANNEX II\n\tMANUFACTURER OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVE SUBSTANCE ANDMANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tCONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE\n\tOTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETINGAUTHORISATION\n\tCONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE ANDEFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\n\tANNEX III\n\tA.
