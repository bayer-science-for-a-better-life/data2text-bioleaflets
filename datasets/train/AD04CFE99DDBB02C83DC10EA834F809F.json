CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIrbesartan Teva is indicated in adults for the treatment of essential hypertension. \n \nIt is also indicated for the treatment of renal disease in adult patients with hypertension and type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive medicinal product regimen (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 \nand 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily, with or without food. \nIrbesartan at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure control \nthan 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in \nhaemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of irbesartan can be increased to \n300 mg, or other anti-hypertensive agents can be added (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). In \nparticular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive \neffect with irbesartan (see section 4.5). \n \nIn hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily \nand titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease.  \n \nThe demonstration of renal benefit of irbesartan in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based on \nstudies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach \ntarget blood pressure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose \n(75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no \nclinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly population  \n \nAlthough consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients over 75 years of \nage, dose adjustment is not usually necessary for elderly people. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Irbesartan Teva in children aged 0 to 18 has not been established. Currently \navailable data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \n \nMethod of Administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed insection 6.1. \n\u2022 Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.4 and 4.6). \n\u2022 The concomitant use of Irbesartan Teva with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \n\npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 \nand 5.1). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravascular volume depletion \nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before the administration of irbesartan. \n \nRenovascular hypertension \nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal \n\n\n\n4 \n\nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is not documented with \nirbesartan, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \nWhen irbesartan is used in patients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium \nand creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of \nirbesartan in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. \n \nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease \nThe effects of irbesartan both on renal and cardiovascular events were not uniform across all \nsubgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study with patients with advanced renal disease. In \nparticular, they appeared less favourable in women and non-white subjects (see section 5.1). \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including \nacute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin \nII receptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with \ndiabetic nephropathy. \n \nHyperkalaemia \nAs with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hyperkalaemia \nmay occur during the treatment with irbesartan, especially in the presence of renal impairment, overt \nproteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring of serum potassium in \npatients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nLithium \nThe combination of lithium and irbesartan is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism \nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products \nacting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of irbesartan is not \nrecommended. \n \nGeneral \nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal \ndisease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or \nangiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, \nazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any antihypertensive agent, \nexcessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular \ndisease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nPregnancy \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless \ncontinued AIIRAs therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \n\n\n\n5 \n\nalternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if \nappropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nPaediatric population \nIrbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but the current data are \ninsufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become available (see \nsections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nExcipient \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents \nOther antihypertensive agents may increase the hypotensive effects of irbesartan; however irbesartan \nhas been safely administered with other antihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting \ncalcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in \nvolume depletion and a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with irbesartan (see section 4.4). \n \nPotassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics \nBased on experience with the use of other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, \nconcomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \npotassium or other medicinal products that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may \nlead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium \nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \nrecommended. \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \nWhen angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), \nattenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.   \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions \nIn clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan \nis mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by glucuronidation. No significant \npharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when irbesartan was coadministered \nwith warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as \nrifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of \ndigoxin was not altered by coadministration of irbesartan. \n \nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors \nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) \nthrough the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated \n\n\n\n6 \n\nwith a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal \nfunction (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Inhibitors (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued AIIRAs \ntherapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nanti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRAs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (see section 5.3). \n \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \n \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see also \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of irbersartan during breast-feeding, irbesartan \nis not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during \nbreast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see section 5.3). \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use \nmachines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness \nor weariness may occur during treatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did \nnot differ between the irbesartan (56.2 %) and the placebo groups (56.5 %). Discontinuation due to \n\n\n\n7 \n\nany clinical or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3 %) than \nfor placebo-treated patients (4.5 %). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the \nrecommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. \n \nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic \ndizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5 % of the patients (i.e., uncommon) but in \nexcess of placebo. \n \nThe following presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials in \nwhich 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the \nadverse reactions that were additionally reported in > 2 % of diabetic hypertensive patients with \nchronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria and in excess of placebo. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nAdverse reactions additionally reported from post\u2013marketing experience are also listed. These adverse \nreactions are derived from spontaneous reports.  \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n \nNot known:  thrombocytopenia \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nNot known:  hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, rash, urticaria, anaphylactic reaction, \n\nanaphylactic shock \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n \nNot known:  hyperkalaemia \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nCommon: dizziness, orthostatic dizziness* \nNot known: vertigo, headache \n \nEar and labyrinth disorder \n \nNot known: tinnitus \n \nCardiac disorders \n \nUncommon: tachycardia \n \nVascular disorders \n \nCommon: orthostatic hypotension* \nUncommon: flushing \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n \nUncommon: cough \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n \nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn \nNot known: dysgeusia \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \n \nUncommon: jaundice \nNot known: hepatitis, abnormal liver function \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nNot known: leukocytoclastic vasculitis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n \nCommon: musculoskeletal pain* \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia (in some cases associated with increased plasma creatine kinase \n  levels), muscle cramps \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \n \nNot known: impaired renal function including cases of renal failure in patients at risk (see section 4.4) \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nCommon: fatigue \nUncommon: chest pain \n \nInvestigations \n \nVery common:  Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan \n\nthan with placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and \nnormal renal function, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4 % of the \npatients in the irbesartan 300 mg group and 22 % of the patients in the placebo \ngroup. In diabetic hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt \nproteinuria, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3 % of the patients in the \nirbesartan group and 26.3 % of the patients in the placebo group. \n\nCommon:   significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7 %) in \nirbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with \nidentifiable clinical musculoskeletal events. In 1.7 % of hypertensive patients with \nadvanced diabetic renal disease treated with irbesartan, a decrease in \nhaemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been observed. \n\n \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nIn a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following \nadverse reactions occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache (7.9 %), hypotension (2.2 %), \ndizziness (1.9 %), cough (0.9 %). In the 26-week open-label period of this trial the most frequent \nlaboratory abnormalities observed were creatinine increases (6.5 %) and elevated CK values in 2 % of \nchild recipients. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most \nlikely manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might \nalso occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with \nirbesartan. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and \nsupportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal \nmay be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin-II antagonists, plain. \nATC code: C09C A04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates \nangiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require \nmetabolic activation for its activity. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nHypertension \n \nIrbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is \ndose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of \n150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing) by \nan average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo. \n \nPeak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood \npressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood \npressure was 60-70 % of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended \ndoses. Once daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar to twice \ndaily dosing on the same total dose. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect \noccurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are maintained during long \nterm therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns toward baseline. Rebound \nhypertension has not been observed. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nThe efficacy of irbesartan is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably less \nresponse to irbesartan monotherapy. There is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or \nurinary uric acid secretion. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nReduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low), 1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high) target \ntitrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of \nhypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the \nthree weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable, trough seated systolic \nblood pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mm Hg (low dose), 9.3 mm Hg (medium dose), 13.2 mm Hg (high \ndose). No significant difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough \nseated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mm Hg (low dose), 3.2 mm Hg (medium \ndose), 5.6 mm Hg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized \nto either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mm Hg \nin SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mm Hg changes respectively in those on all doses of \nirbesartan (see section 4.2). \n \nHypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease \n \nThe \u201cIrbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)\u201d shows that irbesartan decreases the progression \nof renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double \nblind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing irbesartan, amlodipine and placebo. In 1,715 \nhypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria \u2265 900 mg/day and serum creatinine ranging \nfrom 1.0-3.0 mg/dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of irbesartan on the progression of renal \ndisease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg to a maintenance \ndose of 300 mg irbesartan, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine, or placebo as tolerated. Patients in all \ntreatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents (e.g., diuretics, beta \nblockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of \u2264 135/85 mm Hg or a \n10 mm Hg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mm Hg. Sixty per cent (60 %) of \npatients in the placebo group reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was 76 % and \n78 % in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced the relative \nrisk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) \nor allcause mortality. Approximately 33 % of patients in the irbesartan group reached the primary \nrenal composite endpoint compared to 39 % and 41 % in the placebo and amlodipine groups [20 % \nrelative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23 % relative risk reduction compared to \namlodipine (p = 0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were analysed, no \neffect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in ESRD and a \nsignificant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed. \n \nSubgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum \ncreatinine, and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black \nsubgroups which represented 32 % and 26 % of the overall study population respectively, a renal \nbenefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary \nendpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups \nin the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a \ndecreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebobased \nregimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the \nirbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart \nfailure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in \nwomen has been identified. \n \nThe study of the \u201cEffects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 \nDiabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)\u201d shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in \npatients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double blind morbidity study in \n\n\n\n11 \n\n590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function \n(serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl in males and < 1.1 mg/dl in females). The study examined the long-term \neffects (2 years) of irbesartan on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria (urinary albumin \nexcretion rate (UAER) > 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30 % from baseline). The \npredefined blood pressure goal was \u2264 135/85 mm Hg. Additional antihypertensive agents (excluding \nACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium blockers) were added \nas needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal. While similar blood pressure was achieved in all \ntreatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2 %) than in the placebo (14.9 %) \nor in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7 %) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a \n70 % relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An accompanying \nimprovement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first three months of \ntreatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early as three months \nand continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day) was more \nfrequent in the irbesartan 300 mg group (34 %) than in the placebo group (21 %). \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. \nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular \ndisease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D \nwas a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. \n \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE- inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \n \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of \napproximately 60-80 %. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability \nof irbesartan.  \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding is approximately 96 %, with negligible binding to cellular blood components. \nThe volume of distribution is 53-93 litres.  \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85 % of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6 %). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the cytochrome \nP450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal \nrecommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations \nare attained at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 \nand 3-3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. \nSteady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing \nregimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20 %) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily \ndosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female \nhypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of \nirbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values \nwere also somewhat greater in elderly subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). \nHowever the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in \nelderly people. \n \nElimination \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20 % of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2 % of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children after the administration \nof single and multiple daily doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg for \nfour weeks. Of those 23 children, 21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults \n(twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that Cmax, AUC \nand clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan \ndaily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18 %) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily \ndosing. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial \n\n\n\n13 \n\nnephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Irbesartan Teva is and what it is used for \n \nIrbesartan Teva belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists.  \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten.  This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan Teva prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower.  \nIrbesartan Teva slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and type 2 \ndiabetes.      \n \nIrbesartan Teva is used in adult patients \n\uf0a7 to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) \n\uf0a7 to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory \n\nevidence of impaired kidney function. \n \n \n2.  What you need to know before you take Irbesartan Teva \n \nDo not take Irbesartan Teva \n\uf0a7 If you are allergic to irbesartan or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\uf0a7 If you are more than 3 months pregnant (it is also better to avoid Irbesartan Teva in early \n\npregnancy - see pregnancy section). \n\uf0a7  if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Irbesartan Teva and if any of the following apply to you: \n\uf0a7 if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n\uf0a7 if you suffer from kidney problems   \n\uf0a7 if you suffer from heart problems   \n\uf0a7 if you receive Irbesartan Teva for diabetic kidney disease.  In this case your doctor may \n\nperform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor \nkidney function.   \n\n\uf0a7 if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics.  \n\n\n\n38 \n\n\uf0a7 if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have   \n  diabetes-related kidney problems \n\n     - aliskiren \n \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading \u201cDo not take Irbesartan Teva\u201d. \n\n  \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan Teva is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).   \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicinal product should not be given to children under 18 years of age because the safety and \nefficacy have not yet been fully established.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1.  What Irbesartan Teva is and what it is used for \n \nIrbesartan Teva belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists.  \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten.  This results in an increase in blood pressure.  Irbesartan Teva prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower.  \nIrbesartan Teva slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and type 2 \ndiabetes.      \n \nIrbesartan Teva is used in adult patients  \n\uf0a7 to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) \n\uf0a7 to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory \n\nevidence of impaired kidney function. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Irbesartan Teva \n \nDo not take Irbesartan Teva \n\uf0a7 if you are allergic to irbesartan or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\uf0a7 if you are more than 3 months pregnant (it is also better to avoid Irbesartan Teva in early \n\npregnancy - see pregnancy section). \n\uf0a7 if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren \n \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Irbesartan Teva and if any of the following apply to you: \n\uf0a7 If you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n\uf0a7 If you suffer from kidney problems   \n\uf0a7 If you suffer from heart problems   \n\uf0a7 If you receive Irbesartan Teva for diabetic kidney disease.  In this case your doctor may \n\nperform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor \nkidney function   \n\n\n\n50 \n\n\uf0a7 If you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics   \n\uf0a7 if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have  \n  diabetes-related kidney problems \n\n   - aliskiren \n \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading \u201cDo not take Irbesartan Teva\u201d. \nYou must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.  Irbesartan Teva is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).   \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicinal product should not be given to children under 18 years of age because the safety and \nefficacy have not yet been fully established. If a child swallows some tablets, contact your doctor \nimmediately. \n \nOther medicines and Irbesartan Teva \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions: \n \nIf you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings \u201cDo not take \nIrbesartan Teva\u201d and \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n\uf0a7 potassium supplements \n\uf0a7 salt substitutes containing potassium \n\uf0a7 potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) \n\uf0a7 medicines containing lithium \n \nIf you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan \nmay be reduced.   \n \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.  Your doctor will \nnormally advise you to stop taking Irbesartan Teva before you become pregnant or as soon as you \nknow you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Irbesartan Teva.  \nIrbesartan Teva is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 \nmonths pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.   \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding.  Irbesartan Teva is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \nyou if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.   \n \nDriving and using machines \nIrbesartan Teva is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines.  However, occasionally \ndizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure.  If you experience these, \ntalk to your doctor before attempting to drive or use machines. \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nIrbesartan Teva contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3.  How to take Irbesartan Teva \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nMethod of administration \nIrbesartan Teva is for oral use.  Swallow the tablets with a sufficient amount of fluid (e.g. one glass of \nwater).  You can take Irbesartan Teva with or without food.  Try to take your daily dose at about the \nsame time each day. It is important that you continue to take Irbesartan Teva until your doctor tells \nyou otherwise. \n \n\uf0a7 Patients with high blood pressure  \n\nThe usual dose is 150 mg once a day. The dose may later be increased to 300 mg once daily \ndepending on blood pressure response. \n\n \n\uf0a7 Patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes with kidney disease \n\nIn patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, 300 mg once daily is the preferred \nmaintenance dose for the treatment of associated kidney disease. \n\n \nThe doctor may advise a lower dose, especially when starting treatment in certain patients such as \nthose on haemodialysis, or those over the age of 75 years. \n \nThe maximal blood pressure lowering effect should be reached 4-6 weeks after beginning treatment. \n \n \nIf you take more Irbesartan Teva than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor immediately.   \n \nIf you forget to take Irbesartan Teva \nIf you accidentally miss a daily dose, just take the next dose as normal.  Do not take a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten dose.   \n  \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

Some of \nthese effects may be serious and may require medical attention.   \n \nAs with similar medicines, rare cases of allergic skin reactions (rash, urticaria), as well as localised \nswelling of the face, lips and/or tongue have been reported in patients taking irbesartan. If you get any \nof these symptoms or get short of breath, stop taking Irbesartan Teva and contact your doctor \nimmediately. \n  \nList of side effects: \n\uf0a7 Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): if you suffer from high blood pressure and \n\ntype 2 diabetes with kidney disease, blood tests may show an increased level of potassium. \n \n\uf0a7 Common (may affect up to 1in 10 people): dizziness, feeling sick/vomiting, fatigue and blood \n\ntests may show raised levels of an enzyme that measures the muscle and heart function (creatine \nkinase enzyme).  In patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes with kidney disease, \n\n\n\n52 \n\ndizziness when getting up from  lying or sitting position, low blood pressure when getting up \nfrom a lying or sitting position, pain in joints or muscles and decreased levels of a protein in the \nred blood cells (haemoglobin) were also reported. \n\n \n\uf0a7 Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): heart rate increased, flushing, cough, diarrhoea, \n\nindigestion/heartburn, sexual dysfunction (problems with sexual performance), chest pain. \n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): feeling of spinning, headache, \ntaste disturbance, ringing in the ears, muscle cramps, pain in joints and muscles, reduced number of \nplatelets, abnormal liver function, increased blood potassium levels, impaired kidney function, \ninflammation of small blood vessels mainly affecting the skin (a condition known as leukocytoclastic \nvasculitis) and severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic shock).

irbesartan or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). if you are more than 3 months pregnant (it is also better to avoid irbesartan teva in early pregnancy - see pregnancy section). if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure lowering medicine containing aliskiren warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before taking irbesartan teva and if any of the following apply to you: if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea if you suffer from kidney problems if you suffer from heart problems if you receive irbesartan teva for diabetic kidney disease. in this case your doctor may perform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor kidney function. if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics. if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: - an ace-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-related kidney problems - aliskiren your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. see also information under the heading \"do not take irbesartan teva\". you must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant. irbesartan teva is not recommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). children and adolescents this medicinal product should not be given to children under 18 years of age because the safety and efficacy have not yet been fully established. if a child swallows some tablets, contact your doctor immediately. other medicines and irbesartan teva tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions: if you are taking an ace-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings \"do not take irbesartan teva\" and \"warnings and precautions\"). you may need to have blood checks if you take: potassium supplements salt substitutes containing potassium potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) medicines containing lithium if you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan may be reduced. pregnancy and breast-feeding pregnancy you must tell your doctor if you think that you

another medicine instead of irbesartan teva. irbesartan teva is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. breast-feeding tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. irbesartan teva is not recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. driving and using machines irbesartan teva is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. however, occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. if you experience these, talk to your
