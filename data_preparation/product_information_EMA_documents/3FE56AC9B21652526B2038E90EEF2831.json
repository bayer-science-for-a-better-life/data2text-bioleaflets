CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKalydeco tablets are indicated:  \n• As monotherapy for the treatment of adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older \n\nand weighing 25 kg or more with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have an R117H CFTR mutation or \none of the following gating (class III) mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane \nconductance regulator (CFTR) gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, \nS1255P, S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n\n• In a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets for the treatment of adults, \nadolescents, and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous \nfor the F508del mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one of the \nfollowing mutations in the CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, \n\n\n\n3 \n\n711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and \n3849+10kbC→T. \n \n\n• In a combination regimen with ivacaftor /tezacaftor /elexacaftor tablets for the treatment of \nadults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous \nfor the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or heterozygous for F508del and have a minimal \nfunction (MF) mutation in the CFTR gene (see section 5.1). \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nKalydeco should only be prescribed by physicians with experience in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. \nIf the patient's genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be \nperformed before starting treatment to confirm the presence of an indicated mutation in the CFTR gene \n(see section 4.1). The phase of the poly-T variant identified with the R117H mutation should be \ndetermined in accordance with local clinical recommendations. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older should be dosed according to Table 1.  \n \nTable 1: Dosing recommendations \n\n Morning Evening \nIvacaftor as monotherapy \n6 years and older, \n≥25 kg One ivacaftor 150 mg tablet One ivacaftor 150 mg \n\ntablet \nIvacaftor in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor \n6 years to <12 years, \n<30 kg One tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg tablet One ivacaftor 75 mg \n\ntablet \n6 years to <12 years, \n≥30 kg One tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg tablet One ivacaftor 150 mg \n\ntablet \n\n12 years and older One tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg tablet One ivacaftor 150 mg \ntablet \n\nIvacaftor in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor \n\n12 years and older \nTwo \nivacaftor 75 mg/tezacaftor 50 mg/elexacaftor 100 \nmg tablets \n\nOne ivacaftor 150 mg \ntablet \n\n  \nThe morning and evening dose should be taken approximately 12 hours apart with fat-containing food \n(see Method of administration). \n \nMissed dose \n \nIf 6 hours or less have passed since the missed morning or evening dose, the patient should be advised \nto take it as soon as possible and then take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. If more than \n6 hours have passed since the time the dose is usually taken, the patient should be advised to wait until \nthe next scheduled dose. \n \nPatients receiving Kalydeco in a combination regimen should be advised not to take more than one \ndose of either medicine at the same time. \n \nConcomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors \n \nWhen co-administered with moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP3A, either as monotherapy or in a \ncombination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, the dose should be \n\n\n\n4 \n\nreduced (see Table 2 for the recommended dose). Dosing intervals should be modified according to \nclinical response and tolerability (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nTable 2: Dosing recommendations for concomitant use with moderate or strong CYP3A \ninhibitors \n\n Moderate CYP3A inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors \nIvacaftor as monotherapy \n6 years \nand older, \n≥25 kg \n\nOne morning tablet of ivacaftor 150 mg once \ndaily.  \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nOne morning tablet of ivacaftor 150 mg \ntwice a week, approximately 3 to 4 days \napart. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nIvacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor \n6 years to \n<12 years,  \n<30 kg \n\nAlternate each morning:  \n- one tablet of tezacaftor \n\n50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg on the first \nday  \n\n- one tablet of ivacaftor 75 mg on the \nnext day.   \n\nContinue alternating tablets each day. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nOne morning tablet of tezacaftor \n50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg twice a week, \napproximately 3 to 4 days apart.  \n \nNo evening dose. \n\n6 years \n<12 years, \n≥30 kg \n\nAlternate each morning:  \n- one tablet of tezacaftor 100 \n\nmg/ivacaftor 150 mg once daily on \nthe first day \n\n- one tablet of ivacaftor 150 mg on the \nnext day.   \n\nContinue alternating each day. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nOne morning tablet of tezacaftor \n100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg twice a week, \napproximately 3 to 4 days apart. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\n12 years \nand older \n\nAlternate each morning: \n- one tablet of \n\ntezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg on \nthe first day \n\n- one tablet of ivacaftor 150 mg on the \nnext day \n\nContinue alternating tablets each day. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nOne morning tablet of tezacaftor \n100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg twice a week, \napproximately 3 to 4 days apart. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nIvacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor \n12 years \nand older \n\nAlternate each morning:  \n- two tablets of \n\nivacaftor 75 mg/tezacaftor 50 mg/elexac\naftor 100 mg on the first day  \n\n- one tablet of ivacaftor 150 mg on the \nnext day  \n\nContinue alternating tablets each day. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nTwo morning tablets of \nivacaftor 75 mg/tezacaftor 50 mg/elexacaf\ntor 100 mg twice a week, approximately 3 \nto 4 days apart. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n \nVery limited data are available for elderly patients treated with ivacaftor (administered as monotherapy \nor in a combination regimen). No dose adjustment specific to this patient population is required (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution is \nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to \n30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for ivacaftor as monotherapy or in a combination regimen in patients \nwith mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A).  \n \nFor patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) the dose of ivacaftor as \nmonotherapy should be reduced to 150 mg once daily.  \n \nFor patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), the dose of ivacaftor as \nmonotherapy should be reduced to 150 mg every other day or less frequently.  \n \nFor use as an evening dose in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or \nivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor see Table 3 for dosing regimen recommendations.  \n \nTable 3: Dosing recommendations for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment  \n\n Moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) Severe (Child-Pugh Class C) \nIvacaftor as monotherapy \n6 years and \nolder, \n≥25 kg \n\nOne morning tablet of \nivacaftor 150 mg once daily.  \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nUse is not recommended unless the benefits are \nexpected to outweigh the risks.  \n \nIf used: one morning tablet of ivacaftor 150 mg every \nother day or less frequently.  \n \nDosing interval should be modified according to \nclinical response and tolerability.  \n \nNo evening dose. \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIvacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor \n6 years to \n<12 years,  \n<30 kg \n\nOne morning tablet of tezacaftor \n50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg once daily.  \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nUse is not recommended unless the benefits are \nexpected to outweigh the risks.  \n \nIf used: one morning tablet of tezacaftor \n50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg once daily or less frequently.  \n \nDosing interval should be modified according to \nclinical response and tolerability.  \n \nNo evening dose. \n\n6 years to \n<12 years, \n≥30 kg \n\nOne morning tablet of tezacaftor \n100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg once \ndaily.  \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nUse is not recommended unless the benefits are \nexpected to outweigh the risks.  \n \nIf used: one morning tablet of tezacaftor \n100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg once daily or less \nfrequently. \n  \nDosing interval should be modified according to \nclinical response and tolerability.  \n \nNo evening dose. \n\n12 years \nand older \n\nOne morning tablet of \ntezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 m\ng once daily. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nUse is not recommended unless the benefits are \nexpected to outweigh the risks.  \n \nIf used: one morning tablet of \ntezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg once daily or less \nfrequently.  \n \nDosing interval should be modified according to \nclinical response and tolerability.  \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nIvacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor  \n12 years \nand older \n\nUse not recommended. \nUse should only be considered \nwhen there is a clear medical need \nand the benefits are expected to \noutweigh the risks. \n \nIf used: alternate each day \nbetween two \nivacaftor 75 mg/tezacaftor 50 mg/\nelexacaftor 100 mg tablets and one \nivacaftor 75 mg/tezacaftor 50 mg/\nelexacaftor 100 mg tablet. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nShould not be used. \n \n \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of ivacaftor have not been established in children less than 4 months of age as \nmonotherapy, neither in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in children less than 6 years of age or in \n\n\n\n7 \n\ncombination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor in children less than 12 years of age. No data are \navailable. \n \nLimited data are available in patients less than 6 years of age with an R117H mutation in the CFTR \ngene. Available data in patients aged 6 years and older are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use.  \n \nPatients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole. The tablets should not be chewed, crushed, \nor broken before swallowing because there are no clinical data currently available to support other \nmethods of administration. \n \nIvacaftor tablets should be taken with fat-containing food. \n \nFood or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment (see section 4.5). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOnly patients with CF who had a G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, \nS549N, S549R gating (class III), G970R or R117H mutation in at least one allele of the CFTR gene \nwere included in studies 1, 2, 5 and 6 (see section 5.1). \n \nIn study 5, four patients with the G970R mutation were included. In three of four patients the change \nin the sweat chloride test was < 5 mmol/L and this group did not demonstrate a clinically relevant \nimprovement in FEV1 after 8 weeks of treatment. Clinical efficacy in patients with the G970R \nmutation of the CFTR gene could not be established (see section 5.1). \n \nEfficacy results from a phase 2 study in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del \nmutation in the CFTR gene showed no statistically significant difference in FEV1 over 16 weeks of \nivacaftor treatment compared to placebo (see section 5.1). Therefore, use of ivacaftor as monotherapy \nin these patients is not recommended. \n \nLess evidence of a positive effect of ivacaftor has been shown for patients with an R117H-7T mutation \nassociated with less severe disease in study 6 (see section 5.1).  \n \nIvacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor should not be prescribed in patients with \nCF who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have a second CFTR mutation not listed in \nsection 4.1. \n \nEffect on liver function tests \n \nModerate transaminase (alanine transaminase [ALT] or aspartate transaminase [AST]) elevations are \ncommon in subjects with CF. Transaminase elevations have been observed in some patients treated \nwith ivacaftor as monotherapy and in combination regimens with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or \nivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. Therefore, liver function tests are recommended for all patients prior \nto initiating ivacaftor, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. For all \npatients with a history of transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver function tests \nshould be considered. In the event of significant elevations of transaminases (e.g., patients with ALT \nor AST > 5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with bilirubin > 2 x ULN), \ndosing should be interrupted, and laboratory tests closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. \n\n\n\n8 \n\nFollowing resolution of transaminase elevations, the benefits and risks of resuming treatment should \nbe considered (see section 4.8). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nUse of ivacaftor, either as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor, is not \nrecommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment unless the benefits are expected to outweigh \nthe risks. Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with ivacaftor in a combination \nregimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. (See Table 3 and sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n \nFor patients with moderate hepatic impairment, use of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with \nivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor is not recommended. Treatment should only be considered when there \nis a clear medical need and the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, it should be used \nwith caution at a reduced dose (see Table 3 and sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nCaution is recommended while using ivacaftor, either as monotherapy or in a combination regimen \nwith tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, in patients with severe renal impairment or \nend-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nPatients after organ transplantation \n \nIvacaftor, either as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or \nivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone organ \ntransplantation. Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for \ninteractions with ciclosporin or tacrolimus. \n \nRash events  \n \nThe incidence of rash events with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with \nivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor was higher in females than in males, particularly in females taking \nhormonal contraceptives. A role for hormonal contraceptives in the occurrence of rash cannot be \nexcluded. For patients taking hormonal contraceptives who develop rash, interrupting treatment with \nivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor and hormonal contraceptives \nshould be considered. Following the resolution of rash, it should be considered if resuming ivacaftor in \na combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor without hormonal contraceptives is \nappropriate. If rash does not recur, resumption of hormonal contraceptives can be considered (see \nsection 4.8).  \n \nInteractions with medicinal products \n \nCYP3A inducers \n \nExposure to ivacaftor is significantly decreased and exposures to elexacaftor and tezacaftor are \nexpected to decrease by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, potentially resulting in the loss of \nivacaftor efficacy; therefore, co-administration of ivacaftor (as monotherapy or in a combination \nregimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) with strong CYP3A inducers is \nnot recommended (see section 4.5).  \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nCYP3A inhibitors \n \nExposure to ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor are increased when co-administered with strong or \nmoderate CYP3A inhibitors. The dose of ivacaftor (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) must be adjusted when used concomitantly \nwith strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see Table 2 and sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nCases of non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts without impact on vision have been reported in \npaediatric patients treated with ivacaftor and ivacaftor-containing regimens. Although other risk \nfactors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible \nrisk attributable to treatment with ivacaftor cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up \nophthalmological examinations are recommended in paediatric patients initiating ivacaftor treatment, \neither as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or \nivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor (see section 5.3). \n \nLactose content \n \nKalydeco contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIvacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp and a \npotential inhibitor of CYP2C9. In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for P-gp.  \n \nMedicinal products affecting the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor \n \nCYP3A inducers \n \nCo-administration of ivacaftor with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased ivacaftor exposure \n(AUC) by 89% and decreased hydroxymethyl ivacaftor (M1) to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. \nCo-administration of ivacaftor (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor \nor ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampicin, rifabutin, \nphenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is recommended when ivacaftor (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen \nwith tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) is used with moderate or weak CYP3A \ninducers.  \n \nCYP3A inhibitors \n \nIvacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A \ninhibitor, increased ivacaftor exposure (measured as area under the curve [AUC]) by 8.5-fold and \nincreased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the ivacaftor dose (as monotherapy or in \na combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) is recommended \nfor co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, \nvoriconazole, telithromycin and clarithromycin (see Table 2 and sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nCo-administration with fluconazole, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A, increased ivacaftor exposure by \n3-fold and increased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the ivacaftor dose (as \nmonotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) \nis recommended for patients taking concomitant moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole, \nerythromycin, and verapamil (see Table 2 and sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCo-administration of ivacaftor with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that \nmoderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure to ivacaftor. Food or drink containing grapefruit \nshould be avoided during treatment with ivacaftor (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, see section 4.2). \n \nPotential for ivacaftor to interact with transporters \n \nIn vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Ivacaftor and its \nmetabolites are substrates of BCRP in vitro. Due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood \nof being excreted intact, co-administration of BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter exposure of \nivacaftor and M1-IVA, while any potential changes in M6-IVA exposures are not expected to be \nclinically relevant.  \n \nCiprofloxacin \n \nCo-administration of ciprofloxacin with ivacaftor did not affect the exposure of ivacaftor. No dose \nadjustment is required when ivacaftor (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) is co-administered with ciprofloxacin. \n \nMedicinal products affected by ivacaftor \n \nAdministration of ivacaftor may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive \nsubstrates of CYP2C9, and/or P-gp, and/or CYP3A which may increase or prolong their therapeutic \neffect and adverse reactions. \n \nCYP2C9 substrates \n \nIvacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, monitoring of the international normalised ratio (INR) is \nrecommended during co-administration of warfarin with ivacaftor (as monotherapy or in a \ncombination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor). Other medicinal \nproducts for which exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal \nproducts should be used with caution. \n \nDigoxin and other P-gp substrates \n \nCo-administration with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold, \nconsistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of ivacaftor (as monotherapy or \nin a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) may increase \nsystemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or \nprolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used concomitantly with digoxin or other \nsubstrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as ciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus or \ntacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used. \n \nCYP3A substrates  \n \nCo-administration with (oral) midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, increased midazolam exposure \n1.5-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of CYP3A by ivacaftor. No dose adjustment of CYP3A \nsubstrates, such as midazolam, alprazolam, diazepam or triazolam, is required when these are \nco-administered with ivacaftor (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor \nor ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor).  \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nHormonal contraceptives \n \nIvacaftor (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or \nivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) has been studied with an oestrogen/progesterone oral contraceptive \nand was found to have no significant effect on the exposures of the oral contraceptive. Therefore, no \ndose adjustment of oral contraceptives is necessary. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ivacaftor in \npregnant women. Animals studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of \nivacaftor during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether ivacaftor and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of ivacaftor into the milk of lactating female \nrats. As such, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to \ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from ivacaftor therapy taking into account the \nbenefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data available on the effect of ivacaftor on fertility in humans. Ivacaftor had an effect on \nfertility in rats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIvacaftor has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Ivacaftor may cause dizziness \n(see section 4.8) and, therefore, patients experiencing dizziness should be advised not to drive or use \nmachines until symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions experienced by patients aged 6 years and older who received \nivacaftor are headache (23.9%), oropharyngeal pain (22.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (22.0%), \nnasal congestion (20.2%), abdominal pain (15.6%), nasopharyngitis (14.7%), diarrhoea (12.8%), \ndizziness (9.2%), rash (12.8%) and bacteria in sputum (12.8%). Transaminase elevations occurred in \n12.8% of ivacaftor-treated patients versus 11.5% of placebo-treated patients. \n \nIn patients aged 2 to less than 6 years the most common adverse reactions were nasal congestion \n(26.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (23.5%), transaminase elevations (14.7%), rash (11.8%), and \nbacteria in sputum (11.8%). \n \nSerious adverse reactions in patients who received ivacaftor included abdominal pain and transaminase \nelevations (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 4 reflects the adverse reactions observed with ivacaftor monotherapy in clinical trials (placebo-\ncontrolled and uncontrolled studies) in which the length of exposure to ivacaftor ranged from 16 weeks \nto 144 weeks. Additional adverse reactions observed with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor and/or in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor are also \nprovided in Table 4. The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very \nrare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 4: Adverse reactions \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reactions Frequency \nInfections and infestations Upper respiratory tract infection very common \n\nNasopharyngitis very common \nInfluenza † common  \nRhinitis common \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nHypoglycaemia †  common  \n\nNervous system disorders Headache very common \nDizziness very common \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Ear pain common \nEar discomfort common \nTinnitus common \nTympanic membrane hyperaemia common \nVestibular disorder common \nEar congestion uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nOropharyngeal pain very common \nNasal congestion very common \nAbnormal breathing † common  \nRhinorrhoea † common  \nSinus congestion common \nPharyngeal erythema common \nWheezing † uncommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain very common \nDiarrhoea very common \nAbdominal pain upper † common \nFlatulence † common  \nNausea * common \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Transaminase elevations very common \nAlanine aminotransferase \nincreased † \n\ncommon \n\nAspartate aminotransferase \nincreased † \n\ncommon  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRash very common \nAcne † common \nPruritus † common  \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders \n\nBreast mass common \nBreast inflammation uncommon \nGynaecomastia uncommon \n\n\n\n13 \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reactions Frequency \nNipple disorder uncommon \nNipple pain uncommon \n\nInvestigations Bacteria in sputum very common \nBlood creatine phosphokinase \nincreased † \n\ncommon \n\nBlood pressure increased † uncommon  \n* Adverse reaction and frequency reported from clinical studies with ivacaftor in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor \n† Adverse reaction and frequency reported from clinical studies with ivacaftor in combination with \n\nivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nTransaminase elevations  \n \nDuring the 48-week placebo-controlled studies 1 and 2 of ivacaftor as monotherapy in patients aged \n6 years and older, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) > 8, > 5 or > 3 x ULN was \n3.7%, 3.7% and 8.3% in ivacaftor-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.9% and 8.7% in placebo-treated \npatients, respectively. Two patients, one on placebo and one on ivacaftor permanently discontinued \ntreatment for elevated transaminases, each > 8 x ULN. No ivacaftor-treated patients experienced a \ntransaminase elevation > 3 x ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN. In \nivacaftor-treated patients, most transaminase elevations up to 5 x ULN resolved without treatment \ninterruption. Ivacaftor dosing was interrupted in most patients with transaminase elevations > 5 x \nULN. In all instances where dosing was interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently \nresumed, ivacaftor dosing was able to be resumed successfully (see section 4.4). \n \nDuring the placebo controlled phase 3 studies (up to 24 weeks) of tezacaftor/ivacaftor, the incidence of \nmaximum transaminase (ALT or AST) > 8, > 5, or > 3 x ULN were 0.2%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor treated patients, and 0.4%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in placebo-treated patients. One patient \n(0.2%) on therapy and 2 patients (0.4%) on placebo permanently discontinued treatment for elevated \ntransaminases. No patients treated with tezacaftor/ivacaftor experienced a transaminase elevation >3 x \nULN associated with elevated total bilirubin >2 x ULN.  \n \nDuring the 24-week, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, these \nfigures were 1.5%, 2.5%, and 7.9% in ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.5%, \nand 5.5% in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of adverse reactions of transaminase elevations \nwas 10.9% in ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor treated patients \nand 4.0% in placebo-treated patients. \n \nRash events \n \nRash events, generally mild to moderate in severity, have been observed with the use of ivacaftor in a \ncombination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor and occurred more frequently in female-\ntreated patients (16.3%) and in those taking hormonal contraceptives (20.5%). See section 4.4. \n \nIncreased creatine phosphokinase  \n \nGenerally transient and asymptomatic increases in creatine phosphokinase were observed in patients \ntreated with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, which did not \nlead to treatment discontinuation. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nIncreased blood pressure \n \nAn increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 3.5 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, \nrespectively was observed in patients treated with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with \nivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety data of ivacaftor as monotherapy were evaluated in 6 patients between 4 months to less than \n6 months of age, 11 patients between 6 months to less than 12 months of age, 19 patients between \n12 months to less than 24 months of age, 34 patients between 2 to less than 6 years of age, 61 patients \nbetween 6 to less than 12 years of age and 94 patients between 12 to less than 18 years of age.  \n \nThe safety profile of ivacaftor (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen) is generally consistent \namong paediatric patients and is also consistent with adult patients. \n \nThe incidence of transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) observed in studies 2, 5 and 6 (patients aged \n6 to less than 12 years), study 7 (patients aged 2 to less than 6 years), and study 8 (patients aged 6 to \nless than 24 months) are described in Table 5. In the placebo controlled studies, the incidence of \ntransaminase elevations were similar between treatment with ivacaftor (15.0%) and placebo (14.6%). \nPeak LFT elevations were generally higher in paediatric patients than in older patients. Across all \npopulations, peak LFT elevations returned to baseline levels following interruption, and in almost all \ninstances where dosing was interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently resumed, \nivacaftor dosing was able to be resumed successfully (see section 4.4). Cases suggestive of positive \nrechallenge were observed. In study 7 ivacaftor was permanently discontinued in one patient. In \nstudy 8 no patients had elevations in total bilirubin or discontinued ivacaftor treatment due to \ntransaminase elevations in either age cohort (see section 4.4 for management of elevated \ntransaminases). \n \nTable 5: Transaminase elevations in patients 4 months to < 12 years treated with ivacaftor as \nmonotherapy \n\n n % of Patients \n> 3 x ULN  \n\n% of Patients \n>5 x ULN \n\n% of Patients \n> 8 x ULN \n\n6 to <12 years 40 15.0% (6) 2.5% (1) 2.5% (1) \n2 to <6 years 34 14.7% (5) 14.7% (5) 14.7% (5) \n12 to <24 months 18 27.8% (5) 11.1% (2) 11.1% (2) \n6 to <12 months 11 9.1% (1) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) \n4 to <6 months 6 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products, ATC code: R07AX02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIvacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR protein, i.e., in vitro ivacaftor increases CFTR channel gating to \nenhance chloride transport in specified gating mutations (as listed in section 4.1) with reduced \nchannel-open probability compared to normal CFTR. Ivacaftor also potentiated the channel-open \nprobability of R117H-CFTR, which has both low channel-open probability (gating) and reduced \nchannel current amplitude (conductance). The G970R mutation causes a splicing defect resulting in \nlittle-to-no CFTR protein at the cell surface which may explain the results observed in subjects with \nthis mutation in study 5 (see Pharmacodynamic effects and Clinical efficacy data). \n \nIn vitro responses seen in single channel patch clamp experiments using membrane patches from \nrodent cells expressing mutant CFTR forms do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic \nresponse (e.g., sweat chloride) or clinical benefit. The exact mechanism leading ivacaftor to potentiate \nthe gating activity of normal and some mutant CFTR forms in this system has not been completely \nelucidated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIvacaftor as monotherapy \n \nIn studies 1 and 2 in patients with the G551D mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene, ivacaftor led to \nrapid (15 days), substantial (the mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 \nwas -48 mmol/L [95% CI -51, -45] and -54 mmol/L [95% CI -62, -47], respectively) and sustained \n(through 48 weeks) reductions in sweat chloride concentration. \n \nIn study 5, part 1 in patients who had a non-G551D gating mutation in the CFTR gene, treatment with \nivacaftor led to a rapid (15 days) and substantial mean change from baseline in sweat chloride \nof -49 mmol/L (95% CI -57, -41) through 8 weeks of treatment. However, in patients with the \nG970R-CFTR mutation, the mean (SD) absolute change in sweat chloride at week 8 was -6.25 \n(6.55) mmol/L. Similar results to part 1 were seen in part 2 of the study. At the 4-week follow-up visit \n(4 weeks after dosing with ivacaftor ended), mean sweat chloride values for each group were trending \nto pre-treatment levels. \n \nIn study 6 in patients aged 6 years or older with CF who had an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene, \nthe treatment difference in mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through 24 weeks of \ntreatment was -24 mmol/L (95% CI -28, -20). In subgroup analyses by age, the treatment difference \nwas -21.87 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.46, -17.28) in patients aged 18 years or older, and -27.63 mmol/L \n(95% CI: -37.16, -18.10) in patients aged 6-11 years. Two patients 12 to 17 years of age were enrolled \nin this study. \n \nIvacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor \n \nIn patients homozygous for the F508del mutation, the treatment difference between ivacaftor in \ncombination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor and placebo in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat \nchloride through week 24, was -10.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.4, -8.8). \n \nIn patients heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation associated with residual \nCFTR activity, the treatment difference in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride \nthrough week 8 was -9.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.7, -7.3) between tezacaftor/ivacaftor and placebo, \nand -4.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -6.7, -2.3) between ivacaftor and placebo. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nIn patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who were homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del \nmutation and a second mutation associated with residual CFTR activity, mean within-group absolute \nchange in sweat chloride from baseline at week 8 was -12.3 mmol/L (95% CI: -15.3, -9.3) in the \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor group. \n \nIvacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor \n \nIn patients with an F508del mutation on one allele and a mutation on the second allele that predicts \neither no production of CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that is not responsive to ivacaftor and \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor, the treatment difference between ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor and placebo for \nmean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -41.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -\n44.4, -39.3). \n \nIn patients homozygous for the F508del mutation, the treatment difference between \nivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor for mean absolute change in sweat chloride \nfrom baseline at week 4 was -45.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -50.1, -40.1). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nIvacaftor as monotherapy \n \nStudies 1 and 2: studies in patients with CF with G551D gating mutations \n \nThe efficacy of ivacaftor has been evaluated in two phase 3 randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, multi-centre studies of clinically stable patients with CF who had the G551D \nmutation in the CFTR gene on at least 1 allele and had FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted. \n \nPatients in both studies were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every \n12 hours with food containing fat for 48 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies (e.g., \ntobramycin, dornase alfa). The use of inhaled hypertonic sodium chloride was not permitted. \n \nStudy 1 evaluated 161 patients who were 12 years of age or older; 122 (75.8%) patients had the \nF508del mutation in the second allele. At the start of the study, patients in the placebo group used \nsome medicinal products at a higher frequency than the ivacaftor group. These medications included \ndornase alfa (73.1% versus 65.1%), salbutamol (53.8% versus 42.2%), tobramycin (44.9% versus \n33.7%) and salmeterol/fluticasone (41.0% versus 27.7%). At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was \n63.6% (range: 31.6% to 98.2%) and mean age was 26 years (range: 12 to 53 years). \n \nStudy 2 evaluated 52 patients who were 6 to 11 years of age at screening; mean (SD) body weight was \n30.9 (8.63) kg; 42 (80.8%) patients had the F508del mutation in the second allele. At baseline, mean \npredicted FEV1 was 84.2% (range: 44.0% to 133.8%) and mean age was 9 years (range: 6 to 12 years); \n8 (30.8%) patients in the placebo group and 4 (15.4%) patients in the ivacaftor group had an FEV1 less \nthan 70% predicted at baseline. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the mean absolute change from baseline in percent \npredicted FEV1 through 24 weeks of treatment. \n \nThe treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in \npercent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 was 10.6 percentage points (8.6, 12.6) in study \n1 and 12.5 percentage points (6.6, 18.3) in study 2. The treatment difference between ivacaftor and \nplacebo for the mean relative change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through \nweek 24 was 17.1% (13.9, 20.2) in study 1 and 15.8% (8.4, 23.2) in study 2. The mean change from \nbaseline through week 24 in FEV1 (L) was 0.37 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.01 L in the placebo \ngroup in study 1 and 0.30 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.07 L in the placebo group in study 2. In both \nstudies, improvements in FEV1 were rapid in onset (day 15) and durable through 48 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nThe treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in \npercent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients 12 to 17 years of age in study 1 was \n11.9 percentage points (5.9, 17.9). The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the \nmean absolute change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients \nwith baseline predicted FEV1 greater than 90% in study 2 was 6.9 percentage points (-3.8, 17.6). \n \nThe results for clinically relevant secondary endpoints are shown in Table 6. \n \nTable 6: Effect of ivacaftor on other efficacy endpoints in studies 1 and 2 \n\nEndpoint \n\nStudy 1 Study 2 \nTreatment \ndifferencea \n(95% CI) P value \n\nTreatment \ndifferencea \n(95% CI) P value \n\nMean absolute change from baseline in CFQ-Rb respiratory domain score (points)c \nThrough week 24 8.1 \n\n(4.7, 11.4) \n< 0.0001 6.1 \n\n(-1.4, 13.5) \n0.1092 \n\nThrough week 48 8.6 \n(5.3, 11.9) \n\n< 0.0001 5.1 \n(-1.6, 11.8) \n\n0.1354 \n\nRelative risk of pulmonary exacerbation \nThrough week 24 0.40d 0.0016 NA NA \nThrough week 48 0.46d 0.0012 NA NA \nMean absolute change from baseline in body weight (kg) \nAt week 24 2.8 \n\n(1.8, 3.7) \n< 0.0001 1.9 \n\n(0.9, 2.9) \n0.0004 \n\nAt week 48 2.7 \n(1.3, 4.1) \n\n0.0001 2.8 \n(1.3, 4.2) \n\n0.0002 \n\nMean absolute change from baseline in BMI (kg/m2) \nAt week 24 0.94 \n\n(0.62, 1.26) \n< 0.0001 0.81 \n\n(0.34, 1.28) \n0.0008 \n\nAt week 48 0.93 \n(0.48, 1.38) \n\n< 0.0001 1.09 \n(0.51, 1.67) \n\n0.0003 \n\nMean change from baseline in z-scores \nWeight-for-age z-score \nat week 48e \n\n0.33 \n(0.04, 0.62) \n\n0.0260 0.39 \n(0.24, 0.53) \n\n< 0.0001 \n\nBMI-for-age z-score at \nweek 48e \n\n0.33 \n(0.002, 0.65) \n\n0.0490 0.45 \n(0.26, 0.65) \n\n< 0.0001 \n\nCI: confidence interval; NA: not analysed due to low incidence of events \na Treatment difference = effect of ivacaftor – effect of placebo \nb CFQ-R: Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised is a disease-specific, health-related quality-of-life measure for CF. \nc Study 1 data were pooled from CFQ-R for adults/adolescents and CFQ-R for children 12 to 13 years of age; Study 2 data \n\nwere obtained from CFQ-R for children 6 to 11 years of age. \nd Hazard ratio for time to first pulmonary exacerbation \ne In subjects under 20 years of age (CDC growth charts) \n \nStudy 5: study in patients with CF with non-G551D gating mutations \n \nStudy 5 was a phase 3, two-part, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study \n(part 1) followed by a 16-week open-label extension period (part 2) to evaluate the efficacy and safety \nof ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 6 years and older who have a G970R or non-G551D gating \nmutation in the CFTR gene (G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P or G1349D). \n \nIn part 1, patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every 12 hours \nwith fat-containing food for 8 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies and crossed over to \nthe other treatment for the second 8 weeks after a 4- to 8-week washout period. The use of inhaled \nhypertonic saline was not permitted. In part 2, all patients received ivacaftor as indicated in part 1 for \n16 additional weeks. The duration of continuous ivacaftor treatment was 24 weeks for patients \n\n\n\n18 \n\nrandomised to part 1 placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence and 16 weeks for patients randomised to \npart 1 ivacaftor/placebo treatment sequence. \n \nThirty-nine patients (mean age 23 years) with baseline FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted (mean FEV1 78% \npredicted [range: 43% to 119%]) were enrolled. Sixty-two percent (24/39) of them carried the \nF508del-CFTR mutation in the second allele. A total of 36 patients continued into part 2 (18 per \ntreatment sequence). \n \nIn part 1 of study 5, the mean FEV1 percent predicted at baseline in placebo-treated patients was \n79.3% while in ivacaftor-treated patients this value was 76.4%. The mean overall post-baseline value \nwas 76.0% and 83.7%, respectively. The mean absolute change from baseline through week 8 in \npercent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 7.5% in the ivacaftor period and -3.2% in the \nplacebo period.

At the follow up visit, 4 weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, the mean (SD) absolute \nchange in percent predicted FEV1 from part 2 week 16 was -7.4% (5.5%). \n \nStudy 3: study in patients with CF with the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene \n \nStudy 3 (part A) was a 16-week, 4:1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group \nphase 2 study of ivacaftor (150 mg every 12 hours) in 140 patients with CF age 12 years and older \nwho were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene and who had FEV1 ≥ 40% \npredicted. \n \nThe mean absolute change from baseline through week 16 in percent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy \nendpoint) was 1.5 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and -0.2 percentage points in the placebo \ngroup. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 1.7 percentage points \n(95% CI -0.6, 4.1); this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). \n \nStudy 4: open-label extension study \n \nIn study 4 patients who completed treatment in studies 1 and 2 with placebo were switched to ivacaftor \nwhile patients on ivacaftor continued to receive it for a minimum of 96 weeks, i.e., the length of \ntreatment with ivacaftor was at least 96 weeks for patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group and at least \n144 weeks for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. \n \nOne hundred and forty-four (144) patients from study 1 were rolled over in study 4, 67 in the \nplacebo/ivacaftor group and 77 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. Forty-eight (48) patients from study 2 \nwere rolled over in study 4, 22 in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 26 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. \n \nTable 8 shows the results of the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 for both groups \nof patients. For patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group baseline percent predicted FEV1 is that of \nstudy 4 while for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group the baseline value is that of studies 1 and 2. \n \nTable 8: Effect of ivacaftor on percent predicted FEV1 in study 4 \n\nOriginal study \nand treatment \ngroup \n\nDuration of ivacaftor \ntreatment (weeks) \n\nAbsolute change from baseline in percent \npredicted FEV1 (percentage points) \n\n  N Mean (SD) \nStudy 1 \n\nIvacaftor 48* 77 9.4 (8.3) \n 144 72 9.4 (10.8) \n\nPlacebo 0* 67 -1.2 (7.8)† \n 96 55 9.5 (11.2) \nStudy 2 \n\nIvacaftor 48* 26 10.2 (15.7) \n 144 25 10.3 (12.4) \n\nPlacebo 0* 22 -0.6 (10.1)† \n 96 21 10.5 (11.5) \n\n* Treatment occurred during blinded, controlled, 48-week phase 3 study. \n† Change from prior study baseline after 48 weeks of placebo treatment. \n \nWhen the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 is compared from study 4 baseline for \npatients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n = 72) who rolled over from study 1, the mean (SD) absolute \nchange in percent predicted FEV1 was 0.0% (9.05), while for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group \n(n = 25) who rolled over from study 2 this figure was 0.6% (9.1). This shows that patients in the \nivacaftor/ivacaftor group maintained the improvement seen at week 48 of the initial study (day 0 \nthrough week 48) in percent predicted FEV1 through week 144. There were no additional \nimprovements in study 4 (week 48 through week 144). \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nFor patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group from study 1, the annualised rate of pulmonary \nexacerbations was higher in the initial study when patients were on placebo (1.34 events/year) than \nduring the subsequent study 4 when patients rolled over to ivacaftor (0.48 events/year across day 1 to \nweek 48, and 0.67 events/year across weeks 48 to 96). For patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group \nfrom study 1, the annualised rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 0.57 events/year across day 1 to \nweek 48 when patients were on ivacaftor. When they rolled over into study 4, the rate of annualised \npulmonary exacerbations was 0.91 events/year across day 1 to week 48 and 0.77 events/year across \nweeks 48 to 96. \n \nFor patients who rolled over from study 2 the number of events was, overall, low. \n \nStudy 6: study in patients with CF with an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene \n \nStudy 6 evaluated 69 patients who were 6 years of age or older; 53 (76.8%) patients had the F508del \nmutation in the second allele. The confirmed R117H poly-T variant was 5T in 38 patients and 7T in \n16 patients. At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was 73% (range: 32.5% to 105.5%) and mean age was \n31 years (range: 6 to 68 years). The mean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in percent \npredicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 2.57 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and \n0.46 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus \nplacebo was 2.1 percentage points (95% CI -1.1, 5.4). \n \nA pre-planned subgroup analysis was conducted in patients 18 years and older (26 patients on placebo \nand 24 on ivacaftor). Treatment with ivacaftor resulted in a mean absolute change in percent predicted \nFEV1 through week 24 of 4.5 percentage points in the ivacaftor group versus -0.46 percentage points \nin the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 5.0 \npercentage points (95% CI 1.1, 8.8). \n \nIn a subgroup analysis in patients with a confirmed R117H-5T genetic variant, the difference in the \nmean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in percent predicted FEV1 between ivacaftor and \nplacebo was 5.3% (95% CI 1.3, 9.3). In patients with a confirmed R117H-7T genetic variant, the \ntreatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo was 0.2% (95% CI -8.1, 8.5). \n \nFor secondary efficacy variables, no treatment differences were observed for ivacaftor versus placebo \nin absolute change from baseline in BMI at week 24 or time to first pulmonary exacerbation. \nTreatment differences were observed in absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score through \nweek 24 (treatment difference of ivacaftor versus placebo was 8.4 [95% CI 2.2, 14.6] points) and for \nthe mean change from baseline in sweat chloride (see Pharmacodynamic effects). \n \nIvacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor \n \nThe efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with \nCF aged 12 years and older was assessed in two clinical studies; a 24 week, randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled study with 504 patients who were homozygous for the F508del mutation; and a \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and ivacaftor-controlled, 2 period, 3 treatment, 8-week \ncrossover study with 244 patients who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second \nmutation associated with residual CFTR activity. The long-term safety and efficacy of the combination \nregimen was also assessed in both patient populations in a 96-week open-label, rollover, long-term \nextension study. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of tezacaftor/ivacaftor for additional \ndata. \n \nThe efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor in \npatients aged 12 years and older was demonstrated in two phase 3 studies, randomised, double blind, \nplacebo-controlled (heterozygous F508del patients, n=403) and active-controlled (homozygous \nF508del patients, n=107) of 24 and 4 weeks of duration, respectively. Heterozygous F508del patients \nhad a minimal function mutation on the second allele defined as one that either leads to no CFTR \nprotein being produced (e.g. Class I) or a CFTR protein that does not function to transport chloride and \nis unlikely to respond to other CFTR modulators (tezacaftor, ivacaftor or the combination of both). \n\n\n\n21 \n\nHomozygous F508del patients received tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor regimen during a 4-week \nopen-label run-in period and were then randomised and dosed to receive ivacaftor in combination with \nivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor during a 4-week double-blind treatment period. Patients from both \nstudies were eligible to enter an open-label, rollover, 96-week study. Refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor for additional data. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIvacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor \n \nThe efficacy and safety in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean age 8.6 years) were assessed in \nan 8-week, double-blind, phase 3 trial with 67 patients who were randomised 4:1 to either ivacaftor in \na combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or a blinding group. Forty-two patients were \nhomozygous for the F508del mutation (F/F) and 12 were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a \nsecond mutation associated with residual CFTR activity (F/RF). Refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of tezacaftor/ivacaftor for additional data. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nKalydeco in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in cystic fibrosis (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF. \n \nAfter oral administration of a single 150 mg dose to healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) \nfor AUC and Cmax were 10600 (5260) ng*hr/mL and 768 (233) ng/mL, respectively. After every \n12-hour dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of ivacaftor were reached by days 3 to 5, with an \naccumulation ratio ranging from 2.2 to 2.9. \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing multiple oral dose administrations of ivacaftor, the exposure of ivacaftor generally \nincreased with dose from 25 mg every 12 hours to 450 mg every 12 hours. When given with fat-\ncontaining food, the exposure of ivacaftor increased approximately 2.5- to 4-fold. When co-\nadministered with tezacaftor and elexacaftor, the increase in AUC was similar (approximately 3-fold \nand 2.5-to 4-fold respectively). Therefore, ivacaftor, administered as monotherapy or in a combination \nregimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, should be administered with \nfat-containing food. The median (range) tmax is approximately 4.0 (3.0; 6.0) hours in the fed state. \n \nIvacaftor granules (2 x 75 mg sachets) had similar bioavailability as the 150 mg tablet when given with \nfat-containing food to healthy adult subjects. The geometric least squares mean ratio (90% CI) for the \ngranules relative to tablets was 0.951 (0.839, 1.08) for AUC0-∞ and 0.918 (0.750, 1.12) for Cmax. The \neffect of food on ivacaftor absorption is similar for both formulations, i.e., tablets and granules. \n \nDistribution \n \nIvacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and \nalbumin. Ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells. After oral administration of \nivacaftor150 mg every 12 hours for 7 days in healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) \napparent volume of distribution was 353 L (122) . \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIvacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is \nprimarily metabolised by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. \n\n\n\n22 \n\nM1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. \nM6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active. \n \nThe effect of the CYP3A4*22 heterozygous genotype on ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor \nexposure is consistent with the effect of co-administration of a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is not \nclinically relevant. No dose-adjustment of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, or elexacaftor is considered necessary. \nThe effect in CYP3A4*22 homozygous genotype patients is expected to be stronger. However, no data \nare available for such patients. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing oral administration in healthy volunteers, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) was eliminated \nin the faeces after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for \napproximately 65% of the total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There was negligible \nurinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent. The apparent terminal half-life was approximately \n12 hours following a single dose in the fed state. The apparent clearance (CL/F) of ivacaftor was \nsimilar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. The mean (± SD) CL/F for a single 150 mg dose was \n17.3 (8.4) L/hr in healthy subjects. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are generally linear with respect to time or dose ranging from \n25 mg to 250 mg. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nFollowing a single dose of 150 mg of ivacaftor, adult subjects with moderately impaired hepatic \nfunction (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had similar ivacaftor Cmax (mean [± SD] of 735 \n[331] ng/mL) but an approximately two-fold increase in ivacaftor AUC0-∞ (mean [± SD] of 16800 \n[6140] ng*hr/mL) compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Simulations for \npredicting the steady-state exposure of ivacaftor showed that by reducing the dosage from \n150 mg q12h to 150 mg once daily, adults with moderate hepatic impairment would have comparable \nsteady-state Cmin values as those obtained with a dose of 150 mg q12h in adults without hepatic \nimpairment.  \n \nIn subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9), ivacaftor \nAUC increased approximately by 50% following multiple doses for 10 days of either tezacaftor and \nivacaftor or of ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor.  \n \nThe impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C, score 10 to15) on the pharmacokinetics \nof ivacaftor as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or \nivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor has not been studied. The magnitude of increase in exposure in these \npatients is unknown but is expected to be higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment.  \n \nFor guidance on appropriate use and dose modification see Table 3 in section 4.2. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with ivacaftor in patients with renal impairment, \neither as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or with \nivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. In a human pharmacokinetic study with ivacaftor monotherapy, there \nwas minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was \n\n\n\n23 \n\nrecovered in the urine). There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent (less \nthan 0.01% following a single oral dose of 500 mg).  \n \nNo dose adjustments are recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment. Caution is \nrecommended when administering ivacaftor, either as monotherapy or in a combination with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor or with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, to patients with severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4). \n \nRace \n \nRace had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of ivacaftor in white (n = 379) and non-white \n(n = 29) patients based on a population PK analysis. \n \nGender \n \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of ivacaftor, either as monotherapy or in combination with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, are similar in males and females. \n \nElderly \n \nClinical studies of ivacaftor as monotherapy did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged \n65 years and older to determine whether pharmacokinetic parameters are similar or not to those in \nyounger adults. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of ivacaftor in combination with tezacaftor in the elderly patients \n(65-72 years) are comparable to those in younger adults. No patients aged 65 years and older were \nincluded in the clinical studies of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor and therefore it cannot be determined \nwhether pharmacokinetic parameters are similar or not to those in younger adults. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPredicted ivacaftor exposure based on observed ivacaftor concentrations in phase 2 and 3 studies as \ndetermined using population PK analysis is presented by age group in Table 9. \n \nTable 9: Mean (SD) ivacaftor exposure by age group \n\nAge group Dose Cmin, ss \n(ng/mL) \n\nAUCτ, ss \n(ng*h/mL) \n\n6 months to less than 12 months (5 kg to < 7 kg) * 25 mg q12h 336 5410 \n\n6 months to less than 12 months (7 kg to < 14 kg) 50 mg q12h 508 (252) 9140 (4200) \n\n12 months to less than 24 months (7 kg to < 14 kg) 50 mg q12h 440 (212) 9050 (3050) \n\n12 months to less than 24 months (≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg) 75 mg q12h 451 (125) 9600 (1800) \n\n2- to 5-year-olds (< 14 kg) 50 mg q12h 577 (317) 10500 (4260) \n\n2- to 5-year-olds (≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg) 75 mg q12h 629 (296) 11300 (3820) \n\n6- to 11-year-olds † (≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg) 75 mg q12h 641 (329) 10760 (4470) \n\n6- to 11-year-olds † (≥ 25 kg) 150 mg q12h 958 (546) 15300 (7340) \n\n12- to 17-year-olds 150 mg q12h 564 (242) 9240 (3420) \n\n\n\n24 \n\nAdults (≥ 18 years old)  150 mg q12h 701 (317) 10700 (4100) \n\n* Values based on data from a single patient; standard deviation not reported. \n†\n Exposures in 6- to 11-year-olds are predictions based on simulations from the population PK model using data obtained \n\nfor this age group. \n \nIvacaftor exposure in combination with tezacaftor and with tezacaftor/elexacaftor is presented in \nTable 10. \n \nTable 10: Mean (SD) ivacaftor exposure when used in combination, by age group \n\nAge group Dose Ivacaftor Mean (SD) \nAUC0-12h,ss (ng*h/mL) \n\nChildren (6 years to less than 12 years; \n<30 kg) \nn = 71 \n\ntezacaftor 50 mg qd/ \nivacaftor 75 mg q12h 7100 (1950) \n\nChildren (6 years to less than 12 years;  \n≥30 kg)* \nn = 51 \n\ntezacaftor 100 mg qd/ \nivacaftor 150 mg q12h 11800 (3890) \n\nAdolescent patients (12 to less than18 \nyears)  \nn = 97 tezacaftor 100 mg qd/  \n\nivacaftor 150 mg q12h \n\n11400 (5500) \n\nAdult patients (18 years and older) \nn = 389 11400 (4140) \n\nAdolescent patients (12 to less than \n18 years) \nn = 69 \n\nelexacaftor 200 mg qd/ \ntezacaftor 100 mg qd/ \nivacaftor 150 mg q12h \n\n10600 (3350) \n\nAdult patients (18 years and older) \nn = 186 12100 (4170) \n\n* Exposures in ≥30 kg to <40 kg weight range are predictions derived from the population PK model. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. \n \nPregnancy and fertility \n \nIvacaftor was associated with slight decreases of the seminal vesicle weights, a decrease of overall \nfertility index and number of pregnancies in females mated with treated males and significant \nreductions in number of corpora lutea and implantation sites with subsequent reductions in the average \nlitter size and average number of viable embryos per litter in treated females. The \nNo-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for fertility findings provides an exposure level of \napproximately 4 times the systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as \nivacaftor monotherapy in adult humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). \nPlacental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. \n \nPeri- and post-natal development \n \nIvacaftor decreased survival and lactation indices and caused a reduction in pup body weights. The \nNOAEL for viability and growth in the offspring provides an exposure level of approximately 3 times \nthe systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as ivacaftor monotherapy in \nadult humans at the MRHD.  \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nJuvenile animal studies \n \nFindings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal day 7 through 35 at ivacaftor \nexposure levels of 0.22 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites \nwhen administered as ivacaftor monotherapy. This finding has not been observed in foetuses derived \nfrom rat dams treated with ivacaftor on gestation days 7 to 17, in rat pups exposed to ivacaftor through \nmilk ingestion up to postnatal day 20, in 7-week old rats, nor in 3.5 to 5-month old dogs treated with \nivacaftor. The potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGranules in sachet \n \nWhite to off-white granules approximately 2 mm in diameter. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKalydeco granules are indicated for the treatment of infants aged at least 4 months, toddlers and \nchildren weighing 5 kg to less than 25 kg with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have an R117H CFTR \nmutation or one of the following gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, \nG1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nKalydeco should only be prescribed by physicians with experience in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. \nIf the patient's genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be \n\n\n\n28 \n\nperformed before starting treatment to confirm the presence of an indicated mutation in at least one \nallele of the CFTR gene (see section 4.1). The phase of the poly-T variant identified with the R117H \nmutation should be determined in accordance with local clinical recommendation. \n \nPosology \n \nInfants aged at least 4 months, toddlers, children, adolescents and adults should be dosed according to \nTable 1. \n \nTable 1: Dosing recommendations for patients aged 4 months and older \n\nAge Weight Dose Total daily dose \n4 months to less \nthan 6 months \n\n≥ 5 kg 25 mg granules taken orally every \n12 hours with fat-containing food \n\n50 mg \n\n6 months and \nolder \n\n≥ 5 kg to < 7 kg 25 mg granules taken orally every \n12 hours with fat-containing food \n\n50 mg \n\n≥ 7 kg to < 14 kg 50 mg granules taken orally every \n12 hours with fat-containing food \n\n100 mg \n\n≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg 75 mg granules taken orally every \n12 hours with fat-containing food \n\n150 mg \n\n≥ 25 kg See Kalydeco tablets SmPC for further details. \n \nMissed dose \n \nIf 6 hours or less have passed since the missed morning or evening dose, the patient should be advised \nto take it as soon as possible and then take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. If more than \n6 hours have passed since the time the dose is usually taken, the patient should be advised to wait until \nthe next scheduled dose. \n \nConcomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors \n \nWhen co-administered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A in patients aged 6 months and older, the \nivacaftor dose should be reduced to one sachet (ivacaftor 25 mg for patients 5 kg to < 7 kg; ivacaftor \n50 mg for patients 7 kg to < 14 kg; ivacaftor 75 mg for patients 14 kg to < 25 kg) twice a week (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nWhen co-administered with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A in patients aged 6 months and older, the \nivacaftor dose is as above recommended but administered once daily (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nDue to the variability in maturation of the cytochrome (CYP) enzymes involved in ivacaftor \nmetabolism, treatment with ivacaftor is not recommended when co-administered with moderate or \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A in patients aged 4 months to less than 6 months, unless the benefits \noutweigh the risks. In such cases, the recommended dose is one packet of 25 mg granules twice \nweekly or less frequently (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Dosing intervals should be modified according to \nclinical response and tolerability (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \n \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution is \nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to \n30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients aged 6 months and older with mild hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class A). For patients aged 6 months and older with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class B), a reduced dose of one sachet (ivacaftor 25 mg for patients 5 kg to < 7 kg; \nivacaftor 50 mg for patients 7 kg to < 14 kg; ivacaftor 75 mg for patients 14 kg to < 25 kg) once daily \nis recommended. There is no experience of the use of ivacaftor in patients aged 6 months and older \nwith severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, its use is not recommended unless the \nbenefits outweigh the risks. In such cases, the starting dose should be as above recommended, \nadministered every other day. Dosing intervals should be modified according to clinical response and \ntolerability (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nDue to variability in maturation of cytochrome (CYP) enzymes involved in ivacaftor metabolism, \ntreatment with ivacaftor is not recommended in patients aged 4 months to less than 6 months with \nhepatic impairment, unless the benefits outweigh the risks. In such cases, the recommended dose is \none sachet (ivacaftor 25 mg) once daily or less frequently. Dosing intervals should be modified \naccording to clinical response and tolerability (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of ivacaftor in children aged less than 4 months have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nLimited data are available in patients less than 6 years of age with an R117H mutation in the CFTR \ngene. Available data in patients aged 6 years and older are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor oral use. \n \nEach sachet is for single use only. \n \nEach sachet of granules should be mixed with 5 mL of age-appropriate soft food or liquid and \ncompletely and immediately consumed. Food or liquid should be at room temperature or below. If not \nimmediately consumed, the mixture has been shown to be stable for one hour and therefore should be \ningested during this period. A fat-containing meal or snack should be consumed just before or just \nafter dosing. \n \nFood or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment (see section 4.5). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOnly patients with CF who had a G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N \nor S549R gating (class III) or G970R mutation in at least one allele of the CFTR gene were included in \nstudies 1, 2, 5 and 7 (see section 5.1). \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \nLess evidence of a positive effect of ivacaftor has been shown for patients with an R117H-7T mutation \nassociated with less severe disease in study 6 (see section 5.1). \n \nIn study 5, four patients with the G970R mutation were included. In three of four patients the change \nin the sweat chloride test was < 5 mmol/L and this group did not demonstrate a clinically relevant \nimprovement in FEV1 after 8 weeks of treatment. Clinical efficacy in patients with the G970R \nmutation of the CFTR gene could not be established (see section 5.1). \n \nEfficacy results from a phase 2 study in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del \nmutation in the CFTR gene showed no statistically significant difference in FEV1 over 16 weeks of \nivacaftor treatment compared to placebo (see section 5.1). Therefore, use of ivacaftor as monotherapy \nin these patients is not recommended. \n \nEffect on liver function tests \n \nModerate transaminase (alanine transaminase [ALT] or aspartate transaminase [AST]) elevations are \ncommon in subjects with CF. Transaminase elevations have been observed in some patients treated \nwith ivacaftor as monotherapy. Therefore, liver function tests are recommended for all patients prior to \ninitiating ivacaftor, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. For all \npatients with a history of transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver function tests \nshould be considered. In the event of significant elevations of transaminases (e.g., patients with ALT \nor AST > 5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with bilirubin > 2 x ULN), \ndosing should be interrupted, and laboratory tests closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. \nFollowing resolution of transaminase elevations, the benefits and risks of resuming treatment should \nbe considered (see section 4.8). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nUse of ivacaftor is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment unless the benefits are \nexpected to outweigh the risks (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). No safety data are available in infants aged 4 \nto less than 12 months of age with moderate or severe hepatic impairment treated with ivacaftor. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nCaution is recommended while using ivacaftor in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage \nrenal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nPatients after organ transplantation \n \nIvacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone organ transplantation. \nTherefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for interactions with \nciclosporin or tacrolimus. \n \nInteractions with medicinal products \n \nCYP3A inducers  \n \nExposure to ivacaftor is significantly decreased by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, \npotentially resulting in the loss of ivacaftor efficacy; therefore, co-administration of ivacaftor with \nstrong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nCYP3A inhibitors  \n \nExposure to ivacaftor is increased when co-administered with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. \nThe dose of ivacaftor must be adjusted when used concomitantly with strong or moderate CYP3A \ninhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). No safety data are available in infants aged 4 to less than \n\n\n\n31 \n\n12 months of age who are treated with ivacaftor and moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.5). \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nCases of non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts without impact on vision have been reported in \npaediatric patients treated with ivacaftor. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such \nas corticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to treatment with ivacaftor \ncannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in \npaediatric patients initiating ivacaftor treatment. \n \nLactose content \n \nKalydeco contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIvacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp and a \npotential inhibitor of CYP2C9. In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for P-gp.  \n \nMedicinal products affecting the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor \n \nCYP3A inducers \n \nCo-administration of ivacaftor with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased ivacaftor exposure \n(AUC) by 89% and decreased hydroxymethyl ivacaftor (M1) to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. \nCo-administration of ivacaftor with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampicin, rifabutin, \nphenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is recommended when ivacaftor is used with moderate or weak CYP3A inducers.  \n \nCYP3A inhibitors \n \nIvacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A \ninhibitor, increased ivacaftor exposure (measured as area under the curve [AUC]) by 8.5-fold and \nincreased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the ivacaftor dose is recommended for \nco-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, \nvoriconazole, telithromycin and clarithromycin (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCo-administration with fluconazole, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A, increased ivacaftor exposure by \n3-fold and increased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the ivacaftor dose is \nrecommended for patients taking concomitant moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole, \nerythromycin, and verapamil (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCo-administration of ivacaftor with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that \nmoderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure to ivacaftor. Food or drink containing grapefruit \nshould be avoided during treatment with ivacaftor (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nPotential for ivacaftor to interact with transporters \n \nIn vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Ivacaftor and its \nmetabolites are substrates of BCRP in vitro. Due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood \nof being excreted intact, co-administration of BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter exposure of \nivacaftor and M1-IVA, while any potential changes in M6-IVA exposures are not expected to be \nclinically relevant.  \n \nCiprofloxacin \n \nCo-administration of ciprofloxacin with ivacaftor did not affect the exposure of ivacaftor. No dose \nadjustment is required when ivacaftor is co-administered with ciprofloxacin. \n \nMedicinal products affected by ivacaftor \n \nAdministration of ivacaftor may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive \nsubstrates of CYP2C9, and/or P-gp, and/or CYP3A which may increase or prolong their therapeutic \neffect and adverse reactions. \n \nCYP2C9 substrates \n \nIvacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, monitoring of the international normalised ratio (INR) is \nrecommended during co-administration of warfarin with ivacaftor. Other medicinal products for which \nexposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal products should be used \nwith caution. \n \nDigoxin and other P-gp substrates \n \nCo-administration with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold, \nconsistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of ivacaftor may increase \nsystemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or \nprolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used concomitantly with digoxin or other \nsubstrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as ciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus or \ntacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used. \n \nCYP3A substrates  \n \nCo-administration with (oral) midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, increased midazolam exposure \n1.5-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of CYP3A by ivacaftor. No dose adjustment of CYP3A \nsubstrates, such as midazolam, alprazolam, diazepam or triazolam, is required when these are co-\nadministered with ivacaftor.  \n \nHormonal contraceptives \n \nIvacaftor has been studied with an oestrogen/progesterone oral contraceptive and was found to have no \nsignificant effect on the exposures of the oral contraceptive. Therefore, no dose adjustment of oral \ncontraceptives is necessary. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.  \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ivacaftor in \npregnant women. Animals studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable avoid the use of \nivacaftor during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether ivacaftor and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of ivacaftor into the milk of lactating female \nrats. As such, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to \ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from ivacaftor therapy taking into account the \nbenefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data available on the effect of ivacaftor on fertility in humans. Ivacaftor had an effect on \nfertility in rats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIvacaftor has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Ivacaftor may cause dizziness \n(see section 4.8) and, therefore, patients experiencing dizziness should be advised not to drive or use \nmachines until symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions experienced by patients aged 6 years and older are headache \n(23.9%), oropharyngeal pain (22.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (22.0%), nasal congestion \n(20.2%), abdominal pain (15.6%), nasopharyngitis (14.7%), diarrhoea (12.8%), dizziness (9.2%), rash \n(12.8%) and bacteria in sputum (12.8%). Transaminase elevations occurred in 12.8% of \nivacaftor-treated patients versus 11.5% of placebo-treated patients. \n \nIn patients aged 2 to less than 6 years the most common adverse reactions were nasal congestion \n(26.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (23.5%), transaminase elevations (14.7%), rash (11.8%), and \nbacteria in sputum (11.8%). \n \nSerious adverse reactions in patients who received ivacaftor included abdominal pain and transaminase \nelevations (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 2 reflects the adverse reactions observed with ivacaftor in clinical trials (placebo-controlled and \nuncontrolled studies) in which the length of exposure to ivacaftor ranged from 16 weeks to 144 weeks. \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reactions Frequency  \nInfections and infestations Upper respiratory tract \n\ninfection \nvery common \n\nNasopharyngitis very common \nRhinitis  common \n\nNervous system disorders Headache very common \nDizziness very common \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Ear pain common \nEar discomfort common \nTinnitus common \nTympanic membrane \nhyperaemia \n\ncommon \n\nVestibular disorder common \nEar congestion uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nOropharyngeal pain very common \nNasal congestion very common \nSinus congestion  common \nPharyngeal erythema common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain very common \n\nDiarrhoea very common \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Transaminase elevations very common \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRash very common \n\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders \n\nBreast mass common \nBreast inflammation uncommon \nGynaecomastia uncommon \nNipple disorder uncommon \nNipple pain uncommon \n\nInvestigations Bacteria in sputum very common \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nTransaminase elevations \n \nDuring the 48-week placebo-controlled studies 1 and 2 in patients aged 6 years and older, the \nincidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) > 8, > 5 or > 3 x ULN was 3.7%, 3.7% and 8.3% \nin ivacaftor-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.9% and 8.7% in placebo-treated patients, respectively. Two \npatients, one on placebo and one on ivacaftor, permanently discontinued treatment for elevated \ntransaminases, each > 8 x ULN. No ivacaftor-treated patients experienced a transaminase elevation \n> 3 x ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN. In ivacaftor-treated patients, most \ntransaminase elevations up to 5 x ULN resolved without treatment interruption. Ivacaftor dosing was \ninterrupted in most patients with transaminase elevations > 5 x ULN. In all instances where dosing \nwas interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently resumed, ivacaftor dosing was able to be \nresumed successfully (see section 4.4). \n \nDuring the placebo controlled phase 3 studies (up to 24 weeks) of tezacaftor/ivacaftor, the incidence of \nmaximum transaminase (ALT or AST) > 8, > 5, or > 3 x ULN were 0.2%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor treated patients, and 0.4%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in placebo-treated patients. One patient \n(0.2%) on therapy and 2 patients (0.4%) on placebo permanently discontinued treatment for elevated \ntransaminases. No patients treated with tezacaftor/ivacaftor experienced a transaminase elevation >3 x \nULN associated with elevated total bilirubin >2 x ULN.  \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nDuring the 24-week, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, these \nfigures were 1.5%, 2.5%, and 7.9% in ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.5%, \nand 5.5% in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of adverse reactions of transaminase elevations \nwas 10.9% in ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor treated patients \nand 4.0% in placebo-treated patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety data of ivacaftor were evaluated in 6 patients between 4 months to less than 6 months of \nage, 11 patients between 6 months to less than 12 months of age, 19 patients between 12 months to \nless than 24 months of age, 34 patients between 2 to less than 6 years of age, 61 patients between 6 to \nless than 12 years of age and 94 patients between 12 to less than 18 years of age. \n \nThe safety profile is generally consistent among paediatric patients aged 4 months and older and is \nalso consistent with adult patients. \n \nThe incidence of transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) observed in studies 2, 5 and 6 (patients aged 6 \nto less than 12 years), study 7 (patients aged 2 to less than 6 years), and study 8 (patients aged 6 to less \nthan 24 months) are described in Table 3. In the placebo controlled studies, the incidence of \ntransaminase elevations were similar between treatment with ivacaftor (15.0%) and placebo (14.6%). \nPeak LFT elevations were generally higher in paediatric patients than in older patients. Across all \npopulations, peak LFT elevations returned to baseline levels following interruption, and in almost all \ninstances where dosing was interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently resumed, \nivacaftor dosing was able to be resumed successfully (see section 4.4). Cases suggestive of positive \nrechallenge were observed. In study 7 ivacaftor was permanently discontinued in one patient. In study \n8 no patients had elevations in total bilirubin or discontinued ivacaftor treatment due to transaminase \nelevations in either age cohort (see section 4.4 for management of elevated transaminases). \n \nTable 3: Transaminase elevations in patients 4 months to < 12 years treated with ivacaftor as \nmonotherapy \n\n n % of Patients \n> 3 x ULN  \n\n% of Patients \n>5 x ULN \n\n% of Patients \n> 8 x ULN \n\n6 to <12 years 40 15.0% (6) 2.5% (1) 2.5% (1) \n2 to <6 years 34 14.7% (5) 14.7% (5) 14.7% (5) \n12 to <24 months 18 27.8% (5) 11.1% (2) 11.1% (2) \n6 to <12 months 11 9.1% (1) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) \n4 to <6 months 6 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific antidote is available for overdose with ivacaftor. Treatment of overdose consists of general \nsupportive measures including monitoring of vital signs, liver function tests and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n36 \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products, ATC code: R07AX02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIvacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR protein, i.e., in vitro ivacaftor increases CFTR channel gating to \nenhance chloride transport in specified gating mutations (as listed in section 4.1) with reduced \nchannel-open probability compared to normal CFTR. Ivacaftor also potentiated the channel-open \nprobability of R117H-CFTR, which has both low channel-open probability (gating) and reduced \nchannel current amplitude (conductance). The G970R mutation causes a splicing defect resulting in \nlittle-to-no CFTR protein at the cell surface which may explain the results observed in subjects with \nthis mutation in study 5 (see Pharmacodynamic effects and Clinical efficacy data).  \n \nIn vitro responses seen in single channel patch clamp experiments using membrane patches from \nrodent cells expressing mutant CFTR forms do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic \nresponse (e.g., sweat chloride) or clinical benefit. The exact mechanism leading ivacaftor to potentiate \nthe gating activity of normal and some mutant CFTR forms in this system has not been completely \nelucidated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn studies 1 and 2 in patients with the G551D mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene, ivacaftor led to \nrapid (15 days), substantial (the mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 \nwas -48 mmol/L [95% CI -51, -45] and -54 mmol/L [95% CI -62, -47], respectively) and sustained \n(through 48 weeks) reductions in sweat chloride concentration. \n \nIn study 5, part 1 in patients who had a non-G551D gating mutation in the CFTR gene, treatment with \nivacaftor led to a rapid (15 days) and substantial mean change from baseline in sweat chloride \nof -49 mmol/L (95% CI -57, -41) through 8 weeks of treatment. However, in patients with the \nG970R-CFTR mutation, the mean (SD) absolute change in sweat chloride at week 8 was -6.25 \n(6.55) mmol/L. Similar results to part 1 were seen in part 2 of the study. At the 4-week follow-up visit \n(4 weeks after dosing with ivacaftor ended), mean sweat chloride values for each group were trending \nto pre-treatment levels. \n \nIn study 6 in patients aged 6 years or older with CF who had an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene, \nthe treatment difference in mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through 24 weeks of \ntreatment was -24 mmol/L (95% CI -28, -20). In subgroup analyses by age, the treatment difference \nwas -21.87 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.46, -17.28) in patients aged 18 years or older, and -27.63 mmol/L \n(95% CI: -37.16, -18.10) in patients aged 6-11 years. Two patients 12 to 17 years of age were enrolled \nin this study. \n \nIn study 7 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years with a gating mutation on at least 1 allele of the CFTR \ngene administered either 50 mg or 75 mg of ivacaftor twice daily, the mean absolute change from \nbaseline in sweat chloride was -47 mmol/L (95% CI -58, -36) at week 24. \n \nIn study 8 in patients with CF aged less than 24 months, the mean absolute change from baseline in \nsweat chloride was -65.1 mmol/L (95% CI -74.1, -56.0) at week 24. Results were consistent in the \n12 months to less than 24 months, 6 months to less than 12 months, and 4 months to less than 6 \nmonths age cohorts. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nStudies 1 and 2: studies in patients with CF with G551D gating mutations \n \nThe efficacy of ivacaftor has been evaluated in two phase 3 randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, multi-centre studies of clinically stable patients with CF who had the G551D \nmutation in the CFTR gene on at least 1 allele and had FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted. \n \nPatients in both studies were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every \n12 hours with food containing fat for 48 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies (e.g., \ntobramycin, dornase alfa). The use of inhaled hypertonic sodium chloride was not permitted. \n \nStudy 1 evaluated 161 patients who were 12 years of age or older; 122 (75.8%) patients had the \nF508del mutation in the second allele. At the start of the study, patients in the placebo group used \nsome medicinal products at a higher frequency than the ivacaftor group. These medications included \ndornase alfa (73.1% versus 65.1%), salbutamol (53.8% versus 42.2%), tobramycin (44.9% versus \n33.7%) and salmeterol/fluticasone (41.0% versus 27.7%). At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was \n63.6% (range: 31.6% to 98.2%) and mean age was 26 years (range: 12 to 53 years). \n \nStudy 2 evaluated 52 patients who were 6 to 11 years of age at screening; mean (SD) body weight was \n30.9 (8.63) kg; 42 (80.8%) patients had the F508del mutation in the second allele. At baseline, mean \npredicted FEV1 was 84.2% (range: 44.0% to 133.8%) and mean age was 9 years (range: 6 to 12 years); \n8 (30.8%) patients in the placebo group and 4 (15.4%) patients in the ivacaftor group had an FEV1 less \nthan 70% predicted at baseline. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the mean absolute change from baseline in percent \npredicted FEV1 through 24 weeks of treatment. \n \nThe treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in \npercent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 was 10.6 percentage points (8.6, 12.6) in \nstudy 1 and 12.5 percentage points (6.6, 18.3) in study 2. The treatment difference between ivacaftor \nand placebo for the mean relative change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through \nweek 24 was 17.1% (13.9, 20.2) in study 1 and 15.8% (8.4, 23.2) in study 2. The mean change from \nbaseline through week 24 in FEV1 (L) was 0.37 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.01 L in the placebo \ngroup in study 1 and 0.30 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.07 L in the placebo group in study 2. In both \nstudies, improvements in FEV1 were rapid in onset (day 15) and durable through 48 weeks. \n \nThe treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in \npercent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients 12 to 17 years of age in study 1 was \n11.9 percentage points (5.9, 17.9). The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the \nmean absolute change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients \nwith baseline predicted FEV1 greater than 90% in study 2 was 6.9 percentage points (-3.8, 17.6). \n \nThe results for clinically relevant secondary endpoints are shown in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Effect of ivacaftor on other efficacy endpoints in studies 1 and 2 \n\nEndpoint \n\nStudy 1 Study 2 \nTreatment \ndifferencea \n(95% CI) P value \n\nTreatment \ndifferencea \n(95% CI) P value \n\nMean absolute change from baseline in CFQ-Rb respiratory domain score (points)c \nThrough week 24 8.1 \n\n(4.7, 11.4) \n< 0.0001 6.1 \n\n(-1.4, 13.5) \n0.1092 \n\nThrough week 48 8.6 \n(5.3, 11.9) \n\n< 0.0001 5.1 \n(-1.6, 11.8) \n\n0.1354 \n\n\n\n38 \n\nEndpoint \n\nStudy 1 Study 2 \nTreatment \ndifferencea \n(95% CI) P value \n\nTreatment \ndifferencea \n(95% CI) P value \n\nRelative risk of pulmonary exacerbation \nThrough week 24 0.40d 0.0016 NA NA \nThrough week 48 0.46d 0.0012 NA NA \nMean absolute change from baseline in body weight (kg) \nAt week 24 2.8 \n\n(1.8, 3.7) \n< 0.0001 1.9 \n\n(0.9, 2.9) \n0.0004 \n\nAt week 48 2.7 \n(1.3, 4.1) \n\n0.0001 2.8 \n(1.3, 4.2) \n\n0.0002 \n\nMean absolute change from baseline in BMI (kg/m2) \nAt week 24 0.94 \n\n(0.62, 1.26) \n< 0.0001 0.81 \n\n(0.34, 1.28) \n0.0008 \n\nAt week 48 0.93 \n(0.48, 1.38) \n\n< 0.0001 1.09 \n(0.51, 1.67) \n\n0.0003 \n\nMean change from baseline in z-scores \nWeight-for-age z-score \nat week 48e \n\n0.33 \n(0.04, 0.62) \n\n0.0260 0.39 \n(0.24, 0.53) \n\n< 0.0001 \n\nBMI-for-age z-score at \nweek 48e \n\n0.33 \n(0.002, 0.65) \n\n0.0490 0.45 \n(0.26, 0.65) \n\n< 0.0001 \n\nCI: confidence interval; NA: not analysed due to low incidence of events  \na Treatment difference = effect of ivacaftor – effect of placebo \nb CFQ-R: Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised is a disease-specific, health-related quality-of-life measure for CF. \nc Study 1 data were pooled from CFQ-R for adults/adolescents and CFQ-R for children 12 to 13 years of age; Study 2 data \n\nwere obtained from CFQ-R for children 6 to 11 years of age. \nd Hazard ratio for time to first pulmonary exacerbation \ne In subjects under 20 years of age (CDC growth charts) \n \nStudy 5: study in patients with CF with non-G551D gating mutations \n \nStudy 5 was a phase 3, two-part, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study \n(part 1) followed by a 16-week open-label extension period (part 2) to evaluate the efficacy and safety \nof ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 6 years and older who have a G970R or non-G551D gating \nmutation in the CFTR gene (G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P or G1349D). \n \nIn part 1, patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every 12 hours \nwith fat-containing food for 8 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies and crossed over to \nthe other treatment for the second 8 weeks after a 4- to 8-week washout period. The use of inhaled \nhypertonic saline was not permitted. In part 2, all patients received ivacaftor as indicated in part 1 for \n16 additional weeks. The duration of continuous ivacaftor treatment was 24 weeks for patients \nrandomised to the part 1 placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence and 16 weeks for patients randomised to \npart 1 ivacaftor/placebo treatment sequence. \n \nThirty-nine patients (mean age 23 years) with baseline FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted (mean FEV1 78% \npredicted [range: 43% to 119%]) were enrolled. Sixty-two percent (24/39) of them carried the \nF508del-CFTR mutation in the second allele. A total of 36 patients continued into part 2 (18 per \ntreatment sequence). \n \nIn part 1 of study 5, the mean FEV1 percent predicted at baseline in placebo-treated patients was \n79.3% while in ivacaftor-treated patients this value was 76.4%. The mean overall post-baseline value \nwas 76.0% and 83.7%, respectively. The mean absolute change from baseline through week 8 in \npercent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 7.5% in the ivacaftor period and -3.2% in the \nplacebo period.

The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 1.7 percentage points (95% \nCI -0.6, 4.1); this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). \n \nStudy 4: open-label extension study \n \nIn study 4, patients who completed treatment in studies 1 and 2 with placebo were switched to \nivacaftor while patients on ivacaftor continued to receive it for a minimum of 96 weeks, i.e., the length \nof treatment with ivacaftor was at least 96 weeks for patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group and at \nleast 144 weeks for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. \n \nOne hundred and forty-four (144) patients from study 1 were rolled over in study 4, 67 in the \nplacebo/ivacaftor group and 77 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. Forty-eight (48) patients from study 2 \nwere rolled over in study 4, 22 in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 26 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. \n \nTable 6 shows the results of the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 for both groups \nof patients.

This shows that patients in the \nivacaftor/ivacaftor group maintained the improvement seen at week 48 of the initial study (day 0 \nthrough week 48) in percent predicted FEV1 through week 144. There were no additional \nimprovements in study 4 (week 48 through week 144). \n \nFor patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group from study 1, the annualised rate of pulmonary \nexacerbations was higher in the initial study when patients were on placebo (1.34 events/year) than \nduring the subsequent study 4 when patients rolled over to ivacaftor (0.48 events/year across day 1 to \nweek 48, and 0.67 events/year across weeks 48 to 96). For patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group \nfrom study 1, the annualised rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 0.57 events/year across day 1 to \nweek 48 when patients were on ivacaftor. When they rolled over into study 4, the rate of annualised \npulmonary exacerbations was 0.91 events/year across day 1 to week 48 and 0.77 events/year across \nweeks 48 to 96. \n \nFor patients who rolled over from study 2 the number of events was, overall, low. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nStudy 6: study in patients with CF with an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene \n \nStudy 6 evaluated 69 patients who were 6 years of age or older; 53 (76.8%) patients had the F508del \nmutation in the second allele. The confirmed R117H poly-T variant was 5T in 38 patients and 7T in \n16 patients. At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was 73% (range: 32.5% to 105.5%) and mean age was \n31 years (range: 6 to 68 years). The mean absolute change from baseline through week  24 in percent \npredicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 2.57 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and \n0.46 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus \nplacebo was 2.1 percentage points (95% CI -1.1, 5.4). \n \nA pre-planned subgroup analysis was conducted in patients 18 years and older (26 patients on placebo \nand 24 on ivacaftor). Treatment with ivacaftor resulted in a mean absolute change in percent predicted \nFEV1 through week  24 of 4.5 percentage points in the ivacaftor group versus -0.46 percentage points \nin the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 5.0 \npercentage points (95% CI 1.1, 8.8). \n \nIn a subgroup analysis in patients with a confirmed R117H-5T genetic variant, the difference in the \nmean absolute change from baseline through week  24 in percent predicted FEV1 between ivacaftor \nand placebo was 5.3% (95% CI 1.3, 9.3). In patients with a confirmed R117H-7T genetic variant, the \ntreatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo was 0.2% (95% CI -8.1, 8.5). \n \nFor secondary efficacy variables, no treatment differences were observed for ivacaftor versus placebo \nin absolute change from baseline in BMI at week 24 or time to first pulmonary exacerbation. \nTreatment differences were observed in absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score through \nweek 24 (treatment difference of ivacaftor versus placebo was 8.4 [95% CI 2.2, 14.6] points) and for \nthe mean change from baseline in sweat chloride (see Pharmacodynamic effects). \n \nStudy 7: study in paediatric patients with CF aged 2 to less than 6 years with G551D or another \ngating mutation \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile, safety and efficacy of ivacaftor in 34 patients aged 2 to less than 6 years \nwith CF who had a G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R \nmutation in the CFTR gene were assessed in a 24-week uncontrolled study with ivacaftor (patients \nweighing less than 14 kg received ivacaftor 50 mg and patients weighing 14 kg or more received \nivacaftor 75 mg). Ivacaftor was administered orally every 12 hours with fat-containing food in addition \nto their prescribed CF therapies. \n \nPatients in study 7 were aged 2 to less than 6 years (mean age 3 years). Twenty-six patients out of the \n34 enrolled (76.5%) had a CFTR genotype G551D/F508del with only 2 patients with a non-G551D \nmutation (S549N). The mean (SD) sweat chloride at baseline (n = 25) was 97.88 mmol/L (14.00). The \nmean (SD) faecal elastase-1 value at baseline (n = 27) was 28 µg/g (95). \n \nThe primary endpoint of safety was evaluated through week 24 (see section 4.8). Secondary and \nexploratory efficacy endpoints evaluated were absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride \nthrough 24 weeks of treatment, absolute change from baseline in weight, body mass index (BMI) and \nstature (supported by weight, BMI and stature z-scores) at 24 weeks of treatment, and measures of \npancreatic function such as faecal elastase-1. Data on percent predicted FEV1 (exploratory endpoint) \nwere available for 3 patients in the ivacaftor 50 mg group and 17 patients in the 75 mg dosing group. \n \nThe mean (SD) overall (both ivacaftor dosing groups combined) absolute change from baseline in \nBMI at week 24 was 0.32 kg/m2 (0.54) and the mean (SD) overall change in BMI-for-age z-score was \n0.37 (0.42). The mean (SD) overall change in stature-for-age z-score was -0.01 (0.33). The mean (SD) \noverall change from baseline in faecal elastase-1 (n = 27) was 99.8 µg/g (138.4). Six patients with \ninitial levels below 200 µg/g achieved, at week 24, a level of ≥ 200 µg/g. The mean (SD) overall \nchange in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline at week 24 (exploratory endpoint) was 1.8 (17.81). \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nStudy 8: study in paediatric patients with CF aged less than 24 months \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and efficacy of ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 6 months to \nless than 24 months were assessed in a completed cohort of patients in an on-going 24-week, \nopen-label, phase 3 clinical study in patients aged less than 24 months (study 8). \n \nPart B of study 8 enrolled 19 patients aged 12 months to less than 24 months (mean age 15.2 months at \nbaseline), with 18 patients completing the 24-week treatment period, 11 patients aged 6 months to less \nthan 12 months (mean age 9.0 months at baseline) with all 11 patients completing the 24-week \ntreatment period, and 6 patients aged 4 months to less than 6 months (mean age 4.5 months at \nbaseline) with all 6 patients completing the 24-week treatment period. Patients received ivacaftor \n25 mg, 50 mg or 75 mg according to their age and weight at each study visit (see section 4.2). \nIvacaftor was administered orally every 12 hours with fat-containing food. Patients continued on their \nprescribed standard-of-care CF therapies. \n \nIn part B of study 8 the primary endpoint of safety was evaluated through 24 weeks (see section 4.8). \nSecondary endpoints were evaluation of pharmacokinetics and the absolute change from baseline in \nsweat chloride through 24 weeks of treatment (see Pharmacodynamic effects). Tertiary endpoints \nincluded efficacy measures such as faecal elastase-1 and growth parameters. \n \nFor patients aged 4 months to less than 24 months, with both baseline and week 24 values available, \nmean (SD) weight-for-age, length-for-age, and weight-for-length z-scores are provided in Table 7. \n \nTable 7: Effect of ivacaftor on growth parameters in patients aged 4 months to less than \n\n24 months with baseline and week 24 values \n\nParameter \n\nNumber \nof \n\npatients \n\nBaseline \n \n\nAbsolute change at week 24 \n \n\nMean \n(SD) \n\nMedian \n(min, max) \n\nMean \n(SD) \n\nMedian \n(min, max) \n\nWeight–for-age z-score 35 0.17  \n(0.85) \n\n0.20 \n[-1.92, 1.79] \n\n0.33 \n(0.53) \n\n0.26 \n[-0.54, 1.63] \n\nLength-for-age z-score 34 0.06  \n(1.03)  \n\n0.12 \n[-1.99, 2.79] \n\n0.32 \n(0.92) \n\n0.47 \n[-1.81, 3.38] \n\nWeight-for-length z-score 34 0.24 \n(1.01) \n\n0.26 \n[-1.72, 2.16] \n\n0.24 \n(0.98) \n\n0.29 \n[-2.04, 2.22] \n\n \nIn patients aged 4 months to less than 24 months, with both baseline and week 24 values available, 18 \npatients were pancreatic insufficient at baseline (defined as faecal elastase-1 < 200 µg/g) with mean \n(SD) faecal elastase-1 values at baseline and week 24 of 25.5 µg/g (27.6) and 253.6 µg/g (128.3), \nrespectively (mean [SD] absolute change 228.41 µg/g [128.3]). Results were consistent in the \n12 months to less than 24 months, 6 months to less than 12 months, and 4 months to less than 6 \nmonths age cohorts. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nKalydeco in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in cystic fibrosis (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF. \n \nAfter oral administration of a single 150 mg dose to healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) \nfor AUC and Cmax were 10600 (5260) ng*hr/mL and 768 (233) ng/mL, respectively. After every \n\n\n\n43 \n\n12-hour dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of ivacaftor were reached by days 3 to 5, with an \naccumulation ratio ranging from 2.2 to 2.9. \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing multiple oral dose administrations of ivacaftor, the exposure of ivacaftor generally \nincreased with dose from 25 mg every 12 hours to 450 mg every 12 hours. When given with fat-\ncontaining food the exposure of ivacaftor increased approximately 2.5- to 4-fold. Therefore, ivacaftor \nshould be administered with fat-containing food. The median (range) tmax is approximately 4.0 (3.0; \n6.0) hours in the fed state. \n \nIvacaftor granules (2 x 75 mg sachets) had similar bioavailability as the 150 mg tablet when given with \nfat-containing food to healthy adult subjects. The geometric least squares mean ratio (90% CI) for the \ngranules relative to tablets was 0.951 (0.839, 1.08) for AUC0-∞ and 0.918 (0.750, 1.12) for Cmax. The \neffect of food on ivacaftor absorption is similar for both formulations, i.e., tablets and granules. \n \nDistribution \n \nIvacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and \nalbumin. Ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells. After oral administration of ivacaftor \n150 mg every 12 hours for 7 days in healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) apparent \nvolume of distribution was 353 L (122) . \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIvacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is \nprimarily metabolised by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. \nM1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. \nM6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active. \n \nThe effect of the CYP3A4*22 heterozygous genotype on ivacaftor exposure is consistent with the \neffect of co-administration of a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is not clinically relevant. No dose \nadjustment of ivacaftor is considered necessary. The effect in CYP3A4*22 homozygous genotype \npatients is expected to be stronger. However, no data are available for such patients. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing oral administration in healthy volunteers, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) was eliminated \nin the faeces after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for \napproximately 65% of the total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There was negligible \nurinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent. The apparent terminal half-life was approximately \n12 hours following a single dose in the fed state. The apparent clearance (CL/F) of ivacaftor was \nsimilar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. The mean (±SD) CL/F for a single 150 mg dose was \n17.3 (8.4) L/hr in healthy subjects. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are generally linear with respect to time or dose ranging from \n25 mg to 250 mg. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nFollowing a single dose of 150 mg of ivacaftor, adult subjects with moderately impaired hepatic \nfunction (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had similar ivacaftor Cmax (mean [± SD] of 735 \n[331] ng/mL) but an approximately two-fold increase in ivacaftor AUC0-∞ (mean [± SD] of 16800 \n\n\n\n44 \n\n[6140] ng*hr/mL) compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Simulations for \npredicting the steady-state exposure of ivacaftor showed that by reducing the dosage from \n150 mg q12h to 150 mg once daily, adults with moderate hepatic impairment would have comparable \nsteady-state Cmin values as those obtained with a dose of 150 mg q12h in adults without hepatic \nimpairment. Based on these results, a modified regimen of Kalydeco as monotherapy is recommended \nfor patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.2) \n \nThe impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C, score 10 to15) on the pharmacokinetics \nof ivacaftor have not been studied. The magnitude of increase in exposure in these patients is unknown \nbut is expected to be higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The use \nof Kalydeco in patients with severe hepatic impairment is therefore not recommended unless the \nbenefits outweigh the risks (see section 4.2 and section 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is considered necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with ivacaftor in patients with renal impairment. In \na human pharmacokinetic study, there was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in \nurine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine). There was negligible urinary \nexcretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent (less than 0.01% following a single oral dose of 500 mg).  \n \nNo dose adjustments are recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment. However, caution is \nrecommended when administering ivacaftor to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nRace \n \nRace had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of ivacaftor in white (n = 379) and non-white \n(n = 29) patients based on a population PK analysis. \n \nGender \n \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of ivacaftor are similar in males and females. \n \nElderly \n \nClinical studies of ivacaftor as monotherapy did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged \n65 years and older to determine whether pharmacokinetic parameters are similar or not to those in \nyounger adults. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPredicted ivacaftor exposure based on observed ivacaftor concentrations in phase 2 and 3 studies as \ndetermined using population PK analysis is presented by age group in Table 8.  \n \nTable 8: Mean (SD) ivacaftor exposure by age group \n\nAge group Dose Cmin, ss \n(ng/mL) \n\nAUCτ,ss \n(ng*h/mL) \n\n4 months to less than 6 months (≥5 kg) 25 mg q12h 371 (183) 6480 (2520) \n\n6 months to less than 12 months (5 kg to < 7 kg) * 25 mg q12h 336 5410 \n\n6 months to less than 12 months (7 kg to < 14 kg) 50 mg q12h 508 (252) 9140 (4200) \n\n12 months to less than 24 months (7 kg to < 14 kg) 50 mg q12h 440 (212) 9050 (3050) \n\n\n\n45 \n\nAge group Dose Cmin, ss \n(ng/mL) \n\nAUCτ,ss \n(ng*h/mL) \n\n12 months to less than 24 months (≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg) 75 mg q12h 451 (125) 9600 (1800) \n\n2- to 5-year-olds (< 14 kg) 50 mg q12h 577 (317) 10500 (4260) \n\n2- to 5-year-olds (≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg) 75 mg q12h 629 (296) 11300 (3820) \n\n6- to 11-year-olds † (≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg) 75 mg q12h 641 (329) 10760 (4470) \n\n6- to 11-year-olds † (≥ 25 kg) 150 mg q12h 958 (546) 15300 (7340) \n\n12- to 17-year-olds 150 mg q12h 564 (242) 9240 (3420) \n\nAdults (≥ 18 years old) 150 mg q12h 701 (317) 10700 (4100) \n* Values based on data from a single patient; standard deviation not reported. \n†\n Exposures in 6- to 11-year-olds are predictions based on simulations from the population PK model using data obtained \n\nfor this age group. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. \n \nPregnancy and fertility \n \nIvacaftor was associated with slight decreases of the seminal vesicle weights, a decrease of overall \nfertility index and number of pregnancies in females mated with treated males and significant \nreductions in number of corpora lutea and implantation sites with subsequent reductions in the average \nlitter size and average number of viable embryos per litter in treated females. The \nNo-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for fertility findings provides an exposure level of \napproximately 4 times the systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as \nivacaftor monotherapy in adult humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). \nPlacental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. \n \nPeri- and post-natal development \n \nIvacaftor decreased survival and lactation indices and caused a reduction in pup body weights. The \nNOAEL for viability and growth in the offspring provides an exposure level approximately 3 times the \nsystemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as ivacaftor monotherapy in \nadult humans at the MRHD.  \n \nJuvenile animal studies \n \nFindings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal day 7 through 35 at ivacaftor \nexposure levels of 0.22 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites \nwhen administered as ivacaftor monotherapy. This finding has not been observed in foetuses derived \nfrom rat dams treated with ivacaftor on gestation days 7 to 17, in rat pups exposed to ivacaftor through \nmilk ingestion up to postnatal day 20, in 7-week old rats, nor in 3.5 to 5-month old dogs treated with \nivacaftor. The potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown. \n \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Kalydeco is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Kalydeco \n3. How to take Kalydeco \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Kalydeco \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Kalydeco is and what it is used for \n \nKalydeco contains the active ingredient ivacaftor. Ivacaftor acts at the level of the cystic fibrosis \ntransmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a protein that forms a channel at the cell surface that \nallows the movement of particles such as chloride in and out of the cell. Due to mutations in the CFTR \ngene (see below), chloride movement is reduced in those with cystic fibrosis (CF). Ivacaftor helps \ncertain abnormal CFTR proteins open more often to improve chloride movement in and out of the cell. \n \nKalydeco tablets are indicated:  \n• As monotherapy for patients aged 6 years and older and weighing 25 kg or more with cystic \n\nfibrosis (CF) who have an R117H CFTR mutation or one of the following gating mutations in \nthe CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R. \n \n\n• In combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets for patients aged 6 years and older with CF who \nhave two F508del mutations in the CFTR gene (homozygous for the F508del mutation) or who \nhave an F508del mutation and certain other second mutations that result in reduced amount \nand/or function of the CFTR protein (heterozygous for the F508del mutation with a residual \nfunction (RF) mutation). If you have been prescribed Kalydeco to be taken with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor, read the package leaflet of the latter. It contains important information \nabout how to take these two medicines. \n \n\n• In combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor tablets for patients aged 12 years and over \nwith CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or heterozygous for \nF508del in the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation. A minimal function \nmutation is defined as one that results either in no CFTR protein being produced or a CFTR \nprotein that does not function, and which is unlikely to respond to ivacaftor alone and \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor. If you have been prescribed Kalydeco to be taken with \nivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, read the package leaflet of the latter. It contains important \ninformation about how to take these two medicines. \n\n \n\n\n\n87 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Kalydeco \n \nDo not take Kalydeco \n \n• if you are allergic to ivacaftor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \n• Talk to your doctor if you have liver problems or have previously had them. Your doctor may \n\nneed to adjust your dose. \n• Increased liver enzymes in the blood have been seen in some people receiving Kalydeco (alone \n\nor in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor). Tell your doctor \nright away if you have any of these symptoms, which may be a sign of liver problems: \n• Pain or discomfort in the upper right stomach (abdominal) area \n• Yellowing of the skin or the white part of the eyes \n• Loss of appetite \n• Nausea or vomiting \n• Dark urine \n\nYour doctor will do some blood tests to check your liver before and during treatment, particularly \nduring the first year and especially if your blood tests showed high liver enzymes in the past. \n \n\n• Talk to your doctor if you have kidney problems or have previously had them. \n \n• Kalydeco (alone or in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) \n\nis not recommended if you have undergone an organ transplant. \n \n• Talk to your doctor if you are using hormonal contraception – for example, women using the \n\ncontraceptive pill. This may mean you are more likely to get a rash while taking Kalydeco in \ncombination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. \n\n \n• Abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) without any effect on vision has been noted in some \n\nchildren and adolescents treated with Kalydeco (alone or in combination with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor). Your doctor may perform some eye \nexaminations prior to and during treatment. \n\n \n• Kalydeco (alone or in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) \n\nshould only be used if you have one of the mutations in the CFTR gene indicated in section 1 \n(What Kalydeco is and what it is used for). \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children under 4 months of age as it is not known if ivacaftor is safe and \neffective in these children. \n \nDo not give this medicine in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor to children under 6 years of age or \nin combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor to children under 12 years of age as it is not \nknown if they are safe and effective for them. \n \nOther medicines and Kalydeco \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nSome medicines can affect how Kalydeco works or make side effects more likely. In particular, tell \nyour doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. Your doctor may decide to adjust your \ndose or that you need extra check-ups. \n \n\n\n\n88 \n\n• Antifungal medicines (used for the treatment of fungal infections). These include fluconazole, \nitraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. \n\n• Antibiotic medicines (used for the treatment of bacterial infections). These include \nclarithromycin, erythromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin, and telithromycin . \n\n• Epilepsy medicines (used for the treatment of epileptic seizures or fits). These include \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin.  \n\n• Herbal medicines. These include St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n• Immunosuppressants (used after an organ transplantation). These include ciclosporin, \n\neverolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus, .  \n• Cardiac glycosides (used for the treatment of some heart conditions). These include digoxin. \n• Anticoagulant medicines (used to prevent blood clots). These include warfarin.  \n• Medicines for diabetes. These include glimepiride and glipizide.  \n• Medicines for lowering blood pressure. These include verapamil. \n\n \n \nKalydeco with food and drink \n \nAvoid food or drink containing grapefruit during treatment with Kalydeco as they may increase the \nside effects of Kalydeco by increasing the amount of ivacaftor in your body. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. It may be better to avoid using Kalydeco during \npregnancy, if possible, and your doctor will help you decide what is best for you and your child. \n \nIt is unknown whether ivacaftor is excreted in human milk. If you plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor \nfor advice before taking Kalydeco. Your doctor will decide whether to recommend that you stop \nbreast-feeding or for you to stop ivacaftor therapy. Your doctor will take into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for you. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nKalydeco can make you dizzy. If you feel dizzy, do not drive, cycle or use machines. \n \nImportant information about the contents of Kalydeco \n \nKalydeco contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some \nsugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \nKalydeco contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3.
