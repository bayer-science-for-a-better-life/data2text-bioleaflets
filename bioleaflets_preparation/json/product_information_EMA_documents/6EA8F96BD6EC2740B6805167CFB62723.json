CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEntecavir Mylan is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (see \nsection 5.1) in adults with:   \n\n compensated liver disease and evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated \nserum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active \ninflammation and/or fibrosis.   \n\n decompensated liver disease (see section 4.4)  \n  \nFor both compensated and decompensated liver disease, this indication is based on clinical trial data in \nnucleoside naive patients with HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative HBV infection. With respect to \npatients with lamivudine-refractory hepatitis B, see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1.  \n  \nEntecavir Mylan is also indicated for the treatment of chronic HBV infection in nucleoside naive \npaediatric patients from 2 to <18 years of age with compensated liver disease who have evidence of \nactive viral replication and persistently elevated serum ALT levels, or histological evidence of \nmoderate to severe inflammation and/or fibrosis. With respect to the decision to initiate treatment in \npaediatric patients, see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of chronic hepatitis B \ninfection.  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nEntecavir Mylan is only available as 0.5 and 1 mg film-coated tablets. For patients who are not able to \nswallow tablets, or for whom a dose reduction is recommended, other entecavir-containing products \nwith more suitable formulations may be available. \n \nPosology  \n  \nCompensated liver disease  \n  \nNucleoside naïve patients: the recommended dose in adults is 0.5 mg once daily, with or without food.  \n  \nLamivudine-refractory patients (i.e. with evidence of viraemia while on lamivudine or the presence of \nlamivudine resistance [LVDr] mutations) (see sections 4.4 and 5.1): the recommended dose in adults is \n1 mg once daily, which must be taken on an empty stomach (more than 2 hours before and more than \n2 hours after a meal) (see section 5.2). In the presence of LVDr mutations, combination use of \nentecavir plus a second antiviral agent (which does not share cross-resistance with either lamivudine \nor entecavir) should be considered in preference to entecavir monotherapy (see section 4.4.).  \n  \nDecompensated liver disease  \n  \nThe recommended dose for adult patients with decompensated liver disease is 1 mg once daily, which \nmust be taken on an empty stomach (more than 2 hours before and more than 2 hours after a meal) \n(see section 5.2). For patients with lamivudine-refractory hepatitis B, see sections 4.4 and 5.1.  \n  \nDuration of therapy  \nThe optimal duration of treatment is unknown. Treatment discontinuation may be considered as \nfollows:  \n\n In HBeAg positive adult patients, treatment should be administered at least until 12 months \nafter achieving HBe seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA loss with anti-HBe \ndetection on two consecutive serum samples at least 3-6 months apart) or until HBs \nseroconversion or there is loss of efficacy (see section 4.4).  \n\n In HBeAg negative adult patients, treatment should be administered at least until HBs \nseroconversion or there is evidence of loss of efficacy. With prolonged treatment for more \nthan 2 years, regular reassessment is recommended to confirm that continuing the selected \ntherapy remains appropriate for the patient.  \n\n  \nIn patients with decompensated liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment cessation is not recommended.  \n  \nPaediatric population  \n  \nFor appropriate dosing in the paediatric population Entecavir Mylan 0.5 mg Film-coated Tablets are \navailable and for doses below 0.5 mg an oral solution may be available. \n \nThe decision to treat paediatric patients should be based on careful consideration of individual patient \nneeds and with reference to current paediatric treatment guidelines including the value of baseline \nhistological information. The benefits of long-term virologic suppression with continued therapy must \nbe weighed against the risk of prolonged treatment, including the emergence of resistant hepatitis B \nvirus.  \n  \nSerum ALT should be persistently elevated for at least 6 months prior to treatment of paediatric \npatients with compensated liver disease due to HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B; and for at least \n12 months in patients with HBeAg negative disease.  \n  \nPaediatric patients with body weight of at least 32.6 kg, should be administered a daily dose of one \n0.5 mg tablet with or without food. An oral solution should be used for patients with body weight less \nthan 32.6 kg.  \n  \n\n\n\n4 \n\nDuration of therapy for paediatric patients  \nThe optimal duration of treatment is unknown. In accordance with current paediatric practice \nguidelines, treatment discontinuation may be considered as follows:  \n\n In HBeAg positive paediatric patients, treatment should be administered for at least \n12 months after achieving undetectable HBV DNA and HBeAg seroconversion (HBeAg loss \nand anti-HBe detection on two consecutive serum samples at least 3-6 months apart) or until \nHBs seroconversion or there is loss of efficacy. Serum ALT and HBV DNA levels should be \nfollowed regularly after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4).  \n\n In HBeAg negative paediatric patients, treatment should be administered until HBs \nseroconversion or there is evidence of loss of efficacy.   \n\n  \nPharmacokinetics in paediatric patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been studied.  \n  \nElderly: no dosage adjustment based on age is required. The dose should be adjusted according to the \npatient’s renal function (see dosage recommendations in renal impairment and section 5.2).  \n  \nGender and race: no dosage adjustment based on gender or race is required.  \n  \nRenal impairment: the clearance of entecavir decreases with decreasing creatinine clearance (see \nsection 5.2). Dose adjustment is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance <50 ml/min, \nincluding those on haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). A reduction \nof the daily dose using an oral solution is recommended. As an alternative, in case the oral solution is \nnot available, the dose can be adjusted by increasing the dosage interval, as detailed in the table. The \nproposed dose modifications are based on extrapolation of limited data, and their safety and \neffectiveness have not been clinically evaluated. Therefore, virological response should be closely \nmonitored.   \n  \n\n \nCreatinine clearance \n\n(ml/min) \n \n\nEntecavir dosage* \n\nNucleoside naïve patients \n \n \n\nLamivudine-refractory or \ndecompensated liver disease \n\n \n≥50 0.5 mg once daily 1 mg once daily \n\n30 - 49 0.25 mg once daily* \nOR \n\n0.5 mg every 48 hours\n\n0.5 mg once daily \n \n\n10 - 29 0.15 mg once daily* \nOR \n\n0.5 mg every 72 hours\n\n0.3 mg once daily* \nOR \n\n0.5 mg every 48 hours\n<10 \n\nHaemodialysis or \nCAPD** \n\n0.05 mg once daily* \nOR \n\n0.5 mg every 5-7 days \n\n0.1 mg once daily* \nOR \n\n0.5 mg every 72 hours \n* for doses <0.5 mg entecavir oral solution is recommended \n** on haemodialysis days, administer entecavir after haemodialysis.  \n  \nHepatic impairment: no dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment.  \n  \nMethod of administration  \n  \nEntecavir Mylan should be taken orally.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRenal impairment \n \nDosage adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment (see section 4.2). The proposed \ndose modifications are based on extrapolation of limited data, and their safety and effectiveness have \nnot been clinically evaluated. Therefore, virological response should be closely monitored.   \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis \n \nSpontaneous exacerbations in chronic hepatitis B are relatively common and are characterised by \ntransient increases in serum ALT. After initiating antiviral therapy, serum ALT may increase in some \npatients as serum HBV DNA levels decline (see section 4.8). Among entecavir-treated patients on-\ntreatment exacerbations had a median time of onset of 4-5 weeks. In patients with compensated liver \ndisease, these increases in serum ALT are generally not accompanied by an increase in serum bilirubin \nconcentrations or hepatic decompensation. Patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis may be at \na higher risk for hepatic decompensation following hepatitis exacerbation, and therefore should be \nmonitored closely during therapy.  \n  \nAcute exacerbation of hepatitis has also been reported in patients who have discontinued hepatitis B \ntherapy (see section 4.2). Post-treatment exacerbations are usually associated with rising HBV DNA, \nand the majority appears to be self-limited. However, severe exacerbations, including fatalities, have \nbeen reported.  \n  \nAmong entecavir-treated nucleoside naive patients, post-treatment exacerbations had a median time to \nonset of 23-24 weeks, and most were reported in HBeAg negative patients (see section 4.8). Hepatic \nfunction should be monitored at repeated intervals with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at \nleast 6 months after discontinuation of hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, resumption of hepatitis B \ntherapy may be warranted.  \n  \nPatients with decompensated liver disease \n \nA higher rate of serious hepatic adverse events (regardless of causality) has been observed in patients \nwith decompensated liver disease, in particular in those with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class C \ndisease, compared with rates in patients with compensated liver function. Also, patients with \ndecompensated liver disease may be at higher risk for lactic acidosis and for specific renal adverse \nevents such as hepatorenal syndrome. Therefore, clinical and laboratory parameters should be closely \nmonitored in this patient population (see also sections 4.8 and 5.1).  \n  \nLactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis \n \nOccurrences of lactic acidosis (in the absence of hypoxaemia), sometimes fatal, usually associated \nwith severe hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis, have been reported with the use of nucleoside \nanalogues. As entecavir is a nucleoside analogue, this risk cannot be excluded. Treatment with \nnucleoside analogues should be discontinued when rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels, \nprogressive hepatomegaly or metabolic/lactic acidosis of unknown aetiology occur. Benign digestive \nsymptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, might be indicative of lactic acidosis \ndevelopment. Severe cases, sometimes with fatal outcome, were associated with pancreatitis, liver \nfailure/hepatic steatosis, renal failure and higher levels of serum lactate. Caution should be exercised \nwhen prescribing nucleoside analogues to any patient (particularly obese women) with hepatomegaly, \nhepatitis or other known risk factors for liver disease. These patients should be followed closely.  \n  \nTo differentiate between elevations in aminotransferases due to response to treatment and increases \npotentially related to lactic acidosis, physicians should ensure that changes in ALT are associated with \nimprovements in other laboratory markers of chronic hepatitis B.  \n  \nResistance and specific precaution for lamivudine-refractory patients \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nMutations in the HBV polymerase that encode lamivudine-resistance substitutions may lead to the \nsubsequent emergence of secondary substitutions, including those associated with entecavir associated \nresistance (ETVr). In a small percentage of lamivudine-refractory patients, ETVr substitutions at \nresidues rtT184, rtS202 or rtM250 were present at baseline. Patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV \nare at higher risk of developing subsequent entecavir resistance than patients without lamivudine \nresistance. The cumulative probability of emerging genotypic entecavir resistance after 1, 2, 3, 4 and \n5 years treatment in the lamivudine-refractory studies was 6%, 15%, 36%, 47% and 51%, respectively. \nVirological response should be frequently monitored in the lamivudine-refractory population and \nappropriate resistance testing should be performed. In patients with a suboptimal virological response \nafter 24 weeks of treatment with entecavir, a modification of treatment should be considered (see \nsections 4.5 and 5.1). When starting therapy in patients with a documented history of lamivudine-\nresistant HBV, combination use of entecavir plus a second antiviral agent (which does not share cross-\nresistance with either lamivudine or entecavir) should be considered in preference to entecavir \nmonotherapy.  \n  \nPre-existing lamivudine-resistant HBV is associated with an increased risk for subsequent entecavir \nresistance regardless of the degree of liver disease; in patients with decompensated liver disease, \nvirologic breakthrough may be associated with serious clinical complications of the underlying liver \ndisease. Therefore, in patients with both decompensated liver disease and lamivudine-resistant HBV, \ncombination use of entecavir plus a second antiviral agent (which does not share cross-resistance with \neither lamivudine or entecavir) should be considered in preference to entecavir monotherapy.  \n  \nPaediatric population \n \nA lower rate of virologic response (HBV DNA <50 IU/ml) was observed in paediatric patients with \nbaseline HBV DNA ≥8.0 log10 IU/ml (see section 5.1). Entecavir should be used in these patients only \nif the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the child (e.g. resistance). Since some paediatric \npatients may require long-term or even lifetime management of chronic active hepatitis B, \nconsideration should be given to the impact of entecavir on future treatment options.  \n  \nLiver transplant recipients \n \nRenal function should be carefully evaluated before and during entecavir therapy in liver transplant \nrecipients receiving cyclosporine or tacrolimus (see section 5.2).  \n  \nCo-infection with hepatitis C or D \n \nThere are no data on the efficacy of entecavir in patients co-infected with hepatitis C or D virus.  \n  \nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV co-infected patients not receiving concomitant \nantiretroviral therapy \n \nEntecavir has not been evaluated in HIV/HBV co-infected patients not concurrently receiving \neffective HIV treatment. Emergence of HIV resistance has been observed when entecavir was used to \ntreat chronic hepatitis B infection in patients with HIV infection not receiving highly active \nantiretroviral therapy (HAART) (see section 5.1). Therefore, therapy with entecavir should not be used \nfor HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are not receiving HAART. Entecavir has not been studied as a \ntreatment for HIV infection and is not recommended for this use.  \n  \nHIV/HBV co-infected patients receiving concomitant antiretroviral therapy \n \nEntecavir has been studied in 68 adults with HIV/HBV co-infection receiving a lamivudine-containing \nHAART regimen (see section 5.1). No data are available on the efficacy of entecavir in HBeAg-\nnegative patients co-infected with HIV. There are limited data on patients co-infected with HIV who \nhave low CD4 cell counts (<200 cells/mm3).  \n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nGeneral \n \nPatients should be advised that therapy with entecavir has not been proven to reduce the risk of \ntransmission of HBV and therefore appropriate precautions should still be taken.  \n  \nLactose \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSince entecavir is predominantly eliminated by the kidney (see section 5.2), coadministration with \nmedicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase \nserum concentrations of either medicinal product. Apart from lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil and \ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the effects of coadministration of entecavir with medicinal products that \nare excreted renally or affect renal function have not been evaluated. Patients should be monitored \nclosely for adverse reactions when entecavir is coadministered with such medicinal products.  \n  \nNo pharmacokinetic interactions between entecavir and lamivudine, adefovir or tenofovir were \nobserved.  \n  \nEntecavir is not a substrate, an inducer or an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes (see \nsection 5.2). Therefore CYP450 mediated drug interactions are unlikely to occur with entecavir.  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nGiven that the potential risks to the developing foetus are unknown, women of childbearing potential \nshould use effective contraception.  \n  \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of entecavir in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity at high doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nEntecavir Mylan should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. There are no data on \nthe effect of entecavir on transmission of HBV from mother to newborn infant. Therefore, appropriate \ninterventions should be used to prevent neonatal acquisition of HBV.  \n  \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether entecavir is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological data in animals \nhave shown excretion of entecavir in milk (for details see section 5.3). A risk to the infants cannot be \nexcluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Entecavir Mylan.  \n  \nFertility \n \nToxicology studies in animals administered entecavir have shown no evidence of impaired fertility \n(see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Dizziness, \nfatigue and somnolence are common side effects which may impair the ability to drive and use \nmachines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nIn clinical studies in patients with compensated liver disease, the most common adverse reactions of \nany severity with at least a possible relation to entecavir were headache (9%), fatigue (6%), dizziness \n(4%) and nausea (3%). Exacerbations of hepatitis during and after discontinuation of entecavir therapy \nhave also been reported (see section 4.4 and Description of selected adverse reactions).  \n  \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on experience from postmarketing surveillance and four \nclinical studies in which 1,720 patients with chronic hepatitis B infection and compensated liver \ndisease received double-blind treatment with entecavir (n = 862) or lamivudine (n = 858) for up to \n107 weeks (see section 5.1). In these studies, the safety profiles, including laboratory abnormalities, \nwere comparable for entecavir 0.5 mg daily (679 nucleoside-naive HBeAg positive or negative \npatients treated for a median of 53 weeks), entecavir 1 mg daily (183 lamivudine-refractory patients \ntreated for a median of 69 weeks), and lamivudine.  \n  \nAdverse reactions considered at least possibly related to treatment with entecavir are listed by body \nsystem organ class. Frequency is defined as very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000). Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n  \nImmune system disorders:  rare: anaphylactoid reaction \n \nPsychiatric disorders:  common: insomnia \n \nNervous system disorders:  common: headache, dizziness, somnolence \n \nGastrointestinal disorders:  common: vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea, \n\ndyspepsia \n \nHepatobiliary disorders:  common: increased transaminases \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: uncommon: rash, alopecia \n  \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: common: fatigue \n \n \nCases of lactic acidosis have been reported, often in association with hepatic decompensation, other \nserious medical conditions or drug exposures (see section 4.4).  \n  \nTreatment beyond 48 weeks: continued treatment with entecavir for a median duration of 96 weeks \ndid not reveal any new safety signals.  \n  \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n  \nLaboratory test abnormalities \nIn clinical studies with nucleoside-naive patients, 5% had ALT elevations >3 times baseline, and <1% \nhad ALT elevations >2 times baseline together with total bilirubin >2 times upper limit of normal \n\n\n\n9 \n\n(ULN) and >2 times baseline. Albumin levels <2.5 g/dl occurred in <1% of patients, amylase levels \n>3 times baseline in 2%, lipase levels >3 times baseline in 11% and platelets <50,000/mm3 in <1%.  \n  \nIn clinical studies with lamivudine-refractory patients, 4% had ALT elevations >3 times baseline, and \n<1% had ALT elevations >2 times baseline together with total bilirubin >2 times ULN and >2 times \nbaseline. Amylase levels >3 times baseline occurred in 2% of patients, lipase levels >3 times baseline \nin 18% and platelets <50,000/mm3 in <1%.  \n  \nExacerbations during treatment \nIn studies with nucleoside naive patients, on treatment ALT elevations >10 times ULN and >2 times \nbaseline occurred in 2% of entecavir treated patients vs 4% of lamivudine treated patients. In studies \nwith lamivudine-refractory patients, on treatment ALT elevations >10 times ULN and >2 times \nbaseline occurred in 2% of entecavir treated patients vs 11% of lamivudine treated patients. Among \nentecavir-treated patients, on-treatment ALT elevations had a median time to onset of 4-5 weeks, \ngenerally resolved with continued treatment, and, in a majority of cases, were associated with a \n≥2 log10/ml reduction in viral load that preceded or coincided with the ALT elevation. Periodic \nmonitoring of hepatic function is recommended during treatment.  \n  \nExacerbations after discontinuation of treatment \nAcute exacerbations of hepatitis have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B \nvirus therapy, including therapy with entecavir (see section 4.4). In studies in nucleoside-naive \npatients, 6% of entecavir-treated patients and 10% of lamivudine-treated patients experienced ALT \nelevations (>10 times ULN and >2 times reference [minimum of baseline or last end-of-dosing \nmeasurement]) during post-treatment follow-up. Among entecavir-treated nucleoside-naive patients, \nALT elevations had a median time to onset of 23-24 weeks, and 86% (24/28) of ALT elevations \noccurred in HBeAg negative patients. In studies in lamivudine-refractory patients, with only limited \nnumbers of patients being followed up, 11% of entecavir-treated patients and no lamivudine-treated \npatients developed ALT elevations during post-treatment follow-up.  \n  \nIn the clinical trials entecavir treatment was discontinued if patients achieved a prespecified response. \nIf treatment is discontinued without regard to treatment response, the rate of post-treatment ALT flares \ncould be higher.  \n  \nPaediatric Population  \n  \nThe safety of entecavir in paediatric patients from 2 to <18 years of age is based on two ongoing \nclinical trials in subjects with chronic HBV infection; one Phase 2 pharmacokinetic trial (study 028) \nand one Phase 3 trial (study 189). These trials provide experience in 195 HBeAg-positive nucleoside-\ntreatment-naïve subjects treated with entecavir for a median duration of 99 weeks. The adverse \nreactions observed in paediatric subjects who received treatment with entecavir were consistent with \nthose observed in clinical trials of entecavir in adults (see Summary of the safety profile and \nsection 5.1).  \n  \nOther special populations  \n  \nExperience in patients with decompensated liver disease: the safety profile of entecavir in patients \nwith decompensated liver disease was assessed in a randomized open-label comparative study in \nwhich patients received treatment with entecavir 1 mg/day (n = 102) or adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg/day \n(n = 89) (study 048). Relative to the adverse reactions noted in section Tabulated list of adverse \nreactions, one additional adverse reaction [decrease in blood bicarbonate (2%)] was observed in \nentecavir-treated patients through week 48. The on-study cumulative death rate was 23% (23/102), \nand causes of death were generally liver-related, as expected in this population. The on-study \ncumulative rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 12% (12/102). Serious adverse events were \ngenerally liver-related, with an on-study cumulative frequency of 69%. Patients with high baseline \nCTP score were at higher risk of developing serious adverse events (see section 4.4).  \n  \n\n\n\n10 \n\nLaboratory test abnormalities: through week 48 among entecavir-treated patients with decompensated \nliver disease, none had ALT elevations both >10 times ULN and >2 times baseline, and 1% of patients \nhad ALT elevations >2 times baseline together with total bilirubin >2 times ULN and >2 times \nbaseline. Albumin levels <2.5 g/dl occurred in 30% of patients, lipase levels >3 times baseline in 10% \nand platelets <50,000/mm3 in 20%.  \n  \nExperience in patients co-infected with HIV \nThe safety profile of entecavir in a limited number of HIV/HBV co-infected patients on lamivudine-\ncontaining HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) regimens was similar to the safety profile in \nmonoinfected HBV patients (see section 4.4).  \n  \nGender/age \nThere was no apparent difference in the safety profile of entecavir with respect to gender (≈ 25% women \nin the clinical trials) or age (≈ 5% of patients >65 years of age). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited experience of entecavir overdose reported in patients. Healthy subjects who received \nup to 20 mg/day for up to 14 days, and single doses up to 40 mg had no unexpected adverse reactions. \nIf overdose occurs, the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity and given standard \nsupportive treatment as necessary. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors.  \nATC code: J05AF10  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nEntecavir, a guanosine nucleoside analogue with activity against HBV polymerase, is efficiently \nphosphorylated to the active triphosphate (TP) form, which has an intracellular half-life of 15 hours. \nBy competing with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine TP, entecavir-TP functionally inhibits the 3 \nactivities of the viral polymerase: (1) priming of the HBV polymerase, (2) reverse transcription of the \nnegative strand DNA from the pregenomic messenger RNA, and (3) synthesis of the positive strand \nHBV DNA. The entecavir-TP Ki for HBV DNA polymerase is 0.0012 μM. Entecavir-TP is a weak \ninhibitor of cellular DNA polymerases α, β, and δ with Ki values of 18 to 40 µM. In addition, high \nexposures of entecavir had no relevant adverse effects on γ polymerase or mitochondrial DNA \nsynthesis in HepG2 cells (Ki >160 µM).  \n  \nAntiviral activity \n \nEntecavir inhibited HBV DNA synthesis (50% reduction, EC50) at a concentration of 0.004 µM in \nhuman HepG2 cells transfected with wild-type HBV. The median EC50 value for entecavir against \nLVDr HBV (rtL180M and rtM204V) was 0.026 µM (range 0.010-0.059 µM). Recombinant viruses \nencoding adefovir-resistant substitutions at either rtN236T or rtA181V remained fully susceptible to \nentecavir.  \n  \n\n\n\n11 \n\nAn analysis of the inhibitory activity of entecavir against a panel of laboratory and clinical HIV-1 \nisolates using a variety of cells and assay conditions yielded EC50 values ranging from 0.026 to \n>10 µM; the lower EC50 values were observed when decreased levels of virus were used in the assay. \nIn cell culture, entecavir selected for an M184I substitution at micromolar concentrations, confirming \ninhibitory pressure at high entecavir concentrations. HIV variants containing the M184V substitution \nshowed loss of susceptibility to entecavir (see section 4.4).  \n  \nIn HBV combination assays in cell culture, abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir or \nzidovudine were not antagonistic to the anti-HBV activity of entecavir over a wide range of \nconcentrations. In HIV antiviral assays, entecavir at micromolar concentrations was not antagonistic to \nthe anti-HIV activity in cell culture of these six NRTIs or emtricitabine.   \n  \nResistance in cell culture \n \nRelative to wild-type HBV, LVDr viruses containing rtM204V and rtL180M substitutions within the \nreverse transcriptase exhibit 8-fold decreased susceptibility to entecavir. Incorporation of additional \nETVr amino acid changes rtT184, rtS202 or rtM250 decreases entecavir susceptibility in cell culture. \nSubstitutions observed in clinical isolates (rtT184A, C, F, G, I, L, M or S; rtS202 C, G or I; and/or \nrtM250I, L or V) further decreased entecavir susceptibility 16- to 741-fold relative to wild-type virus. \nThe ETVr substitutions at residues rtT184, rtS202 and rtM250 alone have only a modest effect on \nentecavir susceptibility, and have not been observed in the absence of LVDr substitutions in more than \n1000 patient samples sequenced. Resistance is mediated by reduced inhibitor binding to the altered \nHBV reverse transcriptase, and resistant HBV exhibits reduced replication capacity in cell culture.  \n  \nClinical experience \n \nThe demonstration of benefit is based on histological, virological, biochemical, and serological \nresponses after 48 weeks of treatment in active-controlled clinical trials of 1,633 adults with chronic \nhepatitis B infection, evidence of viral replication and compensated liver disease. The safety and \nefficacy of entecavir were also evaluated in an active-controlled clinical trial of 191 HBV-infected \npatients with decompensated liver disease and in a clinical trial of 68 patients co-infected with HBV \nand HIV.  \n  \nIn studies in patients with compensated liver disease, histological improvement was defined as a ≥2-\npoint decrease in Knodell necro-inflammatory score from baseline with no worsening of the Knodell \nfibrosis score. Responses for patients with baseline Knodell Fibrosis Scores of 4 (cirrhosis) were \ncomparable to overall responses on all efficacy outcome measures (all patients had compensated liver \ndisease). High baseline Knodell necroinflammatory scores (>10) were associated with greater \nhistological improvement in nucleoside-naive patients. Baseline ALT levels ≥2 times ULN and \nbaseline HBV DNA ≤9.0 log10 copies/ml were both associated with higher rates of virologic response \n(Week 48 HBV DNA <400 copies/ml) in nucleoside-naive HBeAg-positive patients. Regardless of \nbaseline characteristics, the majority of patients showed histological and virological responses to \ntreatment.  \n  \nExperience in nucleoside-naive patients with compensated liver disease \nResults at 48 weeks of randomised, double blind studies comparing entecavir (ETV) to lamivudine \n(LVD) in HBeAg positive (022) and HBeAg negative (027) patients are presented in the table.  \n  \n\n  Nucleoside Naive \nHBeAg Positive \n\n(study 022) \nHBeAg Negative \n\n(study 027) \nETV \n\n0.5 mg \nonce daily\n\nLVD \n100 mg \n\nonce daily\n\nETV \n0.5 mg \n\nonce daily \n\nLVD \n100 mg \n\nonce daily\nn  314a 314a 296a 287a \nHistological improvementb  72%* 62% 70%* 61% \n\n\n\n12 \n\nIshak fibrosis score improvement  39% 35% 36% 38% \nIshak fibrosis score worsening  8% 10% 12% 15% \nn  354 355 325 313 \nViral load reduction (log10 copies/ml)c -6.86* -5.39 -5.04* -4.53 \nHBV DNA undetectable  \n(<300 copies/ml by PCR)c  \n\n67%* 36% 90%* 72% \n\nALT normalisation (≤1 times ULN)  68%* 60% 78%* 71% \n      \nHBeAg Seroconversion  21% 18%   \n\n*p value vs lamivudine <0.05  \na patients with evaluable baseline histology (baseline Knodell Necroinflammatory Score ≥2)  \nb a primary endpoint  \nc Roche Cobas Amplicor PCR assay (LLOQ = 300 copies/ml)  \n\n  \nExperience in lamivudine-refractory patients with compensated liver disease \nIn a randomised, double-blind study in HBeAg positive lamivudine-refractory patients (026), with \n85% of patients presenting LVDr mutations at baseline, patients receiving lamivudine at study entry \neither switched to entecavir 1 mg once daily, with neither a washout nor an overlap period (n = 141), \nor continued on lamivudine 100 mg once daily (n = 145).

Response criteria were HBV virological suppression (HBV DNA \n<0.7 MEq/ml by bDNA) and loss of HBeAg (in HBeAg positive patients) or ALT <1.25 times ULN \n(in HBeAg negative patients). Patients in response were followed for an additional 24 weeks \noff-treatment. Patients who met virologic but not serologic or biochemical response criteria continued \nblinded treatment. Patients who did not have a virologic response were offered alternative treatment.  \n  \nNucleoside-naive \nHBeAg positive (study 022): treatment with entecavir for up to 96 weeks (n = 354) resulted in \ncumulative response rates of 80% for HBV DNA <300 copies/ml by PCR, 87% for ALT \nnormalisation, 31% for HBeAg seroconversion and 2% for HBsAg seroconversion (5% for HBsAg \n\n\n\n13 \n\nloss). For lamivudine (n = 355), cumulative response rates were 39% for HBV DNA <300 copies/ml \nby PCR, 79% for ALT normalisation, 26% for HBeAg seroconversion, and 2% for HBsAg \nseroconversion (3% for HBsAg loss).  \n \nAt end of dosing, among patients who continued treatment beyond 52 weeks (median of 96 weeks),  \n81% of 243 entecavir-treated and 39% of 164 lamivudine-treated patients had HBV DNA \n<300 copies/ml by PCR while ALT normalisation (≤1 times ULN) occurred in 79% of entecavir-\ntreated and 68% of lamivudine-treated patients.  \n  \nHBeAg negative (study 027): treatment with entecavir up to 96 weeks (n = 325) resulted in cumulative \nresponse rates of 94% for HBV DNA <300 copies/ml by PCR and 89% for ALT normalisation versus \n77% for HBV DNA <300 copies/ml by PCR and 84% for ALT normalisation for lamivudine-treated \npatients (n = 313).  \n \nFor 26 entecavir-treated and 28 lamivudine-treated patients who continued treatment beyond 52 weeks \n(median 96 weeks), 96% of entecavir-treated and 64% of lamivudine-treated patients had HBV DNA \n<300 copies/ml by PCR at end of dosing. ALT normalisation (≤1 times ULN) occurred in 27% of \nentecavir-treated and 21% of lamivudine-treated patients at end of dosing.  \n  \nFor patients who met protocol-defined response criteria, response was sustained throughout the \n24-week post-treatment follow-up in 75% (83/111) of entecavir responders vs 73% (68/93) for \nlamivudine responders in study 022 and 46% (131/286) of entecavir responders vs 31% (79/253) for \nlamivudine responders in study 027. By 48 weeks of post-treatment follow-up, a substantial number of \nHBeAg negative patients lost response.  \n  \nLiver biopsy results: 57 patients from the pivotal nucleoside-naive studies 022 (HBeAg positive) and \n027 (HBeAg negative) who enrolled in a long-term rollover study were evaluated for long-term liver \nhistology outcomes. The entecavir dosage was 0.5 mg daily in the pivotal studies (mean exposure \n85 weeks) and 1 mg daily in the rollover study (mean exposure 177 weeks), and 51 patients in the \nrollover study initially also received lamivudine (median duration 29 weeks). Of these patients, 55/57 \n(96%) had histological improvement as previously defined (see above), and 50/57 (88%) had a \n≥1-point decrease in Ishak fibrosis score. For patients with baseline Ishak fibrosis score ≥2, 25/43 \n(58%) had a ≥2-point decrease. All (10/10) patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis at baseline \n(Ishak fibrosis score of 4, 5 or 6) had a ≥1 point decrease (median decrease from baseline was \n1.5 points). At the time of the long-term biopsy, all patients had HBV DNA <300 copies/ml and 49/57 \n(86%) had serum ALT ≤1 times ULN. All 57 patients remained positive for HBsAg.  \n  \nLamivudine-refractory \nHBeAg positive (study 026): treatment with entecavir for up to 96 weeks (n = 141) resulted in \ncumulative response rates of 30% for HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml by PCR, 85% for ALT \nnormalisation and 17% for HBeAg seroconversion.  \n \nFor the 77 patients who continued entecavir treatment beyond 52 weeks (median 96 weeks), 40% of \npatients had HBV DNA <300 copies/ml by PCR and 81% had ALT normalisation (≤1 times ULN) at \nend of dosing.  \n  \nAge/gender \nThere was no apparent difference in efficacy for entecavir based on gender (≈ 25% women in the \nclinical trials) or age (≈ 5% of patients >65 years of age).  \n  \nSpecial populations  \n \nPatients with decompensated liver disease \nIn study 048, 191 patients with HBeAg positive or negative chronic HBV infection and evidence of \nhepatic decompensation, defined as a CTP score of 7 or higher, received entecavir 1 mg once daily or \nadefovir dipivoxil 10 mg once daily. Patients were either HBV-treatment-naïve or pretreated \n(excluding pretreatment with entecavir, adefovir dipivoxil, or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). At \n\n\n\n14 \n\nbaseline, patients had a mean CTP score of 8.59 and 26% of patients were CTP class C. The mean \nbaseline Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 16.23. Mean serum HBV DNA by \nPCR was 7.83 log10 copies/ml and mean serum ALT was 100 U/l; 54% of patients were HBeAg \npositive, and 35% of patients had LVDr substitutions at baseline. Entecavir was superior to adefovir \ndipivoxil on the primary efficacy endpoint of mean change from baseline in serum HBV DNA by PCR \nat week 24.

Patients \nhad stable controlled HIV (HIV RNA <400 copies/ml) with recurrence of HBV viraemia on a \n\n\n\n15 \n\nlamivudine-containing HAART regimen. HAART regimens did not include emtricitabine or tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate. At baseline entecavir-treated patients had a median duration of prior lamivudine \ntherapy of 4.8 years and median CD4 count of 494 cells/mm3 (with only 5 subjects having CD4 count \n<200 cells/mm3). Patients continued their lamivudine-regimen and were assigned to add either \nentecavir 1 mg once daily (n = 51) or placebo (n = 17) for 24 weeks followed by an additional \n24 weeks where all received entecavir. At 24 weeks the reduction in HBV viral load was significantly \ngreater with entecavir (-3.65 vs an increase of 0.11 log10 copies/ml). For patients originally assigned to \nentecavir treatment, the reduction in HBV DNA at 48 weeks was -4.20 log10 copies/ml, ALT \nnormalisation had occurred in 37% of patients with abnormal baseline ALT and none achieved \nHBeAg seroconversion.   \n  \nHIV/HBV co-infected patients not receiving concomitant HAART \nEntecavir has not been evaluated in HIV/HBV co-infected patients not concurrently receiving \neffective HIV treatment. Reductions in HIV RNA have been reported in HIV/HBV co-infected \npatients receiving entecavir monotherapy without HAART. In some cases, selection of HIV variant \nM184V has been observed, which has implications for the selection of HAART regimens that the \npatient may take in the future. Therefore, entecavir should not be used in this setting due to the \npotential for development of HIV resistance (see section 4.4).  \n  \nLiver transplant recipients \nThe safety and efficacy of entecavir 1 mg once daily were assessed in a single-arm study in 65 patients \nwho received a liver transplant for complications of chronic HBV infection and had HBV DNA \n<172 IU/ml (approximately 1000 copies/ml) at the time of transplant. The study population was 82% \nmale, 39% Caucasian, and 37% Asian, with a mean age of 49 years; 89% of patients had HBeAg-\nnegative disease at the time of transplant. Of the 61 patients who were evaluable for efficacy (received \nentecavir for at least 1 month), 60 also received hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) as part of the \npost-transplant prophylaxis regimen. Of these 60 patients, 49 received more than 6 months of HBIg \ntherapy. At Week 72 post-transplant, none of 55 observed cases had virologic recurrence of HBV \n[defined as HBV DNA ≥50 IU/ml (approximately 300 copies/ml)], and there was no reported \nvirologic recurrence at time of censoring for the remaining 6 patients. All 61 patients had HBsAg loss \npost-transplantation, and 2 of these later became HBsAg positive despite maintaining undetectable \nHBV DNA (<6 IU/ml). The frequency and nature of adverse events in this study were consistent with \nthose expected in patients who have received a liver transplant and the known safety profile of \nentecavir.  \n  \nPaediatric population \nStudy 189 is an ongoing study of the efficacy and safety of entecavir among 180 nucleoside-treatment-\nnaïve children and adolescents from 2 to <18 years of age with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B \ninfection, compensated liver disease, and elevated ALT. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive \nblinded treatment with entecavir 0.015 mg/kg up to 0.5 mg/day (N = 120) or placebo (N = 60). The \nrandomization was stratified by age group (2 to 6 years; >6 to 12 years; and >12 to <18 years). \nBaseline demographics and HBV disease characteristics were comparable between the 2 treatment \narms and across age cohorts. At study entry, the mean HBV DNA was 8.1 log10 IU/ml and mean ALT \nwas 103 U/l across the study population. Results for the main efficacy endpoints at Week 48 and \nWeek 96 are presented in the table below. \n \n\n Entecavir Placebo* \n Week 48 Week 96 Week 48 \nn 120 120 60 \nHBV DNA <50 IU/mL and \nHBeAg seroconversiona \n\n24.2% 35.8% 3.3% \n\nHBV DNA <50 IU/mLa 49.2% 64.2% 3.3% \nHBeAg seroconversiona 24.2% 36.7% 10.0% \nALT normalisationa 67.5% 81.7% 23.3% \nHBV DNA <50 IU/mLa \n \nBaseline HBV \n\n \n \n\n82.6% (38/46)\n\n \n \n\n82.6% (38/46)\n\n \n \n\n6.5% (2/31)\n\n\n\n16 \n\nDNA <8 log10 IU/mL \nBaseline HBV DNA \n≥8 log10 IU/mL \n\n \n28.4% (21/74) \n\n \n52.7% (39/74) \n\n \n0% (0/29) \n\na NC=F (noncompleter = failure) \n* Patients randomised to placebo who did not have HBe serconversion by Week 48 rolled over to open-label entecavir for \n\nthe second year of the study; therefore randomised comparison data are available only through Week 48. \n \nThe paediatric resistance assessment is based on data from nucleoside-treatment-naive paediatric \npatients with HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection in two ongoing clinical trials (028 and 189). The \ntwo trials provide resistance data in 183 patients treated and monitored in Year 1 and 180 patients \ntreated and monitored in Year 2. Genotypic evaluations were performed for all patients with available \nsamples who had virologic breakthrough through Week 96 or HBV DNA ≥50 IU/ml at Week 48 or \nWeek 96. During Year 2, genotypic resistance to ETV was detected in 2 patients (1.1% cumulative \nprobability of resistance through Year 2). \n \nClinical resistance in adults \n \nPatients in clinical trials initially treated with entecavir 0.5 mg (nucleoside-naive) or 1.0 mg \n(lamivudine-refractory) and with an on-therapy PCR HBV DNA measurement at or after Week 24 \nwere monitored for resistance.  \n \nThrough Week 240 in nucleoside-naive studies, genotypic evidence of ETVr substitutions at rtT184, \nrtS202, or rtM250 was identified in 3 patients treated with entecavir, 2 of whom experienced virologic \nbreakthrough (see table). These substitutions were observed only in the presence of LVDr \nsubstitutions (rtM204V and rtL180M).  \n  \n\nEmerging Genotypic Entecavir Resistance Through Year 5, Nucleoside-Naïve Studies  \n\n  Year 1 Year 2 Year 3a Year 4 a Year 5a \n\nPatients treated and monitored for \nresistance b  \n\n663 278 149 121 108 \n\nPatients in specific year with:   \n- emerging genotypic ETVr c  1 1 1 0 0 \n\n- genotypic ETVr c with virologic   \nbreakthrough d \n\n1 0 1 0 0 \n\nCumulative probability of:       \n\n- emerging genotypic ETVr c 0.2% 0.5% 1.2% 1.2% 1.2% \n\n- genotypic ETVr c with virologic \nbreakthrough d  \n\n0.2% 0.2% 0.8% 0.8% 0.8% \n\na Results reflect use of a 1 mg dose of entecavir for 147 of 149 patients in Year 3 and all patients in Years 4 and 5 and of \ncombination entecavir-lamivudine therapy (followed by long-term entecavir therapy) for a median of 20 weeks for 130 \nof 149 patients in Year 3 and for 1 week for 1 of 121 patients in Year 4 in a rollover study.   \n\nb Includes patients with at least one on-therapy HBV DNA measurement by PCR at or after week 24 through week 58 \n(Year 1), after week 58 through week 102 (Year 2), after week 102 through week 156 (Year 3), after week 156 through \nweek 204 (Year 4), or after week 204 through week 252 (Year 5).  \n\nc Patients also have LVDr substitutions.  \nd ≥1 log10 increase above nadir in HBV DNA by PCR, confirmed with successive measurements or at the end of the \n\nwindowed time point.  \n  \nETVr substitutions (in addition to LVDr substitutions rtM204V/I ± rtL180M) were observed at \nbaseline in isolates from 10/187 (5%) lamivudine-refractory patients treated with entecavir and \nmonitored for resistance, indicating that prior lamivudine treatment can select these resistance \nsubstitutions and that they can exist at a low frequency before entecavir treatment. Through Week 240, \n3 of the 10 patients experienced virologic breakthrough (≥1 log10 increase above nadir). Emerging \nentecavir resistance in lamivudine-refractory studies through Week 240 is summarized in the table.  \n\n\n\n17 \n\n  \nGenotypic Entecavir Resistance Through Year 5, Lamivudine-Refractory Studies  \n\n  Year 1 Year 2 Year 3a Year 4 a Year 5 a \n\nPatients treated and monitored for \nresistance b \n\n187 146 80 52 33 \n\nPatients in specific year with:       \n\n- emerging genotypic ETVr c 11 12 16 6 2 \n\n- genotypic ETVr with virologic \nbreakthrough d \n\n2 e 14 e 13 e 9 e 1 e \n\nCumulative probability of:       \n\n- emerging genotypic ETVr c 6.2% 15% 36.3% 46.6% 51.45% \n\n- genotypic ETVr c with virologic \nbreakthrough d \n\n1.1% e 10.7% e 27% e 41.3% e 43.6% e \n\na Results reflect use of combination entecavir-lamivudine therapy (followed by long-term entecavir therapy) for a median \nof 13 weeks for 48 of 80 patients in Year 3, a median of 38 weeks for 10 of 52 patients in Year 4, and for 16 weeks for 1 \nof 33 patients in Year 5 in a rollover study.  \n\nb Includes patients with at least one on-therapy HBV DNA measurement by PCR at or after week 24 through week 58 \n(Year 1), after week 58 through week 102 (Year 2), after week 102 through week 156 (Year 3), after week 156 through \nweek 204 (Year 4), or after week 204 through week 252 (Year 5).  \n\nc Patients also have LVDr substitutions.  \nd ≥1 log10 increase above nadir in HBV DNA by PCR, confirmed with successive measurements or at the end of the \n\nwindowed time point.  \ne ETVr occurring in any year; virologic breakthrough in specified year.  \n\n  \nAmong lamivudine-refractory patients with baseline HBV DNA <107 log10 copies/ml, 64% (9/14) \nachieved HBV DNA <300 copies/ml at Week 48. These 14 patients had a lower rate of genotypic \nentecavir resistance (cumulative probability 18.8% through 5 years of follow-up) than the overall \nstudy population (see table). Also, lamivudine-refractory patients who achieved HBV DNA \n<104 log10 copies/ml by PCR at Week 24 had a lower rate of resistance than those who did not (5-year \ncumulative probability 17.6% [n= 50] versus 60.5% [n= 135], respectively). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nEntecavir is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring between 0.5-1.5 hours. The \nabsolute bioavailability has not been determined. Based on urinary excretion of unchanged drug, the \nbioavailability has been estimated to be at least 70%. There is a dose-proportionate increase in Cmax \nand AUC values following multiple doses ranging from 0.1-1 mg. Steady-state is achieved between 6-\n10 days after once daily dosing with ≈ 2 times accumulation. Cmax and Cmin at steady-state are 4.2 and \n0.3 ng/ml, respectively, for a dose of 0.5 mg, and 8.2 and 0.5 ng/ml, respectively, for 1 mg. The tablet \nand oral solution were bioequivalent in healthy subjects; therefore, both forms may be used \ninterchangeably.  \n  \nAdministration of 0.5 mg entecavir with a standard high-fat meal (945 kcal, 54.6 g fat) or a light meal \n(379 kcal, 8.2 g fat) resulted in a minimal delay in absorption (1-1.5 hour fed vs. 0.75 hour fasted), a \ndecrease in Cmax of 44-46%, and a decrease in AUC of 18-20%. The lower Cmax and AUC when taken \nwith food is not considered to be of clinical relevance in nucleoside-naive patients but could affect \nefficacy in lamivudine-refractory patients (see section 4.2).  \n  \nDistribution \n \nThe estimated volume of distribution for entecavir is in excess of total body water. Protein binding to \nhuman serum protein in vitro is ≈ 13%.  \n\n\n\n18 \n\n  \nBiotransformation \n \nEntecavir is not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of the CYP450 enzyme system. Following \nadministration of 14C-entecavir, no oxidative or acetylated metabolites and minor amounts of the phase \nII metabolites, glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, were observed.  \n  \nElimination \n \nEntecavir is predominantly eliminated by the kidney with urinary recovery of unchanged drug at \nsteady-state of about 75% of the dose. Renal clearance is independent of dose and ranges between \n360-471 ml/min suggesting that entecavir undergoes both glomerular filtration and net tubular \nsecretion. After reaching peak levels, entecavir plasma concentrations decreased in a bi-exponential \nmanner with a terminal elimination half-life of ≈ 128-149 hours. The observed drug accumulation \nindex is ≈ 2 times with once daily dosing, suggesting an effective accumulation half-life of about \n24 hours.  \n  \nHepatic impairment \n \nPharmacokinetic parameters in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment were similar to \nthose in patients with normal hepatic function.  \n  \nRenal impairment \n \nEntecavir clearance decreases with decreasing creatinine clearance. A 4-hour period of haemodialysis \nremoved ≈ 13% of the dose, and 0.3% was removed by CAPD. The pharmacokinetics of entecavir \nfollowing a single 1 mg dose in patients (without chronic hepatitis B infection) are shown in the table \nbelow:  \n  \n\nBaseline Creatinine Clearance (ml/min) \n Unimpaired \n\n>80 \n \n \n\n(n = 6) \n\nMild \n>50; \n≤80 \n\n \n(n = 6) \n\nModerate\n30-50 \n\n \n \n\n(n = 6) \n\nSevere \n20- \n<30 \n\n \n(n = 6) \n\nSevere \nManaged with \nHaemodialysis \n\n \n(n = 6) \n\nSevere \nManaged \n\nwith CAPD\n \n\n(n = 4) \n\nCmax (ng/ml) \n(CV%)  \n\n8.1 \n(30.7) \n\n \n\n10.4 \n(37.2) \n\n10.5 \n(22.7) \n\n15.3 \n(33.8) \n\n15.4 \n(56.4) \n\n16.6 \n(29.7) \n\nAUC(0-T)  \n(ng·h /ml)  \n(CV)  \n\n27.9 \n \n\n(25.6) \n \n\n51.5 \n \n\n(22.8) \n\n69.5 \n \n\n(22.7) \n\n145.7 \n \n\n(31.5) \n\n233.9 \n \n\n(28.4) \n\n221.8 \n \n\n(11.6) \n\nCLR (ml/min) (SD) \n383.2 \n\n(101.8) \n \n\n197.9 \n(78.1) \n\n135.6 \n(31.6) \n\n40.3 \n(10.1) \n\nNA NA \n\nCLT/F (ml/min) \n(SD)  \n\n588.1 \n(153.7) \n\n309.2 \n(62.6) \n\n226.3 \n(60.1) \n\n100.6 \n(29.1) \n\n50.6 \n(16.5) \n\n35.7 \n(19.6) \n\n  \nPost-Liver transplant \n \nEntecavir exposure in HBV-infected liver transplant recipients on a stable dose of cyclosporine A or \ntacrolimus (n = 9) was ≈ 2 times the exposure in healthy subjects with normal renal function. Altered \nrenal function contributed to the increase in entecavir exposure in these patients (see section 4.4).  \n  \nGender \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nAUC was 14% higher in women than in men, due to differences in renal function and weight. After \nadjusting for differences in creatinine clearance and body weight there was no difference in exposure \nbetween male and female subjects.  \n  \nElderly \n \nThe effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of entecavir was evaluated comparing elderly subjects in \nthe age range 65-83 years (mean age females 69 years, males 74 years) with young subjects in the age \nrange 20-40 years (mean age females 29 years, males 25 years). AUC was 29% higher in elderly than \nin young subjects, mainly due to differences in renal function and weight. After adjusting for \ndifferences in creatinine clearance and body weight, elderly subjects had a 12.5% higher AUC than \nyoung subjects. The population pharmacokinetic analysis covering patients in the age range 16-75 \nyears did not identify age as significantly influencing entecavir pharmacokinetics.  \n  \nRace \n \nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify race as significantly influencing entecavir \npharmacokinetics. However, conclusions can only be drawn for the Caucasian and Asian groups as \nthere were too few subjects in the other categories.  \n  \nPaediatric population \n \nThe steady-state pharmacokinetics of entecavir were evaluated (study 028) in  \n24 nucleoside naïve and 19 lamivudine-experienced HBeAg-positive paediatric subjects from 2 to \n<18 years of age with compensated liver disease. Entecavir exposure among nucleoside naïve subjects \nreceiving once daily doses of entecavir 0.015 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 0.5 mg was similar to \nthe exposure achieved in adults receiving once daily doses of 0.5 mg. The Cmax, AUC (0-24), and Cmin \nfor these subjects was 6.31 ng/ml, 18.33 ng h/ml, and 0.28 ng/ml, respectively.  \n \nEntecavir exposure among lamivudine-experienced subjects receiving once daily doses of entecavir \n0.030 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 1.0 mg was similar to the exposure achieved in adults receiving \nonce daily doses of 1.0 mg. The Cmax, AUC(0-24), and Cmin for these subjects was 14.48 ng/ml, \n38.58 ng·h/ml, and 0.47 ng/ml, respectively. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeat-dose toxicology studies in dogs, reversible perivascular inflammation was observed in the \ncentral nervous system, for which no-effect doses corresponded to exposures 19 and 10 times those in \nhumans (at 0.5 and 1 mg respectively). This finding was not observed in repeat-dose studies in other \nspecies, including monkeys administered entecavir daily for 1 year at exposures ≥100 times those in \nhumans.  \n  \nIn reproductive toxicology studies in which animals were administered entecavir for up to 4 weeks, no \nevidence of impaired fertility was seen in male or female rats at high exposures. Testicular changes \n(seminiferous tubular degeneration) were evident in repeat-dose toxicology studies in rodents and dogs \nat exposures ≥26 times those in humans. No testicular changes were evident in a 1-year study in \nmonkeys.  \n  \nIn pregnant rats and rabbits administered entecavir, no effect levels for embryotoxicity and maternal \ntoxicity corresponded to exposures ≥21 times those in humans. In rats, maternal toxicity, \nembryo-foetal toxicity (resorptions), lower foetal body weights, tail and vertebral malformations, \nreduced ossification (vertebrae, sternebrae, and phalanges), and extra lumbar vertebrae and ribs were \nobserved at high exposures. In rabbits, embryo-foetal toxicity (resorptions), reduced ossification \n(hyoid), and an increased incidence of 13th rib were observed at high exposures. In a peri-postnatal \nstudy in rats, no adverse effects on offspring were observed. In a separate study wherein entecavir was \nadministered to pregnant lactating rats at 10 mg/kg, both foetal exposure to entecavir and secretion of \n\n\n\n20 \n\nentecavir into milk were demonstrated. In juvenile rats administered entecavir from postnatal days 4 to \n80, a moderately reduced acoustic startle response was noted during the recovery period (postnatal \ndays 110 to 114) but not during the dosing period at AUC values ≥92 times those in humans at the \n0.5 mg dose or paediatric equivalent dose. Given the exposure margin, this finding is considered of \nunlikely clinical significance.  \n  \nNo evidence of genotoxicity was observed in an Ames microbial mutagenicity assay, a mammalian \ncell gene mutation assay, and a transformation assay with Syrian hamster embryo cells. A \nmicronucleus study and a DNA repair study in rats were also negative. Entecavir was clastogenic to \nhuman lymphocyte cultures at concentrations substantially higher than those achieved clinically.  \n  \nTwo-year carcinogenicity studies: in male mice, increases in the incidences of lung tumours were \nobserved at exposures ≥4 and ≥2 times that in humans at 0.5 mg and 1 mg respectively. Tumour \ndevelopment was preceded by pneumocyte proliferation in the lung which was not observed in rats, \ndogs, or monkeys, indicating that a key event in lung tumour development observed in mice likely was \nspecies-specific. Increased incidences of other tumours including brain gliomas in male and female \nrats, liver carcinomas in male mice, benign vascular tumours in female mice, and liver adenomas and \ncarcinomas in female rats were seen only at high lifetime exposures. However, the no effect levels \ncould not be precisely established. The predictivity of the findings for humans is not known. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Entecavir Mylan is and what it is used for \n2.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Entecavir Mylan is and what it is used for \n \nEntecavir Mylan tablets are anti-viral medicines, used to treat chronic (long term) hepatitis B \nvirus (HBV) infection in adults. Entecavir Mylan can be used in people whose liver is damaged but \nstill functions properly (compensated liver disease) and in people whose liver is damaged and does not \nfunction properly (decompensated liver disease).  \n  \nEntecavir Mylan tablets are also used to treat chronic (long term) HBV infection in children and \nadolescents aged 2 years to less than 18 years. Entecavir Mylan can be used in children whose liver \nis damaged but still functions properly (compensated liver disease).  \n  \nInfection by the hepatitis B virus can lead to damage to the liver. Entecavir Mylan reduces the amount \nof virus in your body, and improves the condition of the liver.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Entecavir Mylan  \n \nDo not take Entecavir Mylan \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to entecavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Entecavir Mylan  \n if you have ever had problems with your kidneys, tell your doctor. This is important because \n\nEntecavir Mylan is eliminated from your body through the kidneys and your dose or dosing \nschedule may need to be adjusted.  \n\n  \n do not stop taking Entecavir Mylan without your doctor’s advice since your hepatitis may \n\nworsen after stopping treatment. When your treatment with Entecavir Mylan is stopped, your \ndoctor will continue to monitor you and take blood tests for several months.  \n\n  \n discuss with your doctor whether your liver functions properly and, if not, what the possible \n\neffects on your Entecavir Mylan treatment may be.  \n\n\n\n44 \n\n  \n if you are also infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) be sure to tell your doctor. \n\nYou should not take Entecavir Mylan to treat your hepatitis B infection unless you are taking \nmedicines for HIV at the same time, as the effectiveness of future HIV treatment may be \nreduced. Entecavir Mylan will not control your HIV infection.  \n\n  \n taking Entecavir Mylan will not stop you from infecting other people with hepatitis B \n\nvirus (HBV) through sexual contact or body fluids (including blood contamination). So, it is \nimportant to take appropriate precautions to prevent others from becoming infected with HBV. \nA vaccine is available to protect those at risk from becoming infected with HBV.  \n\n  \n Entecavir Mylan belongs to a class of medicines that can cause lactic acidosis (excess of \n\nlactic acid in your blood) and enlargement of the liver. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and \nstomach pain might indicate the development of lactic acidosis. This rare but serious side effect \nhas occasionally been fatal. Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women, particularly if they are \nvery overweight. Your doctor will monitor you regularly while you are receiving Entecavir \nMylan.  \n\n  \n if you have previously received treatment for chronic hepatitis B, please inform your doctor.  \n  \nChildren and adolescents  \nEntecavir Mylan should not be used for children below 2 years of age or weighing less than 10 kg.  \n  \nOther medicines and Entecavir Mylan  \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n  \nEntecavir Mylan with food and drink  \nIn most cases you may take Entecavir Mylan with or without food. However, if you have had a \nprevious treatment with a medicine containing the active substance lamivudine you should consider \nthe following. If you were switched over to Entecavir Mylan because the treatment with lamivudine \nwas not successful, you should take Entecavir Mylan on an empty stomach once daily. If your liver \ndisease is very advanced, your doctor will also instruct you to take Entecavir Mylan on an empty \nstomach. Empty stomach means at least 2 hours after a meal and at least 2 hours before your next \nmeal.  \n \nChildren and adolescents (from 2 to less than 18 years of age) can take Entecavir Mylan with or \nwithout food.  \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility  \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. It has not been demonstrated that \nentecavir is safe to use during pregnancy. Entecavir Mylan must not be used during pregnancy unless \nspecifically directed by your doctor. It is important that women of childbearing age receiving \ntreatment with Entecavir Mylan use an effective method of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant.  \n  \nYou should not breast-feed during treatment with Entecavir Mylan. Tell your doctor if you are \nbreastfeeding. It is not known whether entecavir, the active ingredient in Entecavir Mylan, is excreted \nin human breast milk.  \n  \nDriving and using machines  \nDizziness, tiredness (fatigue) and sleepiness (somnolence) are common side effects which may impair \nyour ability to drive and use machines. If you have any concerns consult your doctor.  \n  \nEntecavir Mylan contains lactose  \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n3. How to take Entecavir Mylan \n \nNot all patients need to take the same dose of Entecavir Mylan.  \n  \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.   \n  \nFor adults the recommended dose is either 0.5 mg or 1 mg once daily orally (by mouth).  \n  \nYour dose will depend on:  \n whether you have been treated for HBV infection before, and what medicine you received.  \n whether you have kidney problems. Your doctor may prescribe a lower dose for you or instruct \n\nyou to take it less often than once a day.  \n the condition of your liver.  \n  \nFor children and adolescents (from 2 to less than 18 years of age), your child's doctor will decide the \nright dose based on your child's weight. Children weighing at least 32.6 kg may take the 0.5 mg tablet \nor an entecavir oral solution may be available. For patients weighing from 10 kg to 32.5 kg, an \nentecavir oral solution is recommended. All doses should be taken once daily orally (by mouth). There \nare no recommendations for entecavir in children less than 2 years of age or weighing less than 10 kg.  \n \nFor children and adolescents (from 2 to less than 18 years of age), Entecavir Mylan 0.5 mg Film-\ncoated Tablets are available or an oral solution may be available. Your child’s doctor will decide the \nright dose based on your child’s weight. \n  \nYour doctor will advise you on the dose that is right for you.  \nAlways take the dose recommended by your doctor to ensure that your medicine is fully effective and \nto reduce the development of resistance to treatment. Take Entecavir Mylan as long as your doctor has \ntold you. Your doctor will tell you if and when you should stop the treatment.  \n  \nSome patients must take Entecavir Mylan on an empty stomach (see Entecavir Mylan with food and \ndrink in Section 2). If your doctor instructs you to take Entecavir Mylan on an empty stomach, empty \nstomach means at least 2 hours after a meal and at least 2 hours before your next meal.  \n  \nIf you take more Entecavir Mylan than you should  \nContact your doctor at once.  \n  \nIf you forget to take Entecavir Mylan  \nIt is important that you do not miss any doses. If you miss a dose of Entecavir Mylan, take it as soon \nas possible, and then take your next scheduled dose at its regular time. If it is almost time for your next \ndose, do not take the missed dose. Wait and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  \n  \nDo not stop Entecavir Mylan without your doctor’s advice  \nSome people get very serious hepatitis symptoms when they stop taking entecavir. Tell your doctor \nimmediately about any changes in symptoms that you notice after stopping treatment.  \n  \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nPatients treated with entecavir have reported the following side effects:  \n\n\n\n46 \n\nCommon (at least 1 in 100 patients): headache, insomnia (inability to sleep), fatigue (extreme \ntiredness), dizziness, somnolence (sleepiness), vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea, dyspepsia (indigestion), \nand increased blood levels of liver enzymes.  \nUncommon (at least 1 in 1,000 patients): rash, hair loss.  \nRare (at least 1 in 10,000 patients): severe allergic reaction.  \n \nReporting of side effects  \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
