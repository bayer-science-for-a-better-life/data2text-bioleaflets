NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nResolor 1 mg film-coated tablets. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 1 mg prucalopride (as succinate). \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect: Each film-coated tablet contains 142.5 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n\n \n\nWhite to off-white, round, biconvex tablets marked \u201cPRU 1\u201d on one side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nResolor is indicated for symptomatic treatment of chronic constipation in adults in whom laxatives fail \n\nto provide adequate relief. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n\nAdults: 2 mg once daily with or without food, at any time of the day. \n\n \n\nDue to the specific mode of action of prucalopride (stimulation of propulsive motility), exceeding the \n\ndaily dose of 2 mg is not expected to increase efficacy. \n\n \n\nIf the intake of once daily prucalopride is not effective after 4 weeks of treatment, the patient should \n\nbe re-examined and the benefit of continuing treatment reconsidered. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of prucalopride has been established in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies for up to \n\n3 months. Efficacy beyond three months has not been demonstrated in placebo-controlled studies (see \n\nSection 5.1). In case of prolonged treatment, the benefit should be reassessed at regular intervals. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nOlder people (>65 years): Start with 1 mg once daily (see section 5.2); if needed the dose can be \n\nincreased to 2 mg once daily. \n \n\nPatients with renal impairment: The dose for patients with severe renal impairment \n\n(GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) is 1 mg once daily (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is \n\nrequired for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. \n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) start \n\nwith 1 mg once daily which may be increased to 2 mg if required to improve efficacy and if the 1 mg \n\ndose is well tolerated (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild \n\nto moderate hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 3 \n\nPaediatric population: Resolor should not be used in children and adolescents younger than 18 years \n\n(see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Renal impairment requiring dialysis. \n- Intestinal perforation or obstruction due to structural or functional disorder of the gut wall, \n\nobstructive ileus, severe inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract, such as Crohn\u2019s disease, \n\nand ulcerative colitis and toxic megacolon/megarectum. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nRenal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride (see section 5.2). A dose of 1 mg is \n\nrecommended in subjects with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing Resolor to patients with severe hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh class C) due to limited data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nThere is limited information on the safety and efficacy of Resolor for use in patients with severe and \n\nclinically unstable concomitant disease (e.g. cardiovascular or lung disease, neurological or psychiatric \n\ndisorders, cancer or AIDS and other endocrine disorders). Caution should be exercised when \n\nprescribing Resolor to patients with these conditions especially when used in patients with a history of \n\narrhythmias or ischaemic cardiovascular disease. \n\n \n\nIn case of severe diarrhoea, the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced and the use of an \n\nadditional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral contraception (see \n\nthe prescribing information of the oral contraceptive). \n\n \n\nThe tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \n\nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nPrucalopride has a low pharmacokinetic interaction potential. It is extensively excreted unchanged in \n\nurine (approximately 60% of the dose) and in vitro metabolism is very slow. \n\n \n\nPrucalopride did not inhibit specific CYP450 activities in in vitro studies in human liver microsomes \n\nat therapeutically relevant concentrations. \n\n \n\nAlthough prucalopride may be a weak substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), it is not an inhibitor of P-gp \n\nat clinically relevant concentrations. \n\n \n\nEffects of prucalopride on pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n\nA 30% increase in plasma concentrations of erythromycin was found during prucalopride \n\nco-administration. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. \n\n \n\nPrucalopride had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, digoxin, alcohol, \n\nparoxetine or oral contraceptives. \n\n \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on pharmacokinetics of prucalopride \n\nKetoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of P-gp, increased the systemic \n\nexposure to prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is too small to be clinically relevant. \n\n\n\n \n\n 4 \n\nInteractions of similar magnitude may be expected with other potent inhibitors of P-gp such as \n\nverapamil, cyclosporine A and quinidine. \n\n \n\nTherapeutic doses of probenecid, cimetidine, erythromycin and paroxetine did not affect the \n\npharmacokinetics of prucalopride. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment with \n\nprucalopride \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of prucalopride in pregnant women. Cases of \n\nspontaneous abortion have been observed during clinical studies, although, in the presence of other \n\nrisk factors, the relationship to prucalopride is unknown. Animal studies do not indicate direct or \n\nindirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (including pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \n\ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development) (see section 5.3). Resolor is not recommended \n\nduring pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nA human study has shown that prucalopride is excreted in breast milk. At therapeutic doses of \n\nResolor, no effects on breast-fed newborns/infants are anticipated. In the absence of human data in \n\nwomen who actively breast-fed while taking Resolor, a decision should be made whether to \n\ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Resolor therapy taking into account the benefit of \n\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nAnimal studies indicate that there is no effect on male or female fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nResolor may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines, since dizziness and \n\nfatigue have been observed in clinical studies, particularly during the first day of treatment (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nIn an integrated analysis of 17 double-blind placebo-controlled studies, Resolor was given orally to \n\napproximately 3,300 patients with chronic constipation. Of these, over 1,500 patients received Resolor \n\nat the recommended dose of 2 mg per day, while approximately 1,360 patients were treated with 4 mg \n\nprucalopride daily. The most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with Resolor 2 mg \n\ntherapy are headache (17.8%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain (13.7%), nausea \n\n(13.7%) and diarrhoea (12.0%)). The adverse reactions occur predominantly at the start of therapy and \n\nusually disappear within a few days with continued treatment. Other adverse reactions have been \n\nreported occasionally. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe following adverse reactions were reported in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dose \n\nof 2 mg with frequencies corresponding to very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), \n\nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known \n\n(cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are \n\npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are calculated based on the integrated \n\nanalysis of 17 double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 5 \n\nTable 1: Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) Associated with Resolor \n\nSystem/Organ Class Incidence Category Adverse Drug Reaction \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Decreased appetite \n\nNervous system disorders Very common Headache \n\nCommon Dizziness \n\nUncommon Tremors, migraine \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon Palpitations \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Uncommon Vertigo \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal \n\npain \n\nCommon Vomiting, dyspepsia, \n\nflatulence, gastrointestinal \n\nsounds abnormal \n\nUncommon Rectal haemorrhage \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Uncommon Pollakiuria \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon Fatigue \n\nUncommon Pyrexia, malaise \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nAfter the first day of treatment, the most common adverse reactions were reported in similar \n\nfrequencies (incidence no more than 1% different between prucalopride and placebo) during Resolor \n\ntherapy as during placebo, with the exception of nausea and diarrhoea that still occurred more \n\nfrequently during Resolor therapy, but less pronounced (differences in incidence between Resolor and \n\nplacebo of 1.3% and 3.4%, respectively). \n\n \n\nPalpitations were reported in 0.7% of the placebo patients, 0.9% of the 1 mg prucalopride patients, \n\n0.9% of the 2 mg prucalopride patients and 1.9% of the 4 mg prucalopride patients. The majority of \n\npatients continued using prucalopride. As with any new symptom, patients should discuss the new \n\nonset of palpitations with their physician.  \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIn a study in healthy volunteers, treatment with prucalopride was well tolerated when given in an \n\nup-titrating scheme up to 20 mg once daily (10 times the recommended therapeutic dose). An \n\noverdose may result in symptoms resulting from an exaggeration of prucalopride\u2019s known \n\npharmacodynamic effects and include headache, nausea and diarrhoea. Specific treatment is not \n\navailable for Resolor overdose. Should an overdose occur, the patient should be treated \n\nsymptomatically and supportive measures instituted, as required. Extensive fluid loss by diarrhoea or \n\nvomiting may require correction of electrolyte disturbances. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n 6 \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other drugs for constipation, ATC code: A06AX05.  \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nPrucalopride is a dihydrobenzofurancarboxamide with gastrointestinal prokinetic activities. \n\nPrucalopride is a selective, high affinity serotonin (5-HT4) receptor agonist, which is likely to explain \n\nits prokinetic effects. In vitro, only at concentrations exceeding its 5-HT4 receptor affinity by at least \n\n150-fold, affinity for other receptors was detected. In rats, prucalopride in vivo, at doses above \n\n5 mg/kg (at and above 30-70 times the clinical exposure), induced hyperprolactinaemia caused by an \n\nantagonistic action at the D2 receptor.  \n\n \n\nIn dogs, prucalopride alters colonic motility patterns via serotonin 5-HT4 receptor stimulation: it \n\nstimulates proximal colonic motility, enhances gastroduodenal motility and accelerates delayed gastric \n\nemptying. Furthermore, giant migrating contractions are induced by prucalopride. These are \n\nequivalent to the colonic mass movements in humans, and provide the main propulsive force to \n\ndefaecation. In dogs, the effects observed in the gastrointestinal tract are sensitive to blockade with \n\nselective 5-HT4 receptor antagonists illustrating that the observed effects are exerted via selective \n\naction on 5-HT4 receptors. \n\n \n\nThese pharmacodynamic effects of prucalopride have been confirmed in human subjects with chronic \n\nconstipation using manometry in an open-label, randomised, crossover, reader-blinded study \n\ninvestigating the effect of prucalopride 2 mg and an osmotic laxative on colon motility as determined \n\nby the number of colonic high-amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs, also known as giant \n\nmigrating contractions). Compared with a constipation treatment working through osmotic action, \n\nprokinetic stimulation with prucalopride increased colonic motility as measured by the number of \n\nHAPCs during the first 12 hours after intake of the investigational product. The clinical significance or \n\nbenefit of this mechanism of action when compared with other laxatives has not been investigated. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nAdult population \n\nThe efficacy of Resolor was established in three multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 12-week \n\nplacebo-controlled studies in subjects with chronic constipation (n=1,279 on Resolor, 1,124 females, \n\n155 males). The Resolor doses studied in each of these three studies included 2 mg and 4 mg once \n\ndaily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion (%) of subjects that reached normalisation of \n\nbowel movements defined as an average of three or more spontaneous, complete bowel movements \n\n(SCBM) per week over the 12-week treatment period. \n\n \n\nThe proportion of female patients in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief treated with the \n\nrecommended dose of 2 mg Resolor (n=458) that reached an average of \u22653 SCBM per week was \n\n31.0% (week 4) and 24.7% (week 12), versus 8.6% (week 4) and 9.2% (week 12) on placebo. A \n\nclinically meaningful improvement of \u22651 SCBM per week, the most important secondary efficacy \n\nendpoint, was achieved in 51.0% (week 4) and 44.2% (week 12) treated with 2 mg Resolor versus \n\n21.7% (week 4) and 22.6% (week 12) of placebo patients. \n\n \n\nThe effect of Resolor on spontaneous bowel movements (SBM) also proved to be statistically superior \n\nto placebo for the portion of patients that had an increase of \u22651 SBM/week over the 12-week treatment \n\nperiod. At week 12, 68.3% of patients treated with 2 mg prucalopride had an average increase of \n\n\u22651 SBM/week versus 37.0% of placebo patients (p<0.001 vs placebo). \n\n \n\nIn all three studies, treatment with Resolor also resulted in significant improvements in a validated and \n\ndisease specific set of symptom measures (PAC-SYM), including abdominal (bloating, discomfort, \n\npain and cramps), stool (incomplete bowel movements, false alarm, straining, too hard, too small) and \n\n\n\n \n\n 7 \n\nrectal symptoms (painful bowel movements, burning, bleeding/tearing), determined at week 4 and \n\nweek 12. At week 4, the proportion of patients with an improvement of \u22651 versus baseline in the \n\nPAC-SYM abdominal, stool, and rectal symptom subscales was 41.3%, 41.6%, and 31.3% \n\nrespectively in patients treated with prucalopride 2 mg compared with 26.9%, 24.4% and 22.9% in \n\npatients on placebo. Similar results were observed at Week 12: 43.4%, 42.9%, and 31.7% respectively \n\nin 2 mg Resolor patients versus 26.9%, 27.2%, and 23.4% in placebo patients (p<0.001 vs placebo). \n\n \n\nA significant benefit on a number of Quality of Life measures, such as degree of satisfaction with \n\ntreatment and with bowel habits, physical and psychosocial discomfort and worries and concerns, was \n\nalso observed at both the 4 and 12 week assessment time points. At Week 4, the proportion of patients \n\nwith an improvement of \u22651 versus baseline in the Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life \n\nsatisfaction subscale (PAC-QOL) was 47.7% in patients treated with Resolor 2 mg compared with \n\n20.2% in patients on placebo. Similar results were observed at Week 12: 46.9% in 2 mg Resolor \n\npatients versus 19.0% in placebo patients (p<0.001 vs placebo). \n\n \n\nIn addition, the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Resolor in male patients with chronic constipation \n\nwere evaluated in a 12-week, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo\u2013controlled study \n\n(N=370). The primary endpoint of the study was met: a statistically significantly higher percentage of \n\nsubjects in the Resolor group (37.9%) had an average of \u22653 SCBMs/week compared with subjects in \n\nthe placebo treatment group (17.7%) (p<0.0001) over the 12-week double-blind treatment period. The \n\nsafety profile of Resolor was consistent with that seen in female patients. \n\n \n\nLong-term study \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Resolor in patients (aged \u226518 or older) with chronic constipation, were \n\nevaluated in a 24 week multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study (N=361). The \n\nproportion of patients with an average weekly frequency of \u22653 Spontaneous Complete Bowel \n\nMovements (SCBMs) per week (i.e., responders) over the 24-week double-blind treatment phase was \n\nnot statistically different (p=0.367) between the Resolor (25.1%) and placebo (20.7%) treatment \n\ngroups. The difference between treatment groups in the average weekly frequency of \u22653 SCBMs per \n\nweek was not statistically significant over Weeks 1-12 which is inconsistent with the 5 other \n\nmulticentre, randomised, double-blind, 12-week placebo controlled studies demonstrating efficacy at \n\nthis timepoint in adult patients. The study is therefore considered to be inconclusive with respect to \n\nefficacy. However, the totality of the data including the other double-blind placebo controlled 12 week \n\nstudies support the efficacy of Resolor. The safety profile of prucalopride in this 24 week study was \n\nconsistent with that seen in the previous 12 week studies. \n\n \n\nResolor has been shown not to cause rebound phenomena, nor to induce dependency. \n\n \n\nTQT study \n\nA thorough QT study was performed to evaluate the effects of Resolor on the QT interval at \n\ntherapeutic (2 mg) and supratherapeutic doses (10 mg) and compared with the effects of placebo and a \n\npositive control. This study did not show significant differences between Resolor and placebo at either \n\ndose, based on mean QT measurements and outlier analysis. This confirmed the results of two placebo \n\ncontrolled QT studies. In double-blind clinical studies, the incidence of QT-related adverse events and \n\nventricular arrhythmias was low and comparable to placebo. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Resolor in paediatric patients (aged 6 months to 18 years) with functional \n\nconstipation, were evaluated in an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (N=213), followed by \n\na 16 week open-label comparator-controlled (Polyethylene glycol 4000) study of up to 24 weeks \n\n(N=197). The starting dose administered was 0.04 mg/kg/day titrated between 0.02 and \n\n0.06 mg/kg/day (to a maximum of 2 mg daily) for children weighing \u226450 kg given as an oral solution \n\nof Resolor or matching placebo. Children weighing >50 kg received 2 mg/day Resolor tablets or \n\nmatching placebo. \n\n \n\nResponse to the treatment was defined as having an average of \u22653 spontaneous bowel movements \n\n(SBMs) per week and an average number of faecal incontinence episodes of \u22641 per 2 weeks. The \n\n\n\n \n\n 8 \n\nresults of the study showed no difference in efficacy between Resolor and placebo with response rates \n\nof 17% and 17.8% respectively (P=0.9002). Resolor was generally well tolerated. The incidence of \n\nsubjects with at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was similar between the Resolor \n\ntreatment group (69.8%) and the placebo treatment group (60.7%). Overall, the safety profile of \n\nResolor in children was the same as in adults. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nPrucalopride is rapidly absorbed; after a single oral dose of 2 mg in healthy subjects, Cmax was attained \n\nin 2-3 hours. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Concomitant intake of food does not influence \n\nthe oral bioavailability of prucalopride. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nPrucalopride is extensively distributed, and has a steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss) of \n\n567 litres. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is about 30%. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nMetabolism is not the major route of elimination of prucalopride. In vitro, human liver metabolism is \n\nvery slow and only minor amounts of metabolites are found. In an oral dose study with radiolabelled \n\nprucalopride in man, small amounts of seven metabolites were recovered in urine and faeces. The \n\nquantitatively most important metabolite in excreta, R107504, accounted for 3.2% and 3.1% of the \n\ndose in urine and faeces, respectively. Other metabolites identified and quantified in urine and faeces \n\nwere R084536 (formed by N-dealkylation) accounting for 3% of the dose and products of \n\nhydroxylation (3% of the dose) and N-oxidation (2% of the dose). Unchanged active substance made \n\nup about 92-94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. R107504, R084536 and R104065 (formed by \n\nO-demethylation) were identified as minor plasma metabolites. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nA large fraction of the active substance is excreted unchanged (60-65% of the administered dose in \n\nurine and about 5% in faeces). Renal excretion of unchanged prucalopride involves both passive \n\nfiltration and active secretion. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 ml/min. Its terminal \n\nhalf-life is about one day. Steady-state is reached within three to four days. On once daily treatment \n\nwith 2 mg prucalopride, steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values \n\nof 2.5 and 7 ng/ml, respectively. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 \n\nto 2.3. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic \n\nrange (tested up to 20 mg). Prucalopride o.d. displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the apparent total clearance of prucalopride was \n\ncorrelated with creatinine clearance, but that age, body weight, sex or race had no influence. \n\n \n\nOlder people \n\nAfter once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations and AUC of prucalopride in older people \n\nwere 26% to 28% higher than in young adults. This effect can be attributed to a diminished renal \n\nfunction in older people. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nCompared to subjects with normal renal function, plasma concentrations of prucalopride after a single \n\n2 mg dose were on average 25% and 51% higher in subjects with mild (ClCR 50-79 ml/min) and \n\nmoderate (ClCR 25-49 ml/min) renal impairment, respectively. In subjects with severe renal \n\nimpairment (ClCR \u226424 ml/min), plasma concentrations were 2.3 times the levels in healthy subjects \n\n(see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 9 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNon-renal elimination contributes to about 35% of total elimination. In a small pharmacokinetic study, \n\nthe Cmax and AUC of prucalopride were, on average, 10-20% higher in patients with moderate to \n\nsevere hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to \n\nreproduction and development. An extended series of safety pharmacology studies with special \n\nemphasis on cardiovascular parameters showed no relevant changes in haemodynamic and ECG \n\nderived parameters (QTc) with the exception of a modest increase in heart rate and blood pressure \n\nobserved in anaesthetised pigs after intravenous administration, and an increase in blood pressure in \n\nconscious dogs after bolus intravenous administration, which was not observed either in anaesthetised \n\ndogs or after oral administration in dogs reaching similar plasma levels. A subcutaneous \n\nneonatal/juvenile toxicity study performed in rats 7-55 days of age resulted in a NOAEL of \n\n10 mg/kg/day. The AUC0-24h exposure ratios at the NOAEL versus human children (dosed at \n\napproximately 0.04 mg/kg daily) ranged between 21 and 71 providing adequate safety margins for the \n\nclinical dose. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nResolor is indicated for symptomatic treatment of chronic constipation in adults in whom laxatives fail \n\nto provide adequate relief. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n\nAdults: 2 mg once daily with or without food, at any time of day. \n\nDue to the specific mode of action of prucalopride (stimulation of propulsive motility), exceeding the \n\ndaily dose of 2 mg is not expected to increase efficacy. \n\nIf the intake of once daily prucalopride is not effective after 4 weeks of treatment, the patient should \n\nbe re-examined and the benefit of continuing treatment reconsidered. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of prucalopride has been established in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies for up to \n\n3 months. Efficacy beyond three months has not been demonstrated in placebo-controlled studies (see \n\nSection 5.1). In case of prolonged treatment, the benefit should be reassessed at regular intervals. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nOlder people (>65 years): Start with 1 mg once daily (see section 5.2); if needed the dose can be \n\nincreased to 2 mg once daily. \n \n\nPatients with renal impairment: The dose for patients with severe renal impairment \n\n(GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) is 1 mg once daily (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is \n\nrequired for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. \n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) start \n\nwith 1 mg once daily which may be increased to 2 mg if required to improve efficacy and if the 1 mg \n\ndose is well tolerated (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild \n\nto moderate hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 12 \n\nPaediatric population: Resolor should not be used in children and adolescents younger than 18 years \n(see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Renal impairment requiring dialysis. \n- Intestinal perforation or obstruction due to structural or functional disorder of the gut wall, \n\nobstructive ileus, severe inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract, such as Crohn\u2019s disease, \n\nand ulcerative colitis and toxic megacolon/megarectum. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nRenal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride (see section 5.2). A dose of 1 mg is \n\nrecommended in subjects with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing Resolor to patients with severe hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh class C) due to limited data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nThere is limited information on the safety and efficacy of Resolor for use in patients with severe and \n\nclinically unstable concomitant disease (e.g. cardiovascular or lung disease, neurological or psychiatric \n\ndisorders, cancer or AIDS and other endocrine disorders). Caution should be exercised when \n\nprescribing Resolor to patients with these conditions especially when used in patients with a history of \n\narrhythmias or ischaemic cardiovascular disease. \n\n \n\nIn case of severe diarrhoea, the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced and the use of an \n\nadditional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral contraception (see \n\nthe prescribing information of the oral contraceptive). \n\n \n\nThe tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \n\nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nPrucalopride has a low pharmacokinetic interaction potential. It is extensively excreted unchanged in \n\nurine (approximately 60% of the dose) and in vitro metabolism is very slow. \n\n \n\nPrucalopride did not inhibit specific CYP450 activities in in vitro studies in human liver microsomes \n\nat therapeutically relevant concentrations. \n\n \n\nAlthough prucalopride may be a weak substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), it is not an inhibitor of P-gp \n\nat clinically relevant concentrations. \n\n \n\nEffects of prucalopride on pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n\nA 30% increase in plasma concentrations of erythromycin was found during prucalopride \n\nco-administration. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear. \n\n \n\nPrucalopride had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, digoxin, alcohol, \n\nparoxetine or oral contraceptives. \n\n \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on pharmacokinetics of prucalopride \n\nKetoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of P-gp, increased the systemic \n\nexposure to prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is too small to be clinically relevant. \n\n\n\n \n\n 13 \n\nInteractions of similar magnitude may be expected with other potent inhibitors of P-gp such as \n\nverapamil, cyclosporine A and quinidine. \n\n \n\nTherapeutic doses of probenecid, cimetidine, erythromycin and paroxetine did not affect the \n\npharmacokinetics of prucalopride. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment with \n\nprucalopride \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of prucalopride in pregnant women. Cases of \n\nspontaneous abortion have been observed during clinical studies, although, in the presence of other \n\nrisk factors, the relationship to prucalopride is unknown. Animal studies do not indicate direct or \n\nindirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (including pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \n\ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development) (see section 5.3). Resolor is not recommended \n\nduring pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nA human study has shown that prucalopride is excreted in breast milk. At therapeutic doses of \n\nResolor, no effects on breast-fed newborns/infants are anticipated. In the absence of human data in \n\nwomen who actively breast-fed while taking Resolor, a decision should be made whether to \n\ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Resolor therapy taking into account the benefit of \n\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nAnimal studies indicate that there is no effect on male or female fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nResolor may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines, since dizziness and \n\nfatigue have been observed in clinical studies, particularly during the first day of treatment (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nIn an integrated analysis of 17 double-blind placebo-controlled studies, Resolor was given orally to \n\napproximately 3,300 patients with chronic constipation. Of these, over 1,500 patients received Resolor \n\nat the recommended dose of 2 mg per day, while approximately 1,360 patients were treated with 4 mg \n\nprucalopride daily. The most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with Resolor 2 mg \n\ntherapy are headache (17.8%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain (13.7%), nausea \n\n(13.7%) and diarrhoea (12.0%)). The adverse reactions occur predominantly at the start of therapy and \n\nusually disappear within a few days with continued treatment. Other adverse reactions have been \n\nreported occasionally. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe following adverse reactions were reported in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dose \n\nof 2 mg with frequencies corresponding to very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), \n\nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000) and not \n\nknown (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \n\nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are calculated based on the integrated \n\nanalysis of 17 double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 14 \n\nTable 1: Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) Associated with Resolor \n\nSystem/Organ Class Incidence Category Adverse Drug Reaction \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Decreased appetite \n\nNervous system disorders Very common Headache \n\nCommon Dizziness \n\nUncommon Tremors, migraine \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon Palpitations \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Uncommon Vertigo \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal \n\npain \n\nCommon Vomiting, dyspepsia, flatulence, \n\ngastrointestinal sounds \n\nabnormal \n\nUncommon Rectal haemorrhage \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Uncommon Pollakiuria \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon Fatigue \n\nUncommon Pyrexia, malaise \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nAfter the first day of treatment, the most common adverse reactions were reported in similar \n\nfrequencies (incidence no more than 1% different between prucalopride and placebo) during Resolor \n\ntherapy as during placebo, with the exception of nausea and diarrhoea that still occurred more \n\nfrequently during Resolor therapy, but less pronounced (differences in incidence between Resolor and \n\nplacebo of 1.3% and 3.4%, respectively). \n\n \n\nPalpitations were reported in 0.7% of the placebo patients, 0.9% of the 1 mg prucalopride patients, \n\n0.9% of the 2 mg prucalopride patients and 1.9% of the 4 mg prucalopride patients. The majority of \n\npatients continued using prucalopride. As with any new symptom, patients should discuss the new \n\nonset of palpitations with their physician. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIn a study in healthy volunteers, treatment with prucalopride was well tolerated when given in an \n\nup-titrating scheme up to 20 mg once daily (10 times the recommended therapeutic dose). An \n\noverdose may result in symptoms resulting from an exaggeration of prucalopride\u2019s known \n\npharmacodynamic effects and include headache, nausea and diarrhoea. Specific treatment is not \n\navailable for Resolor overdose. Should an overdose occur, the patient should be treated \n\nsymptomatically and supportive measures instituted, as required. Extensive fluid loss by diarrhoea or \n\nvomiting may require correction of electrolyte disturbances. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n 15 \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other drugs for constipation, ATC code: A06AX05. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nPrucalopride is a dihydrobenzofurancarboxamide with gastrointestinal prokinetic activities. \n\nPrucalopride is a selective, high affinity serotonin (5-HT4) receptor agonist, which is likely to explain \n\nits prokinetic effects. In vitro, only at concentrations exceeding its 5-HT4 receptor affinity by at least \n\n150-fold, affinity for other receptors was detected. In rats, prucalopride in vivo, at doses above \n\n5 mg/kg (at and above 30-70 times the clinical exposure), induced hyperprolactinaemia caused by an \n\nantagonistic action at the D2 receptor.  \n\n \n\nIn dogs, prucalopride alters colonic motility patterns via serotonin 5-HT4 receptor stimulation: it \n\nstimulates proximal colonic motility, enhances gastroduodenal motility and accelerates delayed gastric \n\nemptying. Furthermore, giant migrating contractions are induced by prucalopride. These are \n\nequivalent to the colonic mass movements in humans, and provide the main propulsive force to \n\ndefaecation. In dogs, the effects observed in the gastrointestinal tract are sensitive to blockade with \n\nselective 5-HT4 receptor antagonists illustrating that the observed effects are exerted via selective \n\naction on 5-HT4 receptors. \n\n \n\nThese pharmacodynamic effects of prucalopride have been confirmed in human subjects with chronic \n\nconstipation using manometry in an open-label, randomised, crossover, reader-blinded study \n\ninvestigating the effect of prucalopride 2 mg and an osmotic laxative on colon motility as determined \n\nby the number of colonic high-amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs, also known as giant \n\nmigrating contractions). Compared with a constipation treatment working through osmotic action, \n\nprokinetic stimulation with prucalopride increased colonic motility as measured by the number of \n\nHAPCs during the first 12 hours after intake of the investigational product. The clinical significance or \n\nbenefit of this mechanism of action when compared with other laxatives has not been investigated. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nAdult population \n\nThe efficacy of Resolor was established in three multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 12-week \n\nplacebo-controlled studies in subjects with chronic constipation (n=1,279 on Resolor, 1,124 females, \n\n155 males). The Resolor doses studied in each of these three studies included 2 mg and 4 mg once \n\ndaily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion (%) of subjects that reached normalisation of \n\nbowel movements defined as an average of three or more spontaneous, complete bowel movements \n\n(SCBM) per week over the 12-week treatment period. \n\n \n\nThe proportion of female patients in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief treated with the \n\nrecommended dose of 2 mg Resolor (n=458) that reached an average of \u22653 SCBM per week was \n\n31.0% (week 4) and 24.7% (week 12), versus 8.6% (week 4) and 9.2% (week 12) on placebo. A \n\nclinically meaningful improvement of \u22651 SCBM per week, the most important secondary efficacy \n\nendpoint, was achieved in 51.0% (week 4) and 44.2% (week 12) treated with 2 mg Resolor versus \n\n21.7% (week 4) and 22.6% (week 12) of placebo patients. \n\n \n\nThe effect of Resolor on spontaneous bowel movements (SBM) also proved to be statistically superior \n\nto placebo for the portion of patients that had an increase of \u22651 SBM/week over the 12-week treatment \n\nperiod. At week 12, 68.3% of patients treated with 2 mg Resolor had an average increase of \n\n\u22651 SBM/week versus 37.0% of placebo patients (p<0.001 vs placebo). \n\n \n\nIn all three studies, treatment with Resolor also resulted in significant improvements in a validated and \n\ndisease specific set of symptom measures (PAC-SYM), including abdominal (bloating, discomfort, \n\npain and cramps), stool (incomplete bowel movements, false alarm, straining, too hard, too small) and \n\n\n\n \n\n 16 \n\nrectal symptoms (painful bowel movements, burning, bleeding/tearing), determined at week 4 and \n\nweek 12. At week 4, the proportion of patients with an improvement of \u22651 versus baseline in the \n\nPAC-SYM abdominal, stool, and rectal symptom subscales was 41.3%, 41.6%, and 31.3% \n\nrespectively in patients treated with Resolor 2 mg compared with 26.9%, 24.4% and 22.9% in patients \n\non placebo. Similar results were observed at Week 12: 43.4%, 42.9%, and 31.7% respectively in 2 mg \n\nResolor patients versus 26.9%, 27.2%, and 23.4% in placebo patients (p<0.001 vs placebo). \n\n \n\nA significant benefit on a number of Quality of Life measures, such as degree of satisfaction with \n\ntreatment and with bowel habits, physical and psychosocial discomfort and worries and concerns, was \n\nalso observed at both the 4 and 12 week assessment time points. At Week 4, the proportion of patients \n\nwith an improvement of \u22651 versus baseline in the Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life \n\nsatisfaction subscale (PAC-QOL) was 47.7% in patients treated with Resolor 2 mg compared with \n\n20.2% in patients on placebo. Similar results were observed at Week 12: 46.9% in 2 mg Resolor \n\npatients versus 19.0% in placebo patients (p<0.001 vs placebo). \n\n \n\nIn addition, the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Resolor in male patients with chronic constipation \n\nwere evaluated in a 12-week, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo\u2013controlled study \n\n(N=370). The primary endpoint of the study was met: a statistically significantly higher percentage of \n\nsubjects in the Resolor group (37.9%) had an average of \u22653 SCBMs/week compared with subjects in \n\nthe placebo treatment group (17.7%) (p<0.0001) over the 12-week double-blind treatment period. The \n\nsafety profile of Resolor was consistent with that seen in female patients. \n\n \n\nLong-term study \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Resolor in patients (aged \u226518 or older) with chronic constipation, were \n\nevaluated in a 24 week multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study (N=361). The \n\nproportion of patients with an average weekly frequency of \u22653 Spontaneous Complete Bowel \n\nMovements (SCBMs) per week (i.e., responders) over the 24-week double-blind treatment phase was \n\nnot statistically different (p=0.367) between the prucalopride (25.1%) and placebo (20.7%) treatment \n\ngroups. The difference between treatment groups in the average weekly frequency of \u22653 SCBMs per \n\nweek was not statistically significant over Weeks 1-12 which is inconsistent with the 5 other \n\nmulticentre, randomised, double-blind, 12-week placebo controlled studies demonstrating efficacy at \n\nthis timepoint in adult patients. The study is therefore considered to be inconclusive with respect to \n\nefficacy. However, the totality of the data including the other double-blind placebo controlled 12 week \n\nstudies support the efficacy of Resolor. The safety profile of Resolor in this 24 week study was \n\nconsistent with that seen in the previous 12 week studies. \n\n \n\nResolor has been shown not to cause rebound phenomena, nor to induce dependency. \n\n \n\nTQT study \n\nA thorough QT study was performed to evaluate the effects of Resolor on the QT interval at \n\ntherapeutic (2 mg) and supratherapeutic doses (10 mg) and compared with the effects of placebo and a \n\npositive control. This study did not show significant differences between Resolor and placebo at either \n\ndose, based on mean QT measurements and outlier analysis. This confirmed the results of two placebo \n\ncontrolled QT studies. In double-blind clinical studies, the incidence of QT-related adverse events and \n\nventricular arrhythmias was low and comparable to placebo. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Resolor in paediatric patients (aged 6 months to 18 years) with functional \n\nconstipation, were evaluated in an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (N=213), followed by \n\na 16 week open-label comparator-controlled (Polyethylene glycol 4000) study of up to 24 weeks \n\n(N=197). The starting dose administered was 0.04 mg/kg/day titrated between 0.02 and \n\n0.06 mg/kg/day (to a maximum of 2 mg daily) for children weighing \u226450 kg given as an oral solution \n\nof Resolor or matching placebo. Children weighing >50 kg received 2 mg/day Resolor tablets or \n\nmatching placebo. \n\n \n\nResponse to the treatment was defined as having an average of \u22653 spontaneous bowel movements \n\n(SBMs) per week and an average number of faecal incontinence episodes of \u22641 per 2 weeks. The \n\n\n\n \n\n 17 \n\nresults of the study showed no difference in efficacy between Resolor and placebo with response rates \n\nof 17% and 17.8% respectively (P=0.9002). Resolor was generally well tolerated. The incidence of \n\nsubjects with at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was similar between the Resolor \n\ntreatment group (69.8%) and the placebo treatment group (60.7%). Overall, the safety profile of \n\nResolor in children was the same as in adults. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nPrucalopride is rapidly absorbed; after a single oral dose of 2 mg in healthy subjects, Cmax was attained \n\nin 2-3 hours. The absolute oral bioavailability is >90%. Concomitant intake of food does not influence \n\nthe oral bioavailability of prucalopride. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nPrucalopride is extensively distributed, and has a steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss) of \n\n567 litres. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is about 30%. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nMetabolism is not the major route of elimination of prucalopride. In vitro, human liver metabolism is \n\nvery slow and only minor amounts of metabolites are found. In an oral dose study with radiolabelled \n\nprucalopride in man, small amounts of seven metabolites were recovered in urine and faeces. The \n\nquantitatively most important metabolite in excreta, R107504, accounted for 3.2% and 3.1% of the \n\ndose in urine and faeces, respectively. Other metabolites identified and quantified in urine and faeces \n\nwere R084536 (formed by N-dealkylation) accounting for 3% of the dose and products of \n\nhydroxylation (3% of the dose) and N-oxidation (2% of the dose). Unchanged active substance made \n\nup about 92-94% of the total radioactivity in plasma. R107504, R084536 and R104065 (formed by \n\nO-demethylation) were identified as minor plasma metabolites. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nA large fraction of the active substance is excreted unchanged (60-65% of the administered dose in \n\nurine and about 5% in faeces). Renal excretion of unchanged prucalopride involves both passive \n\nfiltration and active secretion. The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 ml/min. Its terminal \n\nhalf-life is about one day. Steady-state is reached within three to four days. On once daily treatment \n\nwith 2 mg prucalopride, steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values \n\nof 2.5 and 7 ng/ml, respectively. The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1.9 \n\nto 2.3. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride is dose-proportional within and beyond the therapeutic \n\nrange (tested up to 20 mg). Prucalopride o.d. displays time-independent kinetics during prolonged \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the apparent total clearance of prucalopride was \n\ncorrelated with creatinine clearance, but that age, body weight, sex or race had no influence. \n\n \n\nOlder people \n\nAfter once daily dosing of 1 mg, peak plasma concentrations and AUC of prucalopride in older people \n\nwere 26% to 28% higher than in young adults. This effect can be attributed to a diminished renal \n\nfunction in older people. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nCompared to subjects with normal renal function, plasma concentrations of prucalopride after a single \n\n2 mg dose were on average 25% and 51% higher in subjects with mild (ClCR 50-79 ml/min) and \n\nmoderate (ClCR 25-49 ml/min) renal impairment, respectively. In subjects with severe renal \n\nimpairment (ClCR \u226424 ml/min), plasma concentrations were 2.3 times the levels in healthy subjects \n\n(see section 4.2 and 4.4).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 18 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNon-renal elimination contributes to about 35% of total elimination. In a small pharmacokinetic study, \n\nthe Cmax and AUC of prucalopride were, on average, 10-20% higher in patients with moderate to \n\nsevere hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to \n\nreproduction and development. An extended series of safety pharmacology studies with special \n\nemphasis on cardiovascular parameters showed no relevant changes in haemodynamic and ECG \n\nderived parameters (QTc) with the exception of a modest increase in heart rate and blood pressure \n\nobserved in anaesthetised pigs after intravenous administration, and an increase in blood pressure in \n\nconscious dogs after bolus intravenous administration, which was not observed either in anaesthetised \n\ndogs or after oral administration in dogs reaching similar plasma levels. A subcutaneous \n\nneonatal/juvenile toxicity study performed in rats 7-55 days of age resulted in a NOAEL of \n\n10 mg/kg/day.

What Resolor is and what it is used for \n \n\nResolor contains the active substance prucalopride. \n\n \n\nResolor belongs to a group of gut motility enhancing medicines (gastrointestinal prokinetics). It acts \n\non the muscle wall of the gut, helping to restore the normal functioning of the bowel. Resolor is used \n\nfor the treatment of chronic constipation in adults in whom laxatives do not work well enough. \n\n \n\nNot for use in children and adolescents younger than 18 years. \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Resolor \n \n\nDo not take Resolor: \n\n- if you are allergic to prucalopride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- if you are on renal dialysis, \n\n- if you suffer from perforation or obstruction of the gut wall, severe inflammation of the \n\nintestinal tract, such as Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis or toxic megacolon/megarectum. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Resolor. \n\n \n\nTake special care with Resolor and tell your doctor if you: \n\n- suffer from severe kidney disease, \n\n- suffer from severe liver disease, \n\n- are currently under supervision by a doctor for a serious medical problem such as lung or heart \n\ndisease, nervous system or mental health problems, cancer, AIDS or a hormonal disorder. \n\n \n\nIf you have very bad diarrhoea, the contraceptive pill may not work properly and the use of an extra \n\nmethod of contraception is recommended. See the instructions in the patient leaflet of the \n\ncontraceptive pill you are taking. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 32 \n\nOther medicines and Resolor \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, or have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. \n\n \n\nResolor with food and drink \n\nResolor can be taken with or without food and drinks, at any time of the day. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nResolor is not recommended for use during pregnancy. \n\n- Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. \n- Use a reliable method of contraception while you\u2019re taking Resolor, to prevent pregnancy. \n- If you do become pregnant during treatment with Resolor, tell your doctor. \n \n\nWhen breast-feeding, prucalopride can pass into breast milk. Breast-feeding is not recommended \n\nduring treatment with Resolor. Talk to your doctor about this. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nResolor is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, sometimes Resolor may \n\ncause dizziness and tiredness, especially on the first day of treatment, and this may have an effect on \n\ndriving and use of machines. \n\n \n\nResolor contains lactose  \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \n\nbefore taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Resolor \n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor has told you. Check \n\nwith your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Take Resolor every day for as long as your doctor \n\nprescribes it. \n\n \n\nThe doctor may want to reassess your condition and the benefit of continued treatment after the first \n\n4 weeks and thereafter at regular intervals. \n\n \n\nThe usual dose of Resolor for most patients is one 2 mg tablet once a day. \n\n \n\nIf you are older than 65 years or have severe liver disease, the starting dose is one 1 mg tablet once a \n\nday, which your doctor may increase to 2 mg once a day if needed. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may also recommend a lower dose of one 1 mg tablet daily if you have severe kidney \n\ndisease. \n\n \n\nTaking a higher dose than recommended will not make the product work better. \n\n \n\nResolor is only for adults and should not be taken by children and adolescents up to 18 years. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Resolor than you should \n\nIt is important to keep to the dose as prescribed by your doctor. If you have taken more Resolor than \n\nyou should, it is possible that you will get diarrhoea, headache and/or nausea. In case of diarrhoea, \n\nmake sure that you drink enough water. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Resolor \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. Just take your next dose at the usual time. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 33 \n\nIf you stop taking Resolor \n\nIf you stop taking Resolor, your constipation symptoms may come back again. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The side \n\neffects mostly occur at the start of treatment and usually disappear within a few days with continued \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nThe following side effects have been reported very commonly (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\nheadache, feeling sick, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. \n\n \n\nThe following side effects have been reported commonly (may affect up to 1  in 10 people): decreased \n\nappetite, dizziness, vomiting, disturbed digestion (dyspepsia), windiness, abnormal bowel sounds, \n\ntiredness. \n\n \n\nThe following uncommon side effects have also been seen (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): tremors, \n\npounding heart, rectal bleeding, increase in frequency of passing urine (pollakiuria), fever and feeling \n\nunwell. If pounding heart occurs, please tell your doctor. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V.
