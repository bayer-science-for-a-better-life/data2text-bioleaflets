This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nLokelma 5 g powder for oral suspension\nLokelma 10 g powder for oral suspension\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nLokelma 5 g powder for oral suspension\nEach sachet contains 5 g sodium zirconium cyclosilicate\n\nLokelma 10 g powder for oral suspension\nEach sachet contains 10 g sodium zirconium cyclosilicate\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for oral suspension.\n\nWhite, free flowing powder essentially free of debris and particulates.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nLokelma is indicated for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in adult patients (see section 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nAdults, including the elderly\n\nCorrection phase \nThe recommended starting dose of Lokelma is 10 g, administered three times a day orally as a \nsuspension in water. When normokalaemia is achieved, the maintenance regimen should be followed \n(see below).\n\nTypically, normokalaemia is achieved within 24 to 48 hours. If patients are still hyperkalaemic after \n48 hours of treatment, the same regimen can be continued for an additional 24 hours. If \nnormokalaemia is not achieved after 72 hours of treatment, other treatment approaches should be \nconsidered.\n\nMaintenance phase\nWhen normokalaemia has been achieved, the minimal effective dose of Lokelma to prevent recurrence \nof hyperkalaemia should be established. A starting dose of 5 g once daily is recommended, with \npossible titration up to 10 g once daily, or down to 5 g once every other day, as needed, to maintain a \nnormal potassium level. No more than 10 g once daily should be used for maintenance therapy.\n\n\n\n3\n\nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during treatment. Monitoring frequency will \ndepend upon a variety of factors including other medications, progression of chronic kidney disease \nand dietary potassium intake.\n\nIf severe hypokalaemia should occur, Lokelma should be discontinued and the patient re-evaluated.\n\nPatients on chronic haemodialysis\n\nFor patients on dialysis Lokelma should only be dosed on non-dialysis days. The recommended \n\nstarting dose is 5 g once daily. To establish normokalaemia (4.0-5.0 mmol/L), the dose may be titrated \n\nup or down weekly based on the pre-dialysis serum potassium value after the long inter-dialytic \n\ninterval (LIDI). The dose could be adjusted at intervals of one week in increments of 5 g up to 15 g \n\nonce daily on non-dialysis days. It is recommended to monitor serum potassium weekly while the dose \n\nis adjusted; once normokalaemia is established, potassium should be monitored regularly (e.g. \n\nmonthly, or more frequently based on clinical judgement including changes in dietary potassium or \n\nmedication affecting serum potassium).\n\nMissed dose\n\nIf a patient misses a dose they should be instructed to take the next usual dose at their normal time.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPatients with renal/hepatic impairment\nNo changes from the normal doses are required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Lokelma in children and adolescents (< 18 years) have not been established. \nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration \n\nFor oral use.\n\nThe entire contents of the sachet should be emptied in a drinking glass containing approximately 45 ml \nof water and stirred well. The powder will not dissolve. The tasteless liquid should be drunk while still \ncloudy. If the powder settles, the water should be stirred again. It should be ensured that all of the \ncontent is taken.\n\nThe suspension can be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nSerum potassium levels\nSerum potassium should be monitored when clinically indicated, including after changes are made to\nmedicinal products that affect the serum potassium concentration (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem (RAAS) inhibitors or diuretics) and after the Lokelma dose is titrated.\n\nHypokalaemia\nHypokalaemia may be observed (see section 4.8). Dose titration as described under maintenance \nposology may be required in such cases to prevent moderate to severe hypokalaemia. In patients with \nsevere hypokalaemia, Lokelma should be discontinued and the patient re-evaluated.\n\n\n\n4\n\nQT Prolongation\nDuring correction of hyperkalaemia, a lengthening of the QT interval can be observed as the \nphysiologic result of a decline in serum potassium concentration.\n\nThe risk of interaction with X-rays \nSodium zirconium cyclosilicate may be opaque to X-rays. If the patient is having abdominal X-rays, \nradiographers should keep this in mind.\n\nIntestinal perforation \nThe risk for intestinal perforation with the use of Lokelma is currently unknown. No events of \nintestinal perforation have been reported with Lokelma. Since intestinal perforation has been reported \nwith polymers that act in the gastrointestinal tract, specific attention should be paid to signs and \nsymptoms related to intestinal perforation.\n\nSodium content\nThis medicinal product contains approximately 400 mg sodium per 5 g dose, equivalent to 20% of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake for sodium.\nLokelma is considered high in sodium. This should be particularly taken into account for those on a \nlow salt diet. \n\nLimitations of the clinical data\n\nSevere hyperkalaemia\nThere is limited experience in patients with serum potassium concentrations greater than 6.5 mmol/L.\n\nLong-term exposure\nClinical trials with Lokelma have not included exposure longer than one year.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on sodium zirconium cyclosilicate\nAs sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is not absorbed or metabolised by the body, there are no expected \neffects of other medicinal products on the pharmacologic action of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate.\n\nEffect of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate on other medicinal products\nAs sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is not absorbed or metabolised by the body, and does not \nmeaningfully bind other medicinal products, there are limited effects on other medicinal products. \nSodium zirconium cyclosilicate can transiently increase gastric pH by absorbing hydrogen ions and \ncan lead to changes in solubility and absorption kinetics for co-administered medicinal products with \npH-dependent bioavailability. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in healthy subjects \nco-administration of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate with amlodipine, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, \nfurosemide, glipizide, warfarin, losartan or levothyroxine did not result in clinically meaningful drug-\ndrug interactions. Consistent with co-administration of dabigatran with other gastric acid modifiers,\ndabigatran Cmax and AUC values were approximately 40% lower when co-administered with sodium \nzirconium cyclosilicate. No dose adjustments or separation of time of dosing are required for any of \nthese medicinal products. However, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate should be administered at least \n2 hours before or 2 hours after oral medications with clinically meaningful gastric pH dependent \nbioavailability.\n\nExamples of medicinal products that should be administered 2 hours before or after sodium zirconium \ncyclosilicate to avoid possible raised gastric pH drug interaction are azole antifungals (ketoconazole, \nitraconazole and posaconazole), anti-HIV drugs (atazanavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, \nraltegravir, ledipasvir and rilpivirine) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, dasatinib and nilotinib).\n\nSodium zirconium cyclosilicate can be co-administered without spacing of dosing times with oral \nmedications that do not exhibit pH-dependent bioavailability. \n\n\n\n5\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data from the use of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in pregnant women. Animal studies \ndo not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Lokelma during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIn a postnatal study in rats, maternal exposure to sodium zirconium cyclosilicate had no effect on \npostnatal development. Due to its physicochemical properties, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is not \nsystemically absorbed and is not expected to be excreted in breast milk. No effects on the breastfed \nnewborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast-feeding woman to sodium \nzirconium cyclosilicate is negligible. Lokelma can be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\nThere were no adverse effects on embryo-foetal development in treated rats or in rabbits.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nLokelma has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions were hypokalaemia (4.1%) and oedema related events \n(5.7%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe safety profile of Lokelma was evaluated in clinical trials involving 1760 patients with 507 patients \nexposed for one year.\n\nThe adverse reactions identified from controlled trials are shown in Table 1. The following convention \nwas used for frequency of adverse reactions: Very common (\u2265 1/10); Common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); \nUncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); Very rare (< 1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1. List of adverse reactions in clinical studies\n\nSystem Organ class Common\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Hypokalaemia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions\n\nOedema related events\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nHypokalaemia\nIn clinical trials, 4.1% of Lokelma patients developed hypokalaemia with a serum potassium value less \nthan 3.5 mmol/L, which was resolved with dose adjustment or discontinuation of Lokelma.\n\nOedema related events\nOedema related events, including fluid overload, fluid retention, generalised oedema, hypervolaemia, \nlocalised oedema, oedema, oedema peripheral and peripheral swelling, were reported by 5.7% of \nLokelma patients. The events were observed in the maintenance phase only and were more commonly \nseen in patients treated with 15 g. Up to 53% were managed by initiating a diuretic or adjusting a \ndiuretic dose; the remainder did not require treatment.\n\n\n\n6\n\nLong term exposure \nIn 2 clinical studies with open label exposure of Lokelma up to 1 year in 874 subjects, the following \nevents were reported as related by investigators: gastrointestinal events [constipation (2.9%), \ndiarrhea (0.9%), abdominal pain/distension (0.5%), nausea (1.6%) and vomiting (0.5%)]; and \nhypersensitivity reactions [rash (0.3%) and pruritus (0.1%)]. These events were mild to moderate in \nnature, none were reported as serious and were generally resolved while the patient continued \ntreatment. Due to the open label study design, a causal relationship between these events and Lokelma \ncannot be definitively established.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nOverdose with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate could lead to hypokalaemia. Serum potassium should \nbe checked and potassium supplemented as needed.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of hyperkalaemia and hyperphosphatemia, \nATC code: V03AE10\n\nMechanism of action\nSodium zirconium cyclosilicate is a non-absorbed, non-polymer inorganic powder with a uniform \nmicropore structure that preferentially captures potassium in exchange for hydrogen and sodium \ncations. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is highly selective for potassium ions, even in the presence of \nother cations, such as calcium and magnesium, in vitro. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate captures \npotassium throughout the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract and reduces the concentration of free \npotassium in the GI lumen, thereby lowering serum potassium levels and increasing faecal potassium \nexcretion to resolve hyperkalaemia.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nSodium zirconium cyclosilicate starts reducing serum potassium concentrations as soon as 1 hour after \ningestion and normokalaemia can be achieved typically within 24 to 48 hours. Sodium zirconium \ncyclosilicate does not affect serum calcium or magnesium concentrations, or urinary sodium excretion. \nThere is a close correlation between starting serum potassium levels and effect size; patients with \nhigher starting serum potassium levels have greater reductions in serum potassium. There is a \nreduction in urinary potassium excretion which is a consequence of a reduction in serum potassium \nconcentration. In a study of healthy subjects given Lokelma 5 g or 10 g once daily for four days, dose-\ndependent reduction in serum potassium concentration and total urinary potassium excretion were \naccompanied by mean increases in faecal potassium excretion. No statistically significant changes in \nurinary sodium excretion were observed.\n\nThere were no studies conducted to investigate the pharmacodynamics when sodium zirconium \ncyclosilicate is administered with or without food. \n\nSodium zirconium cyclosilicate has also been shown to bind ammonium in vitro and in vivo, thereby \nremoving ammonium and increasing serum bicarbonate levels. Lokelma-treated patients experienced \nan increase of 1.1 mmol/L at 5 g once daily, 2.3 mmol/L at 10 g once daily and 2.6 mmol/L at 15 g \nonce daily in bicarbonate compared with a mean increase of 0.6 mmol/L for those receiving placebo. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7\n\nIn an environment where other factors affecting renin and aldosterone were not controlled, Lokelma \ndemonstrated a dose-independent change in mean serum aldosterone levels (range: -30% to -31%) \ncompared with the placebo group (+14%). No consistent effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure \nhas been observed.\n\nIn addition, mean reductions in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were observed in the 5 g (1.1 mg/dL) and \n10 g (2.0 mg/dL) three times daily groups compared with small mean increases in the placebo \n(0.8 mg/dL) and low dose sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (0.3 mg/dL) groups.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe potassium-lowering effects of Lokelma have been demonstrated in three randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with hyperkalaemia. All three studies tested the \ninitial effect of Lokelma to correct hyperkalaemia during a 48-hour period and two studies also tested \nmaintenance of normokalaemia effect obtained. The maintenance studies included patients with \nchronic kidney disease (58%), heart failure (10%), diabetes mellitus (62%) and RAAS inhibitor \ntherapy (68%). In addition, two open-label maintenance studies tested long-term safety of Lokelma. \nThese five studies included 1760 patients given doses of Lokelma; 507 exposed for at least 360 days. \nIn addition, the efficacy and safety of Lokelma was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial \nof 196 chronic haemodialysis patients with hyperkalaemia, who received doses of Lokelma for \n8 weeks. In the studies, Lokelma reduced serum potassium and maintained normal serum potassium \nlevels regardless of the underlying cause of hyperkalaemia, age, sex, race, comorbid disease or \nconcomitant use of RAAS inhibitors. No dietary restrictions were imposed; patients were instructed to \ncontinue their usual diet without any specified alterations.\n\nStudy 1\nA two-phase, placebo-controlled correction and maintenance use study\nA two-part, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 753 patients (mean age of \n66 years, range 22 to 93 years) with hyperkalaemia (5 to \u2264 6.5 mmol/L, baseline potassium average \n5.3 mmol/L), and included patients with chronic kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus and \nthose on RAAS inhibitor therapy. \nDuring the correction phase, patients were randomised to receive Lokelma (1.25 g, 2.5 g, 5 g or 10 g) \nor placebo, administered three times daily for the initial 48 hours (Table 2).\n\nTable 2.

Patients with higher starting potassium levels had a greater response to Lokelma. \nPatients with pre-treatment potassium levels in excess of 5.5 mmol/L (average baseline 5.8 mmol/L)\nsaw an average decrease of 1.1 mmol/L at 48 hours while those with starting potassium levels at or \nbelow 5.3 mmol/L had an average decrease of 0.6 mmol/L at the highest dose.\n\nPatients who became normokalaemic after receiving Lokelma during the correction phase were \nre-randomised to receive once daily placebo or once daily Lokelma at the same dose level as they had \nreceived three times daily during the correction phase (Table 3).\n\n\n\n8\n\nTable 3.

Reductions in \npotassium were observed 1 hour after the first 10 g dose of Lokelma. Median time to normokalaemia \nwas 2.2 hours with 66% of patients achieving normokalaemia at 24 hours and 88% at 48 hours. \nResponses were larger in patients with more severe hyperkalaemia; serum potassium fell 0.8, 1.2 and \n1.5 mmol/L in patients with baseline serum potassium < 5.5, 5.5-5.9 and \u2265 6 mmol/L, respectively.\n\nPatients who achieved normokalaemia (potassium levels between 3.5 and 5 mmol/L) were randomised \nin a double-blind fashion to one of three doses of Lokelma [5 g (n=45), 10 g (n=51), or 15 g (n=56)] or \nplacebo (n=85) administered once daily for 28 days (the double-blind randomised withdrawal phase).\n\nThe proportion of subjects with average serum potassium < 5.1 mmol/L from Study Day 8 to 29 \n(three-week period) was greater at the 5 g, 10 g and 15 g once daily doses of Lokelma (80%, 90% and \n94%, respectively), compared with placebo (46%). There was a mean decrease in serum potassium of \n0.77 mmol/L, 1.10 mmol/L, 1.19 mmol/L and 0.44 mmol/L, respectively, and the proportion of \nsubjects who remained normokalaemic was 71%, 76%, 85% and 48% in the 5 g, 10 g, 15 g once daily \ndoses of Lokelma and placebo groups, respectively.\n\nMaintenance phase with Lokelma titration (open-label) results: 123 patients entered the 11-month \nopen-label phase. The proportion of subjects with average serum potassium < 5.1 mmol/L was 88%, \nthe average serum potassium level was 4.66 mmol/L and the proportion of serum potassium \nmeasurements below 3.5 mmol/L was less than 1%; between 3.5 and 5.1 mmol/L was 77%; or \nbetween 3.5 and 5.5 mmol/L was 93%, irrespective of other factors that might influence the serum \npotassium. Treatment was discontinued on study exit (Day 365).\n\nKaplan-Meier estimates of time to relapse for maintenance phase showed dose dependence in time to\nrelapse with median time for 5 g dose ranging from 4 to 21 days depending on the baseline serum \npotassium values. Serum potassium should be monitored periodically and the Lokelma dose titrated as \ndescribed in section 4.2 Posology and Method of Administration.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the mean serum potassium over the correction and maintenance phases of the \nstudy.\n\n\n\n9\n\nFigure 1.

Patients were randomised to receive escalating \ndoses of Lokelma (0.3 g, 3 g and 10 g) or placebo, administered three times a day with meals for two \nto four days. The primary endpoint was the rate of change in serum potassium from baseline \nthroughout the initial 2 days of treatment. The trial met the primary efficacy endpoint at the 3 g and \n10 g doses of Lokelma compared to placebo. Lokelma at the 10 g dose and the 3 g dose resulted in \nmean maximal reductions of 0.92 mmol/L and 0.43 mmol/L, respectively. Twenty-four hour urine \ncollections showed that Lokelma decreased urinary potassium excretion from baseline by\n15.8 mmol/24 h compared to placebo increase by 8.9 mmol/24 h (p < 0.001). Sodium excretion was \nunchanged relative to placebo (10 g, increase by 25.4 mmol/24 h compared to placebo increase by \n36.9 mmol/24 h (NS)).\n\nStudy 4\nA two-phase, multicenter, multi-dose, open-label safety and efficacy study\nThe long term (up to 12 months) effects of Lokelma were assessed in this study in 751 subjects with \nhyperkalaemia (baseline average 5.59 mmol/L; range 4.3-7.6 mmol/L). Comorbid conditions included \nchronic kidney disease (65%), diabetes mellitus (64%), heart failure (15%) and hypertension (83%). \nUse of diuretics and RAAS inhibitors was reported by 51 and 70% of subjects, respectively. During \nthe correction phase, 10 g of Lokelma was administered three times daily for at least 24 hours and up \nto 72 hours. Subjects who achieved normokalaemia (3.5-5.0 mmol/L, inclusive) within 72 hours\nentered the maintenance phase of the study. All subjects in the maintenance phase received Lokelma at \na starting dose of 5 g once daily which could be increased in increments of 5 g once daily (to a \nmaximum of 15 g once daily) or decreased (to a minimum of 5 g once every other day) based upon the \ntitration regimen.\n\nM\nea\n\nn\n S\n\ner\nu\n\nm\n P\n\not\nas\n\nsi\nu\n\nm\n w\n\nit\nh\n\n 9\n5%\n\n C\nI \n\n(m\nm\n\nol\n/L\n\n)\n\nPlacebo10g*\n\n10g\n\n5g\n\n15g\n\nTitrated dose\n\nOff treatment\n\nCorrection (hour) Maintenance fixed dose (day) Maintenance titrated-dose (day)\n\nExit EOS\n\n\n\n10\n\nNormokalaemia was achieved in 494/748 (66%), 563/748 (75%) and 583/748 (78%) of subjects after \n24, 48 and 72 hours of correction phase dosing with an average reduction in serum potassium of \n0.81 mmol/L, 1.02 mmol/L and 1.10 mmol/L at 24 (n=748), 48 (n=104) and 72 (n=28) hours, \nrespectively. Normokalaemia was dependent on baseline potassium concentration, with subjects with \nthe highest baseline serum potassium concentrations having the most prominent decrease after starting \nthe study drug but with the lowest proportion of subjects achieving normokalaemia. One hundred and \ntwenty-six patients had a baseline serum potassium \u2265 6.0 mmol/L (mean baseline potassium \n6.28 mmol/L). These subjects had a mean reduction of 1.37 mmol/L at the end of the correction phase.\n\nTable 4.

At randomization, mean serum \npotassium levels were 5.8 mmol/L (range 4.2-7.3 mmol/L) in the Lokelma group and 5.9 mmol/L \n(range 4.2\u20137.3 mmol/L) in the placebo group. To achieve pre-dialysis serum potassium level between \n4.0-5.0 mmol/L during the dose adjustment period (initial 4 weeks), the dose could be adjusted weekly \nin 5 g increments up to 15 g once daily based on pre-dialysis serum potassium measurement after the \nLIDI. The dose reached at the end of the dose-adjustment period was maintained throughout the \nsubsequent 4-week evaluation period. At the end of the dose adjustment period, 37%, 43%, and 19% \nof patients were on Lokelma 5 g, 10 g and 15 g. The proportion of responders, defined as those \nsubjects who maintained a pre-dialysis serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.0 mmol/L on at least 3 out \nof 4 dialysis treatments after LIDI and who did not receive rescue therapy during the evaluation \nperiod, was 41% in the Lokelma group, and 1% in the placebo group (p < 0.001) (see Figure 3).\n\nIn post-hoc analyses the number of times patients had serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.0 mmol/L \nafter the LIDI during the evaluation period was higher in the Lokelma group. 24% of patients were \nwithin this range at all 4 visits in the Lokelma group and none in the placebo group. The post-hoc \nanalysis showed the proportion of patients who maintained serum potassium level between 3.5 and \n5.5 mmol/L on at least 3 out of 4 dialysis treatments after LIDI during the evaluation period was 70% \nin the Lokelma group and 21% in the placebo group.\n\nAt the end of treatment, the mean post-dialysis serum potassium level was 3.6 mmol/L (range \n2.6-5.7 mmol/L) in Lokelma group and 3.9 mmol/L (range 2.2-7.3 mmol/L) in the placebo group. \nThere were no differences between Lokelma and placebo groups in interdialytic weight gain (IDWG). \nIDWG was defined as pre-dialysis weight minus post-dialysis weight on the previous dialysis session \nand was measured after the LIDI.\n\n10g Titrated dose Off treatment\n\nCorrection (hour) Maintenance (day)\n\nS\ner\n\nu\nm\n\nP\not\n\nas\nsi\n\nu\nm\n\n w\nit\n\nh\n 9\n\n5%\n C\n\nI \n(m\n\nm\nol\n\n/L\n)\n\nExit   EOSCPBL MPBL\n\n\n\n12\n\nFigure 3: Mean pre-dialysis serum potassium levels over time in patients on chronic \ndialysis\n\nF/U- follow-up period\nThe displayed error bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals. \nn = Number of patients with non-missing potassium measurements at a particular visit.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nLokelma in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in male and female children from birth to \nless than 18 years of age, with hyperkalaemia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nSodium zirconium cyclosilicate is an inorganic, insoluble compound that is not subject to enzymatic \nmetabolism. In addition, clinical studies have shown it not to be systemically absorbed. An in vivo\nmass balance study in rats showed that sodium zirconium cyclosilicate was recovered in the faeces \nwith no evidence of systemic absorption. Due to these factors and its insolubility, no in vivo or in vitro\nstudies have been performed to examine its effect on cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes or \ntransporter activity.\n\nElimination\nSodium zirconium cyclosilicate is eliminated via the faeces.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development.\n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Lokelma is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Lokelma\n3. How to take Lokelma\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Lokelma\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1.  What Lokelma is and what it is used for\n\nLokelma contains the active substance sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. \n\nLokelma is used to treat hyperkalaemia in adults. Hyperkalaemia means that there is a high level of \npotassium in the blood.\n\nLokelma lowers the high levels of potassium in your body and helps to keep it at a normal level. As \nLokelma passes through your stomach and gut it attaches to potassium and the two are carried together \nout of the body in your stools, lowering the amount of potassium in the body.\n\n2.  What you need to know before you take Lokelma\n\nDo not take Lokelma\n\uf0b7 If you are allergic to the active substance.\n\nWarnings and precautions \nMonitoring\nYour doctor or nurse will check your blood potassium level when you start taking this medicine:\n\uf0b7 This is to make sure you are getting the correct dose. The dose may be raised or lowered based \n\non your blood potassium level.\n\uf0b7 Treatment may be stopped if your blood potassium level becomes too low.\n\nWhile you are taking Lokelma, tell your doctor or nurse if\n\uf0b7 you need to have an X-ray, as Lokelma may affect the interpretation of the results.\n\n\n\n27\n\n\uf0b7 you have sudden or severe pain in your abdomen as this may be a sign of a problem that is \nobserved with other medications that work in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nTalk to your pharmacist or doctor if you need Lokelma 5 g or more daily for a prolonged period, \nespecially if you have been advised to follow a low salt (sodium) diet.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This is because the \neffects of Lokelma in children and adolescents are not known.\n\nOther medicines and Lokelma\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.\n\nIn particular, tell them about any medicines which can change your blood potassium levels because \n\nyour dose of Lokelma may need to be changed. These include:\n\n\uf0b7 diuretics (medicines that increase urine production)\n\n\uf0b7 angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as enalapril, and angiotensin receptor \n\nblockers which name ends with sartan (medicines for high blood pressure and for heart \n\nproblems)\n\n\uf0b7 renin inhibitors such as aliskiren (for high blood pressure)\n\nAlso, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following: \n\uf0b7 ketoconazole, itraconazole and posaconazole (used to treat fungal infections)\n\uf0b7 atazanavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, raltegravir, ledipasvir and rilpivirine\n\n(used to treat HIV infection)\n\uf0b7 tyrosin kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, dasatinib and nilotinib (used to treat cancer)\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking this medicine.\n\nPregnancy and breast feeding\nPregnancy\nDo not use this medicine during pregnancy because there is no information on its use in pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nNo effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast-\nfeeding woman to Lokelma is negligible. Lokelma can be used during breast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nThis medicine has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive or to use machines.\n\n3.  How to take Lokelma\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.\n\nHow much to take\nStarting dose - to lower your high potassium level to normal:\n\uf0b7 The recommended dose is 10 g taken three times a day.\n\uf0b7 The medicine takes one to two days to work.\n\uf0b7 Do not take this starting dose for more than three days.\n\nMaintenance dose - to keep your potassium level within the normal range after it has been lowered:\n\uf0b7 The recommended dose is 5 g taken once a day.\n\n\n\n28\n\n\uf0b7 Your doctor may decide that you need more (10 g once a day) or less than this (5 g every other \nday).\n\n\uf0b7 Do not take a maintenance dose of more than 10 g once a day.\n\nIf you are on haemodialysis therapy: \n\uf0b7 Take Lokelma only on non-dialysis days.\n\uf0b7 The recommended starting dose is 5 g taken once a day.\n\uf0b7 Your doctor may decide that you need more (up to 15 g once a day).\n\uf0b7 Do not take more than 15 g once a day.\n\nTaking this medicine\n\uf0b7 Try to take Lokelma at the same time each day.\n\uf0b7 You can take this medicine with or without meal.\n\nHow to take\n\uf0b7 Open the sachet and pour the powder into a drinking glass with approximately 45 ml of still \n\n(non-carbonated) water.\n\uf0b7 Stir well and drink the tasteless liquid straight away.\n\uf0b7 The powder does not dissolve and the liquid appears cloudy. The white powder will settle in the \n\nglass quickly. If this happens, stir the liquid again and drink it all up.\n\uf0b7 Rinse the glass with more water and drink it all up to take all the medicine.\n\nIf you take more Lokelma than you should:\nIf you take more of this medicine than you should, talk to a doctor straight away. Do not take any \nmore until you have spoken to a doctor.\n\nIf you forget to take Lokelma \n\uf0b7 If you forget to take a dose of this medicine, skip the missed dose.\n\uf0b7 Then take the next dose as usual at your normal time.\n\uf0b7 Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you stop taking Lokelma\nDo not reduce the dose of this medicine or stop taking it without talking to the doctor who prescribed \nit. This is because you may get high potassium levels in your blood again.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4.  Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nTell your doctor or nurse if you experience any of the following:\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people).\n\uf0b7 you start to feel tired, or have muscle weakness or cramps, this may be a sign that your blood \n\npotassium has become too low. Talk to your doctor immediately if these symptoms become \nsevere.\n\n\uf0b7 you start to have a build up of fluid in the tissues, leading to swelling anywhere in your body \n(usually in the feet and ankles).\n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\uf0b7 you start to have abdominal pain or discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation.\n\uf0b7 you start to have itching of the skin or recognise redness or scaling of your skin.\n\n\n\n29\n\nReporting of side effects\n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

getting the correct dose. the dose may be raised or lowered based on your blood potassium level. treatment may be stopped if your blood potassium level becomes too low. while you are taking lokelma, tell your doctor or nurse if you need to have an x-ray, as lokelma may affect the interpretation of the results. you have sudden or severe pain in your abdomen as this may be a sign of a problem that is observed with other medications that work in the gastrointestinal tract. talk to your pharmacist or doctor if you need lokelma 5 g or more daily for a prolonged period, especially if you have been advised to follow a low salt (sodium) diet. children and adolescents do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. this is because the effects of lokelma in children and adolescents are not known. other medicines and lokelma tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. in particular, tell them about any medicines which can change your blood potassium levels because your dose of lokelma may need to be changed. these include: diuretics (medicines that increase urine production) angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors such as enalapril, and angiotensin receptor blockers which name ends with sartan (medicines for high blood pressure and for heart problems) renin inhibitors such as aliskiren (for high blood pressure) also, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following: ketoconazole, itraconazole and posaconazole (used to treat fungal infections) atazanavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, raltegravir, ledipasvir and rilpivirine (used to treat hiv infection) tyrosin kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, dasatinib and nilotinib (used to treat cancer) if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine. pregnancy and breast feeding pregnancy do not use this medicine during pregnancy because there is no information on its use in pregnancy. breast-feeding no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast- feeding woman to lokelma is negligible. lokelma can be used during breast-feeding. driving and using machines this medicine has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive or to use machines.", "Entity_Recognition":
