CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nINVEGA is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents 15 years and\nolder.\nINVEGA is indicated for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder in adults.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nSchizophrenia (adults)\nThe recommended dose of INVEGA for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults is 6 mg once daily, \nadministered in the morning. Initial dose titration is not required. Some patients may benefit from \nlower or higher doses within the recommended range of 3 mg to 12 mg once daily. Dosage \nadjustment, if indicated, should occur only after clinical reassessment. When dose increases are \nindicated, increments of 3 mg/day are recommended and generally should occur at intervals of more \nthan 5 days.\n\nSchizoaffective disorder (adults)\nThe recommended dose of INVEGA for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder in adults is 6 mg\nonce daily, administered in the morning. Initial dose titration is not required. Some patients may \nbenefit from higher doses within the recommended range of 6 mg to 12 mg once daily. Dosage \nadjustment, if indicated, should occur only after clinical reassessment. When dose increases are \n\n\n\n3\n\nindicated, increments of 3 mg/day are recommended and generally should occur at intervals of more \nthan 4 days.\n\nSwitching to other antipsychotic medicinal products\nThere are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients from INVEGA to \nother antipsychotic medicinal products. Due to different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic \nprofiles among antipsychotic medicinal products, supervision by a clinician is needed when switching \nto another antipsychotic product is considered medically appropriate.\n\nElderly\nDosing recommendations for elderly patients with normal renal function (\u2265 80 mL/min) are the same \nas for adults with normal renal function. However, because elderly patients may have diminished renal \nfunction, dose adjustments may be required according to their renal function status (see Renal \nimpairment below). INVEGA should be used with caution in elderly patients with dementia with risk \nfactors for stroke (see section 4.4). Safety and efficacy of INVEGA in patients > 65 years of age with \nschizoaffective disorder have not been studied.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. As INVEGA \nhas not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, caution is recommended in such \npatients.\n\nRenal impairment\nFor patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \u2265 50 to < 80 mL/min), the recommended \ninitial dose is 3 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 6 mg once daily based on clinical \nresponse and tolerability.\n\nFor patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \uf0b3 10 to < 50 mL/min), the \nrecommended initial dose of INVEGA is 3 mg every other day, which may be increased to 3 mg once \ndaily after clinical reassessment. As INVEGA has not been studied in patients with creatinine \nclearance below 10 mL/min, use is not recommended in such patients.\n\nPaediatric population\nSchizophrenia: The recommended starting dose of INVEGA for the treatment of schizophrenia in \nadolescents 15 years and older is 3 mg once daily, administered in the morning.\n\nAdolescents weighing < 51 kg: the maximum recommended daily dose of INVEGA is 6 mg.\n\nAdolescents weighing \u2265 51 kg: the maximum recommended daily dose of INVEGA is 12 mg.\n\nDosage adjustment, if indicated, should occur only after clinical reassessment based on the individual \nneed of the patient. When dose increases are indicated, increments of 3 mg/day are recommended and \ngenerally should occur at intervals of 5 days or more. The safety and efficacy of INVEGA in the \ntreatment of schizophrenia in adolescents between 12 and 14 years old has not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in section 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can \nbe made. There is no relevant use of INVEGA in children aged less than 12 years.\n\nSchizoaffective disorder: The safety and efficacy of INVEGA in the treatment of schizoaffective \ndisorder in patients aged 12 to 17 years has not been studied or established. There is no relevant use of \nINVEGA in children aged less than 12 years.\n\nOther special populations\nNo dose adjustment for INVEGA is recommended based on gender, race, or smoking status.\n\nMethod of administration\nINVEGA is for oral administration. It must be swallowed whole with liquid, and must not be chewed, \ndivided, or crushed. The active substance is contained within a non-absorbable shell designed to \n\n\n\n4\n\nrelease the active substance at a controlled rate. The tablet shell, along with insoluble core \ncomponents, is eliminated from the body; patients should not be concerned if they occasionally notice \nin their stool something that looks like a tablet.\n\nThe administration of INVEGA should be standardised in relation to food intake (see section 5.2). The \npatient should be instructed to always take INVEGA in the fasting state or always take it together with \nbreakfast and not to alternate between administration in the fasting state or in the fed state.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, risperidone, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPatients with schizoaffective disorder treated with paliperidone should be carefully monitored for a \npotential switch from manic to depressive symptoms.\n\nQT interval\nCaution should be exercised when INVEGA is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular \ndisease or family history of QT prolongation, and in concomitant use with other medicines thought to \nprolong the QT interval.\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), characterised by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic \ninstability, altered consciousness, and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels has been reported \nto occur with paliperidone. Additional clinical signs may include myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and \nacute renal failure. If a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS, all antipsychotics, \nincluding INVEGA, should be discontinued.\n\nTardive dyskinesia/extrapyramidal symptoms\nMedicines with dopamine receptor antagonistic properties have been associated with the induction of\ntardive dyskinesia characterised by rhythmical, involuntary movements, predominantly of the tongue \nand/or face. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear, the discontinuation of all \nantipsychotics, including INVEGA, should be considered.\n\nCaution is warranted in patients receiving both, psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) and \npaliperidone concomitantly, as extrapyramidal symptoms could emerge when adjusting one or both \nmedications. Gradual withdrawal of stimulant treatment is recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nLeucopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis\nEvents of leucopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported with antipsychotic agents, \nincluding INVEGA. Agranulocytosis has been reported very rarely (< 1/10,000 patients) during \npost-marketing surveillance. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low white blood cell \ncount (WBC) or a drug-induced leucopenia/neutropenia should be monitored during the first few \nmonths of therapy and discontinuation of INVEGA should be considered at the first sign of a clinically \nsignificant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically \nsignificant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection \nand treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute \nneutrophil count < 1 x 109/L) should discontinue INVEGA and have their WBC followed until \nrecovery.\n\nHyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus\nHyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus, and exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes have been reported \nduring treatment with paliperidone. In some cases, a prior increase in body weight has been reported \nwhich may be a predisposing factor. Association with ketoacidosis has been reported very rarely and \nrarely with diabetic coma. Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in accordance with utilised \nantipsychotic guidelines. Patients treated with any atypical antipsychotic, including INVEGA, should \n\n\n\n5\n\nbe monitored for symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and \nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose \ncontrol.\n\nWeight gain\nSignificant weight gain has been reported with INVEGA use. Weight should be monitored regularly.\n\nHyperprolactinaemia\nTissue culture studies suggest that cell growth in human breast tumours may be stimulated by \nprolactin. Although no clear association with the administration of antipsychotics has so far been \ndemonstrated in clinical and epidemiological studies, caution is recommended in patients with relevant \nmedical history. Paliperidone should be used with caution in patients with possible \nprolactin-dependent tumours.\n\nOrthostatic hypotension\nPaliperidone may induce orthostatic hypotension in some patients based on its alpha-blocking activity.\nBased on pooled data from the three, placebo-controlled, 6-week, fixed-dose trials with INVEGA (3, \n6, 9, and 12 mg), orthostatic hypotension was reported by 2.5% of subjects treated with INVEGA \ncompared with 0.8% of subjects treated with placebo. INVEGA should be used with caution in \npatients with known cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction or ischaemia, \nconduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the patient to \nhypotension (e.g., dehydration and hypovolemia).\n\nSeizures\nINVEGA should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that \npotentially lower the seizure threshold.\n\nPotential for gastrointestinal obstruction\nBecause the INVEGA tablet is non-deformable and does not appreciably change shape in the\ngastrointestinal tract, INVEGA should not ordinarily be administered to patients with preexisting \nsevere gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic) or in patients with dysphagia or significant \ndifficulty in swallowing tablets. There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with \nknown strictures in association with the ingestion of medicines in non-deformable controlled-release \nformulations. Due to the controlled-release design of the dosage form, INVEGA should only be used \nin patients who are able to swallow the tablet whole.\n\nConditions with decreased gastro-intestinal transit time\nConditions leading to shorter gastrointestinal transit time, e.g., diseases associated with chronic severe \ndiarrhoea, may result in a reduced absorption of paliperidone.\n\nRenal impairment\nThe plasma concentrations of paliperidone are increased in patients with renal impairment and, \ntherefore, dosage adjustment may be required in some patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). No data are \navailable in patients with a creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min. Paliperidone should not be used in \npatients with creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Caution is \nrecommended if paliperidone is used in such patients.\n\nElderly patients with dementia\nINVEGA has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. The experience from risperidone is \nconsidered valid also for paliperidone.\n\nOverall mortality\nIn a meta-analysis of 17 controlled clinical trials, elderly patients with dementia treated with other \natypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine had an \n\n\n\n6\n\nincreased risk of mortality compared to placebo. Among those treated with risperidone, the mortality \nwas 4% compared with 3.1% for placebo.\n\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions\nAn approximately 3-fold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse reactions have been seen in \nrandomised placebo-controlled clinical trials in the dementia population with some atypical \nantipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine. The mechanism for this increased \nrisk is not known. INVEGA should be used with caution in elderly patients with dementia who have \nrisk factors for stroke.\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies\nPhysicians should weigh the risks versus the benefits when prescribing INVEGA to patients with \nParkinson\u2019s Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) since both groups may be at increased risk \nof Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome as well as having an increased sensitivity to antipsychotics. \nManifestation of this increased sensitivity can include confusion, obtundation, postural instability with \nfrequent falls, in addition to extrapyramidal symptoms.\n\nPriapism\nAntipsychotic medicinal products (including risperidone) with \u03b1-adrenergic blocking effects have \nbeen reported to induce priapism. During post-marketing surveillance priapism has also been reported \nwith paliperidone, which is the active metabolite of risperidone. Patients should be informed to seek \nurgent medical care in case that priapism has not been resolved within 3-4 hours.\n\nBody temperature regulation\nDisruption of the body\u2019s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic \nmedicinal products. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing INVEGA to patients who will be \nexperiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., \nexercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with \nanticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration.\n\nVenous thromboembolism\nCases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products.\nSince patients treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible \nrisk factors for VTE should be identified before and during treatment with INVEGA and preventive \nmeasures undertaken.\n\nAntiemetic effect\nAn antiemetic effect was observed in preclinical studies with paliperidone. This effect, if it occurs in\nhumans, may mask the signs and symptoms of overdosage with certain medicines or of conditions \nsuch as intestinal obstruction, Reye\u2019s syndrome, and brain tumour.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe sedative effect of INVEGA should be closely monitored in this population. A change in the time \nof administration of INVEGA may improve the impact of sedation on the patient.\n\nBecause of the potential effects of prolonged hyperprolactinemia on growth and sexual maturation in \nadolescents, regular clinical evaluation of endocrinological status should be considered, including \nmeasurements of height, weight, sexual maturation, monitoring of menstrual functioning, and other \npotential prolactin-related effects.\n\nDuring treatment with INVEGA regular examination for extrapyramidal symptoms and other \nmovement disorders should also be conducted.\n\nFor specific posology recommendations in the paediatric population see section 4.2.\n\n\n\n7\n\nIntraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome\nIntraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in patients \ntreated with medicines with alpha 1a-adrenergic antagonist effect, such as INVEGA (see section 4.8).\n\nIFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. Current or past use of \nmedicines with alpha 1a-adrenergic antagonist effect should be made known to the ophthalmic \nsurgeon in advance of surgery. The potential benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocking therapy prior to \ncataract surgery has not been established and must be weighed against the risk of stopping the \nantipsychotic therapy.\n\nExcipients\nLactose content (pertains only to the 3 mg tablets)\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\n\nSodium content\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, i.e., essentially\nsodium-free.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nCaution is advised when prescribing INVEGA with medicines known to prolong the QT interval, e.g., \nclass IA antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide) and class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., \namiodarone, sotalol), some antihistaminics, some other antipsychotics and some antimalarials (e.g., \nmefloquine).\n\nPotential for INVEGA to affect other medicines\nPaliperidone is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with medicines \nthat are metabolised by cytochrome P-450 isozymes. In vitro studies indicate that paliperidone is not \nan inducer of CYP1A2 activity.\n\nGiven the primary CNS effects of paliperidone (see section 4.8), INVEGA should be used with \ncaution in combination with other centrally acting medicines, e.g., anxiolytics, most antipsychotics, \nhypnotics, opiates, etc. or alcohol.\n\nPaliperidone may antagonise the effect of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. If this combination \nis deemed necessary, particularly in end-stage Parkinson\u2019s disease, the lowest effective dose of each \ntreatment should be prescribed.\n\nBecause of its potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.4), an additive effect may \nbe observed when INVEGA is administered with other therapeutic agents that have this potential, e.g., \nother antipsychotics, tricyclics.\n\nCaution is advised if paliperidone is combined with other medicines known to lower the seizure \nthreshold (i.e., phenothiazines or butyrophenones, clozapine, tricyclics or SSRIs, tramadol, \nmefloquine, etc.).\n\nNo interaction study between INVEGA and lithium has been performed, however, a pharmacokinetic \ninteraction is unlikely to occur.\n\nCo-administration of INVEGA 12 mg once daily with divalproex sodium prolonged-release tablets \n(500 mg to 2,000 mg once daily) did not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of valproate. \nCo-administration of INVEGA with divalproex sodium prolonged-release tablets increased the \nexposure to paliperidone (see below).\n\n\n\n8\n\nPotential for other medicines to affect INVEGA\nIn vitro studies indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be minimally involved in paliperidone \nmetabolism, but there are no indications in vitro nor in vivo that these isozymes play a significant role \nin the metabolism of paliperidone. Concomitant administration of INVEGA with paroxetine, a potent \nCYP2D6 inhibitor, showed no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone. In \nvitro studies have shown that paliperidone is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate.\n\nCo-administration of INVEGA once daily with carbamazepine 200 mg twice daily caused a decrease \nof approximately 37% in the mean steady-state Cmax and AUC of paliperidone. This decrease is \ncaused, to a substantial degree, by a 35% increase in renal clearance of paliperidone likely as a result \nof induction of renal P-gp by carbamazepine. A minor decrease in the amount of active substance \nexcreted unchanged in the urine suggests that there was little effect on the CYP metabolism or \nbioavailability of paliperidone during carbamazepine co-administration. Larger decreases in plasma \nconcentrations of paliperidone could occur with higher doses of carbamazepine. On initiation of \ncarbamazepine, the dose of INVEGA should be re-evaluated and increased if necessary. Conversely, \non discontinuation of carbamazepine, the dose of INVEGA should be re-evaluated and decreased if \nnecessary. It takes 2-3 weeks for full induction to be achieved and upon discontinuation of the inducer \nthe effect wears off over a similar time period. Other medicinal products or herbals which are \ninducers, e.g., rifampicin and St John\u00b4s wort (Hypericum perforatum) may have similar effects on \npaliperidone.\n\nMedicinal products affecting gastrointestinal transit time may affect the absorption of paliperidone, \ne.g., metoclopramide.\n\nCo-administration of a single dose of INVEGA 12 mg with divalproex sodium prolonged-release \ntablets (two 500 mg tablets once daily) resulted in an increase of approximately 50% in the Cmax and \nAUC of paliperidone. Dosage reduction for INVEGA should be considered when INVEGA is \nco-administered with valproate after clinical assessment.\n\nConcomitant use of INVEGA with risperidone\nConcomitant use of INVEGA with oral risperidone is not recommended as paliperidone is the active \nmetabolite of risperidone and the combination of the two may lead to additive paliperidone exposure.\n\nConcomitant use of INVEGA with psychostimulants\nThe combined use of psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) with paliperidone can lead to \nextrapyramidal symptoms upon change of either or both treatments (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of paliperidone during pregnancy.\n\nPaliperidone was not teratogenic in animal studies, but other types of reproductive toxicity were \nobserved (see section 5.3). Neonates exposed to antipsychotics (including paliperidone) during the \nthird trimester of pregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or \nwithdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been \nreports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding \ndisorder. Consequently, newborns should be monitored carefully. INVEGA should not be used during \npregnancy unless clearly necessary. If discontinuation during pregnancy is necessary, it should not be \ndone abruptly.\n\n\n\n9\n\nBreast-feeding\nPaliperidone is excreted in the breast milk to such an extent that effects on the breast-fed infant are \nlikely if therapeutic doses are administered to breast-feeding women. INVEGA should not be used \nwhile breast feeding.\n\nFertility\nThere were no relevant effects observed in the non-clinical studies.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPaliperidone can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to \npotential nervous system and visual effects (see section 4.8). Therefore, patients should be advised not \nto drive or operate machines until their individual susceptibility to INVEGA is known.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nAdults\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) most frequently reported in clinical trials with adults were \nheadache, insomnia, sedation/somnolence, parkinsonism, akathisia, tachycardia, tremor, dystonia,\nupper respiratory tract infection, anxiety, dizziness, weight increased, nausea, agitation, constipation, \nvomiting, fatigue, depression, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, dry mouth, toothache, musculoskeletal pain, \nhypertension, asthenia, back pain, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, and cough.\n\nThe ADRs that appeared to be dose-related included headache, sedation/somnolence, parkinsonism, \nakathisia, tachycardia, dystonia, dizziness, tremor, upper respiratory tract infection, dyspepsia, and \nmusculoskeletal pain.\n\nIn the schizoaffective disorder studies, a greater proportion of subjects in the total INVEGA dose \ngroup who were receiving concomitant therapy with an antidepressant or mood stabiliser experienced \nadverse events as compared to those subjects treated with INVEGA monotherapy.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following are all the ADRs that were reported in clinical trials and post-marketing experience \nwith paliperidone by frequency category estimated from INVEGA clinical trials in adults. The \nfollowing terms and frequencies are applied: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), and not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).

paliperidone\n\nd\nIn placebo-controlled pivotal trials, diabetes mellitus was reported in 0.05% in INVEGA-treated subjects compared to a \nrate of 0% in placebo group. Overall incidence from all clinical trials was 0.14% in all INVEGA-treated subjects\n\ne\nInsomnia includes: initial insomnia, middle insomnia; Convulsion includes: grand mal convulsion; Oedema includes: \ngeneralised oedema, oedema peripheral, pitting oedema. Menstrual disorder includes: menstruation irregular, \noligomenorrhoea\n\nUndesirable effects noted with risperidone formulations\nPaliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone, therefore, the adverse reaction profiles of these \ncompounds (including both the oral and injectable formulations) are relevant to one another. In \naddition to the above adverse reactions, the following adverse reactions have been noted with the use \nof risperdone products and can be expected to occur with INVEGA.\nPsychiatric disorders: sleep-related eating disorder\nNervous system disorders: cerebrovascular disorder\nEye disorders: floppy iris syndrome (intraoperative)\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: rales\n\n\n\n12\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)\nIn schizophrenia clinical trials, there was no difference observed between placebo and the 3 and 6 mg\ndoses of INVEGA. Dose dependence for EPS was seen with the two higher doses of INVEGA (9 and \n12 mg). In the schizoaffective disorder studies, the incidence of EPS was observed at a higher rate \nthan placebo in all dose groups without a clear relationship to dose.\n\nEPS included a pooled analysis of the following terms: Parkinsonism (includes salivary \nhypersecretion, musculoskeletal stiffness, parkinsonism, drooling, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, \nhypokinesia, masked facies, muscle tightness, akinesia, nuchal rigidity, muscle rigidity, parkinsonian \ngait, and glabellar reflex abnormal, parkinsonian rest tremor), akathisia (includes akathisia, \nrestlessness, hyperkinesia, and restless leg syndrome), dyskinesia (dyskinesia, muscle twitching, \nchoreoathetosis, athetosis, and myoclonus), dystonia (includes dystonia, hypertonia, torticollis, muscle \ncontractions involuntary, muscle contracture, blepharospasm, oculogyration, tongue paralysis, facial \nspasm, laryngospasm, myotonia, opisthotonus, oropharyngeal spasm, pleurothotonus, tongue spasm, \nand trismus), and tremor. It should be noted that a broader spectrum of symptoms are included that do \nnot necessarily have an extrapyramidal origin.\n\nWeight gain\nIn schizophrenia clinical trials, the proportions of subjects meeting a weight gain criterion of \u2265 7% of \nbody weight were compared, revealing a similar incidence of weight gain for INVEGA 3 mg and 6 mg\ncompared with placebo, and a higher incidence of weight gain for INVEGA 9 mg and 12 mg\ncompared with placebo.\n\nIn schizoaffective disorder clinical trials, a higher percentage of INVEGA-treated subjects (5%) had \nan increase in body weight of \u2265 7% compared with placebo-treated subjects (1%). In the study that \nexamined two dose groups (see section 5.1), the increase in body weight of \u2265 7% was 3% in the \nlower-dose (3-6 mg) group, 7% in the higher-dose (9-12 mg) group, and 1% in the placebo group.\n\nHyperprolactinaemia\nIn schizophrenia clinical trials, increases in serum prolactin were observed with INVEGA in 67% of \nsubjects. Adverse reactions that may suggest increase in prolactin levels (e.g., amenorrhoea, \ngalactorrhoea, menstrual disturbances, gynaecomastia) were reported overall in 2% of subjects. \nMaximum mean increases of serum prolactin concentrations were generally observed on day 15 of \ntreatment, but remained above baseline levels at study endpoint.\n\nClass effects\nQT prolongation, ventricular arrythmias (ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), sudden \nunexplained death, cardiac arrest and Torsade de pointes may occur with antipsychotics. Cases of \nvenous thromboembolism, including cases of pulmonary embolism and cases of deep vein thrombosis \nhave been reported with antipsychotic drugs - Frequency unknown.\n\nPaliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone. The safety profile of risperidone may be pertinent.\n\nElderly\nIn a study conducted in elderly subjects with schizophrenia, the safety profile was similar to that seen \nin non-elderly subjects. INVEGA has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. In clinical \ntrials with some other atypical antipsychotics, increased risks of death and cerebrovascular accidents \nhave been reported (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn one short-term and two longer-term studies with paliperidone prolonged-release tablets conducted \nin adolescents 12 years and older with schizophrenia, the overall safety profile was similar to that seen \nin adults. In the pooled adolescent schizophrenia population (12 years and older, N = 545) exposed to \nINVEGA, the frequency and type of undesirable effects were similar to those in adults except for the \nfollowing ADRs that were reported more frequently in adolescents receiving INVEGA than adults \n\n\n\n13\n\nreceiving INVEGA (and more frequently than placebo): sedation/somnolence, parkinsonism, weight \nincrease, upper respiratory tract infection, akathisia, and tremor were reported very commonly (\u2265 1/10) \nin adolescents; abdominal pain, galactorrhoea, gynaecomastia, acne, dysarthria, gastroenteritis, \nepistaxis, ear infection, blood triglyceride increased, and vertigo were reported commonly (\u2265 1/100, \n< 1/10) in adolescents.\n\nExtrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)\nIn the short-term, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose adolescent study, the incidence of EPS was higher \nthan placebo for all doses of INVEGA with an increased frequency of EPS at higher doses. Across all \nadolescent studies, EPS was more common in adolescents than in adults for each INVEGA dose.\n\nWeight gain\nIn the short-term, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose adolescent study, a higher percentage of \nINVEGA-treated subjects (6-19% depending on dose) had an increase in body weight of \u2265 7% \ncompared to placebo-treated subjects (2%). There was no clear dose relationship. In the long-term \n2-year study, the subjects who were exposed to INVEGA during both the double-blind and open-label \nstudies reported a modest weight gain (4.9 kg).\n\nIn adolescents, weight gain should be assessed against that expected with normal growth.\n\nProlactin\nIn the up to 2-year, open-label treatment study of INVEGA in adolescents with schizophrenia, \nincidence of elevated serum prolactin levels occurred in 48% of females and 60% of males. Adverse \nreactions that may suggest increase in prolactin levels (e.g., amenorrhoea, galactorrhoea, menstrual \ndisturbances, gynaecomastia) were reported overall in 9.3% of subjects.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medical product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn general, expected signs and symptoms are those resulting from an exaggeration of paliperidone\u2019s \nknown pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, QT \nprolongation, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Torsade de pointes and ventricular fibrillation have been \nreported in association with overdose. In the case of acute overdosage, the possibility of multiple \nmedicinal product involvement should be considered.\n\nConsideration should be given to the prolonged-release nature of the product when assessing treatment \nneeds and recovery. There is no specific antidote to paliperidone. General supportive measures should \nbe employed. Establish and maintain a clear airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. \nCardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous \nelectrocardiographic monitoring for possible arrhythmias. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should \nbe treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluid and/or sympathomimetic agents. \nAdministration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. In case of severe \nextrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic agents should be administered. Close supervision and \nmonitoring should continue until the patient recovers.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacologic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics ATC code: N05AX13\n\nINVEGA contains a racemic mixture of (+)- and (-)-paliperidone.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14\n\nMechanism of action\nPaliperidone is a selective blocking agent of monoamine effects, whose pharmacological properties \nare different from that of traditional neuroleptics. Paliperidone binds strongly to serotonergic 5-HT2-\nand dopaminergic D2-receptors. Paliperidone also blocks alfa1-adrenergic receptors and blocks, to a \nlesser extent, H1-histaminergic and alfa2-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacological activity of the \n(+)- and (-)-paliperidone enantiomers are qualitatively and quantitatively similar.\n\nPaliperidone is not bound to cholinergic receptors. Even though paliperidone is a strong \nD2-antagonist, which is believed to relieve the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, it causes less \ncatalepsy and decreases motor functions to a lesser extent than traditional neuroleptics. Dominating \ncentral serotonin antagonism may reduce the tendency of paliperidone to cause extrapyramidal side \neffects.\n\nClinical efficacy\nSchizophrenia\nThe efficacy of INVEGA in the treatment of schizophrenia was established in three multi-centre, \nplacebo-controlled, double-blind, 6-week trials in subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for \nschizophrenia. INVEGA doses, which varied across the three studies, ranged from 3 to 15 mg once \ndaily. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as a decrease in total Positive and Negative \nSyndrome Scale (PANSS) scores as shown in the following table. The PANSS is a validated \nmulti-item inventory composed of five factors to evaluate positive symptoms, negative symptoms, \ndisorganised thoughts, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression. All tested doses of \nINVEGA separated from placebo on day 4 (p < 0.05). Predefined secondary endpoints included the \nPersonal and Social Performance (PSP) scale and the Clinical Global Impression \u2013 Severity (CGI-S) \nscale. In all three studies, INVEGA was superior to placebo on PSP and CGI-S. Efficacy was also \nevaluated by calculation of treatment response (defined as decrease in PANSS Total Score \u2265 30%) as a \nsecondary endpoint.\n\nSchizophrenia Studies: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Total Score - Change \nFrom Baseline to End Point - LOCF for Studies R076477-SCH-303, R076477-SCH-304, and \nR076477-SCH-305: Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set\n\nPlacebo INVEGA\n3 mg\n\nINVEGA\n6 mg\n\nINVEGA\n9 mg\n\nINVEGA\n12 mg\n\nR076477-SCH-303\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs, Placebo)\nDiff. of LS Means (SE)\n\n(N = 126)\n94.1 (10.74)\n-4.1 (23.16)\n\n(N = 123)\n94.3 (10.48)\n-17.9 (22.23)\n\n<0.001\n-13.7 (2.63)\n\n(N = 122)\n93.2 (11.90)\n-17.2 (20.23)\n\n<0.001\n-13.5 (2.63)\n\n(N = 129)\n94.6 (10.98)\n-23.3 (20.12)\n\n<0.001\n-18.9 (2.60)\n\nR076477-SCH-304\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs, Placebo)\nDiff. of LS Means (SE)\n\n(N = 105)\n93.6 (11.71)\n-8.0 (21.48)\n\n(N = 111)\n92.3 (11.96)\n-15.7 (18.89)\n\n0.006\n-7.0 (2.36)\n\n(N = 111)\n94.1 (11.42)\n-17.5 (19.83)\n\n<0.001\n-8.5 (2.35)\n\nR076477-SCH-305\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs, Placebo)\nDiff. of LS Means (SE)\n\n(N = 120)\n93.9 (12.66)\n-2.8 (20.89)\n\n(N = 123)\n91.6 (12.19)\n-15.0 (19.61)\n\n<0.001\n-11.6 (2.35)\n\n(N = 123)\n93.9 (13.20)\n-16.3 (21.81)\n\n<0.001\n-12.9 (2.34)\n\nNote: Negative change in score indicates improvement.

After \nhaving been treated for an acute episode for 6 weeks and stabilised for an additional 8 weeks with \nINVEGA (doses ranging from 3 to 15 mg once daily) patients were then randomised in a double-blind \nmanner to either continue on INVEGA or on placebo until they experienced a relapse in schizophrenia \nsymptoms. The trial was stopped early for efficacy reasons by showing a significantly longer time to \nrelapse in patients treated with INVEGA compared to placebo (p=0.0053).\n\nSchizoaffective disorder\nThe efficacy of INVEGA in the acute treatment of psychotic or manic symptoms of schizoaffective \ndisorder was established in two placebo-controlled, 6-week trials in non-elderly adult subjects. \nEnrolled subjects 1) met DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder, as confirmed by the Structured \nClinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders, 2) had a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) \ntotal score of at least 60, and 3) had prominent mood symptoms as confirmed by a score of at least 16 \non the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and/or Hamilton Rating Scale 21 for Depression (HAM-D\n21). The population included subjects with schizoaffective bipolar and depressive types. In one of \nthese trials, efficacy was assessed in 211 subjects who received flexible doses of INVEGA (3-12 mg\nonce daily). In the other study, efficacy was assessed in 203 subjects who were assigned to one of two \ndose levels of INVEGA: 6 mg with the option to reduce to 3 mg (n = 105) or 12 mg with the option to \nreduce to 9 mg (n = 98) once daily. Both studies included subjects who received INVEGA either as \nmonotherapy or in combination with mood stabilisers and/or antidepressants. Dosing was in the \nmorning without regard to meals. Efficacy was evaluated using the PANSS.\n\nThe INVEGA group in the flexible-dose study (dosed between 3 and 12 mg/day, mean modal dose of \n8.6 mg/day) and the higher dose group of INVEGA in the 2 dose-level study (12 mg/day with option \nto reduce to 9 mg/day) were each superior to placebo in the PANSS at 6 weeks. In the lower dose \ngroup of the 2 dose-level study (6 mg/day with option to reduce to 3 mg/day), INVEGA was not \nsignificantly different from placebo as measured by the PANSS. Only few subjects received the 3 mg\ndose in both studies and efficacy of this dose could not be established. Statistically superior \nimprovements in manic symptoms as measured by YMRS (secondary efficacy scale) were observed in \npatients from the flexible-dose study and the INVEGA higher dose in the second study.\n\nTaking the results of both studies together (pooled study-data), INVEGA improved the psychotic and \nmanic symptoms of schizoaffective disorder at endpoint relative to placebo when administered either \nas monotherapy or in combination with mood stabilisers and/or antidepressants. However, overall the \nmagnitude of effect in regard to PANSS and YMRS observed on monotherapy was larger than that \nobserved with concomitant antidepressants and/or mood stabilisers. Moreover, in the pooled \npopulation, INVEGA was not efficacious in patients concomitantly receiving mood stabiliser and \nantidepressants in regard to the psychotic symptoms, but this population was small (30 responders in \n\n\n\n16\n\nthe paliperidone group and 20 responders in the placebo group). Additionally, in study SCA-3001 in \nthe ITT population the effect on psychotic symptoms measured by PANSS was clearly less \npronounced and not reaching statistical significance for patients receiving concomitantly mood \nstabilisers and/or antidepressants. An effect of INVEGA on depressive symptoms was not \ndemonstrated in these studies, but has been demonstrated in a long-term study with the long-acting \ninjectable formulation of paliperidone (described further down in this section).\n\nAn examination of population subgroups did not reveal any evidence of differential responsiveness on \nthe basis of gender, age, or geographic region. There were insufficient data to explore differential \neffects based on race. Efficacy was also evaluated by calculation of treatment response (defined as \ndecrease in PANSS Total Score \u2265 30% and CGI-C Score \u2264 2) as a secondary endpoint.\n\nSchizoaffective Disorder Studies: Primary Efficacy Parameter, PANSS Total Score Change from Baseline from \nStudies R076477-SCA-3001 and R076477-SCA-3002: Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set\n\nPlacebo INVEGA \nLower Dose\n\n(3-6 mg)\n\nINVEGA Higher \nDose\n\n(9-12 mg)\n\nINVEGA Flexible \nDose (3-12 mg)\n\nR076477-SCA-3001\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\nDiff. of LS Means (SE)\n\n(N=107)\n91.6 (12.5)\n-21.7 (21.4)\n\n(N=105)\n95.9 (13.0)\n-27.4 (22.1)\n\n0.187\n-3.6 (2.7)\n\n(N=98)\n92.7 (12.6)\n-30.6 (19.1)\n\n0.003\n-8.3 (2.8)\n\nR076477-SCA-3002\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\nDiff. of LS Means (SE)\n\n(N=93)\n91.7 (12.1)\n-10.8 (18.7)\n\n(N=211)\n92.3 (13.5)\n\n-20.0 (20.23)\n< 0.001\n\n-13.5 (2.63)\nNote: Negative change in score indicates improvement.

LOCF = last observation carried forward.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of paliperidone following INVEGA administration are dose proportional within \nthe available dose range.\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing a single dose, INVEGA exhibits a gradual ascending release rate, allowing the plasma \nconcentrations of paliperidone to steadily rise to reach peak plasma concentration (Cmax) \napproximately 24 hours after dosing. With once-daily dosing of INVEGA, steady-state concentrations \nof paliperidone are attained within 4-5 days of dosing in most subjects.\n\nPaliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone. The release characteristics of INVEGA result in \nminimal peak-trough fluctuations as compared to those observed with immediate-release risperidone \n(fluctuation index 38% versus 125%).\n\nThe absolute oral bioavailability of paliperidone following INVEGA administration is 28% (90% CI \nof 23%-33%).\n\nAdministration of paliperidone prolonged-release tablets with a standard high-fat/high-caloric meal\nincreases Cmax and AUC of paliperidone by up to 50-60% compared with administration in the fasting \nstate.\n\nDistribution\nPaliperidone is rapidly distributed. The apparent volume of distribution is 487 L. The plasma protein \nbinding of paliperidone is 74%. It binds primarily to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein and albumin.\n\nBiotransformation and elimination\nOne week following administration of a single oral dose of 1 mg immediate-release 14C-paliperidone,\n59% of the dose was excreted unchanged into urine, indicating that paliperidone is not extensively\nmetabolised by the liver. Approximately 80% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine \nand 11% in the faeces. Four metabolic pathways have been identified in vivo, none of which accounted \nfor more than 6.5% of the dose: dealkylation, hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, and benzisoxazole \nscission. Although in vitro studies suggested a role for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the metabolism of \npaliperidone, there is no evidence in vivo that these isozymes play a significant role in the metabolism \nof paliperidone. Population pharmacokinetics analyses indicated no discernible difference on the \napparent clearance of paliperidone after administration of INVEGA between extensive metabolisers \nand poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 substrates. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that \npaliperidone does not substantially inhibit the metabolism of medicines metabolised by cytochrome \nP450 isozymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and \nCYP3A5. The terminal elimination half-life of paliperidone is about 23 hours.\n\nIn vitro studies have shown that paliperidone is a P-gp substrate and a weak inhibitor of P-gp at high \nconcentrations. No in vivo data are available and the clinical relevance is unknown.\n\n\n\n19\n\nHepatic impairment\nPaliperidone is not extensively metabolised in the liver. In a study in subjects with moderate hepatic\nimpairment (Child-Pugh class B), the plasma concentrations of free paliperidone were similar to those \nof healthy subjects. No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nclass C).\n\nRenal impairment\nElimination of paliperidone decreased with decreasing renal function. Total clearance of paliperidone \nwas reduced in subjects with impaired renal function by 32% in mild (Creatinine Clearance \n[CrCl] = 50 to < 80 mL/min), 64% in moderate (CrCl = 30 to < 50 mL/min), and 71% in severe \n(CrCl = < 30 mL/min) renal impairment. The mean terminal elimination half-life of paliperidone was \n24, 40, and 51 hours in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, \ncompared with 23 hours in subjects with normal renal function (CrCl \u2265 80 mL/min).\n\nElderly\nData from a pharmacokinetic study in elderly subjects (\u2265 65 years of age, n = 26) indicated that the \napparent steady-state clearance of paliperidone following INVEGA administration was 20% lower \ncompared to that of adult subjects (18-45 years of age, n = 28). However, there was no discernable \neffect of age in the population pharmacokinetic analysis involving schizophrenia subjects after \ncorrection of age-related decreases in CrCl.\n\nAdolescents\nPaliperidone systemic exposure in adolescent subjects (15 years and older) was comparable to that in\nadults. In adolescents weighing < 51 kg, a 23% higher exposure was observed than in adolescents\nweighing \u2265 51 kg. Age alone did not influence the paliperidone exposure.\n\nRace\nPopulation pharmacokinetics analysis revealed no evidence of race-related differences in the \npharmacokinetics of paliperidone following INVEGA administration.\n\nGender\nThe apparent clearance of paliperidone following INVEGA administration is approximately 19% \nlower in women than men. This difference is largely explained by differences in lean body mass and \ncreatinine clearance between men and women.\n\nSmoking status\nBased on in vitro studies utilising human liver enzymes, paliperidone is not a substrate for CYP1A2; \nsmoking should, therefore, not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone. A population \npharmacokinetic analysis showed a slightly lower exposure to paliperidone in smokers compared with \nnon-smokers. The difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance, though.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRepeat-dose toxicity studies of paliperidone in rat and dog showed mainly pharmacological effects, \nsuch as sedation and prolactin-mediated effects on mammary glands and genitals. Paliperidone was \nnot teratogenic in rat and rabbit. In rat reproduction studies using risperidone, which is extensively \nconverted to paliperidone in rats and humans, a reduction was observed in the birth weight and \nsurvival of the offspring. Other dopamine antagonists, when administered to pregnant animals, have \ncaused negative effects on learning and motor development in the offspring. Paliperidone was not \ngenotoxic in a battery of tests. In oral carcinogenicity studies of risperidone in rats and mice, increases \nin pituitary gland adenomas (mouse), endocrine pancreas adenomas (rat), and mammary gland \nadenomas (both species) were seen. These tumours can be related to prolonged dopamine D2 \nantagonism and hyperprolactinemia. The relevance of these tumour findings in rodents in terms of \nhuman risk is unknown.\n\nIn a 7-week juvenile toxicity study in rats administered oral doses of paliperidone up to 2.5 mg/kg/day, \ncorresponding to an exposure approximately equal to the clinical exposure based on AUC, no effects \n\n\n\n20\n\non growth, sexual maturation and reproductive performance were observed. Paliperidone did not \nimpair the neurobehavioural development in males at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day. At 2.5 mg/kg/day in \nfemales, an effect on learning and memory was observed. This effect was not observed after \ndiscontinuation of treatment. In a 40-week juvenile toxicity study in dogs with oral doses of\nrisperidone (which is extensively converted to paliperidone) up to 5 mg/kg/day, effects on sexual \nmaturation, long bone growth and femur mineral density were observed from 3 times the clinical \nexposure based on AUC.\n\n6.
