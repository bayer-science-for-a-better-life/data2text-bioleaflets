This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nMvabea suspension for injection\nEbola vaccine (MVA-BN-Filo [recombinant])\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nOne dose (0.5 mL) contains:\nModified Vaccinia Ankara Bavarian Nordic Virus* encoding the:\nZaire ebolavirus (EBOV) Mayinga variant glycoprotein (GP)\nSudan ebolavirus Gulu variant GP\nTaï Forest ebolavirus nucleoprotein\nMarburg marburgvirus Musoke variant GP\n\nNot less than 0.7 x 108 infectious units (Inf.U)\n* Produced in chicken embryo fibroblast cells and by recombinant DNA technology.\n\nThis product contains genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\n\nThis vaccine contains trace residues of gentamicin (see section 4.3).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSuspension for injection\n\nLight yellow, clear to milky suspension.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nMvabea, as part of the Zabdeno, Mvabea vaccine regimen, is indicated for active immunisation for \nprevention of disease caused by Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus species) in individuals ≥1 year of age\n(see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nThe use of the vaccine regimen should be in accordance with official recommendations.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nMvabea should be administered by a trained healthcare worker.\n\nMvabea is the second vaccination in the prophylactic 2-dose heterologous Ebola vaccine regimen \nwhich consists of vaccination with Zabdeno followed by a second vaccination with Mvabea given \napproximately 8 weeks later (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) (refer to the SmPC for Zabdeno).\n\n\n\n3\n\nPosology\n\nPrimary vaccination\nA dose (0.5 mL) of Zabdeno (red cap vial) vaccine should be administered as the first vaccination\n(refer to the SmPC for Zabdeno).\n\nA dose (0.5 mL) of Mvabea (yellow cap vial) vaccine should be administered as the second \nvaccination approximately 8 weeks after the first vaccination with Zabdeno.\n\nBooster vaccination with Zabdeno (individuals who previously received the Zabdeno, Mvabea \n2-dose primary vaccination regimen)\nIndividuals who have previously completed the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen can receive a \nbooster dose of Zabdeno. As a precautionary measure, a Zabdeno booster vaccination is recommended \nin individuals who are at imminent risk of exposure to Ebola virus and have completed the 2-dose \nprimary vaccination regimen more than 4 months ago (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nCorrective measures in case of inadvertent administration\nIf Mvabea is inadvertently administered as the first vaccination, administration of Zabdeno is \nrecommended as the second vaccination approximately 8 weeks later.\n\nIf Zabdeno is inadvertently administered as the first and the second vaccination, additional \nimmunisation with Mvabea is recommended approximately 8 weeks after the second vaccination with\nZabdeno.\n\nIf Mvabea is inadvertently administered as the first and the second vaccination, additional \nimmunisation with Zabdeno is recommended approximately 8 weeks after the second vaccination with \nMvabea.\n\nIf the second vaccination (Mvabea) of the regimen has been delayed beyond the recommended \n8 weeks after the first vaccination (Zabdeno) of the regimen, the Mvabea vaccine should be \nadministered regardless of the elapsed time from the first vaccination with Zabdeno (see section 5.1).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe posology in children aged 1 to <18 years is the same as in adults. No data are available on the\nsafety and efficacy of the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen and the booster vaccination in children \naged <1 year.\n\nElderly population\nNo dosage adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥65 years of age.\n\nHIV-infected individuals\nNo dosage adjustment is required in HIV-infected individuals with infection controlled through \nantiretroviral therapy (see section 5.1).\n\n\n\n4\n\nMethod of administration\n\nMvabea should be administered by the intramuscular (IM) route. The preferred site is the deltoid \nmuscle of the upper arm. In younger children, either the deltoid region of the arm or anterolateral \naspect of the thigh are acceptable sites for intramuscular injection.\n\nDo not administer this vaccine intravenously or subcutaneously.\n\nThe vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.\n\nFor precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.\n\nFor precautions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of its excipients listed in section 6.1, or trace \nresidues (chicken or egg protein and gentamicin).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nHypersensitivity\n\nClose observation is recommended following vaccination for the early signs of anaphylaxis or \nanaphylactoid reactions. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and \nsupervision should always be readily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the \nadministration of the vaccine. Individuals should be observed by a healthcare professional for at least \n15 minutes after vaccination.\n\nAnxiety-related reactions\n\nAnxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related \nreactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. \nIt is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.\n\nThrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders\n\nThe vaccine should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation \ndisorder because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these \nindividuals.\n\nConcurrent illness\n\nVaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness or acute \ninfection, unless the benefit of immediate vaccination outweighs the potential risks. The presence of a \nminor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.\n\nImmunocompromised individuals\n\nSafety and immunogenicity of the Zabdeno, Mvabea vaccine regimen has not been assessed in \nimmunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy. \n\n\n\n5\n\nImmunocompromised individuals may not respond as well as immunocompetent individuals to the \nZabdeno, Mvabea vaccine regimen.\n\nLevel of protection\n\nThe exact level of protection afforded by the vaccine regimen is unknown.\n\nIn the absence of field efficacy data, the protective effect of the vaccine regimen in humans was \ninferred by the bridging of immunogenicity in humans to immunogenicity and efficacy data obtained \nin non-human primates (immunobridging) (see section 5.1).\n\nIf only one of the vaccines, Zabdeno or Mvabea, is received, the efficacy is expected to be reduced as \ncompared to the 2-dose vaccine regimen.\n\nThe vaccine regimen might not protect all individuals against Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus species) \ndisease, and does not replace precautions to avoid exposure to Ebola virus. Vaccinated individuals \nshould adhere to local guidelines and recommendations to prevent or treat exposure to Ebola virus.\n\nThe Zabdeno, Mvabea vaccine regimen should not be initiated for post-exposure prophylaxis against \nEbola virus.\n\nDuration of protection\n\nThe duration of protection is unknown. A booster dose of Zabdeno administered at various intervals \nafter completion of a primary series with Zabdeno and Mvabea has been shown to elicit an anamnestic \nresponse (see section 5.1). As a precautionary measure, a Zabdeno booster vaccination should be \nconsidered for individuals at imminent risk of exposure to Ebola virus, for example healthcare \nprofessionals and those living in or visiting areas with an ongoing Ebola virus disease outbreak, who \ncompleted the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen more than 4 months ago (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nProtection against Filovirus disease\n\nThe vaccine regimen is not intended to prevent diseases caused by Filoviruses other than Zaire \nebolavirus species.\n\nSodium\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and is considered to be \nessentially sodium-free.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of co-administration of Mvabea with other vaccines have not \nbeen evaluated, and therefore, co-administration is not recommended.\n\nIf Mvabea must be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine(s), then the vaccine(s) should \nalways be administered at different injection sites. Do not mix Mvabea with any other vaccine in the \nsame syringe or vial.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data from the use of Mvabea in pregnant women.\n\n\n\n6\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity.\nZabdeno and Mvabea vaccine regimens elicited detectable Ebola virus (EBOV) GP-specific maternal \nantibody titres that were transferred to the foetuses (see section 5.3).\n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid vaccination with Mvabea during pregnancy.\nNevertheless, considering the severity of Ebola virus disease, vaccination should not be withheld when \nthere is a clear risk of exposure to Ebola infection.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether Mvabea is excreted in human milk.\nA risk to the newborns/infants from breast-feeding by vaccinated mothers cannot be excluded.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid vaccination with Mvabea during breast-feeding.\nNevertheless, considering the severity of Ebola virus disease, vaccination should not be withheld when \nthere is a clear risk of exposure to Ebola infection.\n\nFertility\n\nNo data are available on fertility in humans. A reproductive toxicity study in animals with Zabdeno\nand Mvabea vaccine regimens did not reveal any evidence of impaired female fertility. General \ntoxicity studies have not revealed any effects on male sex organs that would impair male fertility (see \nsection 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nMvabea has no known effect on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most common local adverse reactions reported in adults who received Mvabea were pain (45%), \nwarmth (20%) and swelling (10%) at the injection site. The most common systemic adverse reactions \nwere fatigue (30%), myalgia (26%) and arthralgia (16%). Most adverse reactions occurred within \n7 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (2-3 days).\n\nThe most common local adverse reaction reported in children 1 to 17 years of age who received \nMvabea was pain (21%) at the injection site. The most common systemic adverse reaction was fatigue\n(11%). Most adverse reactions occurred within 7 days following vaccination. Most adverse reactions \nwere mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (1-3 days).\n\nPyrexia was reported more frequently for younger children 1 to 3 years of age (8%) and 4 to 11 years \nof age (4%) compared to adolescents 12 to 17 years of age (2%) and adults (4%). The frequency of \npyrexia in younger children was less than that observed in the placebo control group.\n\nThe safety profile of Mvabea in children 1 to 17 years of age was generally similar to that observed in \nadults.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below by the following frequency \ncategories:\nvery common (≥1/10);\ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10);\nuncommon (≥1/1000 to <1/100);\nrare (≥1/10000 to <1/1000).\n\n\n\n7\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nAdults\nTable 1 shows the adverse reactions reported from clinical trials in adults.\n\nTable 1: Adverse Reactions Reported in Adults Following Vaccination with Mvabea\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions\nGastrointestinal disorders common vomiting\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders\n\nvery common myalgia, arthralgia\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders uncommon pruritus\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions\n\nvery common fatigue, injection site pain, \ninjection site swelling, injection \nsite warmth\n\ncommon injection site pruritus\nuncommon injection site induration, injection \n\nsite erythema\n\nChildren 1 to 17 years of age\nTable 2 shows the adverse reactions reported from clinical trials in children 1 to 17 years of age.\n\nTable 2: Adverse Reactions Reported in Children 1 to 17 Years of Age Following \nVaccination with Mvabea\n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders\n\ncommon myalgia, arthralgia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions\n\nvery common fatigue, injection site pain\ncommon pyrexia, chills, injection site \n\npruritus, injection site swelling, \ninjection site erythema\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo case of overdose has been reported.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccine, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX02\n\nMechanism of action\n\nMvabea is a recombinant, non-replicating in human cells, Modified Vaccinia Ankara - Bavarian \nNordic (MVA-BN) vectored multivalent Filovirus vaccine that encodes the Zaire ebolavirus Mayinga \nvariant GP, Sudan ebolavirus Gulu variant GP, Taï Forest ebolavirus nucleoprotein, Marburg \nmarburgvirus Musoke variant GP. The EBOV GP encoded by Zabdeno has 100% homology to the \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8\n\none encoded by Mvabea. Following administration, the EBOV GP is expressed locally and stimulates \nan immune response.\n\nEfficacy\n\nIn the absence of efficacy data from clinical studies, the efficacy of the 2-dose primary vaccination\nregimen has been assessed through challenge studies in non-human primates (NHP, Cynomolgus \nmacaques, Macaca fascicularis), the most relevant animal model for EBOV disease. The 2-dose \nprimary vaccination regimen administered at an interval of 8 weeks was protective down to a first dose \nof 2 x 109 virus particle (VP) of Zabdeno, in combination with 1 x 108 Inf.U of Mvabea, in a lethal \nintramuscular EBOV Kikwit NHP challenge model. Humoral immune responses, as measured by the \nlevel of EBOV GP-binding antibodies, were strongly correlated to survival in NHP. Protective effect \nin humans has been inferred through comparison of EBOV GP-binding antibody concentrations\n(immunobridging).\n\nClinical immunogenicity\n\nIn the absence of efficacy data from clinical studies, the protective effect of the vaccine has been \ninferred from immunogenicity data. Data from 5 clinical studies conducted in Europe, the United \nStates, and Africa in 764 adults 18 to 50 years of age who had received the 2-dose primary vaccination\nregimen at the 8-week interval were used in this analysis. Anti-EBOV GP binding antibodies were \ncorrelated with a protective effect against a rapidly progressing fully lethal Ebola virus infection in \nnon-human primates. The human immune responses measured 21 days post-dose 2 were associated \nwith an increase of the predicted survival probability from 0% (i.e., fully lethal) to 53.4% (98.68%CI: \n33.8%; 70.9%) using the animal model. Based on this analysis, the Zabdeno, Mvabea vaccine regimen \ncan be anticipated to have a protective effect against EBOV disease in humans. Although the \nrelationship between antibody titre and survival has been studied only in adult NHP, immunobridging \nperformed on paediatric subjects, the elderly and HIV-infected subjects suggests that the potential \nprotective effects for these populations are consistent with the one estimated in adults.\n\nImmunogenicity\nImmunogenicity data are presented for a total of 842 adults and 509 children (1 to 17 years of age)\nwho had received the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen in Phase II and III clinical studies: study \nEBL2001 in the UK and France, studies EBL3002 and EBL3003 in the United States, study EBL2002 \nin Uganda, Kenya, Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire, and study EBL3001 in Sierra Leone. The \nconcentrations of EBOV GP-specific binding antibodies were measured approximately 3 weeks after \ncompletion of the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen. These are presented as geometric mean \nconcentrations (GMC).\n\nImmunogenicity data in adults after the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen\nThe immune response to the 2-dose primary vaccination regimen given in an 8-week interval was \nassessed in 5 Phase II and III studies conducted in Europe, Africa and the USA (see Table 3). In all \nstudies, 98% to 100% of study participants mounted a binding antibody response to EBOV GP, \ndefined as more than 2.5-fold increase in binding antibody concentration over baseline value.\n\nTable 3: EBOV GP-specific Binding Antibody Responses to the Zabdeno, Mvabea 2-dose Vaccine \nRegimen in Adults (8 week interval): GMC EU/mL (95% CI)\n\nStudy Baseline\n21 days \n\npost-dose 2 \n6 months \n\npost-dose 2\n10 months \npost-dose 2\n\nEBL2001 (N=70)\n<LLOQ\n\n(<LLOQ; <LLOQ)\n\n(N=69)\n10131\n\n(8554; 11999)\n-\n\n(N=50)\n1205\n\n(971; 1497)\nEBL2002 (N=134)\n\n39\n(<LLOQ; 48)\n\n(N=136)\n7518\n\n(6468; 8740)\n-\n\n(N=133)\n342\n\n(291; 401)\nEBL3001 (N=231)\n\n68\n(56; 81)\n\n(N=224)\n3976\n\n(3517; 4495)\n-\n\n(N=199)\n268\n\n(234; 307)\n\n\n\n9\n\nEBL3002 (N=140)\n<LLOQ\n\n(<LLOQ; <LLOQ)\n\n(N=135)\n11054\n\n(9673; 12633)\n\n(N=131)\n1263\n\n(1100; 1450)\n-\n\nEBL3003 (N=258)\n<LLOQ\n\n(<LLOQ; <LLOQ)\n\n(N=254)\n11052\n\n(9959; 12265)\n\n(N=244)\n1151\n\n(1024; 1294)\n-\n\nData shown for vaccinated participants who received the 2-dose vaccine regimen in the Per Protocol Analysis Set.\nEU = ELISA Units\nCI = Confidence interval\nN = Number of participants with data\nLLOQ = Lower limit of quantification\n\nThe interval between doses in these studies was 8 weeks +/- 3 days.

As illustrated by the data on 43 adults in study \nEBL3001, the response remains stable also at two years post-dose 1 (latest time point available) (“B” \nin figure 1 below). After administration of a booster dose of Zabdeno, a rapid anamnestic response is \nobserved within 7 days. The highest binding antibody concentrations are observed 21 days \npost-booster dose (“C” in figure 1 below), followed by a decline in antibody concentrations. At 1 year \npost-booster dose, GMCs were higher than before administration of the booster dose (“D” in figure 1 \nbelow).\n\nFigure 1.

This means that for scientific \nreasons it has been impossible to get complete information on this vaccine. The European Medicines \nAgency will review any new information which may become available every year and this SmPC will \nbe updated as necessary.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on repeated dose toxicity and local \ntolerance studies, and a reproductive toxicity study in rabbits.\n\nGeneral (repeated dose) toxicity studies, including local tolerance\n\nVaccination of rabbits with various Zabdeno and Mvabea vaccine regimens was well tolerated when \nadministered intramuscularly at full human dose levels. The vaccine-related findings (reflected by \ninflammatory changes at the injection site, increases in fibrinogen, C-reactive protein and globulin,\nand microscopic findings of increased lymphoid cellularity and/or germinal centres in the draining \nlymph nodes and spleen) were noted to be recovering 2 weeks after the last vaccination, and reflect a \nnormal, physiological response associated with vaccination. There were no effects noted that were \nconsidered to be adverse.\n\nFertility/Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity\n\nBiodistribution studies conducted in the rabbit did not show distribution of the MVA-BN vector to the \ngonads (testes, ovaries) following IM injection.\n\nThe general (repeated dose) toxicity studies with Zabdeno and Mvabea vaccine regimens have not \nrevealed any effects on male sex organs that would impair male fertility. In addition, the general \nand/or reproductive toxicity studies did not reveal any evidence of impaired female fertility. In a \nreproductive toxicity study, Zabdeno and Mvabea vaccine regimens did not induce maternal or \ndevelopmental toxicity following maternal exposure during the premating and gestation period. In this \nstudy, the vaccine regimens elicited detectable EBOV GP-specific maternal antibody titres that were \ntransferred to the foetuses.\n\n6.

What Mvabea is and what it is used for\n\nWhat is Mvabea\nMvabea is a vaccine used to protect against Ebola virus disease in the future.\nIt is given to people aged 1 year and older who may possibly come into contact with Ebola virus.\n\nMvabea is given as the second dose of a 2-dose course of vaccinations to protect you from getting \nEbola virus disease caused by the Zaire ebolavirus, which is a type of Filovirus. This vaccine will not \nprotect you against the other types of Filovirus. \n\nBecause Mvabea does not contain the whole Ebola virus, it cannot give you Ebola virus disease.\n\nThe 2-dose course of vaccinations consists of:\n a first dose of Zabdeno vaccine,\n followed around 8 weeks later by a dose with Mvabea vaccine.\n\nEven after you have had the course of Zabdeno and Mvabea vaccination you should be very careful\nnot to come into contact with Ebola virus. As with all vaccinations, the vaccination course may not \nfully protect everyone from Ebola virus disease.\n\nThe Zabdeno and Mvabea 2-dose course of vaccinations should be used according to official \nrecommendations.\n\nWhat is Ebola\n Ebola is a serious disease caused by a virus. People catch Ebola from people or animals who are \n\ninfected with Ebola virus or who died from Ebola.\n You can catch Ebola from blood and body fluids like urine, stools, saliva, vomit, sweat, breast \n\nmilk, semen and vaginal fluids of people who are infected with Ebola virus.\n You can also catch Ebola from things that have touched the blood or body fluids of a person or \n\nanimal with Ebola (like clothes or objects in direct contact).\n\n\n\n25\n\n Ebola is not spread through the air, water or food.\n\nEbola virus disease usually causes a high fever – and it can stop the blood from clotting, causing \nsevere bleeding (‘severe haemorrhagic fever’). This can lead to serious illness, and in some cases \ndeath.\n First signs and symptoms may be fever, feeling tired, weak or dizzy, and muscle aches.\n Later signs and symptoms may include bleeding under the skin, into organs in the body such as \n\nthe liver or kidneys and from the mouth, eyes or ears. Some people get severe diarrhea, sudden \ndrop in blood pressure or blood flow to the organs in the body (shock) which may cause serious \nand permanent damage to these organs, severe confusion (delirium), fits (seizures), kidney \nfailure and coma.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first to decide if you should be given this vaccine.\n\nHow the vaccine works\nThe Zabdeno and Mvabea 2-dose vaccine course stimulates the body’s natural defences (immune \nsystem). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the \nvirus that causes the Ebola infection. This will help to protect against Ebola virus disease in the future.\n\n2. What you need to know before you or your child are given Mvabea\n\nTo make sure that the vaccination course is suitable for you or your child, it is important to tell your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if any of the points below apply to you or your child. If there is anything \nyou do not understand, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse to explain.\n\nDo not have the vaccine if\n you or your child have ever had a severe allergic reaction to any of the active substances or any \n\nof the other ingredients listed in section 6.\n you or your child have ever had a severe allergic reaction to chicken or eggs or an antibiotic \n\nknown as ‘gentamicin’.\nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Mvabea if you or your child:\n have ever had a severe allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection,\n have ever fainted, after having an injection,\n have a problem with bleeding or you bruise easily,\n currently have a fever or an infection,\n are taking medicines that weaken the immune system, such as high-dose corticosteroids (such as \n\nprednisone) or chemotherapy (cancer medicines),\n have a weak immune system – for example, due to HIV infection or an illness that runs in the \n\nfamily (‘genetic disorder’).\nIf any of the above apply to you or your child (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse before you are given Mvabea.\n\nIf you are at high risk of being in contact with the Ebola virus, a booster vaccination with Zabdeno\nmay be recommended for you or your child. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if this applies to \nyou or your child.\n\nIf you or your child only have one of the vaccines, Zabdeno or Mvabea, it may give less protection\nfrom Ebola virus disease than having a course of both vaccines.\n\nAs with all vaccines, the Zabdeno and Mvabea 2-dose course of vaccination may not fully protect \neveryone from Ebola virus disease and it is not known how long you will be protected.\n\n\n\n26\n\n People who have been given the 2-dose course of vaccination should still take precautions \nto avoid coming into contact with Ebola virus.\n\nWashing your hands correctly is the most effective way to prevent the spread of dangerous germs, like\nEbola virus. It reduces the number of germs on the hands and so reduces their spread from person to\nperson.\n\nProper hand washing methods are described below.\n Use soap and water when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids. There is no \n\nneed to use antimicrobial soaps for washing hands.\n Use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when hands are not dirty. Do not use alcohol-based hand \n\nsanitiser when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids.\n\nWhile in an area affected by Ebola, it is important to avoid the following:\n Contact with blood and body fluids (such as urine, faeces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, \n\nsemen, and vaginal fluids).\n Items that may have come in contact with an infected person’s blood or body fluids (such as \n\nclothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment).\n Funeral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who died from Ebola.\n Contact with bats, apes and monkeys or with blood, fluids and raw meat prepared from these \n\nanimals (bushmeat) or meat from an unknown source.\n Contact with semen from a man who had Ebola. You should follow safe sex practices until the \n\nvirus is gone from the semen. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice about how \nlong to maintain safe sex practices.\n\nChildren younger than 1 year of age\nMvabea must not be used in children younger than 1 year of age.\n\nOther medicines and Mvabea\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take, any \nother medicines or vaccines.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before having this vaccine if you or your child is pregnant or \nbreast-feeding. Also do this if you think you or your child may be pregnant or are planning to have a \nbaby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nMvabea has no known effect on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nMvabea contains Sodium\nMvabea contains less than 1mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of 0.5 mL, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’.\n\n3. How Mvabea is given\n\nYour doctor or nurse will inject the vaccine into a muscle (intramuscular injection) in the upper arm or \nthigh.\n\nMvabea must not be injected into a blood vessel.\n\nThe 2-dose course of vaccination consists of:\n a dose of Zabdeno vaccine,\n followed around 8 weeks later by a dose of Mvabea vaccine.\nYour doctor will tell you the date for the second vaccine.\n\n\n\n27\n\nHow much vaccine will you or your child get\nPrimary vaccination\n First vaccination with Zabdeno – red cap vial (0.5 mL).\n Second vaccination with Mvabea – yellow cap vial (0.5 mL), given around 8 weeks after \n\nthe first vaccination with Zabdeno.\n\nBooster vaccination with Zabdeno (an extra dose of Zabdeno to increase or renew the \neffect of an earlier Zabdeno and Mvabea 2-dose course of vaccination)\n The booster vaccination is recommended for you or your child if you are at high risk of \n\nbeing in contact with the Ebola virus and you completed the 2-dose course of vaccination \nmore than 4 months ago.\n\n Ask your doctor if you or your child should consider getting the booster vaccination.\n\nDuring and after the injection of the vaccine, the doctor will watch over you or your child for around \n15 minutes or longer as necessary in case of a severe allergic reaction.\n\nInstructions for preparing the vaccine – for medical and healthcare professionals – are included at \nthe end of the leaflet.\n\nIf you have an unintended or accidental injection of Zabdeno or Mvabea\n If you or your child are accidently given Mvabea as the first vaccination – you will get Zabdeno\n\nas the second vaccination around 8 weeks later.\n If you or your child are accidently given Zabdeno as the first and the second vaccination – you \n\nwill get Mvabea around 8 weeks after the second vaccination with Zabdeno.\n If you or your child are accidently given Mvabea as the first and the second vaccination – you \n\nwill get Zabdeno around 8 weeks after the second vaccination with Mvabea.\n If you or your child have not been given Mvabea around 8 weeks after vaccination with \n\nZabdeno – talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about getting the second vaccination with \nMvabea.\n\nIf you miss an appointment for vaccination of Zabdeno or Mvabea\n If you miss an appointment, tell your doctor and arrange another visit.\n If you miss a scheduled injection, you may not be fully protected from Ebola virus.\n If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor.\n\n4.
