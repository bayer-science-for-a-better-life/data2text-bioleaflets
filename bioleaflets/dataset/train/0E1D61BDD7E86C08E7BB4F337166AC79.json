CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLacosamide UCB is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or \nwithout secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy.  \nLacosamide UCB is indicated as adjunctive therapy \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\u2022 in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, \nadolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. \n\n\u2022 in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults, adolescents and \nchildren from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nLacosamide must be taken twice a day (usually once in the morning and once in the evening). \nLacosamide may be taken with or without food. \nIf a dose is missed, the patient should be instructed to take the missed dose immediately, and then to \ntake the next dose of lacosamide at the regularly scheduled time. If the patient notices the missed dose \nwithin 6 hours of the next one, he/she should be instructed to wait to take the next dose of lacosamide \nat the regularly scheduled time. Patients should not take a double dose. \n \n\nAdolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more, and adults \n\n \nThe following table summarises the recommended posology for adolescents and children weighing \n50 kg or more, and for adults. More details are provided in the table below. \n \n Monotherapy Adjunctive therapy \nStarting dose \n \n\n100 mg/day or 200 mg/day 100 mg/day \n\nSingle loading dose  \n(if applicable) \n\n200 mg 200 mg \n\nTitration (incremental steps) 50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day) \nat weekly intervals \n\n50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day) \nat weekly intervals \n\nMaximum recommended dose up to 600 mg/day up to 400 mg/day \n \n\nMonotherapy (in the treatment of partial-onset seizures) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice a day which should be increased to an initial \ntherapeutic dose of 100 mg twice a day after one week. \nLacosamide can also be initiated at the dose of 100 mg twice a day based on the physician's \nassessment of required seizure reduction versus potential side effects. \nDepending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased at weekly \nintervals by 50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day), up to a maximum recommended daily dose of 300 mg \ntwice a day (600 mg/day).  \nIn patients having reached a dose greater than 400 mg/day and who need an additional antiepileptic \nmedicinal product, the posology that is recommended for adjunctive therapy below should be \nfollowed. \n \nAdjunctive therapy (in the treatment of partial-onset seizures or in the treatment of primary \n\ngeneralised tonic-clonic seizures) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice a day which should be increased to an initial \ntherapeutic dose of 100 mg twice a day after one week.  \nDepending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased at weekly \nintervals by 50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day), up to a maximum recommended daily dose of 400 mg \n(200 mg twice a day).  \n \n\nInitiation of lacosamide treatment with a loading dose (initial monotherapy or conversion to \n\nmonotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of \n\npartial-onset seizures or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic \n\nseizures) \n\nLacosamide treatment may also be initiated with a single loading dose of 200 mg, followed \napproximately 12 hours later by a 100 mg twice a day (200 mg/day) maintenance dose regimen. \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSubsequent dose adjustments should be performed according to individual response and tolerability as \ndescribed above. A loading dose may be initiated in patients in situations when the physician \ndetermines that rapid attainment of lacosamide steady state plasma concentration and therapeutic \neffect is warranted. It should be administered under medical supervision with consideration of the \npotential for increased incidence of serious cardiac arrhythmia and central nervous system adverse \nreactions (see section 4.8). Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in acute conditions \nsuch as status epilepticus. \n \nDiscontinuation \n\nIn accordance with current clinical practice, if lacosamide has to be discontinued, it is recommended \nthis be done gradually (e.g. taper the daily dose by 200 mg/week). \nIn patients who develop serious cardiac arrhythmia, clinical benefit/risk assessment should be \nperformed and if needed lacosamide should be discontinued. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \n\nNo dose reduction is necessary in elderly patients. Age associated decreased renal clearance with an \nincrease in AUC levels should be considered in elderly patients (see following paragraph \u2018renal \nimpairment\u2019 and section 5.2). There is limited clinical data in the elderly patients with epilepsy, \nparticularly at doses greater than 400 mg/day (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1). \n \nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired adult and paediatric \npatients (CLCR > 30 ml/min). In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with \nmild or moderate renal impairment a loading dose of 200 mg may be considered, but further dose \ntitration (> 200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or \nmore and in adult patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR \u2264 30 ml/min) or with end-stage renal \ndisease, a maximum dose of 250 mg/day is recommended and the dose titration should be performed \nwith caution. If a loading dose is indicated, an initial dose of 100 mg followed by a 50 mg twice daily \nregimen for the first week should be used. In paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with severe \nrenal impairment (CLCR \u2264 30 ml/min) and in those with end-stage renal disease, a reduction of 25 % of \nthe maximum dose is recommended. For all patients requiring haemodialysis a supplement of up to \n50 % of the divided daily dose directly after the end of haemodialysis is recommended. Treatment of \npatients with end-stage renal disease should be made with caution as there is little clinical experience \nand accumulation of a metabolite (with no known pharmacological activity).  \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nA maximum dose of 300 mg/day is recommended for paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and \nfor adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  \nThe dose titration in these patients should be performed with caution considering co-existing renal \nimpairment. In adolescents and adults weighing 50 kg or more, a loading dose of 200 mg may be \nconsidered, but further dose titration (> 200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. Based on \ndata in adults, in paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment, a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose should be applied. The pharmacokinetics of \nlacosamide has not been evaluated in severely hepatic impaired patients (see section 5.2). Lacosamide \nshould be administered to adult and paediatric patients with severe hepatic impairment only when the \nexpected therapeutic benefits are anticipated to outweigh the possible risks. The dose may need to be \nadjusted while carefully observing disease activity and potential side effects in the patient. \n \nPaediatric population \n \n\nThe physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and \ndose.  \n \nAdolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more \n\nDosage in adolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more is the same as in adults (see above). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nChildren (from 4 years of age) and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg \n\nThe dose is determined based on body weight. It is therefore recommended to initiate treatment with \nthe syrup and switch to tablets, if desired.  \n \n\nMonotherapy (in the treatment of partial-onset seizures) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 2 mg/kg/day which should be increased to an initial therapeutic \ndose of 4 mg/kg/day after one week. \nDepending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased by 2 mg/kg/day \nevery week. The dose should be gradually increased until the optimum response is obtained. In \nchildren weighing less than 40 kg, a maximum dose of up to 12 mg/kg/day is recommended. In \nchildren weighing from 40 to under 50 kg, a maximum dose of 10 mg/kg/day is recommended. \n \nThe following table summarises the recommended posology in monotherapy for children and \nadolescents weighing less than 50 kg. \n\nStarting dose \n \n\n2 mg/kg/day  \n\nSingle loading dose  Not recommended \nTitration (incremental steps) 2 mg/kg/day every week \nMaximum recommended dose in patients < 40 kg up to 12 mg/kg/day \nMaximum recommended dose in patients \u2265 40 kg \nto < 50 kg \n\nup to 10 mg/kg/day \n\n \n\nAdjunctive therapy (in the treatment of partial-onset seizures or in the treatment of primary \n\ngeneralised tonic-clonic seizures) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 2 mg/kg/day which should be increased to an initial therapeutic \ndose of 4 mg/kg/day after one week. \nDepending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased by 2 mg/kg/day \nevery week. The dose should be gradually adjusted until the optimum response is obtained. In children \nweighing less than 20 kg, due to an increased clearance compared to adults, a maximum dose of up to \n12 mg/kg/day is recommended. In children weighing from 20 to under 30 kg, a maximum dose of \n10 mg/kg/day is recommended and in children weighing from 30 to under 50 kg, a maximum dose of \n8 mg/kg/day is recommended, although in open-label studies (see sections 4.8 and 5.2), a dose up to \n12 mg/kg/day has been used by a small number of these children.  \n \nThe following table summarises the recommended posology in adjunctive therapy for children and \nadolescents weighing less than 50 kg. \n\nStarting dose \n \n\n2 mg/kg/day  \n\nSingle loading dose  Not recommended \nTitration (incremental steps) 2 mg/kg/day every week \nMaximum recommended dose in patients \n< 20 kg \n\nup to 12 mg/kg/day \n\nMaximum recommended dose in patients \u2265 20 kg \nto < 30 kg \n\nup to 10 mg/kg/day \n\nMaximum recommended dose in patients \u2265 30 kg \nto < 50 kg  \n\nup to 8 mg/kg/day  \n\n \nLoading dose \nAdministration of a loading dose has not been studied in children. Use of a loading dose is not \nrecommended in adolescents and children weighing less than 50 kg. \n \nChildren less than 4 years \n\nThe safety and efficacy of lacosamide in children aged below 4 years have not yet been established. \nNo data are available. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nMethod of administration \n \nLacosamide film-coated tablets are for oral use. Lacosamide may be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nKnown second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled studies of \nantiepileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and \nbehaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the \npossibility of an increased risk for lacosamide. \nTherefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate \ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical \nadvice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge (see section 4.8). \n \nCardiac rhythm and conduction \n \nDose-related prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies. \nLacosamide should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as \npatients with known cardiac conduction problems or severe cardiac disease (e.g. myocardial \nischaemia/infarction, heart failure, structural heart disease or cardiac sodium channelopathies) or \npatients treated with medicinal products affecting cardiac conduction, including antiarrhythmics and \nsodium channel blocking antiepileptic medicinal products (see section 4.5), as well as in elderly \npatients. \nIn these patients it should be considered to perform an ECG before a lacosamide dose increase above \n400 mg/day and after lacosamide is titrated to steady-state. \n \nIn the placebo-controlled studies of lacosamide in epilepsy patients, atrial fibrillation or flutter were \nnot reported; however, both have been reported in open-label epilepsy studies and in post-marketing \nexperience. \n \nIn post-marketing experience, AV block (including second degree or higher AV block) has been \nreported. In patients with proarrhythmic conditions, ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been reported. In \nrare cases, these events have led to asystole, cardiac arrest and death in patients with underlying \nproarrhythmic conditions. \n \nPatients should be made aware of the symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. slow, rapid or irregular \npulse, palpitations, shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded, fainting). Patients should be counselled to \nseek immediate medical advice if these symptoms occur. \n \nDizziness \n \nTreatment with lacosamide has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of \naccidental injury or falls. Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are \nfamiliar with the potential effects of the medicine (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nPotential for new onset or worsening of myoclonic seizures \n \nNew onset or worsening of myoclonic seizures has been reported in both adult and paediatric patients \nwith PGTCS, in particular during titration. In patients with more than one seizure type, the observed \nbenefit of control for one seizure type should be weighed against any observed worsening in another \nseizure type. \n \nPotential for electro-clinical worsening in specific paediatric epilepsy syndromes \n \nThe safety and efficacy of lacosamide in paediatric patients with epilepsy syndromes in which focal \nand generalised seizures may coexist have not been determined. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nLacosamide should be used with caution in patients treated with medicinal products known to be \nassociated with PR prolongation (including sodium channel blocking antiepileptic medicinal products) \nand in patients treated with antiarrhythmics. However, subgroup analysis in clinical studies did not \nidentify an increased magnitude of PR prolongation in patients with concomitant administration of \ncarbamazepine or lamotrigine. \n \nIn vitro data \n \nData generally suggest that lacosamide has a low interaction potential. In vitro studies indicate that the \nenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9 are not induced and that CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, \nCYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 are not inhibited by lacosamide at plasma \nconcentrations observed in clinical studies. An in vitro study indicated that lacosamide is not \ntransported by P-glycoprotein in the intestine. In vitro data show that CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and \nCYP3A4 are capable of catalysing the formation of the O-desmethyl metabolite. \n \nIn vivo data \n \nLacosamide does not inhibit or induce CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 to a clinically relevant extent. \nLacosamide did not affect the AUC of midazolam (metabolised by CYP3A4, lacosamide given \n200 mg twice a day), but Cmax of midazolam was slightly increased (30 %). Lacosamide did not affect \nthe pharmacokinetics of omeprazole (metabolised by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, lacosamide given \n300 mg twice a day).  \nThe CYP2C19 inhibitor omeprazole (40 mg once daily) did not give rise to a clinically significant \nchange in lacosamide exposure. Thus, moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 are unlikely to affect systemic \nlacosamide exposure to a clinically relevant extent.  \nCaution is recommended in concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP2C9 (e.g. \nfluconazole) and CYP3A4 (e.g. itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin), which may lead \nto increased systemic exposure of lacosamide. Such interactions have not been established in vivo, but \nare possible based on in vitro data. \n \nStrong enzyme inducers such as rifampicin or St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) may moderately \nreduce the systemic exposure of lacosamide. Therefore, starting or ending treatment with these \nenzyme inducers should be done with caution. \n \nAntiepileptic medicinal products  \n \nIn interaction studies lacosamide did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of \ncarbamazepine and valproic acid. Lacosamide plasma concentrations were not affected by \ncarbamazepine and by valproic acid. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in different age groups \nestimated that concomitant treatment with other antiepileptic medicinal products known to be enzyme \ninducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, in various doses) decreased the overall systemic \nexposure of lacosamide by 25 % in adults and 17 % in paediatric patients.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nOral contraceptives \n \nIn an interaction study there was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and the oral \ncontraceptives ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Progesterone concentrations were not affected \nwhen the medicinal products were co-administered. \n \nOthers \n \nInteraction studies showed that lacosamide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. There \nwas no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and metformin.  \nCo-administration of warfarin with lacosamide does not result in a clinically relevant change in the \npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin. \nAlthough no pharmacokinetic data on the interaction of lacosamide with alcohol are available, a \npharmacodynamic effect cannot be excluded. \nLacosamide has a low protein binding of less than 15 %. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions \nwith other medicinal products through competition for protein binding sites are considered unlikely. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n \n\nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general  \n\nFor all antiepileptic medicinal products, it has been shown that in the offspring of treated women with \nepilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately \n3 % in the general population. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted \nwith polytherapy, however, the extent to which the treatment and/or the illness is responsible has not \nbeen elucidated. \nMoreover, effective antiepileptic therapy must not be interrupted, since the aggravation of the illness is \ndetrimental to both the mother and the foetus. \n \nRisk related to lacosamide \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of lacosamide in pregnant women. Studies in animals did not \nindicate any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but embryotoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits \nat maternal toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nLacosamide should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the benefit to the mother \nclearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). If women decide to become pregnant, the use of this \nproduct should be carefully re-evaluated. \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is unknown whether lacosamide is excreted in human breast milk. A risk to the newborns/infants \ncannot be excluded. Animal studies have shown excretion of lacosamide in breast milk. For \nprecautionary measures, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with lacosamide. \n \nFertility \n \nNo adverse reactions on male or female fertility or reproduction were observed in rats at doses \nproducing plasma exposures (AUC) up to approximately 2 times the plasma AUC in humans at the \nmaximum recommended human dose (MRHD). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLacosamide has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Lacosamide \ntreatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision.  \nAccordingly, patients should be advised not to drive or to operate other potentially hazardous \nmachinery until they are familiar with the effects of lacosamide on their ability to perform such \nactivities. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nBased on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in \n1,308 patients with partial-onset seizures, a total of 61.9 % of patients randomised to lacosamide and \n35.2 % of patients randomised to placebo reported at least 1 adverse reaction. The most frequently \nreported adverse reactions (\u2265 10 %) with lacosamide treatment were dizziness, headache, nausea and \ndiplopia. They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Some were dose-related and could be \nalleviated by reducing the dose. Incidence and severity of central nervous system (CNS) and \ngastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time. \nIn all of these controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12.2 % for \npatients randomised to lacosamide and 1.6 % for patients randomised to placebo. The most common \nadverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy was dizziness.  \nIncidence of CNS adverse reactions such as dizziness may be higher after a loading dose. \n \nBased on the analysis of data from a non-inferiority monotherapy clinical study comparing lacosamide \nto carbamazepine controlled release (CR), the most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u2265 10 %) for \nlacosamide were headache and dizziness. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was \n10.6 % for patients treated with lacosamide and 15.6 % for patients treated with carbamazepine CR.  \n \nThe safety profile of lacosamide reported in a study conducted in patients aged 4 years and older with \nidiopathic generalised epilepsy with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) was consistent \nwith the safety profile reported from the pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies in partial-onset \nseizures. Additional adverse reactions reported in PGTCS patients were myoclonic epilepsy (2.5 % in \nthe lacosamide-group and 0 % in the placebo-group) and ataxia (3.3 % in the lacosamide-group and \n0 % in the placebo-group). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were dizziness and \nsomnolence. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy \nwere dizziness and suicidal ideation. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 9.1 % in \nthe lacosamide group and 4.1 % in the placebo group. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe table below shows the frequencies of adverse reactions which have been reported in clinical \nstudies and post-marketing experience. The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10), \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and not known (frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data).

Adverse reactions \nassociated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. atrioventricular block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.  \nIn adjunctive clinical studies in epilepsy patients, the incidence rate of reported first-degree AV Block \nis uncommon, 0.7 %, 0 %, 0.5 % and 0 % for lacosamide 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo, \nrespectively. No second- or higher degree AV Block was seen in these studies. However, cases with \nsecond- and third-degree AV Block associated with lacosamide treatment have been reported in \npost-marketing experience. In the monotherapy clinical study comparing lacosamide to carbamazepine \nCR, the extent of increase in PR interval was comparable between lacosamide and carbamazepine. \nThe incidence rate for syncope reported in pooled adjunctive therapy clinical studies is uncommon and \ndid not differ between lacosamide (n=944) treated epilepsy patients (0.1 %) and placebo (n=364) \ntreated epilepsy patients (0.3 %). In the monotherapy clinical study comparing lacosamide to \ncarbamazepine CR, syncope was reported in 7/444 (1.6 %) lacosamide patients and in 1/442 (0.2 %) \ncarbamazepine CR patients. \nAtrial fibrillation or flutter were not reported in short term clinical studies; however, both have been \nreported in open-label epilepsy studies and in post-marketing experience. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n\nAbnormalities in liver function tests have been observed in placebo-controlled studies with lacosamide \nin adult patients with partial-onset seizures who were taking 1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts. Elevations of ALT to \u2265 3x ULN occurred in 0.7 % (7/935) of Lacosamide UCB patients and \n0 % (0/356) of placebo patients. \n \nMultiorgan hypersensitivity reactions \n\nMultiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic \nSymptoms, DRESS) have been reported in patients treated with some antiepileptic medicinal products. \nThese reactions are variable in expression, but typically present with fever and rash and can be \nassociated with involvement of different organ systems. If multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction is \nsuspected, lacosamide should be discontinued. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety profile of lacosamide in placebo-controlled (see study details in section 5.1) and in open-\nlabel studies (n=408) in adjunctive therapy in children from 4 years of age with partial-onset seizures \nwas consistent with the safety profile observed in adults although the frequency of some adverse \nreactions (somnolence, vomiting and convulsion) was increased and additional adverse reactions \n(nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, pharyngitis, decreased appetite, lethargy and abnormal behaviour) have \nbeen reported in paediatric patients: nasopharyngitis (15.7 %), vomiting (14.7 %), somnolence \n(14.0 %), dizziness (13.5 %), pyrexia (13.0 %), convulsion (7.8 %), decreased appetite (5.9 %), \npharyngitis (4.7 %), lethargy (2.7 %) and abnormal behaviour (1.7 %). \nA total of 67.8 % of patients randomised to lacosamide and 58.1 % of patients randomised to placebo \nreported at least 1 adverse reaction. \nBehavioural, cognition and emotional functioning were measured by the questionnaires Achenbach \nCBCL and BRIEF that were applied at baseline and throughout the studies and were mainly stable \nduring the course of the studies. \n \nElderly population  \n \nIn the monotherapy study comparing lacosamide to carbamazepine CR, the types of adverse reactions \nrelated to lacosamide in elderly patients (\u2265 65 years of age) appear to be similar to that observed in \npatients less than 65 years of age. However, a higher incidence (\u2265 5 % difference) of fall, diarrhoea \nand tremor has been reported in elderly patients compared to younger adult patients. The most \nfrequent cardiac-related adverse reaction reported in elderly compared to the younger adult population \nwas first-degree AV block. This was reported with lacosamide in 4.8 % (3/62) in elderly patients \nversus 1.6 % (6/382) in younger adult patients. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events \nobserved with lacosamide was 21.0 % (13/62) in elderly patients versus 9.2 % (35/382) in younger \n\n\n\n12 \n\nadult patients. These differences between elderly and younger adult patients were similar to those \nobserved in the active comparator group. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \n\nSymptoms observed after an accidental or intentional overdose of lacosamide are primarily associated \nwith CNS and gastrointestinal system. \n\n\uf0b7 The types of adverse reactions experienced by patients exposed to doses above 400 mg up to \n800 mg were not clinically different from those of patients administered recommended doses \nof lacosamide. \n\n\uf0b7 Reactions reported after an intake of more than 800 mg are dizziness, nausea, vomiting, \nseizures (generalised tonic-clonic seizures, status epilepticus). Cardiac conduction disorders, \nshock and coma have also been observed. Fatalities have been reported in patients following \nan intake of acute single overdose of several grams of lacosamide. \n\n \nManagement \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with lacosamide. Treatment of lacosamide overdose should \ninclude general supportive measures and may include haemodialysis if necessary (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX18  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe active substance, lacosamide (R-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide) is a \nfunctionalised amino acid. \nThe precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effect in humans remains to be \nfully elucidated. In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances \nslow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable \nneuronal membranes.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nLacosamide protected against seizures in a broad range of animal models of partial and primary \ngeneralised seizures and delayed kindling development.  \nIn non-clinical experiments lacosamide in combination with levetiracetam, carbamazepine, phenytoin, \nvalproate, lamotrigine, topiramate or gabapentin showed synergistic or additive anticonvulsant effects. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety (partial-onset seizures) \nAdult population \n \n\nMonotherapy \n\nEfficacy of lacosamide as monotherapy was established in a double-blind, parallel group, non-\ninferiority comparison to carbamazepine CR in 886 patients 16 years of age or older with newly or \nrecently diagnosed epilepsy. The patients had to present with unprovoked partial-onset seizures with \nor without secondary generalisation. The patients were randomised to carbamazepine CR or \nlacosamide, provided as tablets, in a 1:1 ratio. The dose was based on dose-response and ranged from \n400 to 1,200 mg/day for carbamazepine CR and from 200 to 600 mg/day for lacosamide. The duration \nof the treatment was up to 121 weeks depending on the response. \nThe estimated 6-month seizure freedom rates were 89.8 % for lacosamide-treated patients and 91.1 % \nfor carbamazepine CR treated patients using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis method. The adjusted \nabsolute difference between treatments was -1.3 % (95 % CI: -5.5, 2.8). The Kaplan-Meier estimates \nof 12-month seizure freedom rates were 77.8 % for lacosamide-treated patients and 82.7 % for \ncarbamazepine CR treated patients. \nThe 6-month seizure freedom rates in elderly patients of 65 and above (62 patients in lacosamide, \n57 patients in carbamazepine CR) were similar between both treatment groups. The rates were also \nsimilar to those observed in the overall population. In the elderly population, the maintenance \nlacosamide dose was 200 mg/day in 55 patients (88.7 %), 400 mg/day in 6 patients (9.7 %) and the \ndose was escalated to over 400 mg/day in 1 patient (1.6 %). \n \nConversion to monotherapy \n\nThe efficacy and safety of lacosamide in conversion to monotherapy has been assessed in a historical-\ncontrolled, multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial. In this study, 425 patients aged 16 to 70 years \nwith uncontrolled partial-onset seizures taking stable doses of 1 or 2 marketed antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts were randomised to be converted to lacosamide monotherapy (either 400 mg/day or \n300 mg/day in a 3:1 ratio). In treated patients who completed titration and started withdrawing \nantiepileptic medicinal products (284 and 99 respectively), monotherapy was maintained in 71.5 % \nand 70.7 % of patients respectively for 57-105 days (median 71 days), over the targeted observation \nperiod of 70 days. \n \nAdjunctive therapy \n\nThe efficacy of lacosamide as adjunctive therapy at recommended doses (200 mg/day, 400 mg/day) \nwas established in 3 multicenter, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical studies with a 12-week \nmaintenance period. Lacosamide 600 mg/day was also shown to be effective in controlled adjunctive \ntherapy studies, although the efficacy was similar to 400 mg/day and patients were less likely to \ntolerate this dose because of CNS- and gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions. Thus, the \n600 mg/day dose is not recommended. The maximum recommended dose is 400 mg/day. These \nstudies, involving 1,308 patients with a history of an average of 23 years of partial-onset seizures, \nwere designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lacosamide when administered concomitantly \nwith 1-3 antiepileptic medicinal products in patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures with or \nwithout secondary generalisation. Overall the proportion of subjects with a 50 % reduction in seizure \nfrequency was 23 %, 34 %, and 40 % for placebo, lacosamide 200 mg/day and lacosamide \n400 mg/day.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics and safety of a single loading dose of intravenous lacosamide were determined \nin a multicenter, open-label study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of rapid initiation of \nlacosamide using a single intravenous loading dose (including 200 mg) followed by twice daily oral \ndosing (equivalent to the intravenous dose) as adjunctive therapy in adult subjects 16 to 60 years of \nage with partial-onset seizures.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPartial-onset seizures have a similar clinical expression in children from 4 years of age and in adults. \nThe efficacy of lacosamide in children aged 4 years and older has been extrapolated from data of \nadolescents and adults with partial-onset seizures, for whom a similar response was expected provided \n\n\n\n14 \n\nthe paediatric dose adaptations are established (see section 4.2) and safety has been demonstrated (see \nsection 4.8).  \nThe efficacy supported by the extrapolation principle stated above was confirmed by a double-blind, \nrandomised, placebo-controlled study. The study consisted of an 8-week baseline period followed by a \n6-week titration period. Eligible patients on a stable dose regimen of 1 to \u2264 3 antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts, who still experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 4 weeks prior to screening \nwith seizure-free phase no longer than 21 days in the 8-week period prior to entry into the baseline \nperiod, were randomised to receive either placebo (n=172) or lacosamide (n=171).  \nDosing was initiated at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day in subjects weighing less than 50 kg or 100 mg/day in \nsubjects weighing 50 kg or more in 2 divided doses. During the titration period, lacosamide doses \nwere adjusted in 1or 2 mg/kg/day increments in subjects weighing less than 50 kg or 50 or 100 mg/day \nin subjects weighing 50 kg or more at weekly intervals to achieve the target maintenance period dose \nrange. \nSubjects must have achieved the minimum target dose for their body weight category for the final \n3 days of the titration period to be eligible for entry into the 10-week maintenance period. Subjects \nwere to remain on stable lacosamide dose throughout the maintenance period or were withdrawn and \nentered in the blinded taper period. \nStatistically significant (p=0.0003) and clinically relevant reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency \nper 28 days from baseline to the maintenance period was observed between the lacosamide and the \nplacebo group. The percent reduction over placebo based on analysis of covariance was 31.72 % \n(95 % CI: 16.342, 44.277). \nOverall, the proportion of subjects with at least a 50 % reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency per \n28 days from baseline to the maintenance period was 52.9 % in the lacosamide group compared with \n33.3 % in the placebo group. \nThe quality of life assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory indicated that subjects in both \nlacosamide and placebo groups had a similar and stable health-related quality of life during the entire \ntreatment period. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety (primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures) \n \nThe efficacy of lacosamide as adjunctive therapy in patients 4 years of age and older with idiopathic \ngeneralized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) was established \nin a 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study. The \nstudy consisted of a 12-week historical baseline period, a 4-week prospective baseline period and a 24-\nweek treatment period (which included a 6-week titration period and an 18-week maintenance period). \nEligible patients on a stable dose of 1 to 3 antiepileptic drugs experiencing at least 3 documented \nPGTCS during the 16-week combined baseline period were randomized 1 to 1 to receive lacosamide \nor placebo (patients in the full analysis set: lacosamide n=118, placebo n=121; of them 8 patients in \nthe \u2265 4 to < 12 years age group and 16 patients in the \u2265 12 to < 18 years range were treated with LCM \nand 9 and 16 patients, respectively with placebo).  \nPatients were titrated up to the target maintenance period dose of 12 mg/kg/day in patients weighing \nless than 30 kg, 8 mg/kg/day in patients weighing from 30 to less than 50 kg or 400 mg/day in patients \nweighing 50 kg or more.  \n \n\nEfficacy variable \nParameter \n\nPlacebo \nN=121 \n\nLacosamide \nN=118 \n\nTime to second PGTCS \nMedian (days) 77.0 - \n95 % CI 49.0, 128.0 - \nLacosamide \u2013 Placebo  \nHazard Ratio 0.540 \n95 % CI 0.377, 0.774 \np-value < 0.001 \n\nSeizure freedom   \nStratified Kaplan-Meier estimate (%) 17.2 31.3 \n95 % CI 10.4, 24.0 22.8, 39.9 \nLacosamide \u2013 Placebo 14.1 \n\n\n\n15 \n\nEfficacy variable \nParameter \n\nPlacebo \nN=121 \n\nLacosamide \nN=118 \n\n95 % CI 3.2, 25.1 \np-value 0.011 \n\nNote: For the lacosamide group, the median time to second PGTCS could not be estimated by Kaplan-\nMeier methods because \u02c3 50% of patients did not experience a second PGTCS by Day 166. \n \nThe findings in the pediatric subgroup were consistent with the results of the overall population for the \nprimary, secondary and other efficacy endpoints.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \n \nLacosamide is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. The oral bioavailability of \nlacosamide tablets is approximately 100 %. Following oral administration, the plasma concentration of \nunchanged lacosamide increases rapidly and reaches Cmax about 0.5 to 4 hours post-dose. Lacosamide \nUCB tablets and oral syrup are bioequivalent. Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/kg. Lacosamide is less than 15 % bound to plasma \nproteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \n95 % of the dose is excreted in the urine as lacosamide and metabolites. The metabolism of \nlacosamide has not been completely characterised.  \nThe major compounds excreted in urine are unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40 % of the dose) \nand its O-desmethyl metabolite less than 30 %.  \nA polar fraction proposed to be serine derivatives accounted for approximately 20 % in urine, but was \ndetected only in small amounts (0-2 %) in human plasma of some subjects. Small amounts (0.5-2 %) \nof additional metabolites were found in the urine.  \nIn vitro data show that CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 are capable of catalysing the formation of \nthe O-desmethyl metabolite but the main contributing isoenzyme has not been confirmed in vivo. No \nclinically relevant difference in lacosamide exposure was observed comparing its pharmacokinetics in \nextensive metabolisers (EMs, with a functional CYP2C19) and poor metabolisers (PMs, lacking a \nfunctional CYP2C19). Furthermore an interaction study with omeprazole (CYP2C19-inhibitor) \ndemonstrated no clinically relevant changes in lacosamide plasma concentrations indicating that the \nimportance of this pathway is minor. The plasma concentration of O-desmethyl-lacosamide is \napproximately 15 % of the concentration of lacosamide in plasma. This major metabolite has no \nknown pharmacological activity. \n \nElimination \n \nLacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and \nbiotransformation. After oral and intravenous administration of radiolabeled lacosamide, \napproximately 95 % of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5 % in the \nfaeces. The elimination half-life of lacosamide is approximately 13 hours. The pharmacokinetics is \ndose-proportional and constant over time, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Following twice \ndaily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after a 3 day period. The plasma \nconcentration increases with an accumulation factor of approximately 2. \n \nA single loading dose of 200 mg approximates steady-state concentrations comparable to 100 mg \ntwice daily oral administration. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nGender \n\nClinical studies indicate that gender does not have a clinically significant influence on the plasma \nconcentrations of lacosamide. \n \nRenal impairment \n\nThe AUC of lacosamide was increased by approximately 30 % in mildly and moderately and 60 % in \nseverely renal impaired patients and patients with end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis \ncompared to healthy subjects, whereas Cmax was unaffected. \nLacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by haemodialysis. Following a 4-hour haemodialysis \ntreatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50 %. Therefore, dosage supplementation \nfollowing haemodialysis is recommended (see section 4.2). The exposure of the O-desmethyl \nmetabolite was several-fold increased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. In \nabsence of haemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease, the levels were increased and \ncontinuously rising during the 24-hour sampling. It is unknown whether the increased metabolite \nexposure in end-stage renal disease subjects could give rise to adverse effects but no pharmacological \nactivity of the metabolite has been identified. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nSubjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of \nlacosamide (approximately 50 % higher AUCnorm). The higher exposure was partly due to a reduced \nrenal function in the studied subjects. The decrease in non-renal clearance in the patients of the study \nwas estimated to give a 20 % increase in the AUC of lacosamide. The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide \nhas not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \n\nIn a study in elderly men and women including 4 patients > 75 years of age, AUC was about 30 and \n50 % increased compared to young men, respectively. This is partly related to lower body weight. The \nbody weight normalized difference is 26 and 23 %, respectively. An increased variability in exposure \nwas also observed. The renal clearance of lacosamide was only slightly reduced in elderly subjects in \nthis study.  \nA general dose reduction is not considered to be necessary unless indicated due to reduced renal \nfunction (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe paediatric pharmacokinetic profile of lacosamide was determined in a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis using sparse plasma concentration data obtained in one placebo-controlled randomised study \nand three open-label studies in 414 children with epilepsy aged 6 months to 17 years. The \nadministered lacosamide doses ranged from 2 to 17.8 mg/kg/day in twice daily intake, with a \nmaximum of 600 mg/day for children weighing 50 kg or more. \nThe typical plasma clearance was estimated to be 1.04 L/h, 1.32 L/h and 1.86 L/h for children \nweighing 20 kg, 30 kg and 50 kg respectively. In comparison, plasma clearance was estimated at \n1.92 L/h in adults (70 kg body weight). \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis using sparse pharmacokinetic samples from PGTCS study \nshowed a similar exposure in patients with PGTCS and in patients with partial-onset seizures. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn the toxicity studies, the plasma concentrations of lacosamide obtained were similar or only \nmarginally higher than those observed in patients, which leaves low or non-existing margins to human \nexposure. \nA safety pharmacology study with intravenous administration of lacosamide in anesthetised dogs \nshowed transient increases in PR interval and QRS complex duration and decreases in blood pressure \nmost likely due to a cardiodepressant action. These transient changes started in the same concentration \nrange as after maximum recommended clinical dosing. In anesthetised dogs and Cynomolgus \n\n\n\n17 \n\nmonkeys, at intravenous doses of 15-60 mg/kg, slowing of atrial and ventricular conductivity, \natrioventricular block and atrioventricular dissociation were seen. \nIn the repeated dose toxicity studies, mild reversible liver changes were observed in rats starting at \nabout 3 times the clinical exposure. These changes included an increased organ weight, hypertrophy of \nhepatocytes, increases in serum concentrations of liver enzymes and increases in total cholesterol and \ntriglycerides. Apart from the hypertrophy of hepatocytes, no other histopathologic changes were \nobserved. \nIn reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rodents and rabbits, no teratogenic effects but an \nincrease in numbers of stillborn pups and pup deaths in the peripartum period, and slightly reduced \nlive litter sizes and pup body weights were observed at maternal toxic doses in rats corresponding to \nsystemic exposure levels similar to the expected clinical exposure. Since higher exposure levels could \nnot be tested in animals due to maternal toxicity, data are insufficient to fully characterise the \nembryofetotoxic and teratogenic potential of lacosamide. \nStudies in rats revealed that lacosamide and/or its metabolites readily crossed the placental barrier. \nIn juvenile rats and dogs, the types of toxicity do not differ qualitatively from those observed in adult \nanimals. In juvenile rats, a reduced body weight was observed at systemic exposure levels similar to \nthe expected clinical exposure. In juvenile dogs, transient and dose-related CNS clinical signs started \nto be observed at systemic exposure levels below the expected clinical exposure. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLacosamide UCB is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or \nwithout secondary generalisation in adolescents and children from 4 years of age weighing 50 kg or \n\n\n\n21 \n\nmore and in adults with epilepsy.  \n\nLacosamide UCB is indicated as adjunctive therapy \n\u2022 in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in \n\nadolescents and children from 4 years of age weighing 50 kg or more and in adults with \nepilepsy. \n\n\u2022 in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adolescents and children from \n4 years of age weighing 50 kg or more and in adults with idiopathic generalised epilepsy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nLacosamide must be taken twice a day (usually once in the morning and once in the evening). \nLacosamide may be taken with or without food. \nIf a dose is missed, the patient should be instructed to take the missed dose immediately, and then to \ntake the next dose of lacosamide at the regularly scheduled time. If the patient notices the missed dose \nwithin 6 hours of the next one, he/she should be instructed to wait to take the next dose of lacosamide \nat the regularly scheduled time. Patients should not take a double dose. \n \nAdolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more, and adults \n\n \nMonotherapy (in the treatment of partial-onset seizures) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice a day which should be increased to an initial \ntherapeutic dose of 100 mg twice a day after one week. \nLacosamide can also be initiated at the dose of 100 mg twice a day based on the physician's \nassessment of required seizure reduction versus potential side effects. \nDepending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased at weekly \nintervals by 50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day), up to a maximum recommended daily dose of 300 mg \ntwice a day (600 mg/day).  \nIn patients having reached a dose greater than 400 mg/day and who need an additional antiepileptic \nmedicinal product, the posology that is recommended for adjunctive therapy below should be \nfollowed. \n \n\nAdjunctive therapy (in the treatment of partial-onset seizures or in the treatment of primary \n\ngeneralised tonic-clonic seizures) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice a day which should be increased to an initial \ntherapeutic dose of 100 mg twice a day after one week.  \nDepending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased at weekly \nintervals by 50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day), up to a maximum recommended daily dose of 400 mg \n(200 mg twice a day). \n \nLacosamide UCB treatment initiation pack contains 4 different packages (one for each tablet strength) \nwith 14 tablets each, for the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy depending on the patient\u2019s response and \ntolerability. The packages are marked with \u2018week 1 (2, 3 or 4)\u2019. \nOn the first day of treatment the patient starts with Lacosamide UCB 50 mg tablets twice a day. \nDuring the second week, the patient takes Lacosamide UCB 100 mg tablets twice a day. \nDepending on response and tolerability, Lacosamide UCB 150 mg tablets may be taken twice a day \nduring the third week and Lacosamide UCB 200 mg tablets twice a day during the fourth week. \n \nDiscontinuation \n\nIn accordance with current clinical practice, if lacosamide has to be discontinued, it is recommended \nthis be done gradually (e.g. taper the daily dose by 200 mg/week).  \nIn patients who develop serious cardiac arrhythmia, clinical benefit/risk assessment should be \nperformed and if needed lacosamide should be discontinued. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \n\nNo dose reduction is necessary in elderly patients. Age associated decreased renal clearance with an \nincrease in AUC levels should be considered in elderly patients (see following paragraph \u2018renal \nimpairment\u2019 and section 5.2). There is limited clinical data in the elderly patients with epilepsy, \nparticularly at doses greater than 400 mg/day (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1). \n \nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired adult and paediatric \npatients (CLCR > 30 ml/min). A maximum dose of 250 mg/day is recommended for paediatric patients \nweighing 50 kg or more and for adult patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR \u2264 30 ml/min) or \nwith end-stage renal disease. In paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with severe renal \nimpairment (CLCR \u2264 30 ml/min) and in those with end-stage renal disease, a reduction of 25 % of the \nmaximum dose is recommended. For all patients requiring haemodialysis a supplement of up to 50 % \nof the divided daily dose directly after the end of haemodialysis is recommended. Treatment of \npatients with end-stage renal disease should be made with caution as there is little clinical experience \nand accumulation of a metabolite (with no known pharmacological activity). In all patients with renal \nimpairment, the dose titration should be performed with caution (see section 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nA maximum dose of 300 mg/day is recommended for paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and \nfor adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  \nThe dose titration in these patients should be performed with caution considering co-existing renal \nimpairment. Based on data in adults, in paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment, a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose should be applied. The \npharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severely hepatic impaired patients (see \nsection 5.2). Lacosamide should be administered to adult and paediatric patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment only when the expected therapeutic benefits are anticipated to outweigh the possible risks. \nThe dose may need to be adjusted while carefully observing disease activity and potential side effects \nin the patient. \n \nPaediatric population \n \n\nAdolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more  \n\nDosage in adolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more is the same as in adults (see above). \n \nChildren (from 4 years of age) and adolescents weighing below 50 kg \n\nThis presentation is not suitable for this category of patients. \n \nChildren less than 4 years \nThe safety and efficacy of lacosamide in children aged below 4 years have not yet been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nLacosamide film-coated tablets are for oral use. Lacosamide may be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nKnown second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.  \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled studies of \nantiepileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and \nbehaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the \npossibility of an increased risk for lacosamide. \nTherefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate \ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical \nadvice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge (see section 4.8). \n \nCardiac rhythm and conduction \n \nDose-related prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies. \nLacosamide should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as \npatients with known cardiac conduction problems or severe cardiac disease (e.g. myocardial \nischaemia/infarction, heart failure, structural heart disease or cardiac sodium channelopathies) or \npatients treated with medicinal products affecting cardiac conduction, including antiarrhythmics and \nsodium channel blocking antiepileptic medicinal products (see section 4.5), as well as in elderly \npatients. \nIn these patients it should be considered to perform an ECG before a lacosamide dose increase above \n400 mg/day and after lacosamide is titrated to steady-state. \n \nIn the placebo-controlled studies of lacosamide in epilepsy patients, atrial fibrillation or flutter were \nnot reported; however, both have been reported in open-label epilepsy studies and in post-marketing \nexperience. \n \nIn post-marketing experience, AV block (including second degree or higher AV block) has been \nreported. In patients with proarrhythmic conditions, ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been reported. In \nrare cases, these events have led to asystole, cardiac arrest and death in patients with underlying \nproarrhythmic conditions. \n \nPatients should be made aware of the symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. slow, rapid or irregular \npulse, palpitations, shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded, fainting). Patients should be counselled to \nseek immediate medical advice if these symptoms occur. \n \nDizziness \n \nTreatment with lacosamide has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of \naccidental injury or falls. Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are \nfamiliar with the potential effects of the medicine (see section 4.8). \n \nPotential for new onset or worsening of myoclonic seizures \n \nNew onset or worsening of myoclonic seizures has been reported in both adult and paediatric patients \nwith PGTCS, in particular during titration. In patients with more than one seizure type, the observed \nbenefit of control for one seizure type should be weighed against any observed worsening in another \nseizure type. \n \nPotential for electro-clinical worsening in specific paediatric epilepsy syndromes \n \nThe safety and efficacy of lacosamide in paediatric patients with epilepsy syndromes in which focal \nand generalised seizures may coexist have not been determined. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nLacosamide should be used with caution in patients treated with medicinal products known to be \nassociated with PR prolongation (including sodium channel blocking antiepileptic medicinal products) \nand in patients treated with antiarrhythmics. However, subgroup analysis in clinical studies did not \nidentify an increased magnitude of PR prolongation in patients with concomitant administration of \ncarbamazepine or lamotrigine. \n \nIn vitro data \n \nData generally suggest that lacosamide has a low interaction potential. In vitro studies indicate that the \nenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9 are not induced and that CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, \nCYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 are not inhibited by lacosamide at plasma \nconcentrations observed in clinical studies. An in vitro study indicated that lacosamide is not \ntransported by P-glycoprotein in the intestine. In vitro data show that CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and \nCYP3A4 are capable of catalysing the formation of the O-desmethyl metabolite. \n \nIn vivo data \n \nLacosamide does not inhibit or induce CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 to a clinically relevant extent. \nLacosamide did not affect the AUC of midazolam (metabolised by CYP3A4, lacosamide given \n200 mg twice a day) but Cmax of midazolam was slightly increased (30 %). Lacosamide did not affect \nthe pharmacokinetics of omeprazole (metabolised by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, lacosamide given \n300 mg twice a day).  \nThe CYP2C19 inhibitor omeprazole (40 mg once daily) did not give rise to a clinically significant \nchange in lacosamide exposure. Thus, moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 are unlikely to affect systemic \nlacosamide exposure to a clinically relevant extent.  \nCaution is recommended in concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP2C9 (e.g. \nfluconazole) and CYP3A4 (e.g. itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin), which may lead \nto increased systemic exposure of lacosamide. Such interactions have not been established in vivo but \nare possible based on in vitro data. \n \nStrong enzyme inducers such as rifampicin or St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) may \nmoderately reduce the systemic exposure of lacosamide. Therefore, starting or ending treatment with \nthese enzyme inducers should be done with caution. \n \nAntiepileptic medicinal products \n \nIn interaction studies lacosamide did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of \ncarbamazepine and valproic acid. Lacosamide plasma concentrations were not affected by \ncarbamazepine and by valproic acid. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in different age groups \nestimated that concomitant treatment with other antiepileptic medicinal products known to be enzyme \ninducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, in various doses) decreased the overall systemic \nexposure of lacosamide by 25 % in adults and 17 % in paediatric patients.  \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nIn an interaction study there was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and the oral \ncontraceptives ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Progesterone concentrations were not affected \nwhen the medicinal products were co-administered. \n \nOthers \n \nInteraction studies showed that lacosamide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. There \nwas no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and metformin.  \nCo-administration of warfarin with lacosamide does not result in a clinically relevant change in the \npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin. \n\n\n\n25 \n\nAlthough no pharmacokinetic data on the interaction of lacosamide with alcohol are available, a \npharmacodynamic effect cannot be excluded. \nLacosamide has a low protein binding of less than 15 %. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions \nwith other medicinal products through competition for protein binding sites are considered unlikely. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n \nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general  \n\nFor all antiepileptic medicinal products, it has been shown that in the offspring of treated women with \nepilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately \n3 % in the general population. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted \nwith polytherapy, however, the extent to which the treatment and/or the illness is responsible has not \nbeen elucidated. \nMoreover, effective antiepileptic therapy must not be interrupted, since the aggravation of the illness is \ndetrimental to both the mother and the foetus. \n \nRisk related to lacosamide \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of lacosamide in pregnant women. Studies in animals did not \nindicate any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but embryotoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits \nat maternal toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nLacosamide should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the benefit to the mother \nclearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). If women decide to become pregnant, the use of this \nproduct should be carefully re-evaluated. \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is unknown whether lacosamide is excreted in human breast milk. A risk to the newborns/infants \ncannot be excluded. Animal studies have shown excretion of lacosamide in breast milk. For \nprecautionary measures, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with lacosamide. \n \nFertility \n \nNo adverse reactions on male or female fertility or reproduction were observed in rats at doses \nproducing plasma exposures (AUC) up to approximately 2 times the plasma AUC in humans at the \nmaximum recommended human dose (MRHD). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLacosamide has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Lacosamide \ntreatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision.  \nAccordingly, patients should be advised not to drive or to operate other potentially hazardous \nmachinery until they are familiar with the effects of lacosamide on their ability to perform such \nactivities. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nBased on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in \n1,308 patients with partial-onset seizures, a total of 61.9 % of patients randomised to lacosamide and \n35.2 % of patients randomised to placebo reported at least 1 adverse reaction. The most frequently \nreported adverse reactions (\u2265 10 %) with lacosamide treatment were dizziness, headache, nausea and \ndiplopia. They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Some were dose-related and could be \nalleviated by reducing the dose. Incidence and severity of central nervous system (CNS) and \ngastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time. \n\n\n\n26 \n\nIn all of these controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12.2 % for \npatients randomised to lacosamide and 1.6 % for patients randomised to placebo. The most common \nadverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy was dizziness.  \n \nBased on the analysis of data from a non-inferiority monotherapy clinical study comparing lacosamide \nto carbamazepine controlled release (CR), the most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u226510 %) for \nlacosamide were headache and dizziness. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was \n10.6 % for patients treated with lacosamide and 15.6 % for patients treated with carbamazepine CR.  \n \nThe safety profile of lacosamide reported in a study conducted in patients aged 4 years and older with \nidiopathic generalised epilepsy with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) was consistent \nwith the safety profile reported from the pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies in partial-onset \nseizures. Additional adverse reactions reported in PGTCS patients were myoclonic epilepsy (2.5 % in \nthe lacosamide-group and 0 % in the placebo-group) and ataxia (3.3 % in the lacosamide-group and \n0 % in the placebo-group). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were dizziness and \nsomnolence. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy \nwere dizziness and suicidal ideation. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 9.1 % in \nthe lacosamide group and 4.1 % in the placebo group. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe table below shows the frequencies of adverse reactions which have been reported in clinical \nstudies and post-marketing experience. The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10), \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and not known (frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data).

Adverse reactions \nassociated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. atrioventricular block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.  \nIn adjunctive clinical studies in epilepsy patients, the incidence rate of reported first-degree AV Block \nis uncommon, 0.7 %, 0 %, 0.5 % and 0 % for lacosamide 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo, \nrespectively. No second- or higher degree AV Block was seen in these studies. However, cases with \nsecond- and third-degree AV Block associated with lacosamide treatment have been reported in post-\nmarketing experience. In the monotherapy clinical study comparing lacosamide to carbamazepine CR, \nthe extent of increase in PR interval was comparable between lacosamide and carbamazepine. \nThe incidence rate for syncope reported in pooled adjunctive therapy clinical studies is uncommon and \ndid not differ between lacosamide (n=944) treated epilepsy patients (0.1 %) and placebo (n=364) \ntreated epilepsy patients (0.3 %). In the monotherapy clinical study comparing lacosamide to \n\n\n\n28 \n\ncarbamazepine CR, syncope was reported in 7/444 (1.6 %) lacosamide patients and in 1/442 (0.2 %) \ncarbamazepine CR patients. \nAtrial fibrillation or flutter were not reported in short term clinical studies; however, both have been \nreported in open-label epilepsy studies and in post-marketing experience. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n\nAbnormalities in liver function tests have been observed in placebo-controlled studies with lacosamide \nin adult patients with partial-onset seizures who were taking 1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts. Elevations of ALT to \u2265 3x ULN occurred in 0.7 % (7/935) of Lacosamide UCB patients and \n0 % (0/356) of placebo patients. \n \nMultiorgan hypersensitivity reactions \n\nMultiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic \nSymptoms, DRESS) have been reported in patients treated with some antiepileptic medicinal products. \nThese reactions are variable in expression but typically present with fever and rash and can be \nassociated with involvement of different organ systems. If multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction is \nsuspected, lacosamide should be discontinued. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety profile of lacosamide in placebo-controlled (see study details in section 5.1) and in open-\nlabel studies (n=408) in adjunctive therapy in children from 4 years of age with partial-onset seizures \nwas consistent with the safety profile observed in adults although the frequency of some adverse \nreactions (somnolence, vomiting and convulsion) was increased and additional adverse reactions \n(nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, pharyngitis, decreased appetite, lethargy and abnormal behaviour) have \nbeen reported in paediatric patients: nasopharyngitis (15.7 %), vomiting (14.7 %), somnolence \n(14.0 %), dizziness (13.5 %), pyrexia (13.0 %), convulsion (7.8 %), decreased appetite (5.9 %), \npharyngitis (4.7 %), lethargy (2.7 %) and abnormal behaviour (1.7 %). \nA total of 67.8 % of patients randomised to lacosamide and 58.1 % of patients randomised to placebo \nreported at least 1 adverse reaction. \nBehavioural, cognition and emotional functioning were measured by the questionnaires Achenbach \nCBCL and BRIEF that were applied at baseline and throughout the studies and were mainly stable \nduring the course of the studies. \n \nElderly population  \n \nIn the monotherapy study comparing lacosamide to carbamazepine CR, the types of adverse reactions \nrelated to lacosamide in elderly patients (\u2265 65 years of age) appear to be similar to that observed in \npatients less than 65 years of age. However, a higher incidence (\u2265 5 % difference) of fall, diarrhoea \nand tremor has been reported in elderly patients compared to younger adult patients. The most \nfrequent cardiac-related adverse reaction reported in elderly compared to the younger adult population \nwas first-degree AV block. This was reported with lacosamide in 4.8 % (3/62) in elderly patients \nversus 1.6 % (6/382) in younger adult patients. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events \nobserved with lacosamide was 21.0 % (13/62) in elderly patients versus 9.2 % (35/382) in younger \nadult patients. These differences between elderly and younger adult patients were similar to those \nobserved in the active comparator group.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n29 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nSymptoms observed after an accidental or intentional overdose of lacosamide are primarily associated \nwith CNS and gastrointestinal system. \n\n\uf0b7 The types of adverse reactions experienced by patients exposed to doses above 400 mg up to \n800 mg were not clinically different from those of patients administered recommended doses \nof lacosamide. \n\n\uf0b7 Reactions reported after an intake of more than 800 mg are dizziness, nausea, vomiting, \nseizures (generalised tonic-clonic seizures, status epilepticus). Cardiac conduction disorders, \nshock and coma have also been observed. Fatalities have been reported in patients following \nan intake of acute single overdose of several grams of lacosamide. \n\n \nManagement \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with lacosamide. Treatment of lacosamide overdose should \ninclude general supportive measures and may include haemodialysis if necessary (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX18  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe active substance, lacosamide (R-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide) is a \nfunctionalised amino acid. \nThe precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effect in humans remains to be \nfully elucidated. \nIn vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow \ninactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal \nmembranes.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nLacosamide protected against seizures in a broad range of animal models of partial and primary \ngeneralised seizures and delayed kindling development.  \nIn non-clinical experiments lacosamide in combination with levetiracetam, carbamazepine, phenytoin, \nvalproate, lamotrigine, topiramate or gabapentin showed synergistic or additive anticonvulsant effects. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety (partial-onset seizures) \nAdult population \n \n\nMonotherapy \n\nEfficacy of lacosamide as monotherapy was established in a double-blind, parallel group, non-\ninferiority comparison to carbamazepine CR in 886 patients 16 years of age or older with newly or \nrecently diagnosed epilepsy. The patients had to present with unprovoked partial-onset seizures with \nor without secondary generalisation. The patients were randomised to carbamazepine CR or \nlacosamide, provided as tablets, in a 1:1 ratio. The dose was based on dose-response and ranged from \n400 to 1,200 mg/day for carbamazepine CR and from 200 to 600 mg/day for lacosamide. The duration \nof the treatment was up to 121 weeks depending on the response. \nThe estimated 6-month seizure freedom rates were 89.8 % for lacosamide-treated patients and 91.1 % \nfor carbamazepine CR treated patients using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis method. The adjusted \nabsolute difference between treatments was -1.3 % (95 % CI: -5.5, 2.8). The Kaplan-Meier estimates \n\n\n\n30 \n\nof 12-month seizure freedom rates were 77.8 % for lacosamide-treated patients and 82.7 % for \ncarbamazepine CR treated patients. \nThe 6-month seizure freedom rates in elderly patients of 65 and above (62 patients in lacosamide, \n57 patients in carbamazepine CR) were similar between both treatment groups. The rates were also \nsimilar to those observed in the overall population. In the elderly population, the maintenance \nlacosamide dose was 200 mg/day in 55 patients (88.7 %), 400 mg/day in 6 patients (9.7 %) and the \ndose was escalated to over 400 mg/day in 1 patient (1.6 %). \n \nConversion to monotherapy \n\nThe efficacy and safety of lacosamide in conversion to monotherapy has been assessed in a historical-\ncontrolled, multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial. In this study, 425 patients aged 16 to 70 years \nwith uncontrolled partial-onset seizures taking stable doses of 1 or 2 marketed antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts were randomised to be converted to lacosamide monotherapy (either 400 mg/day or \n300 mg/day in a 3:1 ratio). In treated patients who completed titration and started withdrawing \nantiepileptic medicinal products (284 and 99 respectively), monotherapy was maintained in 71.5 % \nand 70.7 % of patients respectively for 57-105 days (median 71 days), over the targeted observation \nperiod of 70 days. \n \nAdjunctive therapy \n\nThe efficacy of lacosamide as adjunctive therapy at recommended doses (200 mg/day, 400 mg/day) \nwas established in 3 multicenter, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical studies with a 12-week \nmaintenance period. Lacosamide 600 mg/day was also shown to be effective in controlled adjunctive \ntherapy studies, although the efficacy was similar to 400 mg/day and patients were less likely to \ntolerate this dose because of CNS- and gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions. Thus, the \n600 mg/day dose is not recommended. The maximum recommended dose is 400 mg/day. These \nstudies, involving 1,308 patients with a history of an average of 23 years of partial-onset seizures, \nwere designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lacosamide when administered concomitantly \nwith 1-3 antiepileptic medicinal products in patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures with or \nwithout secondary generalisation. Overall the proportion of subjects with a 50 % reduction in seizure \nfrequency was 23 %, 34 %, and 40 % for placebo, lacosamide 200 mg/day and lacosamide \n400 mg/day.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPartial-onset seizures have a similar clinical expression in children from 4 years of age and in adults. \nThe efficacy of lacosamide in children aged 4 years and older has been extrapolated from data of \nadolescents and adults with partial-onset seizures, for whom a similar response was expected provided \nthe paediatric dose adaptations are established (see section 4.2) and safety has been demonstrated (see \nsection 4.8). \nThe efficacy supported by the extrapolation principle stated above was confirmed by a double-blind, \nrandomised, placebo-controlled study. The study consisted of an 8-week baseline period followed by a \n6-week titration period. Eligible patients on a stable dose regimen of 1 to \u2264 3 antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts, who still experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 4 weeks prior to screening \nwith seizure-free phase no longer than 21 days in the 8-week period prior to entry into the baseline \nperiod, were randomised to receive either placebo (n=172) or lacosamide (n=171).  \nDosing was initiated at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day in subjects weighing less than 50 kg or 100 mg/day in \nsubjects weighing 50 kg or more in 2 divided doses. During the titration period, lacosamide doses \nwere adjusted in 1or 2 mg/kg/day increments in subjects weighing less than 50 kg or 50 or 100 mg/day \nin subjects weighing 50 kg or more at weekly intervals to achieve the target maintenance period dose \nrange. \nSubjects must have achieved the minimum target dose for their body weight category for the final \n3 days of the titration period to be eligible for entry into the 10-week maintenance period. Subjects \nwere to remain on stable lacosamide dose throughout the maintenance period or were withdrawn and \nentered in the blinded taper period. \nStatistically significant (p=0.0003) and clinically relevant reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency \nper 28 days from baseline to the maintenance period was observed between the lacosamide and the \n\n\n\n31 \n\nplacebo group. The percent reduction over placebo based on analysis of covariance was 31.72 % \n(95 % CI: 16.342, 44.277). \nOverall, the proportion of subjects with at least a 50 % reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency per \n28 days from baseline to the maintenance period was 52.9 % in the lacosamide group compared with \n33.3 % in the placebo group. \nThe quality of life assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory indicated that subjects in both \nlacosamide and placebo groups had a similar and stable health-related quality of life during the entire \ntreatment period. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety (primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures) \n \nThe efficacy of lacosamide as adjunctive therapy in patients 4 years of age and older with idiopathic \ngeneralized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) was established \nin a 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study. The \nstudy consisted of a 12-week historical baseline period, a 4-week prospective baseline period and a 24-\nweek treatment period (which included a 6-week titration period and an 18-week maintenance period). \nEligible patients on a stable dose of 1 to 3 antiepileptic drugs experiencing at least 3 documented \nPGTCS during the 16-week combined baseline period were randomized 1 to 1 to receive lacosamide \nor placebo (patients in the full analysis set: lacosamide n=118, placebo n=121; of them 8 patients in \nthe \u2265 4 to < 12 years age group and 16 patients in the \u2265 12 to < 18 years range were treated with LCM \nand 9 and 16 patients, respectively with placebo).  \nPatients were titrated up to the target maintenance period dose of 12 mg/kg/day in patients weighing \nless than 30 kg, 8 mg/kg/day in patients weighing from 30 to less than 50 kg or 400 mg/day in patients \nweighing 50 kg or more.  \n \n\nEfficacy variable \nParameter \n\nPlacebo \nN=121 \n\nLacosamide \nN=118 \n\nTime to second PGTCS \nMedian (days) 77.0 - \n95 % CI 49.0, 128.0 - \nLacosamide \u2013 Placebo  \nHazard Ratio 0.540 \n95 % CI 0.377, 0.774 \np-value < 0.001 \n\nSeizure freedom   \nStratified Kaplan-Meier estimate (%) 17.2 31.3 \n95 % CI 10.4, 24.0 22.8, 39.9 \nLacosamide \u2013 Placebo 14.1 \n95 % CI 3.2, 25.1 \np-value 0.011 \n\nNote: For the lacosamide group, the median time to second PGTCS could not be estimated by Kaplan-\nMeier methods because \u02c3 50% of patients did not experience a second PGTCS by Day 166. \n \nThe findings in the pediatric subgroup were consistent with the results of the overall population for the \nprimary, secondary and other efficacy endpoints.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \n \nLacosamide is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. The oral bioavailability of \nlacosamide tablets is approximately 100 %. Following oral administration, the plasma concentration of \nunchanged lacosamide increases rapidly and reaches Cmax about 0.5 to 4 hours post-dose. Lacosamide \nUCB tablets and oral syrup are bioequivalent. Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nDistribution \n \nThe volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/kg. Lacosamide is less than 15 % bound to plasma \nproteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \n95 % of the dose is excreted in the urine as lacosamide and metabolites. The metabolism of \nlacosamide has not been completely characterised.  \nThe major compounds excreted in urine are unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40 % of the dose) \nand its O-desmethyl metabolite less than 30 %.  \nA polar fraction proposed to be serine derivatives accounted for approximately 20 % in urine, but was \ndetected only in small amounts (0-2 %) in human plasma of some subjects. Small amounts (0.5-2 %) \nof additional metabolites were found in the urine.  \nIn vitro data show that CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 are capable of catalysing the formation of \nthe O-desmethyl metabolite but the main contributing isoenzyme has not been confirmed in vivo. No \nclinically relevant difference in lacosamide exposure was observed comparing its pharmacokinetics in \nextensive metabolisers (EMs, with a functional CYP2C19) and poor metabolisers (PMs, lacking a \nfunctional CYP2C19). Furthermore an interaction study with omeprazole (CYP2C19-inhibitor) \ndemonstrated no clinically relevant changes in lacosamide plasma concentrations indicating that the \nimportance of this pathway is minor. The plasma concentration of O-desmethyl-lacosamide is \napproximately 15 % of the concentration of lacosamide in plasma. This major metabolite has no \nknown pharmacological activity. \n \nElimination \n \nLacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and \nbiotransformation. After oral and intravenous administration of radiolabeled lacosamide, \napproximately 95 % of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5 % in the \nfaeces. The elimination half-life of lacosamide is approximately 13 hours. The pharmacokinetics is \ndose-proportional and constant over time, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Following twice \ndaily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after a 3 day period. The plasma \nconcentration increases with an accumulation factor of approximately 2. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nGender \n\nClinical studies indicate that gender does not have a clinically significant influence on the plasma \nconcentrations of lacosamide. \n \nRenal impairment \n\nThe AUC of lacosamide was increased by approximately 30 % in mildly and moderately and 60 % in \nseverely renal impaired patients and patients with end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis \ncompared to healthy subjects, whereas Cmax was unaffected.  \nLacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by haemodialysis. Following a 4-hour haemodialysis \ntreatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50 %. Therefore, dosage supplementation \nfollowing haemodialysis is recommended (see section 4.2). The exposure of the O-desmethyl \nmetabolite was several-fold increased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. In \nabsence of haemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease, the levels were increased and \ncontinuously rising during the 24-hour sampling. It is unknown whether the increased metabolite \nexposure in end-stage renal disease subjects could give rise to adverse effects but no pharmacological \nactivity of the metabolite has been identified. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nSubjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of \nlacosamide (approximately 50 % higher AUCnorm). The higher exposure was partly due to a reduced \n\n\n\n33 \n\nrenal function in the studied subjects. The decrease in non-renal clearance in the patients of the study \nwas estimated to give a 20 % increase in the AUC of lacosamide. The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide \nhas not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \n\nIn a study in elderly men and women including 4 patients > 75 years of age, AUC was about 30 and \n50 % increased compared to young men, respectively. This is partly related to lower body weight. The \nbody weight normalized difference is 26 and 23 %, respectively. An increased variability in exposure \nwas also observed. The renal clearance of lacosamide was only slightly reduced in elderly subjects in \nthis study.  \nA general dose reduction is not considered to be necessary unless indicated due to reduced renal \nfunction (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe paediatric pharmacokinetic profile of lacosamide was determined in a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis using sparse plasma concentration data obtained in one placebo-controlled randomised study \nand three open-label studies in 414 children with epilepsy aged 6 months to 17 years. The \nadministered lacosamide doses ranged from 2 to 17.8 mg/kg/day in twice daily intake, with a \nmaximum of 600 mg/day for children weighing 50 kg or more. \nThe typical plasma clearance was estimated to be 1.04 L/h, 1.32 L/h and 1.86 L/h for children \nweighing 20 kg, 30 kg and 50 kg respectively. In comparison, plasma clearance was estimated at \n1.92 L/h in adults (70 kg body weight). \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis using sparse pharmacokinetic samples from PGTCS study \nshowed a similar exposure in patients with PGTCS and in patients with partial-onset seizures. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn the toxicity studies, the plasma concentrations of lacosamide obtained were similar or only \nmarginally higher than those observed in patients, which leaves low or non-existing margins to human \nexposure. \nA safety pharmacology study with intravenous administration of lacosamide in anesthetised dogs \nshowed transient increases in PR interval and QRS complex duration and decreases in blood pressure \nmost likely due to a cardiodepressant action. These transient changes started in the same concentration \nrange as after maximum recommended clinical dosing. In anesthetised dogs and Cynomolgus \nmonkeys, at intravenous doses of 15-60 mg/kg, slowing of atrial and ventricular conductivity, \natrioventricular block and atrioventricular dissociation were seen. \nIn the repeated dose toxicity studies, mild reversible liver changes were observed in rats starting at \nabout 3 times the clinical exposure. These changes included an increased organ weight, hypertrophy of \nhepatocytes, increases in serum concentrations of liver enzymes and increases in total cholesterol and \ntriglycerides. Apart from the hypertrophy of hepatocytes, no other histopathologic changes were \nobserved. \nIn reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rodents and rabbits, no teratogenic effects but an \nincrease in numbers of stillborn pups and pup deaths in the peripartum period, and slightly reduced \nlive litter sizes and pup body weights were observed at maternal toxic doses in rats corresponding to \nsystemic exposure levels similar to the expected clinical exposure. Since higher exposure levels could \nnot be tested in animals due to maternal toxicity, data are insufficient to fully characterise the \nembryofetotoxic and teratogenic potential of lacosamide. \nStudies in rats revealed that lacosamide and/or its metabolites readily crossed the placental barrier. \nIn juvenile rats and dogs, the types of toxicity do not differ qualitatively from those observed in adult \nanimals. In juvenile rats, a reduced body weight was observed at systemic exposure levels similar to \nthe expected clinical exposure. In juvenile dogs, transient and dose-related CNS clinical signs started \nto be observed at systemic exposure levels below the expected clinical exposure. \n \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLacosamide UCB is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or \nwithout secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy.  \n\nLacosamide UCB is indicated as adjunctive therapy \n\u2022 in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, \n\nadolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. \n\u2022 in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults, adolescents and \n\nchildren from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nLacosamide must be taken twice a day (usually once in the morning and once in the evening). \nLacosamide may be taken with or without food. \nIf a dose is missed, the patient should be instructed to take the missed dose immediately, and then to \ntake the next dose of lacosamide at the regularly scheduled time. If the patient notices the missed dose \nwithin 6 hours of the next one, he/she should be instructed to wait to take the next dose of lacosamide \nat the regularly scheduled time. Patients should not take a double dose. \n \nAdolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more, and adults \n\n \nThe following table summarises the recommended posology for adolescents and children weighing \n50 kg or more, and for adults. More details are provided in the table below. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n Monotherapy Adjunctive therapy \nStarting dose \n \n\n100 mg/day or 200 mg/day 100 mg/day \n\nSingle loading dose  \n(if applicable) \n\n200 mg 200 mg \n\nTitration (incremental steps) 50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day) \nat weekly intervals \n\n50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day) \nat weekly intervals \n\nMaximum recommended dose up to 600 mg/day up to 400 mg/day \n \nMonotherapy (in the treatment of partial-onset seizures) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice a day which should be increased to an initial \ntherapeutic dose of 100 mg twice a day after one week. \nLacosamide can also be initiated at the dose of 100 mg twice a day based on the physician's \nassessment of required seizure reduction versus potential side effects. \nDepending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased at weekly \nintervals by 50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day), up to a maximum recommended daily dose of 300 mg \ntwice a day (600 mg/day).  \nIn patients having reached a dose greater than 400 mg/day and who need an additional antiepileptic \nmedicinal product, the posology that is recommended for adjunctive therapy below should be \nfollowed. \n \nAdjunctive therapy (in the treatment of partial-onset seizures or in the treatment of primary \n\ngeneralised tonic-clonic seizures) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice a day which should be increased to an initial \ntherapeutic dose of 100 mg twice a day after one week.  \nDepending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased at weekly \nintervals by 50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day), up to a maximum recommended daily dose of 400 mg \n(200 mg twice a day).  \n \nInitiation of lacosamide treatment with a loading dose (initial monotherapy or conversion to \n\nmonotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of \n\npartial-onset seizures or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic \n\nseizures) \n\nLacosamide treatment may also be initiated with a single loading dose of 200 mg, followed \napproximately 12 hours later by a 100 mg twice a day (200 mg/day) maintenance dose regimen. \nSubsequent dose adjustments should be performed according to individual response and tolerability as \ndescribed above. A loading dose may be initiated in patients in situations when the physician \ndetermines that rapid attainment of lacosamide steady state plasma concentration and therapeutic \neffect is warranted. It should be administered under medical supervision with consideration of the \npotential for increased incidence of serious cardiac arrhythmia and central nervous system adverse \nreactions (see section 4.8). Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in acute conditions \nsuch as status epilepticus. \n \nDiscontinuation \n\nIn accordance with current clinical practice, if lacosamide has to be discontinued, it is recommended \nthis be done gradually (e.g. taper the daily dose by 200 mg/week).  \nIn patients who develop serious cardiac arrhythmia, clinical benefit/risk assessment should be \nperformed and if needed lacosamide should be discontinued. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \n\nNo dose reduction is necessary in elderly patients. Age associated decreased renal clearance with an \nincrease in AUC levels should be considered in elderly patients (see following paragraph \u2018renal \nimpairment\u2019 and section 5.2). There is limited clinical data in the elderly patients with epilepsy, \nparticularly at doses greater than 400 mg/day (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1). \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired adult and paediatric \npatients (CLCR > 30 ml/min). In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with \nmild or moderate renal impairment a loading dose of 200 mg may be considered, but further dose \ntitration (> 200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or \nmore and in adult patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR \u2264 30 ml/min) or with end-stage renal \ndisease, a maximum dose of 250 mg/day is recommended and the dose titration should be performed \nwith caution. If a loading dose is indicated, an initial dose of 100 mg followed by a 50 mg twice daily \nregimen for the first week should be used. In paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with severe \nrenal impairment (CLCR \u2264 30 ml/min) and in those with end-stage renal disease, a reduction of 25 % of \nthe maximum dose is recommended. For all patients requiring haemodialysis a supplement of up to \n50 % of the divided daily dose directly after the end of haemodialysis is recommended. Treatment of \npatients with end-stage renal disease should be made with caution as there is little clinical experience \nand accumulation of a metabolite (with no known pharmacological activity).  \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nA maximum dose of 300 mg/day is recommended for paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and \nfor adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  \nThe dose titration in these patients should be performed with caution considering co-existing renal \nimpairment. In adolescents and adults weighing 50 kg or more, a loading dose of 200 mg may be \nconsidered, but further dose titration (> 200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. Based on \ndata in adults, in paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose should be applied. The pharmacokinetics of \nlacosamide has not been evaluated in severely hepatic impaired patients (see section 5.2). Lacosamide \nshould be administered to adult and paediatric patients with severe hepatic impairment only when the \nexpected therapeutic benefits are anticipated to outweigh the possible risks. The dose may need to be \nadjusted while carefully observing disease activity and potential side effects in the patient. \n \nPaediatric population \n \n\nThe physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and \ndose.  \n \nAdolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more \n\nDosage in adolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more is the same as in adults (see above). \n \nChildren (from 4 years of age) and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg \n\nThe dose is determined based on body weight. It is therefore recommended to initiate treatment with \nthe syrup and switch to tablets, if desired. When prescribing the syrup the dose should be expressed in \nvolume (ml) rather than weight (mg). \n \n\nMonotherapy (in the treatment of partial-onset seizures) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 2 mg/kg/day which should be increased to an initial therapeutic \ndose of 4 mg/kg/day after one week. \nDepending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased by 2 mg/kg/day \nevery week.

Use of a loading dose is not \nrecommended in adolescents and children weighing less than 50 kg. \n \nChildren less than 4 years \n\nThe safety and efficacy of lacosamide in children aged below 4 years have not yet been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nLacosamide syrup must be taken orally.  \n \nThe bottle containing Lacosamide UCB syrup should be shaken well before use. Lacosamide may be \ntaken with or without food. \nLacosamide syrup is provided with a measuring cup with graduation marks (for patients weighing \n50 kg or more) and with an oral syringe with an adaptor (for patients weighing less than 50 kg).  \n \nMeasuring cup (for adolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more, and adults) \nEach graduation mark (5 ml) of the measuring cup corresponds to 50 mg lacosamide.  \n \nDosing oral syringe (10 ml graduated every 0.25 ml) with an adaptor (for children and adolescents \n\nfrom 4 years of age weighing less than 50 kg) \nOne full oral syringe (10 ml) corresponds to 100 mg of lacosamide. The minimum extractable volume \nis 1 ml which is 10 mg of lacosamide. As from the 1 ml graduation mark, each graduation corresponds \nto 0.25 ml which is 2.5 mg of lacosamide. \n \nInstructions for use are provided in the package leaflet.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nKnown second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled studies of \nantiepileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and \nbehaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the \npossibility of an increased risk for lacosamide. \nTherefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate \ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical \n\n\n\n42 \n\nadvice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge (see section 4.8). \n \nCardiac rhythm and conduction \n \nDose-related prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies. \nLacosamide should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as \npatients with known cardiac conduction problems or severe cardiac disease (e.g. myocardial \nischaemia/infarction, heart failure, structural heart disease or cardiac sodium channelopathies) or \npatients treated with medicinal products affecting cardiac conduction, including antiarrhythmics and \nsodium channel blocking antiepileptic medicinal products (see section 4.5), as well as in elderly \npatients. \nIn these patients it should be considered to perform an ECG before a lacosamide dose increase above \n400 mg/day and after lacosamide is titrated to steady-state. \n \nIn the placebo-controlled studies of lacosamide in epilepsy patients, atrial fibrillation or flutter were \nnot reported; however, both have been reported in open-label epilepsy studies and in post-marketing \nexperience. \n \nIn post-marketing experience, AV block (including second degree or higher AV block) has been \nreported. In patients with proarrhythmic conditions, ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been reported. In \nrare cases, these events have led to asystole, cardiac arrest and death in patients with underlying \nproarrhythmic conditions. \n \nPatients should be made aware of the symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. slow, rapid or irregular \npulse, palpitations, shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded, fainting). Patients should be counselled to \nseek immediate medical advice if these symptoms occur. \n \nDizziness \n \nTreatment with lacosamide has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of \naccidental injury or falls. Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are \nfamiliar with the potential effects of the medicine (see section 4.8). \n \nPotential for new onset or worsening of myoclonic seizures \n \nNew onset or worsening of myoclonic seizures has been reported in both adult and paediatric patients \nwith PGTCS, in particular during titration. In patients with more than one seizure type, the observed \nbenefit of control for one seizure type should be weighed against any observed worsening in another \nseizure type. \n \nPotential for electro-clinical worsening in specific paediatric epilepsy syndromes \n \nThe safety and efficacy of lacosamide in paediatric patients with epilepsy syndromes in which focal \nand generalised seizures may coexist have not been determined. \n \nExcipients \n \nExcipients which may cause intolerance \nLacosamide UCB syrup contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219), which may cause \nallergic reactions (possibly delayed). \nLacosamide UCB syrup contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take this medicine. Sorbitol may cause gastrointestinal discomfort and mild \nlaxative effect. \nLacosamide UCB syrup contains aspartame (E951), a source of phenylalanine, which may be harmful \nfor people with phenylketonuria.  \nLacosamide UCB syrup contains propylene glycol (E1520). \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nSodium content \n\nLacosamide UCB syrup contains 1.42 mg sodium per ml, equivalent to 0.07 % of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nLacosamide should be used with caution in patients treated with medicinal products known to be \nassociated with PR prolongation (including sodium channel blocking antiepileptic medicinal products) \nand in patients treated with antiarrhythmics. However, subgroup analysis in clinical studies did not \nidentify an increased magnitude of PR prolongation in patients with concomitant administration of \ncarbamazepine or lamotrigine. \n \n\nIn vitro data \n \nData generally suggest that lacosamide has a low interaction potential. In vitro studies indicate that the \nenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9 are not induced and that CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, \nCYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 are not inhibited by lacosamide at plasma \nconcentrations observed in clinical studies. An in vitro study indicated that lacosamide is not \ntransported by P-glycoprotein in the intestine. In vitro data show that CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and \nCYP3A4 are capable of catalysing the formation of the O-desmethyl metabolite. \n \n\nIn vivo data \n \nLacosamide does not inhibit or induce CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 to a clinically relevant extent. \nLacosamide did not affect the AUC of midazolam (metabolised by CYP3A4, lacosamide given \n200 mg twice a day) but Cmax of midazolam was slightly increased (30 %). Lacosamide did not affect \nthe pharmacokinetics of omeprazole (metabolised by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, lacosamide given \n300 mg twice a day).  \nThe CYP2C19 inhibitor omeprazole (40 mg once daily) did not give rise to a clinically significant \nchange in lacosamide exposure. Thus, moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 are unlikely to affect systemic \nlacosamide exposure to a clinically relevant extent. \nCaution is recommended in concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP2C9 (e.g. \nfluconazole) and CYP3A4 (e.g. itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin), which may lead \nto increased systemic exposure of lacosamide. Such interactions have not been established in vivo but \nare possible based on in vitro data. \n \nStrong enzyme inducers such as rifampicin or St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) may \nmoderately reduce the systemic exposure of lacosamide. Therefore, starting or ending treatment with \nthese enzyme inducers should be done with caution. \n \nAntiepileptic medicinal products \n \nIn interaction studies lacosamide did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of \ncarbamazepine and valproic acid. Lacosamide plasma concentrations were not affected by \ncarbamazepine and by valproic acid. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in different age groups \nestimated that concomitant treatment with other antiepileptic medicinal products known to be enzyme \ninducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, in various doses) decreased the overall systemic \nexposure of lacosamide by 25 % in adults and 17 % in paediatric patients.  \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nIn an interaction study there was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and the oral \ncontraceptives ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Progesterone concentrations were not affected \nwhen the medicinal products were co-administered. \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nOthers \n \nInteraction studies showed that lacosamide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. There \nwas no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and metformin.  \nCo-administration of warfarin with lacosamide does not result in a clinically relevant change in the \npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin. \nAlthough no pharmacokinetic data on the interaction of lacosamide with alcohol are available, a \npharmacodynamic effect cannot be excluded. \nLacosamide has a low protein binding of less than 15 %. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions \nwith other medicinal products through competition for protein binding sites are considered unlikely. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n \nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general  \n\nFor all antiepileptic medicinal products, it has been shown that in the offspring of treated women with \nepilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately \n3 % in the general population. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted \nwith polytherapy, however, the extent to which the treatment and/or the illness is responsible has not \nbeen elucidated. \nMoreover, effective antiepileptic therapy must not be interrupted, since the aggravation of the illness is \ndetrimental to both the mother and the foetus. \n \nRisk related to lacosamide \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of lacosamide in pregnant women. Studies in animals did not \nindicate any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but embryotoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits \nat maternal toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nLacosamide should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the benefit to the mother \nclearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). If women decide to become pregnant, the use of this \nproduct should be carefully re-evaluated. \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is unknown whether lacosamide is excreted in human breast milk. A risk to the newborns/infants \ncannot be excluded. Animal studies have shown excretion of lacosamide in breast milk. For \nprecautionary measures, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with lacosamide. \n \nFertility \n \nNo adverse reactions on male or female fertility or reproduction were observed in rats at doses \nproducing plasma exposures (AUC) up to approximately 2 times the plasma AUC in humans at the \nmaximum recommended human dose (MRHD). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLacosamide has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Lacosamide \ntreatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision.  \nAccordingly, patients should be advised not to drive or to operate other potentially hazardous \nmachinery until they are familiar with the effects of lacosamide on their ability to perform such \nactivities. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nBased on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in \n\n\n\n45 \n\n1,308 patients with partial-onset seizures, a total of 61.9 % of patients randomised to lacosamide and \n35.2 % of patients randomised to placebo reported at least 1 adverse reaction. The most frequently \nreported adverse reactions (\u2265 10 %) with lacosamide treatment were dizziness, headache, nausea and \ndiplopia. They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Some were dose-related and could be \nalleviated by reducing the dose. Incidence and severity of central nervous system (CNS) and \ngastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time. \nIn all of these controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12.2 % for \npatients randomised to lacosamide and 1.6 % for patients randomised to placebo. The most common \nadverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy was dizziness.  \nIncidence of CNS adverse reactions such as dizziness may be higher after a loading dose. \n \nBased on the analysis of data from a non-inferiority monotherapy clinical study comparing lacosamide \nto carbamazepine controlled release (CR), the most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u2265 10 %) for \nlacosamide were headache and dizziness. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was \n10.6 % for patients treated with lacosamide and 15.6 % for patients treated with carbamazepine CR.  \n \nThe safety profile of lacosamide reported in a study conducted in patients aged 4 years and older with \nidiopathic generalised epilepsy with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) was consistent \nwith the safety profile reported from the pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies in partial-onset \nseizures. Additional adverse reactions reported in PGTCS patients were myoclonic epilepsy (2.5 % in \nthe lacosamide-group and 0 % in the placebo-group) and ataxia (3.3 % in the lacosamide-group and \n0 % in the placebo-group). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were dizziness and \nsomnolence. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy \nwere dizziness and suicidal ideation. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 9.1 % in \nthe lacosamide group and 4.1 % in the placebo group. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe table below shows the frequencies of adverse reactions which have been reported in clinical \nstudies and post-marketing experience. The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10), \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and not known (frequency cannot be \nestimated from available data).

Adverse reactions \nassociated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. atrioventricular block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.  \nIn adjunctive clinical studies in epilepsy patients, the incidence rate of reported first-degree AV Block \nis uncommon, 0.7 %, 0 %, 0.5 % and 0 % for lacosamide 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo, \nrespectively. No second- or higher degree AV Block was seen in these studies. However, cases with \nsecond- and third-degree AV Block associated with lacosamide treatment have been reported in post-\nmarketing experience. In the monotherapy clinical study comparing lacosamide to carbamazepine CR, \nthe extent of increase in PR interval was comparable between lacosamide and carbamazepine. \nThe incidence rate for syncope reported in pooled adjunctive therapy clinical studies is uncommon and \ndid not differ between lacosamide (n=944) treated epilepsy patients (0.1 %) and placebo (n=364) \ntreated epilepsy patients (0.3 %). In the monotherapy clinical study comparing lacosamide to \ncarbamazepine CR, syncope was reported in 7/444 (1.6 %) lacosamide patients and in 1/442 (0.2 %) \ncarbamazepine CR patients. \nAtrial fibrillation or flutter were not reported in short term clinical studies; however, both have been \nreported in open-label epilepsy studies and in post-marketing experience. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n\nAbnormalities in liver function tests have been observed in placebo-controlled studies with lacosamide \nin adult patients with partial-onset seizures who were taking 1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts. Elevations of ALT to \u2265 3x ULN occurred in 0.7 % (7/935) of Lacosamide UCB patients and \n0 % (0/356) of placebo patients. \n \nMultiorgan hypersensitivity reactions \n\nMultiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic \nSymptoms, DRESS) have been reported in patients treated with some antiepileptic medicinal products. \nThese reactions are variable in expression but typically present with fever and rash and can be \nassociated with involvement of different organ systems. If multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction is \nsuspected, lacosamide should be discontinued. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety profile of lacosamide in placebo-controlled (see study details in section 5.1) and in open-\nlabel studies (n=408) in adjunctive therapy in children from 4 years of age with partial-onset seizures \nwas consistent with the safety profile observed in adults although the frequency of some adverse \nreactions (somnolence, vomiting and convulsion) was increased and additional adverse reactions \n(nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, pharyngitis, decreased appetite, lethargy and abnormal behaviour) have \nbeen reported in paediatric patients: nasopharyngitis (15.7 %), vomiting (14.7 %), somnolence \n(14.0 %), dizziness (13.5 %), pyrexia (13.0 %), convulsion (7.8 %), decreased appetite (5.9 %), \npharyngitis (4.7 %), lethargy (2.7 %) and abnormal behaviour (1.7 %). \nA total of 67.8 % of patients randomised to lacosamide and 58.1 % of patients randomised to placebo \nreported at least 1 adverse reaction. \nBehavioural, cognition and emotional functioning were measured by the questionnaires Achenbach \nCBCL and BRIEF that were applied at baseline and throughout the studies and were mainly stable \nduring the course of the studies. \n \nElderly population  \n \nIn the monotherapy study comparing lacosamide to carbamazepine CR, the types of adverse reactions \nrelated to lacosamide in elderly patients (\u2265 65 years of age) appear to be similar to that observed in \npatients less than 65 years of age. However, a higher incidence (\u2265 5 % difference) of fall, diarrhoea \nand tremor has been reported in elderly patients compared to younger adult patients. The most \nfrequent cardiac-related adverse reaction reported in elderly compared to the younger adult population \nwas first-degree AV block. This was reported with lacosamide in 4.8 % (3/62) in elderly patients \nversus 1.6 % (6/382) in younger adult patients. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events \nobserved with lacosamide was 21.0 % (13/62) in elderly patients versus 9.2 % (35/382) in younger \n\n\n\n48 \n\nadult patients. These differences between elderly and younger adult patients were similar to those \nobserved in the active comparator group.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nSymptoms observed after an accidental or intentional overdose of lacosamide are primarily associated \nwith CNS and gastrointestinal system. \n\n\uf0b7 The types of adverse reactions experienced by patients exposed to doses above 400 mg up to \n800 mg were not clinically different from those of patients administered recommended doses \nof lacosamide. \n\n\uf0b7 Reactions reported after an intake of more than 800 mg are dizziness, nausea, vomiting, \nseizures (generalised tonic-clonic seizures, status epilepticus). Cardiac conduction disorders, \nshock and coma have also been observed. Fatalities have been reported in patients following \nan intake of acute single overdose of several grams of lacosamide. \n\n \nManagement \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with lacosamide. Treatment of lacosamide overdose should \ninclude general supportive measures and may include haemodialysis if necessary (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX18  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe active substance, lacosamide (R-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide) is a \nfunctionalised amino acid. \nThe precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effect in humans remains to be \nfully elucidated. In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances \nslow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable \nneuronal membranes. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nLacosamide protected against seizures in a broad range of animal models of partial and primary \ngeneralised seizures and delayed kindling development.  \nIn non-clinical experiments lacosamide in combination with levetiracetam, carbamazepine, phenytoin, \nvalproate, lamotrigine, topiramate or gabapentin showed synergistic or additive anticonvulsant effects. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n49 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety (partial-onset seizures) \nAdult population \n \n\nMonotherapy \n\nEfficacy of lacosamide as monotherapy was established in a double-blind, parallel group, non-\ninferiority comparison to carbamazepine CR in 886 patients 16 years of age or older with newly or \nrecently diagnosed epilepsy. The patients had to present with unprovoked partial-onset seizures with \nor without secondary generalisation. The patients were randomised to carbamazepine CR or \nlacosamide, provided as tablets, in a 1:1 ratio. The dose was based on dose-response and ranged from \n400 to 1,200 mg/day for carbamazepine CR and from 200 to 600 mg/day for lacosamide. The duration \nof the treatment was up to 121 weeks depending on the response. \nThe estimated 6-month seizure freedom rates were 89.8 % for lacosamide-treated patients and 91.1 % \nfor carbamazepine CR treated patients using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis method. The adjusted \nabsolute difference between treatments was -1.3 % (95 % CI: -5.5, 2.8). The Kaplan-Meier estimates \nof 12-month seizure freedom rates were 77.8 % for lacosamide-treated patients and 82.7 % for \ncarbamazepine CR treated patients. \nThe 6-month seizure freedom rates in elderly patients of 65 and above (62 patients in lacosamide, \n57 patients in carbamazepine CR) were similar between both treatment groups. The rates were also \nsimilar to those observed in the overall population. In the elderly population, the maintenance \nlacosamide dose was 200 mg/day in 55 patients (88.7 %), 400 mg/day in 6 patients (9.7 %) and the \ndose was escalated to over 400 mg/day in 1 patient (1.6 %). \n \nConversion to monotherapy \n\nThe efficacy and safety of lacosamide in conversion to monotherapy has been assessed in a historical-\ncontrolled, multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial. In this study, 425 patients aged 16 to 70 years \nwith uncontrolled partial-onset seizures taking stable doses of 1 or 2 marketed antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts were randomised to be converted to lacosamide monotherapy (either 400 mg/day or \n300 mg/day in a 3:1 ratio). In treated patients who completed titration and started withdrawing \nantiepileptic medicinal products (284 and 99 respectively), monotherapy was maintained in 71.5 % \nand 70.7 % of patients respectively for 57-105 days (median 71 days), over the targeted observation \nperiod of 70 days. \n \nAdjunctive therapy \n\nThe efficacy of lacosamide as adjunctive therapy at recommended doses (200 mg/day, 400 mg/day) \nwas established in 3 multicenter, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical studies with a 12-week \nmaintenance period. Lacosamide 600 mg/day was also shown to be effective in controlled adjunctive \ntherapy studies, although the efficacy was similar to 400 mg/day and patients were less likely to \ntolerate this dose because of CNS- and gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions. Thus, the \n600 mg/day dose is not recommended. The maximum recommended dose is 400 mg/day. These \nstudies, involving 1,308 patients with a history of an average of 23 years of partial-onset seizures, \nwere designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lacosamide when administered concomitantly \nwith 1-3 antiepileptic medicinal products in patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures with or \nwithout secondary generalisation. Overall the proportion of subjects with a 50 % reduction in seizure \nfrequency was 23 %, 34 %, and 40 % for placebo, lacosamide 200 mg/day and lacosamide \n400 mg/day. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics and safety of a single loading dose of intravenous lacosamide were determined \nin a multicenter, open-label study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of rapid initiation of \nlacosamide using a single intravenous loading dose (including 200 mg) followed by twice daily oral \ndosing (equivalent to the intravenous dose) as adjunctive therapy in adult subjects 16 to 60 years of \nage with partial-onset seizures.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPartial-onset seizures have a similar clinical expression in children from 4 years of age and in adults. \nThe efficacy of lacosamide in children aged 4 years and older has been extrapolated from data of \nadolescents and adults with partial-onset seizures, for whom a similar response was expected provided \n\n\n\n50 \n\nthe paediatric dose adaptations are established (see section 4.2) and safety has been demonstrated (see \nsection 4.8). \nThe efficacy supported by the extrapolation principle stated above was confirmed by a double-blind, \nrandomised, placebo-controlled study. The study consisted of an 8-week baseline period followed by a \n6-week titration period. Eligible patients on a stable dose regimen of 1 to \u2264 3 antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts, who still experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 4 weeks prior to screening \nwith seizure-free phase no longer than 21 days in the 8-week period prior to entry into the baseline \nperiod, were randomised to receive either placebo (n=172) or lacosamide (n=171).  \nDosing was initiated at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day in subjects weighing less than 50 kg or 100 mg/day in \nsubjects weighing 50 kg or more in 2 divided doses. During the titration period, lacosamide doses \nwere adjusted in 1or 2 mg/kg/day increments in subjects weighing less than 50 kg or 50 or 100 mg/day \nin subjects weighing 50 kg or more at weekly intervals to achieve the target maintenance period dose \nrange. \nSubjects must have achieved the minimum target dose for their body weight category for the final \n3 days of the titration period to be eligible for entry into the 10-week maintenance period. Subjects \nwere to remain on stable lacosamide dose throughout the maintenance period or were withdrawn and \nentered in the blinded taper period. \nStatistically significant (p=0.0003) and clinically relevant reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency \nper 28 days from baseline to the maintenance period was observed between the lacosamide and the \nplacebo group. The percent reduction over placebo based on analysis of covariance was 31.72 % \n(95 % CI: 16.342, 44.277). \nOverall, the proportion of subjects with at least a 50 % reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency per \n28 days from baseline to the maintenance period was 52.9 % in the lacosamide group compared with \n33.3 % in the placebo group. \nThe quality of life assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory indicated that subjects in both \nlacosamide and placebo groups had a similar and stable health-related quality of life during the entire \ntreatment period. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety (primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures) \n \nThe efficacy of lacosamide as adjunctive therapy in patients 4 years of age and older with idiopathic \ngeneralized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) was established \nin a 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study. The \nstudy consisted of a 12-week historical baseline period, a 4-week prospective baseline period and a 24-\nweek treatment period (which included a 6-week titration period and an 18-week maintenance period). \nEligible patients on a stable dose of 1 to 3 antiepileptic drugs experiencing at least 3 documented \nPGTCS during the 16-week combined baseline period were randomized 1 to 1 to receive lacosamide \nor placebo (patients in the full analysis set: lacosamide n=118, placebo n=121; of them 8 patients in \nthe \u2265 4 to < 12 years age group and 16 patients in the \u2265 12 to < 18 years range were treated with LCM \nand 9 and 16 patients, respectively with placebo).  \nPatients were titrated up to the target maintenance period dose of 12 mg/kg/day in patients weighing \nless than 30 kg, 8 mg/kg/day in patients weighing from 30 to less than 50 kg or 400 mg/day in patients \nweighing 50 kg or more.  \n \n\nEfficacy variable \nParameter \n\nPlacebo \nN=121 \n\nLacosamide \nN=118 \n\nTime to second PGTCS \nMedian (days) 77.0 - \n95 % CI 49.0, 128.0 - \nLacosamide \u2013 Placebo  \nHazard Ratio 0.540 \n95 % CI 0.377, 0.774 \np-value < 0.001 \n\nSeizure freedom   \nStratified Kaplan-Meier estimate (%) 17.2 31.3 \n95 % CI 10.4, 24.0 22.8, 39.9 \nLacosamide \u2013 Placebo 14.1 \n\n\n\n51 \n\nEfficacy variable \nParameter \n\nPlacebo \nN=121 \n\nLacosamide \nN=118 \n\n95 % CI 3.2, 25.1 \np-value 0.011 \n\nNote: For the lacosamide group, the median time to second PGTCS could not be estimated by Kaplan-\nMeier methods because \u02c3 50% of patients did not experience a second PGTCS by Day 166. \n \nThe findings in the pediatric subgroup were consistent with the results of the overall population for the \nprimary, secondary and other efficacy endpoints.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \n \nLacosamide is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. The oral bioavailability of \nlacosamide tablets is approximately 100 %. Following oral administration, the plasma concentration of \nunchanged lacosamide increases rapidly and reaches Cmax about 0.5 to 4 hours post-dose. Lacosamide \nUCB tablets and syrup are bioequivalent. Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/kg. Lacosamide is less than 15 % bound to plasma \nproteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \n95 % of the dose is excreted in the urine as lacosamide and metabolites. The metabolism of \nlacosamide has not been completely characterised.  \nThe major compounds excreted in urine are unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40 % of the dose) \nand its O-desmethyl metabolite less than 30 %.  \nA polar fraction proposed to be serine derivatives accounted for approximately 20 % in urine, but was \ndetected only in small amounts (0-2 %) in human plasma of some subjects. Small amounts (0.5-2 %) \nof additional metabolites were found in the urine.  \nIn vitro data show that CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 are capable of catalysing the formation of \nthe O-desmethyl metabolite but the main contributing isoenzyme has not been confirmed in vivo. No \nclinically relevant difference in lacosamide exposure was observed comparing its pharmacokinetics in \nextensive metabolisers (EMs, with a functional CYP2C19) and poor metabolisers (PMs, lacking a \nfunctional CYP2C19). Furthermore an interaction study with omeprazole (CYP2C19-inhibitor) \ndemonstrated no clinically relevant changes in lacosamide plasma concentrations indicating that the \nimportance of this pathway is minor. The plasma concentration of O-desmethyl-lacosamide is \napproximately 15 % of the concentration of lacosamide in plasma. This major metabolite has no \nknown pharmacological activity. \n \nElimination \n \nLacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and \nbiotransformation. After oral and intravenous administration of radiolabeled lacosamide, \napproximately 95 % of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5 % in the \nfaeces. The elimination half-life of lacosamide is approximately 13 hours. The pharmacokinetics is \ndose-proportional and constant over time, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Following twice \ndaily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after a 3 day period. The plasma \nconcentration increases with an accumulation factor of approximately 2. \n \nA single loading dose of 200 mg approximates steady-state concentrations comparable to 100 mg \ntwice daily oral administration. \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nGender \n\nClinical studies indicate that gender does not have a clinically significant influence on the plasma \nconcentrations of lacosamide. \n \nRenal impairment \n\nThe AUC of lacosamide was increased by approximately 30 % in mildly and moderately and 60 % in \nseverely renal impaired patients and patients with end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis \ncompared to healthy subjects, whereas Cmax was unaffected.  \nLacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by haemodialysis. Following a 4-hour haemodialysis \ntreatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50 %. Therefore, dosage supplementation \nfollowing haemodialysis is recommended (see section 4.2). The exposure of the O-desmethyl \nmetabolite was several-fold increased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. In \nabsence of haemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease, the levels were increased and \ncontinuously rising during the 24-hour sampling. It is unknown whether the increased metabolite \nexposure in end-stage renal disease subjects could give rise to adverse effects but no pharmacological \nactivity of the metabolite has been identified. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nSubjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of \nlacosamide (approximately 50 % higher AUCnorm). The higher exposure was partly due to a reduced \nrenal function in the studied subjects. The decrease in non-renal clearance in the patients of the study \nwas estimated to give a 20 % increase in the AUC of lacosamide. The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide \nhas not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \n\nIn a study in elderly men and women including 4 patients > 75 years of age, AUC was about 30 and \n50 % increased compared to young men, respectively. This is partly related to lower body weight. The \nbody weight normalized difference is 26 and 23 %, respectively. An increased variability in exposure \nwas also observed. The renal clearance of lacosamide was only slightly reduced in elderly subjects in \nthis study.  \nA general dose reduction is not considered to be necessary unless indicated due to reduced renal \nfunction (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe paediatric pharmacokinetic profile of lacosamide was determined in a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis using sparse plasma concentration data obtained in one placebo-controlled randomised study \nand three open-label studies in 414 children with epilepsy aged 6 months to 17 years. The \nadministered lacosamide doses ranged from 2 to 17.8 mg/kg/day in twice daily intake, with a \nmaximum of 600 mg/day for children weighing 50 kg or more. \nThe typical plasma clearance was estimated to be 1.04 L/h, 1.32 L/h and 1.86 L/h for children \nweighing 20 kg, 30 kg and 50 kg respectively. In comparison, plasma clearance was estimated at \n1.92 L/h in adults (70 kg body weight). \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis using sparse pharmacokinetic samples from PGTCS study \nshowed a similar exposure in patients with PGTCS and in patients with partial-onset seizures. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn the toxicity studies, the plasma concentrations of lacosamide obtained were similar or only \nmarginally higher than those observed in patients, which leaves low or non-existing margins to human \nexposure. \nA safety pharmacology study with intravenous administration of lacosamide in anesthetised dogs \nshowed transient increases in PR interval and QRS complex duration and decreases in blood pressure \nmost likely due to a cardiodepressant action. These transient changes started in the same concentration \nrange as after maximum recommended clinical dosing. In anesthetised dogs and Cynomolgus \n\n\n\n53 \n\nmonkeys, at intravenous doses of 15-60 mg/kg, slowing of atrial and ventricular conductivity, \natrioventricular block and atrioventricular dissociation were seen. \nIn the repeated dose toxicity studies, mild reversible liver changes were observed in rats starting at \nabout 3 times the clinical exposure. These changes included an increased organ weight, hypertrophy of \nhepatocytes, increases in serum concentrations of liver enzymes and increases in total cholesterol and \ntriglycerides. Apart from the hypertrophy of hepatocytes, no other histopathologic changes were \nobserved. \nIn reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rodents and rabbits, no teratogenic effects but an \nincrease in numbers of stillborn pups and pup deaths in the peripartum period, and slightly reduced \nlive litter sizes and pup body weights were observed at maternal toxic doses in rats corresponding to \nsystemic exposure levels similar to the expected clinical exposure. Since higher exposure levels could \nnot be tested in animals due to maternal toxicity, data are insufficient to fully characterise the \nembryofetotoxic and teratogenic potential of lacosamide. \nStudies in rats revealed that lacosamide and/or its metabolites readily crossed the placental barrier. \nIn juvenile rats and dogs, the types of toxicity do not differ qualitatively from those observed in adult \nanimals. In juvenile rats, a reduced body weight was observed at systemic exposure levels similar to \nthe expected clinical exposure. In juvenile dogs, transient and dose-related CNS clinical signs started \nto be observed at systemic exposure levels below the expected clinical exposure. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLacosamide UCB is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or \nwithout secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy.  \n\nLacosamide UCB is indicated as adjunctive therapy \n\u2022 in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, \n\nadolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. \n\u2022 in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults, adolescents and \n\nchildren from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nLacosamide therapy can be initiated with either oral or intravenous administration. Solution for \ninfusion is an alternative for patients when oral administration is temporarily not feasible. The overall \nduration of treatment with intravenous lacosamide is at the physician\u2019s discretion; there is experience \nfrom clinical studies with twice daily infusions of lacosamide for up to 5 days in adjunctive therapy. \nConversion to or from oral and intravenous administration can be done directly without titration. The \ntotal daily dose and twice daily administration should be maintained. Monitor closely patients with \nknown cardiac conduction problems, on concomitant medications that prolong PR interval, or with \nsevere cardiac disease (e.g. myocardial ischemia, heart failure) when lacosamide dose is higher than \n400 mg/day (see Method of administration below and section 4.4). \nLacosamide must be taken twice a day (usually once in the morning and once in the evening). \n \n\n\n\n56 \n\nAdolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more, and adults \n\n \nThe following table summarises the recommended posology for adolescents and children weighing \n50 kg or more, and for adults. More details are provided in the table below. \n Monotherapy Adjunctive therapy \nStarting dose \n \n\n100 mg/day or 200 mg/day 100 mg/day \n\nSingle loading dose  \n(if applicable) \n\n200 mg 200 mg \n\nTitration (incremental steps) 50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day) \nat weekly intervals \n\n50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day) \nat weekly intervals \n\nMaximum recommended dose up to 600 mg/day up to 400 mg/day \n \nMonotherapy (in the treatment of partial-onset seizures) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice a day which should be increased to an initial \ntherapeutic dose of 100 mg twice a day after one week. \nLacosamide can also be initiated at the dose of 100 mg twice a day based on the physician's \nassessment of required seizure reduction versus potential side effects. \nDepending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased at weekly \nintervals by 50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day), up to a maximum recommended daily dose of 300 mg \ntwice a day (600 mg/day).  \nIn patients having reached a dose greater than 400 mg/day and who need an additional antiepileptic \nmedicinal product, the posology that is recommended for adjunctive therapy below should be \nfollowed. \n \nAdjunctive therapy (in the treatment of partial-onset seizures or in the treatment of primary \n\ngeneralised tonic-clonic seizures) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice a day which should be increased to an initial \ntherapeutic dose of 100 mg twice a day after one week.  \nDepending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased at weekly \nintervals by 50 mg twice a day (100 mg/day), up to a maximum recommended daily dose of 400 mg \n(200 mg twice a day).  \n \nInitiation of lacosamide treatment with a loading dose (initial monotherapy or conversion to \n\nmonotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of \n\npartial-onset seizures or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic \n\nseizures) \n\nLacosamide treatment may also be initiated with a single loading dose of 200 mg, followed \napproximately 12 hours later by a 100 mg twice a day (200 mg/day) maintenance dose regimen. \nSubsequent dose adjustments should be performed according to individual response and tolerability as \ndescribed above. A loading dose may be initiated in patients in situations when the physician \ndetermines that rapid attainment of lacosamide steady state plasma concentration and therapeutic \neffect is warranted. It should be administered under medical supervision with consideration of the \npotential for increased incidence of serious cardiac arrhythmia and central nervous system adverse \nreactions (see section 4.8). Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in acute conditions \nsuch as status epilepticus. \n \n\nDiscontinuation \n\nIn accordance with current clinical practice, if lacosamide has to be discontinued, it is recommended \nthis be done gradually (e.g. taper the daily dose by 200 mg/week).  \nIn patients who develop serious cardiac arrhythmia, clinical benefit/risk assessment should be \nperformed and if needed lacosamide should be discontinued. \n \n\n\n\n57 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \n\nNo dose reduction is necessary in elderly patients. Age associated decreased renal clearance with an \nincrease in AUC levels should be considered in elderly patients (see following paragraph \u2018renal \nimpairment\u2019 and section 5.2). There is limited clinical data in the elderly patients with epilepsy, \nparticularly at doses greater than 400 mg/day (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1). \n \nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired adult and paediatric \npatients (CLCR > 30 ml/min). In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with \nmild or moderate renal impairment a loading dose of 200 mg may be considered, but further dose \ntitration (> 200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or \nmore and in adult patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR \u2264 30 ml/min) or with end-stage renal \ndisease, a maximum dose of 250 mg/day is recommended and the dose titration should be performed \nwith caution. If a loading dose is indicated, an initial dose of 100 mg followed by a 50 mg twice daily \nregimen for the first week should be used. In paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with severe \nrenal impairment (CLCR \u2264 30 ml/min) and in those with end-stage renal disease, a reduction of 25 % of \nthe maximum dose is recommended. For all patients requiring haemodialysis a supplement of up to \n50 % of the divided daily dose directly after the end of haemodialysis is recommended. Treatment of \npatients with end-stage renal disease should be made with caution as there is little clinical experience \nand accumulation of a metabolite (with no known pharmacological activity).  \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nA maximum dose of 300 mg/day is recommended for paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and \nfor adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  \nThe dose titration in these patients should be performed with caution considering co-existing renal \nimpairment. In adolescents and adults weighing 50 kg or more, a loading dose of 200 mg may be \nconsidered, but further dose titration (> 200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. Based on \ndata in adults, in paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose should be applied. The pharmacokinetics of \nlacosamide has not been evaluated in severely hepatic impaired patients (see section 5.2). Lacosamide \nshould be administered to adult and paediatric patients with severe hepatic impairment only when the \nexpected therapeutic benefits are anticipated to outweigh the possible risks. The dose may need to be \nadjusted while carefully observing disease activity and potential side effects in the patient. \n \nPaediatric population \n \n\nThe physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and \ndose. \n \nAdolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more  \n\nDosage in adolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more is the same as in adults (see above). \n \nChildren (from 4 years of age) and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg \n\n \n\nMonotherapy (in the treatment of partial-onset seizures) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 2 mg/kg/day which should be increased to an initial therapeutic \ndose of 4 mg/kg/day after one week. \nDepending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased by 2 mg/kg/day \nevery week. The dose should be gradually increased until the optimum response is obtained. In \nchildren weighing less than 40 kg, a maximum dose of up to 12 mg/kg/day is recommended. In \nchildren weighing from 40 to under 50 kg, a maximum dose of 10 mg/kg/day is recommended. \n \n\n\n\n58 \n\nThe following table below summarises the recommended posology in monotherapy for children and \nadolescents weighing less than 50 kg. \n\nStarting dose \n \n\n2 mg/kg/day  \n\nSingle loading dose  Not recommended \nTitration (incremental steps) 2 mg/kg/day every week \nMaximum recommended dose in patients < 40 kg up to 12 mg/kg/day \nMaximum recommended dose in patients \u2265 40 kg \nto < 50 kg \n\nup to 10 mg/kg/day \n\n \nThe tables below provide examples of volumes of solution for infusion per administration depending \non prescribed dose and body weight.

A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled studies of \nantiepileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and \nbehaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the \npossibility of an increased risk for lacosamide. \nTherefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate \ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical \nadvice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge (see section 4.8). \n \nCardiac rhythm and conduction \n \nDose-related prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies. \nLacosamide should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as \npatients with known cardiac conduction problems or severe cardiac disease (e.g. myocardial \nischaemia/infarction, heart failure, structural heart disease or cardiac sodium channelopathies) or \npatients treated with medicinal products affecting cardiac conduction, including antiarrhythmics and \n\n\n\n61 \n\nsodium channel blocking antiepileptic medicinal products (see section 4.5), as well as in elderly \npatients. \nIn these patients it should be considered to perform an ECG before a lacosamide dose increase above \n400 mg/day and after lacosamide is titrated to steady-state. \n \nIn the placebo-controlled studies of lacosamide in epilepsy patients, atrial fibrillation or flutter were \nnot reported; however, both have been reported in open-label epilepsy studies and in post-marketing \nexperience. \n \nIn post-marketing experience, AV block (including second degree or higher AV block) has been \nreported. In patients with proarrhythmic conditions, ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been reported. In \nrare cases, these events have led to asystole, cardiac arrest and death in patients with underlying \nproarrhythmic conditions. \n \nPatients should be made aware of the symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. slow, rapid or irregular \npulse, palpitations, shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded, fainting). Patients should be counselled to \nseek immediate medical advice if these symptoms occur. \n \nDizziness \n \nTreatment with lacosamide has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of \naccidental injury or falls. Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are \nfamiliar with the potential effects of the medicine (see section 4.8). \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains 59.8 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 3% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nPotential for new onset or worsening of myoclonic seizures \n \nNew onset or worsening of myoclonic seizures has been reported in both adult and paediatric patients \nwith PGTCS, in particular during titration. In patients with more than one seizure type, the observed \nbenefit of control for one seizure type should be weighed against any observed worsening in another \nseizure type. \n \nPotential for electro-clinical worsening in specific paediatric epilepsy syndromes \n \nThe safety and efficacy of lacosamide in paediatric patients with epilepsy syndromes in which focal \nand generalised seizures may coexist have not been determined. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nLacosamide should be used with caution in patients treated with medicinal products known to be \nassociated with PR prolongation (including sodium channel blocking antiepileptic medicinal products) \nand in patients treated with antiarrhythmics. However, subgroup analysis in clinical studies did not \nidentify an increased magnitude of PR prolongation in patients with concomitant administration of \ncarbamazepine or lamotrigine. \n \nIn vitro data \n \nData generally suggest that lacosamide has a low interaction potential. In vitro studies indicate that the \nenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9 are not induced and that CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, \nCYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 are not inhibited by lacosamide at plasma \nconcentrations observed in clinical studies. An in vitro study indicated that lacosamide is not \ntransported by P-glycoprotein in the intestine. In vitro data show that CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and \nCYP3A4 are capable of catalysing the formation of the O-desmethyl metabolite. \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\nIn vivo data \n \nLacosamide does not inhibit or induce CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 to a clinically relevant extent. \nLacosamide did not affect the AUC of midazolam (metabolised by CYP3A4, lacosamide given \n200 mg twice a day) but Cmax of midazolam was slightly increased (30 %). Lacosamide did not affect \nthe pharmacokinetics of omeprazole (metabolised by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, lacosamide given \n300 mg twice a day).  \nThe CYP2C19 inhibitor omeprazole (40 mg once daily) did not give rise to a clinically significant \nchange in lacosamide exposure. Thus, moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 are unlikely to affect systemic \nlacosamide exposure to a clinically relevant extent. \nCaution is recommended in concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP2C9 (e.g. \nfluconazole) and CYP3A4 (e.g. itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin), which may lead \nto increased systemic exposure of lacosamide. Such interactions have not been established in vivo but \nare possible based on in vitro data. \n \nStrong enzyme inducers such as rifampicin or St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) may \nmoderately reduce the systemic exposure of lacosamide. Therefore, starting or ending treatment with \nthese enzyme inducers should be done with caution. \n \nAntiepileptic medicinal products \n \nIn interaction studies lacosamide did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of \ncarbamazepine and valproic acid. Lacosamide plasma concentrations were not affected by \ncarbamazepine and by valproic acid. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in different age groups \nestimated that concomitant treatment with other antiepileptic medicinal products known to be enzyme \ninducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, in various doses) decreased the overall systemic \nexposure of lacosamide by 25 % in adults and 17 % in paediatric patients.  \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nIn an interaction study there was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and the oral \ncontraceptives ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Progesterone concentrations were not affected \nwhen the medicinal products were co-administered. \n \nOthers \n \nInteraction studies showed that lacosamide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. There \nwas no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and metformin.  \nCo-administration of warfarin with lacosamide does not result in a clinically relevant change in the \npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin. \nAlthough no pharmacokinetic data on the interaction of lacosamide with alcohol are available, a \npharmacodynamic effect cannot be excluded. \nLacosamide has a low protein binding of less than 15 %. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions \nwith other medicinal products through competition for protein binding sites are considered unlikely. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n \nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general  \n\nFor all antiepileptic medicinal products, it has been shown that in the offspring of treated women with \nepilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately \n3 % in the general population. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted \nwith polytherapy, however, the extent to which the treatment and/or the illness is responsible has not \nbeen elucidated. \nMoreover, effective antiepileptic therapy must not be interrupted, since the aggravation of the illness is \n\n\n\n63 \n\ndetrimental to both the mother and the foetus. \n \nRisk related to lacosamide \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of lacosamide in pregnant women. Studies in animals did not \nindicate any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but embryotoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits \nat maternal toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nLacosamide should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the benefit to the mother \nclearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). If women decide to become pregnant, the use of this \nproduct should be carefully re-evaluated. \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is unknown whether lacosamide is excreted in human breast milk. A risk to the newborns/infants \ncannot be excluded. Animal studies have shown excretion of lacosamide in breast milk. For \nprecautionary measures, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with lacosamide. \n \nFertility \n \nNo adverse reactions on male or female fertility or reproduction were observed in rats at doses \nproducing plasma exposures (AUC) up to approximately 2 times the plasma AUC in humans at the \nmaximum recommended human dose (MRHD). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLacosamide has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Lacosamide \ntreatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision.  \nAccordingly, patients should be advised not to drive or to operate other potentially hazardous \nmachinery until they are familiar with the effects of lacosamide on their ability to perform such \nactivities. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nBased on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in \n1,308 patients with partial-onset seizures, a total of 61.9 % of patients randomised to lacosamide and \n35.2 % of patients randomised to placebo reported at least 1 adverse reaction. The most frequently \nreported adverse reactions (\u2265 10 %) with lacosamide treatment were dizziness, headache, nausea and \ndiplopia. They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Some were dose-related and could be \nalleviated by reducing the dose. Incidence and severity of central nervous system (CNS) and \ngastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time. \nIn all of these controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12.2 % for \npatients randomised to lacosamide and 1.6 % for patients randomised to placebo. The most common \nadverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy was dizziness.  \nIncidence of CNS adverse reactions such as dizziness may be higher after a loading dose. \n \nBased on the analysis of data from a non-inferiority monotherapy clinical study comparing lacosamide \nto carbamazepine controlled release (CR), the most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u2265 10 %) for \nlacosamide were headache and dizziness. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was \n10.6 % for patients treated with lacosamide and 15.6 % for patients treated with carbamazepine CR.  \n \nThe safety profile of lacosamide reported in a study conducted in patients aged 4 years and older with \nidiopathic generalised epilepsy with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) was consistent \nwith the safety profile reported from the pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies in partial-onset \nseizures. Additional adverse reactions reported in PGTCS patients were myoclonic epilepsy (2.5 % in \nthe lacosamide-group and 0 % in the placebo-group) and ataxia (3.3 % in the lacosamide-group and \n0 % in the placebo-group). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were dizziness and \n\n\n\n64 \n\nsomnolence. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy \nwere dizziness and suicidal ideation. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 9.1 % in \nthe lacosamide group and 4.1 % in the placebo group. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe table below shows the frequencies of adverse reactions which have been reported in clinical \nstudies and post-marketing experience.

Adverse reactions \nassociated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. atrioventricular block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.  \nIn adjunctive clinical studies in epilepsy patients the incidence rate of reported first-degree AV Block \nis uncommon, 0.7 %, 0 %, 0.5 % and 0 % for lacosamide 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo, \nrespectively. No second- or higher degree AV Block was seen in these studies. However, cases with \nsecond- and third-degree AV Block associated with lacosamide treatment have been reported in post-\nmarketing experience. In the monotherapy clinical study comparing lacosamide to carbamazepine CR \nthe extent of increase in PR interval was comparable between lacosamide and carbamazepine. \nThe incidence rate for syncope reported in pooled adjunctive therapy clinical studies is uncommon and \ndid not differ between lacosamide (n=944) treated epilepsy patients (0.1 %) and placebo (n=364) \ntreated epilepsy patients (0.3 %). In the monotherapy clinical study comparing lacosamide to \ncarbamazepine CR, syncope was reported in 7/444 (1.6 %) lacosamide patients and in 1/442 (0.2 %) \ncarbamazepine CR patients. \nAtrial fibrillation or flutter were not reported in short term clinical studies; however, both have been \nreported in open-label epilepsy studies and in post-marketing experience. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n\nAbnormalities in liver function tests have been observed in placebo-controlled studies with lacosamide \nin adult patients with partial-onset seizures who were taking 1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts. Elevations of ALT to \u2265 3x ULN occurred in 0.7 % (7/935) of Lacosamide UCB patients and \n0 % (0/356) of placebo patients. \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nMultiorgan hypersensitivity reactions \n\nMultiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic \nSymptoms, DRESS) have been reported in patients treated with some antiepileptic medicinal products. \nThese reactions are variable in expression but typically present with fever and rash and can be \nassociated with involvement of different organ systems. If multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction is \nsuspected, lacosamide should be discontinued. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety profile of lacosamide in placebo-controlled (see study details in section 5.1) and in open-\nlabel studies (n=408) in adjunctive therapy in children from 4 years of age with partial-onset seizures \nwas consistent with the safety profile observed in adults although the frequency of some adverse \nreactions (somnolence, vomiting and convulsion) was increased and additional adverse reactions \n(nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, pharyngitis, decreased appetite, lethargy and abnormal behaviour) have \nbeen reported in paediatric patients: nasopharyngitis (15.7 %), vomiting (14.7 %), somnolence \n(14.0 %), dizziness (13.5 %), pyrexia (13.0 %), convulsion (7.8 %), decreased appetite (5.9 %), \npharyngitis (4.7 %), lethargy (2.7 %) and abnormal behaviour (1.7 %). \nA total of 67.8 % of patients randomised to lacosamide and 58.1 % of patients randomised to placebo \nreported at least 1 adverse reaction. \nBehavioural, cognition and emotional functioning were measured by the questionnaires Achenbach \nCBCL and BRIEF that were applied at baseline and throughout the studies and were mainly stable \nduring the course of the studies. \n \nElderly population  \n \nIn the monotherapy study comparing lacosamide to carbamazepine CR, the types of adverse reactions \nrelated to lacosamide in elderly patients (\u2265 65 years of age) appear to be similar to that observed in \npatients less than 65 years of age. However, a higher incidence (\u2265 5 % difference) of fall, diarrhoea \nand tremor has been reported in elderly patients compared to younger adult patients. The most \nfrequent cardiac-related adverse reaction reported in elderly compared to the younger adult population \nwas first-degree AV block. This was reported with lacosamide in 4.8 % (3/62) in elderly patients \nversus 1.6 % (6/382) in younger adult patients. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events \nobserved with lacosamide was 21.0 % (13/62) in elderly patients versus 9.2 % (35/382) in younger \nadult patients. These differences between elderly and younger adult patients were similar to those \nobserved in the active comparator group. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \n\nSymptoms observed after an accidental or intentional overdose of lacosamide are primarily associated \nwith CNS and gastrointestinal system. \n\n\uf0b7 The types of adverse reactions experienced by patients exposed to doses above 400 mg up to \n800 mg were not clinically different from those of patients administered recommended doses \nof lacosamide. \n\n\uf0b7 Reactions reported after an intake of more than 800 mg are dizziness, nausea, vomiting, \nseizures (generalised tonic-clonic seizures, status epilepticus). Cardiac conduction disorders, \nshock and coma have also been observed. Fatalities have been reported in patients following \nan intake of acute single overdose of several grams of lacosamide. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n67 \n\nManagement \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with lacosamide. Treatment of lacosamide overdose should \ninclude general supportive measures and may include haemodialysis if necessary (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX18  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe active substance, lacosamide (R-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide) is a \nfunctionalised amino acid. \nThe precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effect in humans remains to be \nfully elucidated. In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances \nslow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable \nneuronal membranes.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nLacosamide protected against seizures in a broad range of animal models of partial and primary \ngeneralised seizures and delayed kindling development.  \nIn non-clinical experiments lacosamide in combination with levetiracetam, carbamazepine, phenytoin, \nvalproate, lamotrigine, topiramate or gabapentin showed synergistic or additive anticonvulsant effects. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety (partial-onset seizures) \nAdult population \n \n\nMonotherapy \n\nEfficacy of lacosamide as monotherapy was established in a double-blind, parallel group, non-\ninferiority comparison to carbamazepine CR in 886 patients 16 years of age or older with newly or \nrecently diagnosed epilepsy. The patients had to present with unprovoked partial-onset seizures with \nor without secondary generalisation. The patients were randomised to carbamazepine CR or \nlacosamide, provided as tablets, in a 1:1 ratio. The dose was based on dose-response and ranged from \n400 to 1,200 mg/day for carbamazepine CR and from 200 to 600 mg/day for lacosamide. The duration \nof the treatment was up to 121 weeks depending on the response. \nThe estimated 6-month seizure freedom rates were 89.8 % for lacosamide-treated patients and 91.1 % \nfor carbamazepine CR treated patients using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis method. The adjusted \nabsolute difference between treatments was -1.3 % (95 % CI: -5.5, 2.8). The Kaplan-Meier estimates \nof 12-month seizure freedom rates were 77.8 % for lacosamide-treated patients and 82.7 % for \ncarbamazepine CR treated patients. \nThe 6-month seizure freedom rates in elderly patients of 65 and above (62 patients in lacosamide, \n57 patients in carbamazepine CR) were similar between both treatment groups. The rates were also \nsimilar to those observed in the overall population. In the elderly population, the maintenance \nlacosamide dose was 200 mg/day in 55 patients (88.7 %), 400 mg/day in 6 patients (9.7 %) and the \ndose was escalated to over 400 mg/day in 1 patient (1.6 %). \n \nConversion to monotherapy \n\nThe efficacy and safety of lacosamide in conversion to monotherapy has been assessed in a historical-\ncontrolled, multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial. In this study, 425 patients aged 16 to 70 years \nwith uncontrolled partial-onset seizures taking stable doses of 1 or 2 marketed antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts were randomised to be converted to lacosamide monotherapy (either 400 mg/day or \n300 mg/day in a 3:1 ratio). In treated patients who completed titration and started withdrawing \nantiepileptic medicinal products (284 and 99 respectively), monotherapy was maintained in 71.5 % \n\n\n\n68 \n\nand 70.7 % of patients respectively for 57-105 days (median 71 days), over the targeted observation \nperiod of 70 days. \n \nAdjunctive therapy \n\nThe efficacy of lacosamide as adjunctive therapy at recommended doses (200 mg/day, 400 mg/day) \nwas established in 3 multicenter, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical studies with a 12-week \nmaintenance period. Lacosamide 600 mg/day was also shown to be effective in controlled adjunctive \ntherapy studies, although the efficacy was similar to 400 mg/day and patients were less likely to \ntolerate this dose because of CNS- and gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions. Thus, the \n600 mg/day dose is not recommended. The maximum recommended dose is 400 mg/day. These \nstudies, involving 1,308 patients with a history of an average of 23 years of partial-onset seizures, \nwere designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lacosamide when administered concomitantly \nwith 1-3 antiepileptic medicinal products in patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures with or \nwithout secondary generalisation. Overall the proportion of subjects with a 50 % reduction in seizure \nfrequency was 23 %, 34 %, and 40 % for placebo, lacosamide 200 mg/day and lacosamide \n400 mg/day.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics and safety of a single loading dose of intravenous lacosamide were determined \nin a multicenter, open-label study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of rapid initiation of \nlacosamide using a single intravenous loading dose (including 200 mg) followed by twice daily oral \ndosing (equivalent to the intravenous dose) as adjunctive therapy in adult subjects 16 to 60 years of \nage with partial-onset seizures.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPartial-onset seizures have a similar clinical expression in children from 4 years of age and in adults. \nThe efficacy of lacosamide in children aged 4 years and older has been extrapolated from data of \nadolescents and adults with partial-onset seizures, for whom a similar response was expected provided \nthe paediatric dose adaptations are established (see section 4.2) and safety has been demonstrated (see \nsection 4.8). \nThe efficacy supported by the extrapolation principle stated above was confirmed by a double-blind, \nrandomised, placebo-controlled study. The study consisted of an 8-week baseline period followed by a \n6-week titration period. Eligible patients on a stable dose regimen of 1 to \u2264 3 antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts, who still experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 4 weeks prior to screening \nwith seizure-free phase no longer than 21 days in the 8-week period prior to entry into the baseline \nperiod, were randomised to receive either placebo (n=172) or lacosamide (n=171).  \nDosing was initiated at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day in subjects weighing less than 50 kg or 100 mg/day in \nsubjects weighing 50 kg or more in 2 divided doses. During the titration period, lacosamide doses \nwere adjusted in 1or 2 mg/kg/day increments in subjects weighing less than 50 kg or 50 or 100 mg/day \nin subjects weighing 50 kg or more at weekly intervals to achieve the target maintenance period dose \nrange. \nSubjects must have achieved the minimum target dose for their body weight category for the final \n3 days of the titration period to be eligible for entry into the 10-week maintenance period. Subjects \nwere to remain on stable lacosamide dose throughout the maintenance period or were withdrawn and \nentered in the blinded taper period. \nStatistically significant (p=0.0003) and clinically relevant reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency \nper 28 days from baseline to the maintenance period was observed between the lacosamide and the \nplacebo group. The percent reduction over placebo based on analysis of covariance was 31.72 % \n(95 % CI: 16.342,44.277). \nOverall, the proportion of subjects with at least a 50 % reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency per \n28 days from baseline to the maintenance period was 52.9 % in the lacosamide group compared with \n33.3 % in the placebo group. \nThe quality of life assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory indicated that subjects in both \nlacosamide and placebo groups had a similar and stable health-related quality of life during the entire \ntreatment period. \n \n\n\n\n69 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety (primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures) \n \nThe efficacy of lacosamide as adjunctive therapy in patients 4 years of age and older with idiopathic \ngeneralized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) was established \nin a 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study. The \nstudy consisted of a 12-week historical baseline period, a 4-week prospective baseline period and a 24-\nweek treatment period (which included a 6-week titration period and an 18-week maintenance period). \nEligible patients on a stable dose of 1 to 3 antiepileptic drugs experiencing at least 3 documented \nPGTCS during the 16-week combined baseline period were randomized 1 to 1 to receive lacosamide \nor placebo (patients in the full analysis set: lacosamide n=118, placebo n=121; of them 8 patients in \nthe \u2265 4 to < 12 years age group and 16 patients in the \u2265 12 to < 18 years range were treated with LCM \nand 9 and 16 patients, respectively with placebo).  \nPatients were titrated up to the target maintenance period dose of 12 mg/kg/day in patients weighing \nless than 30 kg, 8 mg/kg/day in patients weighing from 30 to less than 50 kg or 400 mg/day in patients \nweighing 50 kg or more.  \n \n\nEfficacy variable \nParameter \n\nPlacebo \nN=121 \n\nLacosamide \nN=118 \n\nTime to second PGTCS \nMedian (days) 77.0 - \n95 % CI 49.0, 128.0 - \nLacosamide \u2013 Placebo  \nHazard Ratio 0.540 \n95 % CI 0.377, 0.774 \np-value < 0.001 \n\nSeizure freedom   \nStratified Kaplan-Meier estimate (%) 17.2 31.3 \n95 % CI 10.4, 24.0 22.8, 39.9 \nLacosamide \u2013 Placebo 14.1 \n95 % CI 3.2, 25.1 \np-value 0.011 \n\nNote: For the lacosamide group, the median time to second PGTCS could not be estimated by Kaplan-\nMeier methods because \u02c3 50% of patients did not experience a second PGTCS by Day 166. \n \nThe findings in the pediatric subgroup were consistent with the results of the overall population for the \nprimary, secondary and other efficacy endpoints.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \n \nAfter intravenous administration, Cmax is reached at the end of infusion. The plasma concentration \nincreases proportionally with dose after oral (100-800 mg) and intravenous (50-300 mg) \nadministration. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/kg. Lacosamide is less than 15 % bound to plasma \nproteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \n95 % of the dose is excreted in the urine as lacosamide and metabolites. The metabolism of \nlacosamide has not been completely characterised.  \nThe major compounds excreted in urine are unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40 % of the dose) \nand its O-desmethyl metabolite less than 30 %.  \n\n\n\n70 \n\nA polar fraction proposed to be serine derivatives accounted for approximately 20 % in urine, but was \ndetected only in small amounts (0-2 %) in human plasma of some subjects. Small amounts (0.5-2 %) \nof additional metabolites were found in the urine.  \nIn vitro data show that CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 are capable of catalysing the formation of \nthe O-desmethyl metabolite but the main contributing isoenzyme has not been confirmed in vivo. No \nclinically relevant difference in lacosamide exposure was observed comparing its pharmacokinetics in \nextensive metabolisers (EMs, with a functional CYP2C19) and poor metabolisers (PMs, lacking a \nfunctional CYP2C19). Furthermore an interaction study with omeprazole (CYP2C19-inhibitor) \ndemonstrated no clinically relevant changes in lacosamide plasma concentrations indicating that the \nimportance of this pathway is minor. The plasma concentration of O-desmethyl-lacosamide is \napproximately 15 % of the concentration of lacosamide in plasma. This major metabolite has no \nknown pharmacological activity. \n \nElimination \n \nLacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and \nbiotransformation. After oral and intravenous administration of radiolabeled lacosamide, \napproximately 95 % of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5 % in the \nfaeces. The elimination half-life of lacosamide is approximately 13 hours. The pharmacokinetics is \ndose-proportional and constant over time, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Following twice \ndaily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after a 3 day period. The plasma \nconcentration increases with an accumulation factor of approximately 2. \n \nA single loading dose of 200 mg approximates steady-state concentrations comparable to 100 mg \ntwice daily oral administration. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nGender \n\nClinical studies indicate that gender does not have a clinically significant influence on the plasma \nconcentrations of lacosamide. \n \nRenal impairment \n\nThe AUC of lacosamide was increased by approximately 30 % in mildly and moderately and 60 % in \nseverely renal impaired patients and patients with end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis \ncompared to healthy subjects, whereas Cmax was unaffected.  \nLacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by haemodialysis. Following a 4-hour haemodialysis \ntreatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50 %. Therefore, dosage supplementation \nfollowing haemodialysis is recommended (see section 4.2). The exposure of the O-desmethyl \nmetabolite was several-fold increased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. In \nabsence of haemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease, the levels were increased and \ncontinuously rising during the 24-hour sampling. It is unknown whether the increased metabolite \nexposure in end-stage renal disease subjects could give rise to adverse effects but no pharmacological \nactivity of the metabolite has been identified. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nSubjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of \nlacosamide (approximately 50 % higher AUCnorm). The higher exposure was partly due to a reduced \nrenal function in the studied subjects. The decrease in non-renal clearance in the patients of the study \nwas estimated to give a 20 % increase in the AUC of lacosamide. The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide \nhas not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \n\nIn a study in elderly men and women including 4 patients > 75 years of age, AUC was about 30 and \n50 % increased compared to young men, respectively. This is partly related to lower body weight. The \nbody weight normalized difference is 26 and 23 %, respectively. An increased variability in exposure \n\n\n\n71 \n\nwas also observed. The renal clearance of lacosamide was only slightly reduced in elderly subjects in \nthis study.  \nA general dose reduction is not considered to be necessary unless indicated due to reduced renal \nfunction (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe paediatric pharmacokinetic profile of lacosamide was determined in a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis using sparse plasma concentration data obtained in one placebo-controlled randomised study \nand three open-label studies in 414 children with epilepsy aged 6 months to 17 years. The \nadministered lacosamide doses ranged from 2 to 17.8 mg/kg/day in twice daily intake, with a \nmaximum of 600 mg/day for children weighing 50 kg or more. \nThe typical plasma clearance was estimated to be 1.04 L/h, 1.32 L/h and 1.86 L/h for children \nweighing 20 kg, 30 kg and 50 kg respectively. In comparison, plasma clearance was estimated at \n1.92 L/h in adults (70 kg body weight). \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis using sparse pharmacokinetic samples from PGTCS study \nshowed a similar exposure in patients with PGTCS and in patients with partial-onset seizures. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn the toxicity studies, the plasma concentrations of lacosamide obtained were similar or only \nmarginally higher than those observed in patients, which leaves low or non-existing margins to human \nexposure. \nA safety pharmacology study with intravenous administration of lacosamide in anesthetised dogs \nshowed transient increases in PR interval and QRS complex duration and decreases in blood pressure \nmost likely due to a cardiodepressant action. These transient changes started in the same concentration \nrange as after maximum recommended clinical dosing. In anesthetised dogs and Cynomolgus \nmonkeys, at intravenous doses of 15-60 mg/kg, slowing of atrial and ventricular conductivity, \natrioventricular block and atrioventricular dissociation were seen. \nIn the repeated dose toxicity studies, mild reversible liver changes were observed in rats starting at \nabout 3 times the clinical exposure. These changes included an increased organ weight, hypertrophy of \nhepatocytes, increases in serum concentrations of liver enzymes and increases in total cholesterol and \ntriglycerides. Apart from the hypertrophy of hepatocytes, no other histopathologic changes were \nobserved. \nIn reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rodents and rabbits, no teratogenic effects but an \nincrease in numbers of stillborn pups and pup deaths in the peripartum period, and slightly reduced \nlive litter sizes and pup body weights were observed at maternal toxic doses in rats corresponding to \nsystemic exposure levels similar to the expected clinical exposure. Since higher exposure levels could \nnot be tested in animals due to maternal toxicity, data are insufficient to fully characterise the \nembryofetotoxic and teratogenic potential of lacosamide. \nStudies in rats revealed that lacosamide and/or its metabolites readily crossed the placental barrier. \nIn juvenile rats and dogs, the types of toxicity do not differ qualitatively from those observed in adult \nanimals. In juvenile rats, a reduced body weight was observed at systemic exposure levels similar to \nthe expected clinical exposure. In juvenile dogs, transient and dose-related CNS clinical signs started \nto be observed at systemic exposure levels below the expected clinical exposure. \n \n \n6.

It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\uf0b7 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Lacosamide UCB is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Lacosamide UCB is \nLacosamide UCB contains lacosamide. This belongs to a group of medicines called \u201cantiepileptic \nmedicines\u201d. These medicines are used to treat epilepsy. \n\uf0b7 You have been given this medicine to lower the number of fits (seizures) you have. \n \nWhat Lacosamide UCB is used for \n\uf0a7 Lacosamide UCB is used in adults, adolescents and children aged 4 years and older.  \n\uf0b7 It is used: \n\n\uf0b7 on its own and in association with other antiepileptic medicines to treat a certain type \nof epilepsy characterised by the occurrence of partial-onset seizure with or without \nsecondary generalisation. In this type of epilepsy, fits first affect only one side of your \nbrain. However, these may then spread to larger areas on both sides of your brain; \n\n\uf0b7 in association with other antiepileptic medicines to treat primary generalised tonic-\nclonic seizures (major fits, including loss of consciousness) in patients with idiopathic \ngeneralised epilepsy (the type of epilepsy that is thought to have a genetic cause). \n\n \n \n2.  What you need to know before you take Lacosamide UCB \n \nDo not take Lacosamide UCB \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to lacosamide, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If you are not sure whether you are allergic, please discuss with your doctor. \n\uf0b7 if you have a certain type of heart beat problem called second- or third-degree AV block. \n \nDo not take Lacosamide UCB if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine. \n \n\n\n\n121 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Lacosamide UCB if: \n\uf0b7 you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. A small number of people being treated with \n\nantiepileptic medicinal products such as lacosamide have had thoughts of harming or killing \nthemselves. If you have any of these thoughts at any time, tell your doctor straight away. \n\n\uf0b7 you have a heart problem that affects the beat of your heart and you often have a particulary \nslow, fast or irregular heart beat (such as AV block, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter).  \n\n\uf0b7 you have severe heart disease such as heart failure or have had a heart attack.  \n\uf0b7 you are often dizzy or fall over. Lacosamide UCB may make you dizzy - this could increase \n\nthe risk of accidental injury or a fall. This means that you should take care until you are used \nto the effects of this medicine. \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nLacosamide UCB. \nIf you are taking Lacosamide UCB, talk to your doctor if you are experiencing a new type of seizure \nor worsening of existing seizures. \nIf you are taking Lacosamide UCB and you are experiencing symptoms of abnormal heartbeat (such as \nslow, rapid or irregular heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded, fainting), seek \nmedical advice immediately (see section 4). \n \nChildren under 4 years \nLacosamide UCB is not recommended for children aged under 4 years. This is because we do not yet \nknow whether it will work and whether it is safe for children in this age group.  \n  \nOther medicines and Lacosamide UCB \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines that affect \nyour heart - this is because Lacosamide UCB can also affect your heart: \n\uf0b7 medicines to treat heart problems;  \n\uf0b7 medicines which can increase the \u201cPR interval\u201d on a scan of the heart (ECG or \n\nelectrocardiogram) such as medicines for epilepsy or pain called carbamazepine, lamotrigine \nor pregabalin;  \n\n\uf0b7 medicines used to treat certain types of irregular heart beat or heart failure.  \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nLacosamide UCB.  \n \nAlso tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines - this is because \nthey may increase or decrease the effect of Lacosamide UCB on your body: \n\uf0b7 medicines for fungal infections called fluconazole, itraconazole or ketoconazole;  \n\uf0b7 a medicine for HIV called ritonavir; \n\uf0b7 medicines used to treat bacterial infections called clarithromycin or rifampicin;  \n\uf0b7 a herbal medicine used to treat mild anxiety and depression called St. John\u2019s wort. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nLacosamide UCB.  \n \nLacosamide UCB with alcohol \nAs a safety precaution do not take Lacosamide UCB with alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nIt is not recommended to take Lacosamide UCB if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, as the effects of \nLacosamide UCB on pregnancy and the unborn baby or the new-born child are not known. Also, it is \nnot known whether Lacosamide UCB passes into breast milk. Seek advice immediately from your \n\n\n\n122 \n\ndoctor if you get pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. They will help you decide if you \nshould take Lacosamide UCB or not. \n \nDo not stop treatment without talking to your doctor first as this could increase your fits (seizures). A \nworsening of your disease can also harm your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive, cycle or use any tools or machines until you know how this medicine affects you. This is \nbecause Lacosamide UCB may make you feel dizzy or cause blurred vision.  \n \n \n3. How to take Lacosamide UCB \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nTaking Lacosamide UCB \n\uf0b7 Take Lacosamide UCB twice each day - once in the morning and once in the evening. \n\uf0b7 Try to take it at about the same time each day.  \n\uf0b7 Swallow the Lacosamide UCB tablet with a glass of water. \n\uf0b7 You may take Lacosamide UCB with or without food. \n \nYou will usually start by taking a low dose each day and your doctor will slowly increase this over a \nnumber of weeks. When you reach the dose that works for you, this is called the \u201cmaintenance dose\u201d, \nyou then take the same amount each day. Lacosamide UCB is used as a long term treatment. You \nshould continue to take Lacosamide UCB until your doctor tells you to stop. \n \nHow much to take \nListed below are the normal recommended doses of Lacosamide UCB for different age groups and \nweights. Your doctor may prescribe a different dose if you have problems with your kidneys or with \nyour liver. \n \nAdolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more and adults \nWhen you take Lacosamide UCB on its own \nThe usual starting dose of Lacosamide UCB is 50 mg twice a day. \nYour doctor may also prescribe a starting dose of 100 mg of Lacosamide UCB twice a day. \n \nYour doctor may increase your twice daily dose every week by 50 mg. This will be until you reach a \nmaintenance dose between 100 mg and 300 mg twice a day. \n \nWhen you take Lacosamide UCB with other antiepileptic medicines \nThe usual starting dose of Lacosamide UCB is 50 mg twice a day.  \n \nYour doctor may increase your twice daily dose every week by 50 mg. This will be until you reach a \nmaintenance dose between 100 mg and 200 mg twice a day. \n \nIf you weigh 50 kg or more, your doctor may decide to start Lacosamide UCB treatment with a single \n\u201cloading\u201d dose of 200 mg. You would then start your ongoing maintenance dose 12 hours later. \n \nChildren and adolescent weighing less than 50 kg \nThe dose depends on their body weight. They usually start treatment with the syrup and only change to \ntablets if they are able to take tablets and get the correct dose with the different tablet strengths. The \ndoctor will prescribe the formulation that is best suited to them. \n \nIf you take more Lacosamide UCB than you should  \nIf you have taken more Lacosamide UCB than you should, contact your doctor immediately.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Lacosamide UCB is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Lacosamide UCB is \nLacosamide UCB contains lacosamide. This belongs to a group of medicines called \u201cantiepileptic \nmedicines\u201d. These medicines are used to treat epilepsy. \n\uf0b7 You have been given this medicine to lower the number of fits (seizures) you have. \n \nWhat Lacosamide UCB is used for \n\uf0b7 Lacosamide UCB is used in adolescents and children aged 4 years and older weighing 50 kg \n\nor more and in adults. \n\uf0b7 It is used: \n\n\uf0a7 on its own and in association with other antiepileptic medicines to treat a certain type of \nepilepsy characterised by the occurrence of partial-onset seizure with or without \nsecondary generalisation. In this type of epilepsy, fits first affect only one side of your \nbrain. However, these may then spread to larger areas on both sides of your brain;  \n\n\uf0b7 in association with other antiepileptic medicines to treat primary generalised tonic-\nclonic seizures (major fits, including loss of consciousness) in patients with idiopathic \ngeneralised epilepsy (the type of epilepsy that is thought to have a genetic cause). \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Lacosamide UCB  \n \nDo not take Lacosamide UCB \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to lacosamide, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If you are not sure whether you are allergic, please discuss with your doctor. \n\uf0b7 if you have a certain type of heart beat problem called second- or third-degree AV block. \n \n\n\n\n129 \n\nDo not take Lacosamide UCB if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Lacosamide UCB if: \n\uf0b7 you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. A small number of people being treated with \n\nantiepileptic medicinal products such as lacosamide have had thoughts of harming or killing \nthemselves. If you have any of these thoughts at any time, tell your doctor straight away. \n\n\uf0b7 you have a heart problem that affects the beat of your heart and you often have a particulary \nslow, fast or irregular heart beat (such as AV block, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter). \n\n\uf0b7 you have severe heart disease such as heart failure or have had a heart attack. \n\uf0b7 you are often dizzy or fall over. Lacosamide UCB may make you dizzy - this could increase \n\nthe risk of accidental injury or a fall. This means that you should take care until you are used \nto the effects of this medicine. \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nLacosamide UCB. \nIf you are taking Lacosamide UCB, talk to your doctor if you are experiencing a new type of seizure \nor worsening of existing seizures. \nIf you are taking Lacosamide UCB and you are experiencing symptoms of abnormal heartbeat (such as \nslow, rapid or irregular heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded, fainting), seek \nmedical advice immediately (see section 4). \n \nChildren under 4 years \nLacosamide UCB is not recommended for children aged under 4 years. This is because we do not yet \nknow whether it will work and whether it is safe for children in this age group.  \n \nOther medicines and Lacosamide UCB \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines that affect \nyour heart - this is because Lacosamide UCB can also affect your heart: \n\uf0b7 medicines to treat heart problems; \n\uf0b7 medicines which can increase the \u201cPR interval\u201d on a scan of the heart (ECG or \n\nelectrocardiogram) such as medicines for epilepsy or pain called carbamazepine, lamotrigine \nor pregabalin; \n\n\uf0b7 medicines used to treat certain types of irregular heart beat or heart failure. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure) talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nLacosamide UCB.  \n \nAlso tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines - this is because \nthey may increase or decrease the effect of Lacosamide UCB on your body: \n\uf0b7 medicines for fungal infections called fluconazole, itraconazole or ketoconazole; \n\uf0b7 a medicine for HIV called ritonavir; \n\uf0b7 medicines for bacterial infections called clarithromycin or rifampicin; \n\uf0b7 a herbal medicine used to treat mild anxiety and depression called St. John\u2019s wort. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nLacosamide UCB.  \n \nLacosamide UCB with alcohol \nAs a safety precaution do not take Lacosamide UCB with alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \n\n\n\n130 \n\nIt is not recommended to take Lacosamide UCB if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, as the effects of \nLacosamide UCB on pregnancy and the unborn baby or the new-born child are not known. Also, it is \nnot known whether Lacosamide UCB passes into the breast milk. Seek advice immediately from your \ndoctor if you get pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. They will help you decide if you \nshould take Lacosamide UCB or not. \n \nDo not stop treatment without talking to your doctor first as this could increase your fits (seizures). A \nworsening of your disease can also harm your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive, cycle or use any tools or machines until you know how this medicine affects you. This is \nbecause Lacosamide UCB may make you feel dizzy or cause blurred vision.  \n \n \n3. How to take Lacosamide UCB  \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nTaking Lacosamide UCB \n\uf0b7 Take Lacosamide UCB twice each day - once in the morning and once in the evening. \n\uf0b7 Try to take it at about the same time each day.  \n\uf0b7 Swallow the Lacosamide UCB tablet with a glass of water.  \n\uf0b7 You may take Lacosamide UCB with or without food. \n \nYou will usually start by taking a low dose each day and your doctor will slowly increase this over a \nnumber of weeks.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Lacosamide UCB is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Lacosamide UCB is \nLacosamide UCB contains lacosamide. This belongs to a group of medicines called \u201cantiepileptic \nmedicines\u201d. These medicines are used to treat epilepsy. \n\uf0b7 You have been given this medicine to lower the number of fits (seizures) you have. \n \nWhat Lacosamide UCB is used for \n\uf0a7 Lacosamide UCB is used in adults, adolescents and children aged 4 years and older.  \n\uf0b7 It is used: \n\n\uf0a7 on its own and in association with other antiepileptic medicines to treat a certain type of \nepilepsy characterised by the occurrence of partial-onset seizure with or without \nsecondary generalisation. In this type of epilepsy, fits first affect only one side of your \nbrain. However, these may then spread to larger areas on both sides of your brain;  \n\n\uf0a7 in association with other antiepileptic medicines to treat primary generalised tonic-\nclonic seizures (major fits, including loss of consciousness) in patients with idiopathic \ngeneralised epilepsy (the type of epilepsy that is thought to have a genetic cause). \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Lacosamide UCB  \n \nDo not take Lacosamide UCB \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to lacosamide, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nSection 6). If you are not sure whether you are allergic, please discuss with your doctor. \n\uf0b7 if you have a certain type of heart beat problem called second- or third-degree AV block. \n \nDo not take Lacosamide UCB if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine. \n\n\n\n137 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Lacosamide UCB if: \n\uf0b7 you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. A small number of people being treated with \n\nantiepileptic medicinal products such as lacosamide have had thoughts of harming or killing \nthemselves. If you have any of these thoughts at any time, tell your doctor straight away. \n\n\uf0b7 you have a heart problem that affects the beat of your heart and you often have a particulary \nslow, fast or irregular heart beat (such as AV block, atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter).  \n\n\uf0b7 you have severe heart disease such as heart failure or have had a heart attack. \n\uf0b7 you are often dizzy or fall over. Lacosamide UCB may make you dizzy \u2013 this could increase \n\nthe risk of accidental injury or a fall. This means that you should take care until you are used \nto the effects of this medicine. \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nLacosamide UCB. \nIf you are taking Lacosamide UCB, talk to your doctor if you are experiencing a new type of seizure \nor worsening of existing seizures. \nIf you are taking Lacosamide UCB and you are experiencing symptoms of abnormal heartbeat (such as \nslow, rapid or irregular heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded, fainting), seek \nmedical advice immediately (see section 4). \n \nChildren under 4 years \nLacosamide UCB is not recommended for children aged under 4 years. This is because we do not yet \nknow whether it will work and whether it is safe for children in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Lacosamide UCB \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines that affect \nyour heart - this is because Lacosamide UCB can also affect your heart: \n\uf0b7 medicines to treat heart problems; \n\uf0b7 medicines which can increase the \u201cPR interval\u201d on a scan of the heart (ECG or \n\nelectrocardiogram) such as medicines for epilepsy or pain called carbamazepine, lamotrigine \nor pregabalin; \n\n\uf0b7 medicines used to treat certain types of irregular heart beat or heart failure. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nLacosamide UCB.  \n \nAlso tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines - this is because \nthey may increase or decrease the effect of Lacosamide UCB on your body: \n\uf0b7 medicines for fungal infections called fluconazole, itraconazole or ketoconazole; \n\uf0b7 a medicine for HIV called ritonavir; \n\uf0b7 medicines for bacterial infections called clarithromycin or rifampicin; \n\uf0b7 a herbal medicine used to treat mild anxiety and depression called St. John\u2019s wort. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nLacosamide UCB.  \n \nLacosamide UCB with alcohol \nAs a safety precaution do not take Lacosamide UCB with alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nIt is not recommended to take Lacosamide UCB if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, as the effects of \nLacosamide UCB on pregnancy and the unborn baby or the new-born child are not known. Also, it is \nnot known whether Lacosamide UCB passes into the breast milk. Seek advice immediately from your \n\n\n\n138 \n\ndoctor if you get pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. They will help you decide if you \nshould take Lacosamide UCB or not. \n \nDo not stop treatment without talking to your doctor first as this could increase your fits (seizures). A \nworsening of your disease can also harm your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive, cycle or use any tools or machines until you know how this medicine affects you. This is \nbecause Lacosamide UCB may make you feel dizzy or cause blurred vision. \n \nLacosamide UCB contains sorbitol, sodium, sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate, aspartame \nand propylene glycol \n\uf0b7 Sorbitol (a type of sugar): This medicine contains 187 mg sorbitol in each ml. Sorbitol is a \n\nsource of fructose. If your doctor has told you that you (or your child) have an intolerance to \nsome sugars or if you have been diagnosed with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare \ngenetic disorder in which a person cannot break down fructose, talk to your doctor before you \n(or your child) take or receive this medicine. Sorbitol may cause gastrointestinal discomfort \nand mild laxative effect.  \n\n\uf0b7 Sodium (salt): This medicine contains 1.42  mg sodium (main component of cooking/table \nsalt) in each ml. This is equivalent to 0.07 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary \nintake of sodium for an adult. \n\n\uf0b7 Sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).  \n\uf0b7 Aspartame (E951): This medicine contains 0.032 mg aspartame in each ml. Aspartame is a \n\nsource of phenylalanine. It may be harmful if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic \ndisorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the body cannot remove it properly.  \n\n\uf0b7 Propylene glycol (E1520): This medicine contains 2.14 mg propylene glycol in each ml. \n \n \n3.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Lacosamide UCB is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Lacosamide UCB is \nLacosamide UCB contains lacosamide. This belongs to a group of medicines called \u201cantiepileptic \nmedicines\u201d. These medicines are used to treat epilepsy. \n\uf0b7 You have been given this medicine to lower the number of fits (seizures) you have. \n \nWhat Lacosamide UCB is used for \n\uf0a7 Lacosamide UCB is used in adults, adolescents and children aged 4 years and older.  \n\uf0b7 It is used: \n\n\uf0a7 on its own and in association with other antiepileptic medicines to treat a certain type of \nepilepsy characterised by the occurrence of partial-onset seizure with or without \nsecondary generalisation. In this type of epilepsy, fits first affect only one side of your \nbrain. However, these may then spread to larger areas on both sides of your brain; \n\n\uf0a7 in association with other antiepileptic medicines to treat primary generalised tonic-\nclonic seizures (major fits, including loss of consciousness) in patients with idiopathic \ngeneralised epilepsy (the type of epilepsy that is thought to have a genetic cause). \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Lacosamide UCB  \n \nDo not use Lacosamide UCB \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to lacosamide, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If you are not sure whether you are allergic, please discuss with your doctor. \n\uf0b7 if you have a certain type of heart beat problem called second- or third-degree AV block.  \n \nDo not use Lacosamide UCB if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor \nor pharmacist before using this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using Lacosamide UCB if: \n\uf0b7 you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. A small number of people being treated with \n\nantiepileptic medicinal products such as lacosamide have had thoughts of harming or killing \nthemselves. If you have any of these thoughts at any time, tell your doctor straight away. \n\n\uf0b7 you have a heart problem that affects the beat of your heart and you often have a particulary \nslow, fast or irregular heart beat (such as AV block, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter). \n\n\n\n149 \n\n\uf0b7 you have severe heart disease such as heart failure or have had a heart attack.  \n\uf0b7 you are often dizzy or fall over. Lacosamide UCB may make you dizzy - this could increase \n\nthe risk of accidental injury or a fall. This means that you should take care until you are used \nto the effects of this medicine. \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using \nLacosamide UCB. \nIf you are taking Lacosamide UCB, talk to your doctor if you are experiencing a new type of seizure \nor worsening of existing seizures. \nIf you are taking Lacosamide UCB and you are experiencing symptoms of abnormal heartbeat (such as \nslow, rapid or irregular heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded, fainting), seek \nmedical advice immediately (see section 4). \n \nChildren under 4 years \nLacosamide UCB is not recommended for children aged under 4 years. This is because we do not yet \nknow whether it will work and whether it is safe for children in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Lacosamide UCB \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines that affect \nyour heart - this is because Lacosamide UCB can also affect your heart: \n\uf0b7 medicines to treat heart problems; \n\uf0b7 medicines which can increase the \u201cPR interval\u201d on a scan of the heart (ECG or \n\nelectrocardiogram) such as medicines for epilepsy or pain called carbamazepine, lamotrigine \nor pregabalin; \n\n\uf0b7 medicines used to treat certain types of irregular heart beat or heart failure. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using \nLacosamide UCB.  \n \nAlso tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines - this is because \nthey may increase or decrease the effect of Lacosamide UCB on your body: \n\uf0b7 medicines for fungal infections called fluconazole, itraconazole or ketoconazole; \n\uf0b7 a medicine for HIV called ritonavir; \n\uf0b7 medicines for bacterial infections called clarithromycin or rifampicin; \n\uf0b7 a herbal medicine used to treat mild anxiety and depression called St. John\u2019s wort. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using \nLacosamide UCB. \n \nLacosamide UCB with alcohol \nAs a safety precaution do not use Lacosamide UCB with alcohol. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n \nIt is not recommended to use Lacosamide UCB if you are pregnant or breast feeding, as the effects of \nLacosamide UCB on pregnancy and the unborn baby or the new-born child are not known. Also, it is \nnot known whether Lacosamide UCB passes into breast milk. Seek advice immediately from your \ndoctor if you get pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. They will help you decide if you \nshould use Lacosamide UCB or not. \n \nDo not stop treatment without talking to your doctor first as this could increase your fits (seizures). A \nworsening of your disease can also harm your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive, cycle or use any tools or machines until you know how this medicine affects you. This is \n\n\n\n150 \n\nbecause Lacosamide UCB may make you feel dizzy or cause blurred vision.  \n \nLacosamide UCB contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 59.8 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is \nequivalent to 3 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \n \n3. How to use Lacosamide UCB  \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nUsing Lacosamide UCB \n\uf0b7 Lacosamide UCB can be started by: \n\n- taking the medicine by mouth or \n- by being given as an intravenous infusion (sometimes called an \u201cIV infusion\u201d) where the \n\nmedicine is given into your vein by a doctor or nurse. It is given over 15 to 60 minutes. \n\uf0b7 The IV infusion is usually used for a short time when you cannot take the medicine by mouth. \n\uf0b7 Your doctor will decide for how many days you will have infusions. There is experience with \n\ntwice daily infusions of Lacosamide UCB for up to 5 days.
