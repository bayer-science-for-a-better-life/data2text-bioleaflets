This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca nasal spray, suspension\nPandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (live attenuated, nasal)\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\n1 dose (0.2 ml) contains: \n\nReassortant influenza virus* (live attenuated) of the following strain**:\n\nA/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) strain\n(A/Vietnam/1203/2004, MEDI 0141000136) 107.0\u00b10.5 FFU***\n\n* propagated in fertilised hens\u2019 eggs from healthy chicken flocks.\n** produced in VERO cells by reverse genetic technology. This product contains a genetically \n\nmodified organism (GMO).\n*** fluorescent focus units\n\nThis vaccine complies with the WHO recommendation and EU decision for the pandemic.\n\nThe vaccine may contain residues of the following substances: egg proteins (e.g. ovalbumin) and \ngentamicin. The maximum amount of ovalbumin is less than 0.024 micrograms per 0.2 ml dose (0.12 \nmicrograms per ml).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nNasal spray, suspension\n\nThe suspension is colourless to pale yellow, clear to opalescent with a pH of approximately 7.2. Small \nwhite particles may be present.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation in children and adolescents \nfrom 12 months to less than 18 years of age.\n\nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca should be used in accordance with official guidance.\n\n\n\n3\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nChildren and adolescents from 12 months to less than 18 years of age\n0.2 ml (administered as 0.1 ml per nostril).\nTwo doses are recommended for all children and adolescents. The second dose should be administered \nafter an interval of at least 4 weeks.\n\nChildren less than 12 months\nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca should not be used in infants below 12 months of age \nbecause of safety concerns regarding increased rates of hospitalisation and wheezing in this population \n(see section 4.8).\n\nMethod of administration\nImmunisation must be carried out by nasal administration.\n\nDo not inject Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca.\n\nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is administered as a divided dose in both nostrils. \nAfter administering half of the dose in one nostril, administer the other half of the dose in the other \nnostril immediately or shortly thereafter. The patient can breathe normally while the vaccine is being \nadministered \u2013 there is no need to actively inhale or sniff.\n\nSee section 6.6 for administration instructions.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to the active substance or to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1 (e.g. gelatin), or to gentamicin (a possible trace residue), to eggs or to \negg proteins (e.g. ovalbumin).  However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give the \nvaccine, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nCaution is needed when administering this vaccine to individuals with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or \nto trace residues (gentamicin, eggs or egg proteins, ovalbumin). Appropriate medical treatment and \nsupervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event or hypersensitivity \nevent following administration of the vaccine.\n\nThere are no data with Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca in children and adolescents \nyounger than 18 years of age receiving salicylate therapy. Due to the association of Reye\u2019s syndrome \nwith salicylates and wild-type influenza infection, healthcare providers should assess the potential \nrisks of administering the vaccine with the potential benefits in a pandemic situation (see section 4.5).\n\nImmune response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient.\n\nNo data are available for individuals with significant clinical immunodeficiency. In a pandemic \nsituation, healthcare providers need to assess the potential benefits, alternatives, and risks of \nadministering the vaccine to children and adolescents with significant clinical immunodeficiency due \nto conditions or immunosuppressive therapy such as: acute and chronic leukaemias; lymphoma; \nsymptomatic HIV infection; cellular immune deficiencies; and high-dose corticosteroids. \n\n\n\n4\n\nThe safety of seasonal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in children with severe asthma and \nactive wheezing has not been adequately studied. Healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and \npotential risks of administering Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca to these individuals.\n\nIn a study with the seasonal trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (T/LAIV), an increased \nincidence of medically significant wheezing was seen in children 12-23 months of age (see section \n4.8). \n\nVaccine recipients should be informed that Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is an \nattenuated live virus vaccine and has the potential for transmission to immunocompromised contacts. \nVaccine recipients should attempt to avoid, whenever possible, close association with severely \nimmunocompromised individuals (e.g. bone marrow transplant recipients requiring isolation) \nfor 1-2 weeks following vaccination. Shedding of the H5N1 vaccine virus in adults was extremely \nlimited. Peak incidence of vaccine virus recovery occurred 1-2 days post-vaccination in clinical studies\nwith Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca. In circumstances where contact with severely \nimmunocompromised individuals is unavoidable, the potential risk of transmission of the influenza \nvaccine virus should be weighed against the risk of acquiring and transmitting wild-type influenza \nvirus.\n\nVaccine recipients under treatment with influenza antiviral agents should not receive Pandemic \ninfluenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca until 48 hours after the cessation of influenza antiviral therapy.\n\nNo data exist regarding the safety of intranasal administration of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 \nAstraZeneca in children with unrepaired craniofacial malformations.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nChildren and adolescents under 18 years of age receiving salicylate therapy should avoid vaccination \nwith Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca (see section 4.4). Use of salicylates in children \nand adolescents for 4 weeks after vaccination should be avoided unless medically indicated as Reye\u2019s \nsyndrome has been reported following the use of salicylates during wild-type influenza infection.\n\nThe co-administration of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca with inactivated vaccines or \nwith the seasonal vaccine Fluenz Tetra has not been studied.\n\nData regarding co-administration of the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine live, intranasal (T/LAIV)\nwith live attenuated vaccines (measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), varicella vaccine, and \norally-administered poliovirus) are available and suggest that concomitant admininstration of \nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca with these live vaccines may be acceptable. \n\nBased upon the potential for influenza antiviral agents to reduce the effectiveness of Pandemic \ninfluenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca, it is recommended not to administer the vaccine until 48 hours \nafter the cessation of influenza antiviral therapy. Administration of influenza antiviral agents within \ntwo weeks of vaccination may affect the response of the vaccine.\n\nIf influenza antiviral agents and Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca are administered \nconcomitantly, timing and the need for revaccination should be considered based on clinical \njudgement.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data available on the use of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca in pregnant \nwomen. \n\n\n\n5\n\nThere are a moderate amount of data from the use of T/LAIV and the seasonal Fluenz Tetra vaccine in \npregnant women. There was no evidence of significant maternal adverse outcomes in 138 pregnant \nwomen who had a record of receiving the seasonal T/LAIV vaccine in a US-based health insurance \nclaims database. \n\nIn more than 300 case reports in the AstraZeneca safety database of vaccine administration in pregnant \nwomen, no unusual patterns of pregnancy complications or foetal outcomes were observed.\nSimilarly from the VAERS, in 113 reports of pregnant women who had received AstraZeneca\u2019s \n(H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Live, Intranasal, no unusual patterns of pregnancy complications or \nfoetal outcomes were observed. \n\nAnimal developmental toxicity studies conducted with T/LAIV and Fluenz Tetra do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Post-marketing data from occasional \ninadvertent gestational use of the seasonal vaccines offer some reassurance.\n\nHealthcare providers need to assess the benefit and potential risks of administering Pandemic influenza \nvaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca to pregnant women.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is excreted in human milk. \nTherefore, as some viruses are excreted in human milk, the vaccine should not be used during breast-\nfeeding.\n\nFertility\nNo data exist regarding the possible effects of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca on male \nand female fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive \nand use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe assessment of the safety profile for Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is based on a \nlimited number of adult subjects. \n\nIn clinical studies, the safety profile of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca was \ncomparable to the safety profile of the seasonal vaccines T/LAIV and Fluenz Tetra (see section 5.1 for \nmore information).\n\nClinical studies have evaluated the incidence of adverse reactions in 59 adults from 18 to 49 years of \nage receiving at least one dose of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca. Additional data are \nprovided from 289 adults enrolled in studies of vaccine candidates for an additional 7 influenza \nsubtypes and from 240 adults and 259 children enrolled in studies of the monovalent 2009 H1N1 \npandemic vaccine.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions observed in clinical studies conducted with the Pandemic \ninfluenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca in healthy adults was headache (25.4%) and upper respiratory \ninfection (10.2%).\n\nPaediatric population\n\n\n\n6\n\nList of adverse reactions\nFrom clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance with T/LAIV and Fluenz Tetra in over 110,000 \nchildren and adolescents 2 to 17 years of age, the following adverse reaction frequencies are reported:\nVery common (\u2265 1/10)\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10)\nUncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100)\nRare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000)\nVery rare (< 1/10,000)\n\nImmune system disorders\nUncommon: Hypersensitivity reactions (including facial oedema, urticaria and very rare \nanaphylactic reactions)\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nVery common: Decreased appetite\n\nNervous system disorders\nVery common: Headache\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nVery common: Nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea\nUncommon: Epistaxis\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nUncommon: Rash\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nCommon: Myalgia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nVery common: Malaise\nCommon: Pyrexia\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nChildren less than 12 months of age\nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is not indicated for use in infants younger \nthan 12 months of age (see section 4.2).  The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in this population has \nnot been established. No data are available.\n\nIn an active-controlled clinical study (MI-CP111) conducted with T/LAIV in comparison to the \ninjectable influenza trivalent vaccine, an increased rate of hospitalisations (for any cause) \nthrough 180 days after final vaccination dose was observed in infants 6-11 months of age (6.1% \nT/LAIV versus 2.6% injectable influenza vaccine). Most hospitalisations were due to gastrointestinal \nand respiratory tract infections and occurred more than 6 weeks post vaccination. The rate of \nhospitalisations was not increased in T/LAIV recipients 12 months and older and the rates for infants \nand toddlers 12-23 months of age were 3.2% T/LAIV versus 3.5% injectable influenza vaccine. \n\nWheezing in children below 24 months of age\nIn the same study, an increased rate of wheezing through 42 days was observed in infants and \ntoddlers 6-23 months of age (5.9% T/LAIV versus 3.8% injectable influenza vaccine). Corresponding \nrates for infants and toddlers 12-23 months of age were 5.4% and 3.6% for T/LAIV and injectable \ninfluenza vaccine, respectively. A total of 20 subjects (12 T/LAIV, 0.3%; 8 injectable influenza \nvaccine, 0.2%) were hospitalised in association with medically significant wheezing. No deaths \nresulted from these events, and none of the hospitalised children required mechanical ventilation or \nadmission to an intensive care unit. The rate of wheezing was not increased in T/LAIV\nrecipients 24 months of age and older. \n\n\n\n7\n\nChronic conditions\nAlthough safety in children and adolescents with mild to moderate asthma has been established for \nT/LAIV, data in children with other pulmonary diseases or with chronic cardiovascular, metabolic or \nrenal diseases are limited.\n\nIn a study (D153-P515) of children 6 to 17 years of age with asthma (seasonal T/LAIV: n=1,114, \nseasonal injectable influenza vaccine: n=1,115), there were no significant differences between \ntreatment groups in the incidence of asthma exacerbations, mean peak expiratory flow rate, asthma \nsymptom scores, or night-time awakening scores. The incidence of wheezing within 15 days after \nvaccination was lower in T/LAIV recipients relative to seasonal inactivated vaccine recipients (19.5% \nvs. 23.8%, P=0.02).\n\nIn a study (AV010) of children and adolescents 9 to 17 years of age with moderate to severe asthma \n(seasonal T/LAIV: n=24, placebo: n=24), the primary safety criterion, change in percent predicted \nforced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) measured before and after vaccination, did not differ \nbetween treatment arms.\n\nOther special populations:\n\nImmunocompromised\nOverall, the safety profile of T/LAIV in a limited number of subjects with mildly to moderately non-\nHIV related compromised immune function, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV infection, or \ncancer (solid tumors and haematological malignancies) was comparable to that in healthy individuals \nand does not indicate any untoward effect. No data are available for individuals with severe \nimmunosuppression (see section 4.4). In a pandemic situation, the use of Pandemic influenza vaccine \nH5N1 AstraZeneca in mildly to moderately immunosuppressed individuals may be considered after \nweighing the anticipated benefits against the potential risks for the individual.\n\nPost-marketing experience with seasonal T/LAIV\nVery rare reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and exacerbation of symptoms of Leigh syndrome \n(mitochondrial encephalomyopathy) have also been observed.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nAdministration of a higher than recommended dose of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca \nhas not been reported in the small number of subjects who received the vaccine during pre-licensure \nclinical studies. Based on experience with the live attenuated seasonal influenza vaccine, \nadministration of a higher than recommended dose is expected to result in an adverse reaction profile \nthat is comparable to that observed with the recommended dose of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1\nAstraZeneca.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, influenza live attenuated; ATC Code: J07BB03\n\n\n\n8\n\nThe influenza virus strain in Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is (a) cold-adapted (ca);\n(b) temperature-sensitive (ts); and (c) attenuated (att). The virus must infect and replicate in cells \nlining the nasopharynx of the vaccine recipient in order to induce protective immunity.\n\nClinical studies\nThis section describes the clinical experience observed in three pivotal studies conducted with the \nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca in adults. In addition, studies conducted with\nAstraZeneca\u2019s 2009 H1N1 pandemic LAIV and seasonal T/LAIV vaccine are also considered \nsupportive because all these vaccines are manufactured using the same process, administered through \nthe same route, and studied primarily in na\u00efve individuals.\n\nPaediatric studies\n\nH1N1 pandemic LAIV vaccine in children aged 2 to 17 years\n\nIn clinical study MI-CP217, the safety and descriptive immunogenicity of a live attenuated \nmonovalent influenza virus vaccine (derived from A/California/7/2009) developed for the 2009 H1N1 \npandemic were evaluated in a total of 326 randomised subjects (259 subjects monovalent vaccine; 65 \nsubjects placebo) and 324 subjects received one dose of investigational product. Of these subjects, 319 \nreceived a second dose (256 subjects monovalent vaccine; 63 subjects placebo). \n\nFor children regardless of baseline serostatus, seroresponse rates after receipt of monovalent vaccine \nwere 7.8% and 11.1% for Days 15 and 29, respectively, and 32.0% on Day 57. For placebo recipients \nregardless of baseline serostatus, seroresponse rate was 6.3% on Days 15 and 29 and 14.5% on Day \n57. Seroresponse rates were slightly higher among subjects who were seronegative at baseline. In a \nsurveillance study conducted by the US CDC (Griffin, et al, 2011) the effectiveness of the H1N1 \npandemic LAIV vaccine in children 2 through 9 years of age was estimated at 81.9% (95% CI:13.6, \n96.2).\n\nT/LAIV efficacy\n\nT/LAIV\u2019s efficacy data in the paediatric population consist of 9 controlled studies comprising \nover 20,000 infants and toddlers, children and adolescents, conducted during 7 influenza seasons. Four \nplacebo-controlled studies included second season revaccination. T/LAIV has demonstrated \nsuperiority in 3 active-controlled studies with injectable influenza vaccine.

This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency \nwill review any new information on the product every year and this SmPC will be updated as \nnecessary.\n\n\n\n10\n\nAdult studies\n\nAdults aged 18 to 49 years \n\nIn clinical study CIR 217, the safety, infectivity and immunogenicity of a live attenuated vaccine\nderived from A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) influenza isolate were evaluated in 21 subjects who \nreceived one 106.7 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) , with 18 of those subjects receiving a \nsecond dose 4-8 weeks later. Twenty-one additional subjects received one dose of the vaccine virus at \n107.5 TCID50, with 19 of those subjects receiving a second dose 4-8 weeks later. After 1 or 2 doses of \n106.7 TCID50 vaccine, haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and IgA seroresponses were each detected in \n10% subjects, and nasal wash IgA responses were detected in 24% subjects. After 1 or 2 doses of 107.5 \n\nTCID50 vaccine, HAI and IgA seroresponses were each detected in 10% and  52% of subjects and \nnasal IgA responses were detected in 19% of subjects. \n\nIn clinical study CIR 239, the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a live attenuated vaccine \nderived from A/Hong Kong/213/2003 (H5N1) influenza isolate were evaluated in 17 subjects who\nreceived one dose of 107.5 TCID50 of the vaccine intranasally in isolation, with 16 of those subjects \nreceiving a second dose 4-8 weeks later. HAI responses were not detected in any of the subjects after \neither the first or second dose of the vaccine. IgA seroresponse and nasal wash response were each \ndetected in 18% of subjects.\n\nAdults aged 22 to 54 years\n\nClinical study CIR 277 assessed whether prior recipients of pandemic live attenuated influenza H5N1 \nvaccines were primed or established long-lasting immunity that could be detected following the \nsubsequent administration of an inactivated H5N1 vaccine. The study enrolled 69 subjects in 5 groups: \nGroup 1 enrolled 11 subjects who had previously received 2 doses of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 \npandemic live attenuated influenza vaccine (P/LAIV) in 2006-2007; Group 2 enrolled 10 subjects who \nhad previously received 2 doses of the A/Hong Kong/213/2003 H5N1 P/LAIV in 2007; Group 3 \nenrolled 8 subjects who had previously received 2 doses of the A/British Columbia/CN-6/2004 H7N3 \nP/LAIV in 2010 (as a P/LAIV control group); Groups 4 and 5 each enrolled 20 subjects who had not \nbeen previously vaccinated with LAIV and were influenza H5 na\u00efve. Subjects in Groups 1 to 4 \nreceived a single 45-\u03bcg dose of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 pandemic inactivated influenza vaccine \n(P/IIV) while subjects in Group 5 received 2 doses, approximately 28 days apart.\n\nP/LAIV H5N1-primed subjects developed vigorous antibody responses to wild-type H5N1 virus upon \nsubsequent exposure to the inactivated H5N1 vaccine, although such antibody responses were not \ndetectable after the primary 2 doses in the majority of the subjects. Subjects who were primed with \neither the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 P/LAIV or the A/Hong Kong/213/2003 P/LAIV had a significantly \nbetter response to a single dose of inactivated H5N1 vaccine than P/LAIV-na\u00efve subjects. The \nantibody response in A/Vietnam/1203/2004 P/LAIV-primed subjects also exceeded that observed after \n2 doses of inactivated vaccine in P/LAIV-na\u00efve subjects (see Table 3). \n\n\n\n11\n\nTable 3 Serum microneutralization (MN) and haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay\nantibody responses on Days 28 and 56 following administration of an inactivated \nH5N1 vaccine\n\nStudy \ngroup\n\nP/LAIV \npriming \n\ndose\n\nNumber \nof \n\nVietnam \n2004 \n\ninactivat\ned \n\nvaccine \ndoses\n\nNumber\nof \n\nsubjects\n\n28 Days after inactivated \nvaccinea\n\n56 Days after inactivated \nvaccinea\n\nGeometric \nmean titer\n\nSubjects with \n4-fold \n\nantibody rise \n(percentage)b\n\nGeometric \nmean titer\n\nSubjects \nwith 4-fold \n\nantibody rise \n(percentage)\n\nb\n\nMN HAI MN HAI MN HAI MN HAI\n\n1\nH5N1 \n\nVietnam \n2004\n\n1 11 48 87 73 73 25 66 55 82\n\n2\n\nH5N1\nHong \nKong \n2003\n\n1 10 31 29 60 50 22 21 60 40\n\n4 None 1 20 7 8 10 10 4 8 10 10\n\n5 None 2 20c 11 15 30 40 19 21 56 50\n\nData for Group 3, subjects initially vaccinated with an H7N3 P/LAIV are not shown. \naDays are counted relative to the only P/IIV dose for Groups 1-4 and after the first of 2 P/IIV doses for \nGroup 5.\nbSerological response defined as a \u22654-fold rise in antibody titer (\u22651:20).\ncSerum samples were available from 7 subjects in Group 3 on Day 28 and from 18 subjects in Group 5 on \nDay 56.\n\nAntibody response developed rapidly in P/LAIV H5N1-primed subjects. Seven of 11 (64%) subjects \nin Group 1 (ca A/Vietnam/1204/2004 [H5N1]) had \u22654-fold rises in HAI antibody titer by Day 7 \nfollowing receipt of the inactivated vaccine, with a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 165 and a titer \nrange of 20 to 1280 in responders. Of the P/LAIV-na\u00efve subjects, only 10% had \u22654-fold rises by Day \n7. Antibody responses in P/LAIV H5N1-primed subjects were also broader. H5N1 P/LAIV-primed \nsubjects developed antibody responses that neutralised 2 or more clades of H5N1 viruses from the \nA/Goose/Guangdong/1996 H5N1 lineage, whereas few subjects even in the 2-dose inactivated H5N1 \nvaccine group developed cross-clade neutralising antibodies. The affinity of antibodies against the \nHA1 domain of the H5 HA in the H5N1 P/LAIV-primed groups was significantly higher than the 2-\ndose inactivated vaccine group, which correlated with cross-clade H5N1 neutralisation.\n\nSimilar responses were seen with P/LAIV H7N7- and H7N9-primed subjects who developed vigorous \nantibody responses to the corresponding wild-type viruses upon subsequent exposure to the inactivated \nvaccine from the same subtype. For the H7N7 P/LAIV, strong serum antibody responses were detected \nby both MN and HAI in 9 of 13 individuals, with peak titers achieved by Day 14. For the H7N9 \nP/LAIV, 8 of 14 individuals who received a single dose of vaccine and 13 of 16 individuals who \nreceived two doses of vaccine developed strong antibody responses; peak titers were again seen by \nDay 14.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\n\n\n12\n\nNon-clinical data with the Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca, and the seasonal vaccines \nT/LAIV and Fluenz Tetra reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional non-clinical \nstudies of repeated dose toxicity, reproduction and developmental toxicity, local tolerance, and \nneurovirulence.\n\n6.

How to store Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is and what it is used for\n\nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is a vaccine to prevent influenza (flu) in an officially \ndeclared pandemic. It is used in children and adolescents 12 months to less than 18 years of age.\n\nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that happens at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many \ndecades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The signs of pandemic flu are similar to those of ordinary \nflu but may be more serious.\n\nHow Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca works\n\nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is similar to Fluenz Tetra (a nasal influenza vaccine \ncontaining four strains), except Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca provides protection \nagainst a single influenza strain in an officially declared pandemic.\n\nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence system) will \nproduce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause \nthe flu.\n\nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca vaccine virus is grown in chicken eggs. The influenza \nstrain used for the vaccine in an offically declared pandemic is recommended by the World Health \nOrganisation.\n\n\n\n26\n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 \nAstraZeneca\n\nYou should not be given Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca:\n\n\uf0b7 if you have previously had a serious allergic reaction (i.e. life-threatening) to eggs, egg \nproteins, gentamicin, or gelatin or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in \nsection 6 \u201cContents of the pack and other information\u201d). For signs of allergic reactions, see \nsection 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d.  However, in a pandemic situation, your doctor may \nrecommend to give you the vaccine provided that appropriate medical treatement is immediately \navailable in case of an allergic reaction.\n\nIf any of these apply, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination:\n\uf0b7 if the child is less than 12 months of age. Children less than 12 months of age should not \n\nreceive this vaccine because of the risk of side effects.\n\uf0b7 if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction\n\nto eggs, egg proteins, gentamicin, or gelatin or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed \nin section 6 \u201cContents of the pack and other information\u201d).\n\n\uf0b7 if you are already taking acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used \nto relieve pain and lower fever). This is because of the risk of a very rare but serious disease\n(Reye\u2019s syndrome).\n\n\uf0b7 if you have a blood disorder or a cancer that affects the immune system.\n\uf0b7 if you have been told by your doctor that you have a weakened immune system as a result \n\nof a disease, medicine, or other treatment.\n\uf0b7 if you have severe asthma or are currently wheezing.\n\uf0b7 if you are in close contact with someone with a severely weakened immune system\n\n(for example, a bone marrow transplant patient needing isolation).\n\nIf any of these apply, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination. He or she will \ndecide if Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is suitable for you.\n\nOther medicines, other vaccines and Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca\nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if the person being vaccinated is taking, has recently taken or \nmight take any other medicines, including medicines that do not require a prescription.\n\uf0b7 Do not give acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain \n\nand lower fever) to children for 4 weeks after vaccination with Pandemic influenza vaccine \nH5N1 AstraZeneca unless your doctor, nurse or pharmacist tells you otherwise. This is because \nof the risk of Reye\u2019s syndrome, a very rare but serious disease that can affect the brain and liver.\n\n\uf0b7 It is recommended that Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is not given at the \nsame time as influenza-specific antiviral medicines such as oseltamivir and zanamivir. This is \nbecause the vaccine may work less effectively.\n\nYour doctor, nurse or pharmacist will decide if Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca can be \ngiven at the same time as other vaccines.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\uf0b7 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or plan to become pregnant soon, tell your \n\ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination. He or she will decide if Pandemic influenza \nvaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is suitable for you.\n\n\uf0b7 Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is not recommended for breast-feeding\nwomen.\n\n\n\n27\n\nDriving and using machines\n\uf0b7 Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca has no or negligible influence on the ability to \n\ndrive and use machines.\n\n3. How Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is given\n\nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca will be administered under the supervision of a \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist.\n\nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca must only be used as a nasal spray.\n\nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca must not be injected.\n\nPandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca will be given as a spray in each nostril.
