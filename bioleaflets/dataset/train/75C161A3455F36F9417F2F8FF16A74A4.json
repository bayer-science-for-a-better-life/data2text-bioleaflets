NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNeuroBloc 5000 U/ml solution for injection. \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 5000 U Botulinum Toxin Type B. \nEach 0.5 ml vial contains 2500 U Botulinum Toxin Type B. \nEach 1.0 ml vial contains 5000 U Botulinum Toxin Type B. \nEach 2.0 ml vial contains 10,000 U Botulinum Toxin Type B. \nProduced in Clostridium botulinum Serotype B (Bean Strain) cells. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \nClear and colourless to light yellow solution. \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNeuroBloc is indicated for the treatment of cervical dystonia (torticollis) in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNeuroBloc should only be administered by a physician who is familiar with and experience in the \ntreatment of cervical dystonia and in the use of botulinum toxins. \n \nRestricted to hospital use only.  \n \nPosology \n \nThe initial dose is 10,000 U and should be divided between the two to four most affected muscles. \nData from clinical studies suggest that efficacy is dose dependent, but these trials, because they were \nnot powered for a comparison, do not show a significant difference between 5000 U and 10,000 U. \nTherefore an initial dose of 5000 U may also be considered, but a dose of 10,000 U may increase the \nlikelihood of clinical benefit. \n \nInjections should be repeated as required to maintain good function and minimise pain. In long term \nclinical studies, the average dosing frequency was approximately every 12 weeks, however this may \nvary between subjects, and a proportion of patients maintained a significant improvement relative to \nbaseline for 16 weeks or longer. The dosing frequency should therefore be adapted based on the \nclinical assessment/response of an individual patient.  \n \nFor patients with reduced muscle mass the dose should be adjusted according to individual patient \nneed. \n \nThe potency of this medicinal product is expressed in NeuroBloc 5000 U/ml. These units are not \ninterchangeable with the units used to express the potency of other botulinum toxin preparations (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in older people \u2265 65 years of age. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \nStudies have not been carried out in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, the \npharmacological characteristics do not indicate any need to adjust the dose. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of NeuroBloc in children aged less than 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nNeuroBloc must only be administered by intramuscular injection. Particular caution should be paid to \nensure that it is not injected into a blood vessel. \n \nThe initial dose of 10,000 U should be divided between the two to four most affected muscles. \n \nTo allow division of the total dose between several injections, NeuroBloc may be diluted with sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection and the solution used immediately. For instructions on \ndilution of the product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nIndividuals with known neuromuscular diseases (e.g. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or peripheral \nneuropathy) or known neuromuscular junctional disorders (e.g. myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton \nsyndrome) must not be given NeuroBloc. \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNeuroBloc is recommended for intramuscular administration only.  \n \nThe safety of NeuroBloc outside the approved indication has not been established. This warning \nincludes use in children and in any other indication besides cervical dystonia. The risks, which can \ninclude death, may outweigh the potential benefits. \n \nSeroconversion \nAs with many biological/biotechnology proteins used as therapeutic agents, repeated administration of \nNeuroBloc may be associated with development of antibodies to Botulinum Toxin Type B in some \npatients. Immunogenicity data from three long term clinical studies indicate that approximately one \nthird of patients develop antibodies, as determined by the mouse neutralisation/mouse protection assay \ndependent on duration of exposure (see section 5.1).   \n \nAn investigation into the consequence of seroconversion showed that the presence of antibodies was \nnot synonymous with a loss of clinical response, and did not have an impact on the overall safety \nprofile. However, the clinical relevance of the presence of antibodies as determined by the mouse \nneutralisation / mouse protection assay is uncertain. \n \nCaution should be used in patients with bleeding disorders or receiving anticoagulant therapy. \n \nSpread of toxin effect \nNeuromuscular effects related to spread of toxin, distant from the site of administration have been \nreported (see section 4.8). These include dysphagia and breathing difficulties.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n \n\nPre-Existing neuromuscular disorders \nPatients treated with therapeutic doses may experience exaggerated muscle weakness. Patients with \nneuromuscular disorders may be at increased risk of clinically significant effects including severe \ndysphagia and respiratory compromise from typical doses of NeuroBloc (see section 4.3). \n \nThere have been spontaneous reports of dysphagia, aspiration pneumonia and/or potentially fatal \nrespiratory disease, after treatment with Botulinum Toxin Type A/B. \n \nChildren (non approved use) and patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders including \nswallowing disorders are at increased risk of these adverse reactions. In patients with neuromuscular \ndisorders or history of dysphagia and aspiration, botulinum toxins should only be used in an \nexperimental setting under strict medical supervision. \n \nFollowing NeuroBloc treatment, all patients and caregivers should be advised to seek medical \nattention for respiratory difficulties, choking or any new or worsening dysphagia. \n \nDysphagia has been reported following injection to sites other than the cervical musculature. \n \nLack of interchangeability between botulinum toxin products \nThe initial starting dose of 10,000 U (or 5000 U) is relevant only to NeuroBloc (Botulinum Toxin \nType B). These dose units are specific to NeuroBloc only and are not relevant to preparations of \nBotulinum Toxin Type A. The unit dose recommendations for Botulinum Toxin Type A are \nsignificantly lower than those for NeuroBloc and administration of Botulinum Toxin Type A at the \nunit dose recommended for NeuroBloc may result in systemic toxicity and life-threatening clinical \nsequelae. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe effect of administering different botulinum neurotoxin serotypes concurrently is unknown. \nHowever, in clinical studies, NeuroBloc was administered 16 weeks after the injection of Botulinum \nToxin Type A. \n \nCo-administration of NeuroBloc and aminoglycosides or agents interfering with neuromuscular \ntransmission (e.g. curare-like compounds) should be considered with caution. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nAnimal reproduction studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy and embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment. The potential risk for humans is unknown. NeuroBloc should not be used during \npregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with Botulinum Toxin \nType B (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether Botulinum Toxin Type B is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of \nBotulinum Toxin Type B in milk has not been studied in animals. A decision must be made on \nwhether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with NeuroBloc \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of NeuroBloc therapy to \nthe woman. \n \nFertility \nNo fertility studies have been performed and it is not known whether NeuroBloc can affect \nreproduction capacity. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Neurobloc \nmay impair the ability to drive or operate machinery in case of adverse reactions such as muscle \nweakness and eye disorders (blurred vision, eyelid ptosis). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with NeuroBloc treatment were dry mouth, \ndysphagia, dyspepsia, and injection site pain. \n \nAdverse reactions related to spread of toxin distant from the site of administration have been reported: \nexaggerated muscle weakness, dysphagia, dyspnoea, aspiration pneumonia with fatal outcome in some \ncases (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions seen in all clinical studies are listed below according to MedDRA system organ \nclass and in decreasing frequency which is defined as follows: Very Common (>1/10); \nCommon (>1/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (>1/1000 to <1/100). \n \n \nSystem Organ Class Very Common Common \nNervous system disorders dry mouth, headache torticollis (worsening from \n\nbaseline), taste perversion \nEye disorders  blurred vision \nRespiratory thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\n dysphonia \n\nGastrointestinal disorders dysphagia dyspepsia \nMusculoskeletal connective \ntissue and bone disorders \n\n myasthenia \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\ninjection site pain \n \n\nneck pain \ninfluenza like illness \n\n \n \nIn common with Botulinum Toxin Type A, electrophysiological jitter, which is not associated with \nclinical weakness or other electrophysiological abnormalities, may be experienced in some distant \nmuscles. \n \nPost marketing experience \nSide effects related to spread of toxin distant from the site of administration have been reported \n(exaggerated muscle weakness, dysphagia, dyspnoea, aspiration pneumonia with fatal outcome in \nsome cases) (see section 4.4). \n \nThe following effects have also been reported during post marketing use: abnormal accommodation, \nptosis, vomiting, constipation, flu-like symptoms, asthenia, angioedema, rash, urticaria and pruritus. \n \nThe available reports indicate that the product has been used in the paediatric population. Case reports \nare more likely to be serious in children (40%) compared to those in adults and older people (12%), \npossibly as a result of using an inappropriately high dosage for the child (see section 4.9). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nCases of overdose (some with signs of systemic toxicity) have been reported. In the event of an \noverdose, general medical supportive measures should be instituted. Doses of up to 15,000 U have \ninfrequently resulted in clinically significant systemic toxicity in adults. If botulism is clinically \nsuspected, hospitalisation for the monitoring of respiratory function (incipient respiratory failure) may \nbe required. \n \nIn the event of an overdose or injection into a muscle that normally compensates for the cervical \ndystonia, it is conceivable that the dystonia may worsen. As with other botulinum toxins spontaneous \nrecovery will occur over a period of time. \n \nPaediatric use (non approved): in children, clinically significant systemic toxicity has occurred at \ndoses approved for the treatment of adult patients. The risk of spreading of effect is greater than in \nadults, and more frequently severe. This can be due to the high dosages usually used in this \npopulation. \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: muscle relaxant, peripherally acting agents, ATC code: M03AX 01. \n \nMechanism of action \nNeuroBloc is a neuromuscular blocking agent. The mechanism of action of NeuroBloc in blocking \nneuromuscular conduction occurs by a three-step process: \n \n1. Extracellular binding of the toxin to specific acceptors on motor nerve terminals \n2. Internalisation and release of the toxin into the cytosol of the nerve terminals \n3. Inhibition of acetylcholine release from nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction \n \nWhen injected directly into a muscle, NeuroBloc causes a localised paralysis that gradually reverses \nover time. The mechanism by which muscle paralysis is reversed over time remains unknown, but \nmay be associated with the intraneuronal turnover of the affected protein and/or sprouting of the nerve \nending. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nA series of clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NeuroBloc in \nthe treatment of cervical dystonia. These studies have demonstrated the activity of NeuroBloc in both \ntreatment-na\u00efve patients, and patients who have previously received treatment with Botulinum Toxin \nType A, including those that were considered clinically resistant to Botulinum Toxin Type A. \n \nTwo Phase III randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in \npatients with cervical dystonia. Both studies enrolled adult patients (\u00b3 18 years) who had a history of \nreceiving Botulinum Toxin Type A. The first study enrolled patients who were clinically resistant to \ntype A toxin (A-non responders), confirmed by a Frontalis Type A test. The second study enrolled \npatients who continued to respond to type A toxin (A-responders). In the first study, type A resistant \npatients (A-non responders) were randomised to receive placebo or 10,000 U of NeuroBloc and in the \nsecond, type A toxin responsive patients (A-responders) were randomised to receive placebo, 5000 U \nor 10,000 U of toxin. The medicinal product was injected on a single occasion into 2 to 4 of the \n\nhttps://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ema.europa.eu%2Fdocs%2Fen_GB%2Fdocument_library%2FTemplate_or_form%2F2013%2F03%2FWC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n \n \n\nfollowing muscles: splenius capitus, sternocleidomastoid, levator scapulae, trapezius, semispinalis \ncapitus and scalene. The total dose was divided between the selected muscles and 1 to 5 injections per \nmuscle were administered. There were 77 subjects enrolled into the first study and 109 subjects into \nthe second. Patient evaluations continued for 16 weeks post injection. \n \nThe primary efficacy outcome variable for both studies was the Toronto Western Spasmodic \nTorticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS)-Total score (range of possible scores is 0-87) at Week 4. The \nsecondary endpoints included Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) to quantify the Patient Global \nAssessment of change and the Physician Global Assessment of change, both from baseline to Week 4. \nOn these scales, scores of 50 indicate no change, 0 much worse, and 100 much better. Results of \ncomparisons of the primary and secondary efficacy variables are summarised in Table 1. Analysis of \nthe TWSTRS sub scales revealed significant effects on the severity of cervical dystonia and its \nassociated pain and disability. \n \nTable 1 Efficacy Results from Phase III NeuroBloc Studies \n\n STUDY 1 \n(A-Resistant Patients) \n\nSTUDY 2 \n(A-Responsive Patients) \n\nAssessments Placebo 10,000 U Placebo 5000 U 10,000 U \n n = 38 n = 39 n = 36 n = 36 n = 37 \nTWSTRS-Total      \nMean At Baseline 51.2 52.8 43.6 46.4 46.9 \nMean at Week 4 49.2 41.8 39.3 37.1 35.2 \nChange from Baseline -2.0 -11.1 -4.3 -9.3 -11.7 \nP-Value*  0.0001  0.0115 0.0004 \nPatient Global      \nMean at Week 4 39.5 60.2 43.6 60.6 64.6 \nP-Value*  0.0001  0.0010 0.0001 \nPhysician Global      \nMean at Week 4 47.9 60.6 52.0 65.3 64.2 \nP-Value*  0.0001  0.0011 0.0038 \n * Analysis of covariance, two-tailed tests, a = 0.05 \n \nA further randomised, multicentre, double-blind study was conducted to compare the efficacy of \nNeuroBloc (10,000 U) to Botulinum Toxin Type A (150 U) in patients with cervical dystonia who \nhave never previously received a botulinum toxin product. The primary efficacy assessment was the \nTWSTRS Total score, and secondary efficacy assessments included VAS assessment of change \nevaluated by patient and investigator, conducted at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after treatment. The study met \nthe pre-defined criteria for non-inferiority of NeuroBloc compared to Botulinum Toxin Type A, both \nin terms of mean TWSTRS total score at week 4 after first and second treatment sessions, and in terms \nof duration of effect. \n \nThe non-inferiority of NeuroBloc compared to Botulinum Toxin Type A was further supported by a \nresponder analysis where similar percentages of subjects showed improvement in the TWSTRS score \nat Week 4 of Session 1 (86% NeuroBloc and 85% Botox), and a similar proportion of subjects \nexperienced at least a 20% decrease from baseline in the TWSTRS score at Week 4 of Session 1 (51% \nNeuroBloc, 47% Botox). \n \nFurther clinical studies and open label follow-up have shown that subjects can continue to respond to \nNeuroBloc for prolonged periods of time, with some subjects receiving more than 14 treatment \nsessions over a period of more than 3.5 years. In addition to improved function as demonstrated by a \nreduction in TWSTRS-total score, treatment with NeuroBloc was associated with a significant \nreduction in TWSTRS-Pain and pain VAS scores at each treatment session at weeks 4, 8 and 12 \nrelative to baseline. In these studies, the average dosing frequency was approximately every 12 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n \n\nThe immunogenicity of NeuroBloc has been evaluated in two clinical studies and an open-label \nextension study. The presence of antibodies in these studies was assessed using the mouse protection \nassay (also known as the Mouse Neutralization Assay, MNA).   \n \nImmunogenicity data from three long-term clinical studies indicate that approximately one third of \npatients develop antibodies, as determined by the mouse neutralisation/ mouse protection assay \ndependent on duration of exposure. Specifically, these studies showed approximately 19-25% \nseroconverted within 18 months of initiation of treatment, increasing to approximately 33-44% with \nup to 45 months of treatment. An investigation into the consequence of seroconversion showed that \nthe presence of antibodies was not synonymous with a loss of clinical response, and did not have an \nimpact on the overall safety profile. However, the clinical relevance of the presence of antibodies as \ndetermined by the mouse neutralisation/ mouse protection assay is uncertain.   \n \nThe extent and time course of seroconversion were similar in patients with prior toxin A exposure and \nthose who were toxin A na\u00efve, and between toxin A resistant and toxin A responsive patients.  \n  \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNeuroBloc injected intramuscularly produces localised muscle weakness by chemical denervation. \nFollowing local intramuscular injection of NeuroBloc serious adverse events that may have been due \nto systemic effects of Botulinum Toxin Type B, were observed in 12% of adverse reaction cases \nreported during the post-marketing experience (including the following adverse reactions: dry mouth, \ndysphagia and blurred vision). However, no pharmacokinetic or Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism \nand Excretion (ADME) studies have been performed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle dose pharmacology studies in cynomolgus monkeys have shown no effects other than the \nanticipated dose-dependent paralysis of injected muscles, together with some diffusion of toxin at high \ndoses producing similar effects in neighbouring non-injected muscles. \n \nSingle dose intramuscular toxicology studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys. The \nsystemic No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) was shown to be approximately 960 U/kg. The dose \nresulting in death was 2400 U/kg. \n \nBecause of the nature of the product, no animal studies have been carried out to establish the \ncarcinogenic effects of NeuroBloc. Standard tests to investigate the mutagenicity of NeuroBloc have \nnot been performed.  \n \nDevelopment studies in rats and rabbits have shown no evidence of foetal malformations or changes to \nfertility. In the development studies, the No Observed Adverse Effect Dose Level (NOAEL) in rats \nwas 1000 U/kg/day for maternal effects and 3000 U/kg/day for foetal effects. In rabbits, the NOAEL \nwas 0.1 U/kg/day for maternal effects and 0.3 U/kg/day for foetal effects. In the fertility studies the \nNOAEL was 300 U/kg/day for general toxicity in both males and females and 1000 U/kg/day for \nfertility and reproductive performance. \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n26 \n \n \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user  \n\n \nNeuroBloc 5000 U/ml Solution for Injection \n\nBotulinum Toxin Type B \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What NeuroBloc is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use NeuroBloc \n3. How to use NeuroBloc \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store NeuroBloc \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What NeuroBloc is and what it is used for \n \nNeuroBloc injection works by reducing or stopping muscle contractions. It contains the active \ningredient \u2018Botulinum Toxin Type B\u2019.  \n  \nNeuroBloc is used to treat an illness called cervical dystonia (torticollis). This is where you have \ncontractions of your neck or shoulder muscles that you cannot control. \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NeuroBloc \n \nDo not use NeuroBloc: \n- if you are allergic to Botulinum Toxin Type B or any of the other ingredients of NeuroBloc \n\n(listed in section 6) \n- if you have other problems with your nerves or muscles, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \n\n(Lou Gehrig's disease), peripheral neuropathy, myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome \n(muscle weakness or numbness or pain) \n\n- if you have been experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty swallowing \n \nYou must not be given NeuroBloc if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using NeuroBloc: \n- if you have a bleeding problem such as haemophilia  \n- if you have lung problems \n- if you have difficulty swallowing. This is because swallowing problems could make you breathe \n\nfood or liquids into your lungs, which could then cause very serious pneumonia \n \n\n\n\n27 \n \n \n\nGeneral precaution: \nNeuroBloc has been approved for the treatment of cervical dystonia only and should not be used to \ntreat anything else. The safety of NeuroBloc when used to treat other conditions is not known: some \nside effects may be fatal. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nNeuroBloc is not to be used in children aged less than18 years.  \n \nOther medicines and NeuroBloc \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because NeuroBloc can affect the way some medicines work and other medicines \ncan also affect the way NeuroBloc works. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n- aminoglycoside antibiotics for an infection \n- medicines to stop blood clotting, such as warfarin \n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are \ngiven NeuroBloc. \n \nBefore having an operation \nIf you are going to have an operation, please tell your doctor that you have been given NeuroBloc. \nThis is because NeuroBloc can affect the medicines you may be given before a general anaesthetic. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n- you will not normally be given NeuroBloc if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. This is because \n\nit is not known how NeuroBloc affects patients who are pregnant and it is not known if \nNeuroBloc passes into a nursing mother\u2019s breast milk \n\n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nYou may have muscle weakness or eye problems such as blurred vision or eyelid drooping after being \ngiven NeuroBloc. If this happens, do not drive or use any tools or machines. \n \nNeuroBloc contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 10,000 units of NeuroBloc. This means it \nis essentially \u201csodium free\u201d. \n \n3. How to use NeuroBloc \n \nNeuroBloc will be given to you by a doctor with specialist experience in the treatment of cervical \ndystonia and in the use of botulinum toxins. \n \nHow much will be given \n- your doctor will decide how much NeuroBloc to give you  \n- the usual dose is 10,000 units, however, it can be higher or lower \n- if you have had NeuroBloc injections before, your doctor will take into account how well it \n\nworked the other times \n \nHow NeuroBloc is given \n- NeuroBloc will be injected into your neck or shoulder muscles, depending on which ones are \n\ncausing the problem  \n- your doctor may inject part of the dose into different places in your muscles \n \nHaving more injections of NeuroBloc \n- the effects of NeuroBloc will usually last about 12 to 16 weeks  \n- your doctor will decide if you need another injection and how much to give you \n \nIf you think that the effect of NeuroBloc is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor. \n\n\n\n28 \n \n \n\n \nIf you are given more NeuroBloc than you should \n- if you have been given more NeuroBloc than you need, some of your muscles that were not \n\ninjected may feel weak or you may develop symptoms away from the injected muscles, like \ndifficulty in swallowing or breathing. This may occur when higher doses of up to 15,000 units \nare given  \n\n- if you have difficulty breathing or you are worried by any symptoms you develop away from \nthe place of the injection, talk to your doctor immediately. If he/she is unavailable seek \nemergency assistance. You may need urgent medical treatment \n\n \nA serious condition called \u201cbotulism\u201d which causes paralysis of muscles and respiratory failure could \noccur if too much of the active ingredient (botulinum toxin) is injected into the body. If your doctor \nsuspects that botulism may have occurred, you will be admitted to hospital and your breathing \n(respiratory function) will be monitored. Recovery usually takes place over a period of time. \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. They may \nhappen days to weeks after you have had the injection. You may feel pain at the place where you had \nthe injection, but this should wear off after a few minutes. \n \nYou may get a dry mouth and it might become difficult to swallow. In rare cases difficulty in \nswallowing may be severe and choking is possible. If your swallowing difficulty gets worse or you \nhave choking or breathing problems, see a doctor immediately. You may need urgent medical \ntreatment. \n \nAspiration pneumonia caused by food particles or vomit entering into the lungs, and respiratory \ndisease, have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxins (Type A and Type B). These side \neffects have sometimes resulted in death and are possibly related to the spread of botulinum toxin to \nbody parts away from the place where the injection is given. \n \nOther side effects include: \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n- dry mouth \n- difficulty swallowing \n- headache \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n- blurred vision or drooping of your upper eyelid  \n- indigestion or being sick (vomiting) \n- constipation \n- neck pain \n- feeling weak, pain or stiff muscles around your body \n- loss of strength or energy \n- changes in the taste of your food and drink \n- changes in the sound of your voice \n- flu-like symptoms \n \nSkin allergies such as rash with or without paleness, redness, patches, severe itching; and skin \neruptions such as welts or hives have also been reported after receiving NeuroBloc. The frequency of \nthese side effects is not known. \n \nIt is possible that cervical dystonia could become worse after you have had your injection. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n29 \n \n \n\nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n5.
