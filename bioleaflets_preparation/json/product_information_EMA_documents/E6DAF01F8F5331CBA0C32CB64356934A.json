NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nComtan 200 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 200 mg entacapone.\n\nExcipient with known effect\n\nEach tablet contains 1.82 mg sucrose.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet\n\nBrownish-orange, oval, biconvex film-coated tablet with “Comtan” engraved on one side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nEntacapone is indicated as an adjunct to standard preparations of levodopa/benserazide or \nlevodopa/carbidopa for use in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor \nfluctuations, who cannot be stabilised on those combinations.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nEntacapone should only be used in combination with levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa. \nThe prescribing information for these levodopa preparations is applicable to their concomitant use \nwith entacapone.\n\nPosology\n\nOne 200 mg tablet is taken with each levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor dose. The maximum \nrecommended dose is 200 mg ten times daily, i.e. 2,000 mg of entacapone.\n\nEntacapone enhances the effects of levodopa. Hence, to reduce levodopa-related dopaminergic \nadverse reactions, e.g. dyskinesias, nausea, vomiting and hallucinations, it is often necessary to \nadjust levodopa dosage within the first days to first weeks after initiating entacapone treatment. The \ndaily dose of levodopa should be reduced by about 10–30% by extending the dosing intervals and/or \nby reducing the amount of levodopa per dose, according to the clinical condition of the patient.\n\nIf entacapone treatment is discontinued, it is necessary to adjust the dosing of other antiparkinsonian \ntreatments, especially levodopa, to achieve a sufficient level of control of the parkinsonian \nsymptoms.\n\nEntacapone increases the bioavailability of levodopa from standard levodopa/benserazide \npreparations slightly (5–10%) more than from standard levodopa/carbidopa preparations. Hence, \npatients who are taking standard levodopa/benserazide preparations may need a larger reduction of \nlevodopa dose when entacapone is initiated.\n\n\n\n3\n\nRenal impairment\nRenal insufficiency does not affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone and there is no need for dose \nadjustment. However, for patients who are receiving dialysis therapy, a longer dosing interval may \nbe considered (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nSee section 4.3.\n\nElderly (≥65 years)\nNo dosage adjustment of entacapone is required for older people.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Comtan in children below age 18 have not been established. No data are \navailable.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nEntacapone is administered orally and simultaneously with each levodopa/carbidopa or \nlevodopa/benserazide dose.\n\nEntacapone can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n- Hepatic impairment.\n- Phaeochromocytoma.\n- Concomitant use of entacapone and non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO-A and MAO-B) \n\ninhibitors (e.g. phenelzine, tranylcypromine).\n- Concomitant use of a selective MAO-A inhibitor plus a selective MAO-B inhibitor and \n\nentacapone (see section 4.5).\n- A previous history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and/or non-traumatic \n\nrhabdomyolysis.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRhabdomyolysis secondary to severe dyskinesias or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been \nobserved rarely in patients with Parkinson’s disease.\n\nNMS, including rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia, is characterised by motor symptoms (rigidity, \nmyoclonus, tremor), mental status changes (e.g. agitation, confusion, coma), hyperthermia, autonomic \ndysfunction (tachycardia, labile blood pressure) and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase. In \nindividual cases, only some of these symptoms and/or findings may be evident.\n\nNeither NMS nor rhabdomyolysis have been reported in association with entacapone treatment from \ncontrolled trials in which entacapone was discontinued abruptly. Since the introduction into the \nmarket, isolated cases of NMS have been reported, especially following abrupt reduction or \ndiscontinuation of entacapone and other concomitant dopaminergic medicinal products. When \nconsidered necessary, withdrawal of entacapone and other dopaminergic treatment should proceed \nslowly, and if signs and/or symptoms occur despite a slow withdrawal of entacapone, an increase in \nlevodopa dosage may be necessary.\n\nEntacapone therapy should be administered cautiously to patients with ischaemic heart disease.\n\nBecause of its mechanism of action, entacapone may interfere with the metabolism of medicinal \n\n\n\n4\n\nproducts containing a catechol group and potentiate their action. Thus, entacapone should be \nadministered cautiously to patients being treated with medicinal products metabolised by catechol-O-\nmethyl transferase (COMT), e.g. rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, \ndobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, and apomorphine (see also section 4.5).\n\nEntacapone is always given as an adjunct to levodopa treatment. Hence, the precautions valid for \nlevodopa treatment should also be taken into account for entacapone treatment. Entacapone increases \nthe bioavailability of levodopa from standard levodopa/benserazide preparations 5–10% more than \nfrom standard levodopa/carbidopa preparations. Consequently, adverse dopaminergic reactions may \nbe more frequent when entacapone is added to levodopa/benserazide treatment (see also section 4.8). \nTo reduce levodopa-related dopaminergic adverse reactions, it is often necessary to adjust levodopa \ndosage within the first days to first weeks after initiating entacapone treatment, according to the \nclinical condition of the patient (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nEntacapone may aggravate levodopa-induced orthostatic hypotension. Entacapone should be given \ncautiously to patients who are taking other medicinal products which may cause orthostatic \nhypotension.\n\nIn clinical studies, undesirable dopaminergic effects, e.g. dyskinesia, were more common in patients \nwho received entacapone and dopamine agonists (such as bromocriptine), selegiline or amantadine \ncompared to those who received placebo with this combination. The doses of other antiparkinsonian \nmedicinal products may need to be adjusted when entacapone treatment is initiated.\n\nEntacapone in association with levodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of \nsudden sleep onset in patients with Parkinson’s disease and caution should therefore be exercised \nwhen driving or operating machines (see also section 4.7).\n\nFor patients experiencing diarrhoea, a follow-up of weight is recommended in order to avoid \npotential excessive weight decrease. Prolonged or persistent diarrhoea appearing during use of\nentacapone may be a sign of colitis. In the event of prolonged or persistent diarrhoea, the medicinal \nproduct should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy and investigations considered.\n\nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients \nand carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including \npathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge \neating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other \ndopaminergic treatments such as Comtan in association with levodopa. Review of treatment is \nrecommended if such symptoms develop.\n\nFor patients who experience progressive anorexia, asthenia and weight decrease within a relatively \nshort period of time, a general medical evaluation including liver function should be considered.\n\nComtan tablets contain sucrose. Therefore, patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this \nmedicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction of entacapone with carbidopa has been observed with the recommended treatment \nschedule. Pharmacokinetic interaction with benserazide has not been studied.\n\nIn single-dose studies in healthy volunteers, no interactions were observed between entacapone and \nimipramine or between entacapone and moclobemide. Similarly, no interactions between entacapone\nand selegiline were observed in repeated-dose studies in parkinsonian patients. However, the \nexperience of the clinical use of entacapone with several medicinal products, including MAO-A \ninhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as desipramine, \n\n\n\n5\n\nmaprotiline and venlafaxine, and medicinal products that are metabolised by COMT (e.g. catechol-\nstructured compounds: rimiterol, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, \nalpha-methyldopa, apomorphine, and paroxetine) is still limited. Caution should be exercised when \nthese medicinal products are used concomitantly with entacapone (see also sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nEntacapone may be used with selegiline (a selective MAO-B inhibitor), but the daily dose of \nselegiline should not exceed 10 mg.\n\nEntacapone may form chelates with iron in the gastrointestinal tract. Entacapone and iron \npreparations should be taken at least 2–3 hours apart (see section 4.8).\n\nEntacapone binds to human albumin binding site II which also binds several other medicinal \nproducts, including diazepam and ibuprofen. Clinical interaction studies with diazepam and non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products have not been carried out. According to in vitro\nstudies, significant displacement is not anticipated at therapeutic concentrations of the medicinal \nproducts.\n\nDue to its affinity to cytochrome P450 2C9 in vitro (see section 5.2), entacapone may potentially \ninterfere with medicinal products with metabolism dependent on this isoenzyme, such as S-warfarin. \nHowever, in an interaction study in healthy volunteers, entacapone did not change the plasma levels \nof S-warfarin, while the AUC for R-warfarin increased on average by 18% [CI90 11–26%]. The INR \nvalues increased on average by 13% [CI90 6–19%]. Thus, control of INR is recommended when \nentacapone treatment is initiated for patients receiving warfarin.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nNo overt teratogenic or primary foetotoxic effects were observed in animal studies in which the \nexposure levels of entacapone were markedly higher than the therapeutic exposure levels. As there is \nno experience in pregnant women, entacapone should not be used during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIn animal studies entacapone was excreted in milk. The safety of entacapone in infants is unknown. \nWomen should not breast-feed during treatment with entacapone.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nComtan in association with levodopa may have a major influence on the ability to drive and use \nmachines. Entacapone may, together with levodopa, cause dizziness and symptomatic orthostatism. \nTherefore, caution should be exercised when driving or using machines.\n\nPatients being treated with entacapone in association with levodopa and presenting with somnolence \nand/or sudden sleep onset episodes must be instructed to refrain from driving or engaging in \nactivities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death \n(e.g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes have resolved (see also section 4.4).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions caused by entacapone relate to the increased dopaminergic \nactivity and occur most commonly at the beginning of treatment. Reduction of levodopa dosage \ndecreases the severity and frequency of these reactions. The other major class of adverse reactions \nare gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation and \n\n\n\n6\n\ndiarrhoea. Urine may be discoloured reddish-brown by entacapone, but this is a harmless \nphenomenon.\n\nUsually the adverse reactions caused by entacapone are mild to moderate. In clinical studies the most \ncommon adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of entacapone treatment have been \ngastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea, 2.5%) and increased dopaminergic adverse reactions of \nlevodopa (e.g. dyskinesias, 1.7%).\n\nDyskinesias (27%), nausea (11%), diarrhoea (8%), abdominal pain (7%) and dry mouth (4.2%) were \nreported significantly more often with entacapone than with placebo in pooled data from clinical \nstudies involving 406 patients taking the medicinal product and 296 patients taking placebo.\n\nSome of the adverse reactions, such as dyskinesia, nausea, and abdominal pain, may be more \ncommon with the higher doses (1,400 to 2,000 mg per day) than with the lower doses of entacapone.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following adverse reactions, listed below in Table 1, have been accumulated both from clinical \nstudies with entacapone and since the introduction of entacapone into the market.\n\nTable 1* Adverse drug reactions\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nCommon: Insomnia, hallucinations, confusion, paroniria\nVery rare: Agitation\n\nNervous system disorders\nVery common: Dyskinesia\nCommon: Parkinsonism aggravated, dizziness, dystonia, hyperkinesia\n\nCardiac disorders**\nCommon: Ischaemic heart disease events other than myocardial \n\ninfarction (e.g. angina pectoris)\nUncommon: Myocardial infarction\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nVery common: Nausea\nCommon: Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dry mouth, constipation, vomiting\nVery rare: Anorexia\nNot known: Colitis\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nRare: Hepatic function tests abnormal\nNot known: Hepatitis with mainly cholestatic features (see section 4.4)\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nRare: Erythematous or maculopapular rash\nVery rare: Urticaria\nNot known: Skin, hair, beard and nail discolourations\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nVery common: Urine discolouration\n\n\n\n7\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon: Fatigue, sweating increased, fall\nVery rare: Weight decrease\n\n* Adverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency, the most frequent first, using the \nfollowing convention: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot \nbe estimated from the available data, since no valid estimate can be derived from clinical trials \nor epidemiological studies).\n\n** The incidence rates of myocardial infarction and other ischaemic heart disease events (0.43% \nand 1.54%, respectively) are derived from an analysis of 13 double-blind studies involving \n2,082 patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations receiving entacapone.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nEntacapone in association with levodopa has been associated with isolated cases of excessive \ndaytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes.\n\nImpulse control disorders: Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive \nspending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine \nagonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments such as Comtan in association with levodopa (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nIsolated cases of NMS have been reported following abrupt reduction or discontinuation of \nentacapone and other dopaminergic treatments.\n\nIsolated cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe post-marketing data include isolated cases of overdose in which the reported highest daily dose of \nentacapone has been 16,000 mg. The acute symptoms and signs in these cases of overdose included \nconfusion, decreased activity, somnolence, hypotonia, skin discolouration and urticaria. Management \nof acute overdose is symptomatic.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: other dopaminergic agents, ATC code: N04BX02.\n\nEntacapone belongs to a new therapeutic class, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors. It \nis a reversible, specific, and mainly peripherally acting COMT inhibitor designed for concomitant \nadministration with levodopa preparations. Entacapone decreases the metabolic loss of levodopa to \n3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) by inhibiting the COMT enzyme. This leads to a higher levodopa AUC. \nThe amount of levodopa available to the brain is increased. Entacapone thus prolongs the clinical \nresponse to levodopa.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8\n\nEntacapone inhibits the COMT enzyme mainly in peripheral tissues. COMT inhibition in red blood \ncells closely follows the plasma concentrations of entacapone, thus clearly indicating the reversible \nnature of COMT inhibition.\n\nClinical studies\n\nIn two phase III double-blind studies in a total of 376 patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-\ndose motor fluctuations, entacapone or placebo was given with each levodopa/dopa decarboxylase \ninhibitor dose. The results are given in Table 2. In study I, daily ON time (hours) was measured from \nhome diaries and in study II, the proportion of daily ON time.\n\nTable 2 Daily ON time (Mean ± SD)\n\nStudy I: Daily On time (h)\nEntacapone (n=85) Placebo (n=86) Difference\n\nBaseline 9.3±2.2 9.2±2.5\n\nWeek 8-24 10.7±2.2 9.4±2.6 1 h 20 min\n(8.3%)\nCI95% 45 min, 1 h 56\n\nStudy II: Proportion of daily On time (%)\nEntacapone (n=103) Placebo (n=102) Difference\n\nBaseline 60.0±15.2 60.8±14.0\n\nWeek 8-24 66.8±14.5 62.8±16.80 4.5% (0 h 35 min)\nCI95% 0.93%, 7.97%\n\nThere were corresponding decreases in OFF time.\n\nThe % change from baseline in OFF time was –24% in the entacapone group and 0% in the placebo \ngroup in study I. The corresponding figures in study II were –18% and –5%.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nGeneral characteristics of the active substance\n\nAbsorption\nThere are large intra- and interindividual variations in the absorption of entacapone.\n\nThe peak concentration (Cmax) in plasma is usually reached about one hour after ingestion of a \n200 mg entacapone tablet. The substance is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism. The \nbioavailability of entacapone is about 35% after an oral dose. Food does not affect the absorption of \nentacapone to any significant extent.\n\nDistribution\nAfter absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, entacapone is rapidly distributed to the peripheral \ntissues with a distribution volume of 20 litres at steady state (Vdss). Approximately 92% of the dose \nis eliminated during ß-phase with a short elimination half-life of 30 minutes. The total clearance of \nentacapone is about 800 ml/min.\n\nEntacapone is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. In human plasma the \nunbound fraction is about 2.0% in the therapeutic concentration range. At therapeutic concentrations, \nentacapone does not displace other extensively bound substances (e.g. warfarin, salicylic acid, \nphenylbutazone, or diazepam), nor is it displaced to any significant extent by any of these substances\nat therapeutic or higher concentrations.\n\n\n\n9\n\nBiotransformation\nA small amount of entacapone, the (E)-isomer, is converted to its (Z)-isomer. The (E)-isomer \naccounts for 95% of the AUC of entacapone. The (Z)-isomer and traces of other metabolites account \nfor the remaining 5%.\n\nData from in vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations indicate that entacapone \ninhibits cytochrome P450 2C9 (IC50 4 µM). Entacapone showed little or no inhibition of other types \nof P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A and CYP2C19) (see section \n4.5).\n\nElimination\nThe elimination of entacapone occurs mainly by non-renal metabolic routes. It is estimated that 80–\n90% of the dose is excreted in faeces, although this has not been confirmed in man. Approximately \n10–20% is excreted in urine. Only traces of entacapone are found unchanged in urine. The major part \n(95%) of the product excreted in urine is conjugated with glucuronic acid. Of the metabolites found \nin urine only about 1% have been formed through oxidation.\n\nCharacteristics in patients\n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of entacapone are similar in both young people and older people. \nThe metabolism of the medicinal product is slowed in patients with mild to moderate liver \ninsufficiency (Child-Pugh Class A and B), which leads to an increased plasma concentration of \nentacapone in both the absorption and elimination phases (see section 4.3). Renal impairment does \nnot affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone. However, a longer dosing interval may be considered \nfor patients who are receiving dialysis therapy.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. In repeated dose \ntoxicity studies, anaemia most likely due to iron chelating properties of entacapone was observed. \nRegarding reproduction toxicity, decreased foetal weight and a slightly delayed bone development \nwere noticed in rabbits at systemic exposure levels in the therapeutic range.\n\n6.

What Comtan is and what it is used for\n\nComtan tablets contain entacapone and are used together with levodopa to treat Parkinson’s disease. \nComtan aids levodopa in relieving the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Comtan has no effect on \nrelieving the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease unless taken with levodopa.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Comtan\n\nDo not take Comtan\n if you are allergic to entacapone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6);\n if you have a tumour of the adrenal gland (known as pheochromocytoma; this may increase the \n\nrisk of severe high blood pressure);\n if you are taking certain antidepressants (ask your doctor or pharmacist whether your \n\nantidepressive medicine can be taken together with Comtan);\n if you have liver disease;\n if you have ever suffered from a rare reaction to antipsychotic medicines called neuroleptic \n\nmalignant syndrome (NMS). See Section 4 Possible side effects for the characteristics of \nNMS;\n\n if you have ever suffered from a rare muscle disorder called rhabdomyolysis which was not \ncaused by injury.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Comtan:\n if you have ever had a heart attack or any other diseases of the heart;\n if you are taking a medicine which may cause dizziness or light-headedness (low blood \n\npressure) when rising from a chair or bed;\n if you experience prolonged diarrhoea consult your doctor as it may be a sign of inflammation \n\nof the colon;\n if you experience diarrhoea, monitoring of your weight is recommended in order to avoid \n\n\n\n20\n\npotentially excessive weight loss;\n if you experience increasing loss of appetite, weakness, exhaustion and weight loss within a \n\nrelatively short period of time, a general medical evaluation including liver function should be \nconsidered.\n\nTell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices you are developing urges or cravings to behave in \nways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain \nactivities that could harm yourself or others. These behaviours are called impulse control disorders \nand can include addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or a \npreoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to review your \ntreatments.\n\nAs Comtan tablets will be taken together with other levodopa medicines, please also read the package \nleaflets of these medicines carefully.\n\nThe dose of other medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease may need to be adjusted when you start \ntaking Comtan. Follow the instructions that your doctor has given you.\n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a serious but rare reaction to certain medicines, and may \noccur especially when Comtan and other medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease are suddenly stopped \nor the dose is suddenly reduced. For the characteristics of NMS see Section 4 Possible side effects. \nYour doctor may advise you to slowly discontinue the treatment with Comtan and other medicines to \ntreat Parkinson’s disease.\n\nComtan taken with levodopa may cause drowsiness and may cause you to sometimes suddenly fall \nasleep. If this happens, you should not drive or use any tools or machines (see “Driving and using \nmachines”).\n\nOther medicines and Comtan\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. In particular please tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following:\n rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, \n\napomorphine;\n antidepressants including desipramine, maprotiline, venlafaxine, paroxetine;\n warfarin used to thin the blood;\n iron supplements. Comtan may make it harder for you to digest iron. Therefore, do not take \n\nComtan and iron supplements at the same time. After taking one of them, wait at least 2 to \n3 hours before taking the other.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nDo not use Comtan during pregnancy or if you are breast-feeding.\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nComtan taken together with levodopa may lower your blood pressure, which may make you feel \nlight-headed or dizzy. Be particularly careful when you drive or when you use tools or machinery.\n\nIn addition, Comtan taken with levodopa may make you feel very drowsy, or cause you to sometimes \nsuddenly fall asleep.\n\nDo not drive or operate machinery if you experience these side effects.\n\nComtan contains sucrose\nComtan tablets contain a sugar called sucrose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \n\n\n\n21\n\nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.\n\n3. How to take Comtan\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nComtan is taken together with medicines containing levodopa (either levodopa/carbidopa \npreparations or levodopa/benserazide preparations). You may also use other medicines to treat \nParkinson’s disease at the same time.\n\nThe recommended dose of Comtan is one 200 mg tablet with each levodopa dose. The maximum \nrecommended dose is 10 tablets per day, i.e. 2,000 mg of Comtan.\n\nIf you are receiving dialysis for renal insufficiency, your doctor may tell you to increase the time\nbetween doses.\n\nTo open the bottle for the first time: open the closure, \nand then press with your thumb on the seal until it \nbreaks. See picture 1.\n\nPicture 1\n\nUse in children and adolescents\nExperience with Comtan in patients under 18 years is limited. Therefore, the use of Comtan in \nchildren or adolescents cannot be recommended.\n\nIf you take more Comtan than you should\nIn the event of an overdose, consult your doctor, pharmacist or the nearest hospital immediately.\n\nIf you forget to take Comtan\nIf you forget to take the Comtan tablet with your levodopa dose, you should continue the treatment \nby taking the next Comtan tablet with your next levodopa dose.\n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.\n\nIf you stop taking Comtan\nDo not stop taking Comtan unless your doctor tells you to.\n\nWhen stopping, your doctor may need to re-adjust the dosage of your other medicines to treat \nParkinson’s disease. Suddenly stopping Comtan and other medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease \nmay result in unwanted side effects. See Section 2 Warnings and precautions.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Usually \nside effects caused by Comtan are mild to moderate.\n\nSome of the side effects are often caused by the increased effects of levodopa therapy and are most \ncommon at the start of treatment. If you experience such effects at the start of treatment with Comtan \nyou should contact your doctor who may decide to adjust your dosage of levodopa.\n\n\n\n22\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\n Uncontrollable movements with difficulty in performing voluntary movements (dyskinesias);\n feeling sick (nausea);\n harmless reddish-brown discolouration of urine.\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n Excessive movements (hyperkinesias), worsening of symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, \n\nprolonged muscle cramps (dystonia);\n being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth;\n dizziness, tiredness, increased sweating, fall;\n hallucinations (seeing/hearing/feeling/smelling things that are not really there), sleeplessness,\n\nvivid dreams, and confusion;\n heart or artery disease events (e.g. chest pain).\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n Heart attack.\n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people):\n Rashes;\n abnormal results in liver function test.\n\nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people):\n Agitation;\n decreased appetite, weight loss;\n hives.\n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data):\n Inflammation of the colon (colitis), inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) with yellowing of the \n\nskin and whites of the eyes;\n discolouration of the skin, hair, beard and nails.\n\nWhen Comtan is given at higher doses:\nIn doses of 1,400 to 2,000 mg per day, the following side effects are more common:\n Uncontrollable movements;\n nausea;\n abdominal pain.\n\nOther important side effects which may occur:\n Comtan taken with levodopa may rarely make you feel very drowsy during the day, and cause \n\nyou to suddenly fall asleep;\n\n Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a rare severe reaction to medicines used to treat \ndisorders of the nervous system. It is characterised by stiffness, muscle twitching, shaking, \nagitation, confusion, coma, high body temperature, increased heart rate and unstable blood \npressure;\n\n a rare severe muscle disorder (rhabdomyolysis) which causes pain, tenderness and weakness \nof the muscles and may lead to kidney problems.\n\nYou may experience the following side effects:\n Inability to resist the impulse to perform an action that could be harmful, which may include:\n\n strong impulse to gamble excessively despite serious personal or family consequences.\n altered or increased sexual interest and behaviour of significant concern to you or to \n\nothers, for example, an increased sexual drive.\n\n\n\n23\n\n uncontrollable excessive shopping or spending.\n binge eating (eating large amounts of food in a short time period) or compulsive eating \n\n(eating more food than normal and more than is needed to satisfy your hunger).\n\nTell your doctor if you experience any of these behaviours; they will discuss ways of \nmanaging or reducing the symptoms.\n\nReporting of side effects\n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \n\nof this medicine.\n\n5.
