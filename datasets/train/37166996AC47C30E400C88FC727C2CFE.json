This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section \n4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRolufta Ellipta 55 micrograms inhalation powder, pre-dispensed \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach single inhalation provides a delivered dose (the dose leaving the mouthpiece of the inhaler) of \n55 micrograms umeclidinium  (equivalent to 65  micrograms of umeclidinium bromide) This corresponds to \na pre-dispensed dose of 62.5  micrograms umeclidinium equivalent to 74.2  micrograms umeclidinium \nbromide. \n \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nEach delivered dose contains approximately 12.5 mg of lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nInhalation powder, pre-dispensed (inhalation powder). \n \nWhite powder in a grey inhaler (Ellipta) with a light green mouthpiece cover and a dose counter. \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRolufta Ellipta is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients \nwith chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults  \n\nThe recommended dose is one inhalation of umeclidinium bromide once daily.  \n \nRolufta Ellipta should be administered once daily at the same time of the day each day to maintain \nbronchodilation. The maximum dose is one inhalation of umeclidinium bromide once daily. \n \nSpecial populations  \n\nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Rolufta Ellipta has not \nbeen studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be used with caution (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Rolufta Ellipta in the paediatric population (under 18 years of age) in the \nindication for COPD. \n\nMethod of administration  \n \nRolufta Ellipta is for inhalation use only. \n \nThe following instructions for the 30 dose inhaler (30 day supply) also apply to the 7 dose inhaler (7 day \nsupply). \n \nThe Ellipta inhaler contains pre-dispensed doses and is ready to use. \n \nThe inhaler is packaged in a tray containing a desiccant sachet, to reduce moisture. The desiccant sachet \nshould be thrown away and it should not be opened, eaten or inhaled. \n \nThe patient should be advised to not open the tray until they are ready to inhale a dose. \n \nThe inhaler will be in the \u2018closed\u2019 position when it is first taken out of its sealed tray. The \u201cDiscard by\u201d date \nshould be written on the inhaler label in the space provided. The \u201cDiscard by\u201d date is 6 weeks from the date \nof opening the tray. After this date the inhaler should no longer be used. The tray can be discarded after first \nopening.  \nIf the inhaler cover is opened and closed without inhaling the medicinal product, the dose will be lost. The \nlost dose will be securely held inside the inhaler, but it will no longer be available to be inhaled. \n \nIt is not possible to accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in one inhalation. \n \nInstructions for use: \n \na) Prepare a dose \n \nOpen the cover when ready to inhale a dose. The inhaler should not be shaken. \n \nSlide the cover down until a \u201cclick\u201d is heard. The medicinal product is now ready to be inhaled. \n \nThe dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. If the dose counter does not count down as the \u201cclick\u201d is \nheard, the inhaler will not deliver a dose and should be taken back to a pharmacist for advice. \n \nb) How to inhale the medicinal product \n \nThe inhaler should be held away from the mouth breathing out as far as is comfortable. But not breathing out \ninto the inhaler. \n \nThe mouthpiece should be placed between the lips and the lips should then be closed firmly around it. The \nair vents should not be blocked with fingers during use. \n \n\n\u2022 Inhale with one long, steady, deep breath in. This breath should be held in for as long as possible (at \nleast 3-4 seconds). \n\n\u2022 Remove the inhaler from the mouth. \n\u2022 Breathe out slowly and gently. \n\n \nThe medicinal product may not be tasted or felt, even when using the inhaler correctly. \n \nThe mouthpiece of the inhaler may be cleaned using a dry tissue before closing the cover. \n \nc) Close the inhaler \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n \nSlide the cover upwards as far as it will go, to cover the mouthpiece. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAsthma \nUmeclidinium bromide should not be used in patients with asthma since it has not been studied in this patient \npopulation. \n \nParadoxical bronchospasm \nAdministration of umeclidinium bromide may produce paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-\nthreatening. Treatment should be discontinued immediately if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs and \nalternative therapy instituted if necessary. \n \nDeterioration of disease \nUmeclidinium bromide is intended for the maintenance treatment of COPD. It should not be used for the \nrelief of acute symptoms, i.e. as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. Acute \nsymptoms should be treated with an inhaled short-acting bronchodilator. Increasing use of short-acting \nbronchodilators to relieve symptoms indicates deterioration of control. In the event of deterioration of COPD \nduring treatment with umeclidinium bromide, a re-evaluation of the patient and of the COPD treatment \nregimen should be undertaken.  \n \nCardiovascular effects \nCardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, may be seen after \nthe administration of muscarinic receptor antagonists including umeclidinium bromide. In addition, patients \nwith clinically significant uncontrolled cardiovascular disease were excluded from clinical studies. \nTherefore, umeclidinium bromide should be used with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular \ndisorders, particularly cardiac arrhythmias. \n \nAntimuscarinic activity  \nConsistent with its antimuscarinic activity, umeclidinium bromide should be used with caution in patients \nwith urinary retention or with narrow-angle glaucoma. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not use this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nClinically significant interactions mediated by umeclidinium bromide at clinical doses are considered \nunlikely due to the low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing. \n \nOther antimuscarinics  \nCo-administration of umeclidinium bromide with other long-acting muscarinic antagonists or medicinal \nproducts containing this active substance has not been studied and is not recommended as it may potentiate \nknown inhaled muscarinic antagonist adverse reactions. \nMetabolic and transporter based interactions  \nUmeclidinium bromide is a substrate of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). The steady-state \npharmacokinetics of umeclidinium bromide were assessed in healthy volunteers lacking CYP2D6 (poor \nmetabolisers). No effect on umeclidinium AUC or Cmax was observed at a dose 4-fold higher than the \ntherapeutic dose. An approximately 1.3-fold increase in umeclidinium bromide AUC was observed at an 8-\n\n\n\n5 \n\nfold higher dose with no effect on umeclidinium bromide Cmax. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no \nclinically relevant drug interaction is expected when umeclidinium is co-administered with CYP2D6 \ninhibitors or when administered to subjects genetically deficient in CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolisers). \n \nUmeclidinium bromide is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter. The effect of the moderate P-gp \ninhibitor verapamil (240 mg once daily) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of umeclidinium bromide was \nassessed in healthy volunteers. No effect of verapamil was observed on umeclidinium bromide Cmax. An \napproximately 1.4-fold increase in umeclidinium bromide AUC was observed. Based on the magnitude of \nthese changes, no clinically relevant interaction is expected when umeclidinium bromide is co-administered \nwith P-gp inhibitors. \n \nOther medicinal products for COPD \nAlthough no formal in vivo interaction studies have been performed, inhaled umeclidinium bromide has been \nused concomitantly with other COPD medicinal products including short and long acting sympathomimetic \nbronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids without clinical evidence of interactions. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of umeclidinium bromide in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nUmeclidinium bromide should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the mother justifies \nthe potential risk to the fetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether umeclidinium bromide is excreted in human milk. A risk to breastfed \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded.  \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Rolufta Ellipta therapy \ntaking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of umeclidinium bromide on human fertility. Animal studies indicate no \neffects of umeclidinium bromide on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nUmeclidinium bromide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with Rolufta Ellipta were nasopharyngitis and upper \nrespiratory tract infection. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe safety profile of umeclidinium bromide was evaluated from 1663 patients with COPD who received \ndoses of 55 micrograms or greater for up to one year. This includes 576 patients who received the \nrecommended dose of 55 micrograms once daily. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nThe frequencies assigned to the adverse reactions identified in the table below include crude incidence rates \nobserved from four efficacy studies and the long-term safety study (which involved 1,412 patients who \nreceived umeclidinium bromide). \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n \n\nSystem Organ Class \n \n\nAdverse reactions Frequency \n\nInfections and infestations Nasopharyngitis \nUpper respiratory tract infection \nUrinary tract infection  \nSinusitis \nPharyngitis \n\nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nUncommon \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity reactions including: \nRash, urticaria and pruritus \n\n \nUncommon \n\nNervous system disorders Headache \nDysgeusia \nDizziness \n\nCommon \nUncommon \nNot known \n\nEye disorders Glaucoma \nVision blurred \nIntraocular pressure increased \nEye pain \n\nNot known \nNot known \nNot known \nRare \n\nCardiac disorders Atrial fibrillation \nRhythm idioventricular \nSupraventricular tachycardia \nSupraventricular extrasystoles \nTachycardia \n\nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nCommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders  \n\nCough Common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Constipation \nDry mouth \n\ncommon \nUncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRash Uncommon \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Urinary retention \nDysuria \n\nNot known \nNot known \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAn overdose of umeclidinium bromide will likely produce signs and symptoms consistent with the known \ninhaled muscarinic antagonist adverse effects (e.g. dry mouth, visual accommodation disturbances and \ntachycardia). \n \nIf overdose occurs, the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, anticholinergics, ATC code: R03BB07 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nUmeclidinium bromide is a long acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (also referred to as an \nanticholinergic). It is a quinuclidine derivative that is a muscarinic receptor antagonist with activity across \nmultiple muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes. Umeclidinium bromide exerts its bronchodilatory activity \nby competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine with muscarinic cholinergic receptors on airway \nsmooth muscle. It demonstrates slow reversibility at the human M3 muscarinic receptor subtype in vitro and \na long duration of action in vivo when administered directly to the lungs in pre-clinical models. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn a Phase III, 6-month study (DB2113373) Rolufta Ellipta provided a clinically meaningful improvement \nover placebo in lung function (as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]) over 24 hours \nfollowing once daily administration, which was evident at 30 minutes following administration of the first \ndose (improvement over placebo by 102 mL, p<0.001*). The mean peak improvements in FEV1 within the \nfirst 6 hours following dosing relative to placebo were 130 ml (p<0.001*) at Week 24. There was no \nevidence for tachyphylaxis in the effect of Rolufta Ellipta over time. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology  \n \nThe effect of umeclidinium 500 micrograms (pre-dispensed) on the QT interval was evaluated in a placebo- \nand moxifloxacin-controlled QT trial of 103 healthy volunteers. Following repeat doses of umeclidinium \n500 micrograms once daily for 10 days, no clinically relevant effect on prolongation of QT interval \n(corrected using the Fridericia method) or effects on heart rate were observed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe clinical efficacy of Rolufta Ellipta administered once daily was evaluated in 904 adult patients who \nreceived umeclidinium bromide or placebo from two pivotal Phase III clinical studies with a clinical \ndiagnosis of COPD; a 12-week study (AC4115408) and a 24-week study (DB2113373). \n \nPivotal Efficacy Studies: \nEffects on lung function \nIn both of the pivotal 12-week and 24-week studies, Rolufta Ellipta demonstrated statistically significant and \nclinically meaningful improvements in lung function (as defined by change from baseline trough FEV1 at \nWeek 12 and Week 24 respectively, which was the primary efficacy endpoint in each study) compared with \nplacebo (see Table 1). The bronchodilatory effects with Rolufta Ellipta compared with placebo were evident \nafter the first day of treatment in both studies and were maintained over the 12-week and 24-week treatment \nperiods. \n \nThere was no attenuation of the bronchodilator effect over time. \n \n\n                                                      \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 1:  Trough FEV1 (ml) at Week 12 and Week 24 (primary endpoint)  \n \nTreatment with Rolufta \n\nEllipta 55 mcg \n \n\n12-Week Study \nTreatment difference1 \n\n95% Confidence interval \np-value \n\n24-Week Study \nTreatment difference1 \n\n95% Confidence interval \np-value \n\nVersus  \nPlacebo \n\n127  \n(52, 202) \n<0.001 \n\n115  \n(76, 155) \n<0.001 \n\nmcg = micrograms \n1.least squares mean (95% confidence interval)  \n \nRolufta Ellipta demonstrated a statistically significant greater improvement from baseline in weighted mean \nFEV1 over 0-6 hours post-dose at Week 12 compared with placebo (166 ml, p<0.001) in the 12-week pivotal \nstudy.  Rolufta Ellipta demonstrated a greater improvement from baseline in weighted mean FEV1 over 0-6 \nhours post-dose at Week 24 compared with placebo (150 ml, p<0.001*) in the 24-week pivotal study. \n \nSymptomatic outcomes \nBreathlessness: \nIn the 12-week study, a statistically significant improvement compared with placebo in the TDI focal score at \nWeek 12 was not demonstrated for Rolufta Ellipta (1.0 units, p=0.05). A statistically significant \nimprovement compared with placebo in the TDI focal score at Week 24 was demonstrated for Rolufta Ellipta \n(1.0 units, p<0.001) in the 24-week study. \n \nThe proportion of patients who responded with at least the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) \nof 1 unit TDI focal score at Week 12 was greater for Rolufta Ellipta (38%) compared with placebo (15%) in \nthe 12-week study. Similarly, a greater proportion of patients achieved \u22651 unit TDI focal score for Rolufta \nEllipta (53%) compared with placebo (41%) at Week 24 in the 24-week study. \n \nHealth-related quality of life: \nRolufta Ellipta also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in health-related quality of life \nmeasured using the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) as indicated by a reduction in SGRQ \ntotal score at Week 12 compared with placebo (-7.90 units, p<0.001) in the 12-week study.  A greater \nimprovement compared with placebo in the change from baseline in SGRQ total score at Week 24 was \ndemonstrated for Rolufta Ellipta (-4.69 units, p<0.001\u2217) in the 24-week study. \n \nThe proportion of patients who responded with at least the MCID in SGRQ score (defined as a decrease of \n4 units from baseline) at Week 12 was greater for Rolufta Ellipta 55 micrograms (44%) compared with \nplacebo (26%) in the 12-week study. Similarly, a greater proportion of patients achieved at least the MCID \nfor Rolufta Ellipta at Week 24 (44%) compared with placebo (34%) in the 24-week study.  \n \nCOPD exacerbations \nIn the 24-week placebo-controlled study in patients with symptomatic COPD, Rolufta Ellipta reduced the \nrisk of a moderate/severe COPD exacerbation by 40% compared with placebo (analysis of time to first \nexacerbation; Hazard Ratio 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4, 1.0, p=0.035*). The probability of having an exacerbation in \npatients receiving Rolufta Ellipta at week 24 was 8.9% compared with 13.7% for placebo. These studies \nwere not specifically designed to evaluate the effect of treatments on COPD exacerbations and patients were \nwithdrawn from the study if an exacerbation occurred. \n \n\n                                                      \n*A step-down statistical testing procedure was used in this study and this comparison was below a comparison that did \nnot achieve statistical significance. Therefore, statistical significance on this comparison cannot be inferred. \n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nUse of rescue medicinal product \nIn the 12-week study, Rolufta Ellipta statistically significantly reduced the use of rescue medication with \nsalbutamol compared with placebo (on average a reduction of 0.7 puffs per day over Weeks 1-12, p=0.025) \nand demonstrated a higher percentage of days when no rescue medication was needed (on average 46.3%) \ncompared with placebo (on average 35.2%; no formal statistical analysis was performed on this endpoint). In \nthe 24-week study treatment with Rolufta Ellipta, the mean (SD) change from baseline in the number of \npuffs of rescue salbutamol over the 24-week treatment period was -1.4 (0.20) for placebo and -1.7 (0.16) for \nRolufta Ellipta (Difference = -0.3; 95% CI: -0.8, 0.2, p=0.276). Patients receiving Rolufta Ellipta had a \nhigher percentage of days when no rescue medication was needed (on average 31.1%) compared with \nplacebo (on average 21.7%). No formal statistical testing was performed on this endpoint. \n \nSupporting efficacy studies \nIn a randomised, double-blind, 52-week study (CTT116855, IMPACT) of 10,355 adult patients with \nsymptomatic COPD and a history of 1 or more moderate or severe exacerbations within the prior 12 months, \ntreatment with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI 92/55/22 micrograms) once daily \nas a single inhaler was compared with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI 92/22 micrograms) once daily as \na single inhaler. The primary endpoint was annual rate of on-treatment moderate and severe exacerbations in \nsubjects treated with FF/UMC/VI compared with FF/VI. The mean annual rate of exacerbations was 0.91 \nand 1.07 for FF/UMEC/VI and FF/VI respectively (Rate Ratio: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.90; p<0.001). \n \nAt Week 52, a statistically significant improvement in the least-squares (LS) mean change from baseline in \ntrough FEV1 was observed for FF/UMEC/VI compared with FF/VI (mean change: +94 mL vs. -3 mL; \ntreatment difference: 97 mL; 95% CI: 85, 109; p<0.001). \n \nIn two 12-week, placebo controlled studies (200109 and 200110), the addition of Rolufta Ellipta to \nfluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) (92/22 micrograms) once daily in adult patients with a clinical \ndiagnosis of COPD, resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the \nprimary endpoint of trough FEV1 at Day 85 compared to placebo plus FF/VI (124 mL 95% CI: 93, 154; \np<0.001 and 122 mL 95% CI: 91, 152; p<0.001). \n \nImprovements in lung function were supported with reductions in use of salbutamol over Weeks 1-12 (-0.4 \npuffs per day (95% CI: -0.7, -0.2; p<0.001) and -0.3 puffs per day (95% CI: -0.5, -0.1; p=0.003)) compared \nto placebo plus FF/VI but improvements in SGRQ at week 12 were not statistically significant (200109) or \nclinically relevant (200109 and 200110). The short duration of these two studies and limited number of \nexacerbation events, preclude any conclusion regarding additional effect of Rolufta Ellipta on COPD \nexacerbation rate. \n \nNo new adverse drug reactions were identified with the addition of Rolufta Ellipta to FF/VI in these studies. \n \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Rolufta \nEllipta in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing inhaled administration of umeclidinium bromide in healthy volunteers, Cmax occurred at 5 to \n15 minutes. The absolute bioavailability of inhaled umeclidinium bromide was on average 13% of the dose, \nwith negligible contribution from oral absorption. Following repeat dosing of inhaled umeclidinium bromide, \nsteady state was achieved within 7 to 10 days with 1.5 to 1.8-fold accumulation. \n \nDistribution \nFollowing intravenous administration to healthy subjects, the mean volume of distribution was 86 litres. \nIn vitro plasma protein binding in human plasma was on average 89%. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nBiotransformation \nIn vitro studies showed that umeclidinium bromide is principally metabolised by cytochrome P450 2D6 \n(CYP2D6) and is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter. The primary metabolic routes for \numeclidinium bromide are oxidative (hydroxylation, O-dealkylation) followed by conjugation \n(glucuronidation, etc), resulting in a range of metabolites with either reduced pharmacological activity or for \nwhich the pharmacological activity has not been established. Systemic exposure to the metabolites is low. \n \nElimination \nPlasma clearance following intravenous administration was 151 litres/hour. Following intravenous \nadministration, approximately 58% of the administered radiolabelled dose (or 73% of the recovered \nradioactivity) was excreted in faeces by 192 hours post-dose. Urinary elimination accounted for 22% of the \nadministered radiolabelled dose by 168 hours (27% of recovered radioactivity). The excretion of the \ndrug-related material in the faeces following intravenous dosing indicated secretion into the bile. Following \noral administration to healthy male subjects, total radioactivity was excreted primarily in faeces (92% of the \nadministered radiolabelled dose or 99% of the recovered radioactivity) by 168 hours post-dose. Less than 1% \nof the orally administered dose (1% of recovered radioactivity) was excreted in urine, suggesting negligible \nabsorption following oral administration. Umeclidinium bromide plasma elimination half-life following \ninhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 19 hours, with 3% to 4% active substance excreted unchanged in urine \nat steady-state. \n \nCharacteristics in specific groups of subjects or patients \n \nElderly \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that pharmacokinetics of umeclidinium bromide are similar \nbetween COPD patients 65 years and older and those younger than 65 years of age. \n \nRenal impairment \nSubjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30mL/min) showed no evidence of an increase \nin systemic exposure to umeclidinium bromide (Cmax and AUC), and no evidence of altered protein binding \nbetween subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy volunteers. \n \nHepatic impairment \nSubjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) showed no evidence of an increase in \nsystemic exposure to umeclidinium bromide (Cmax and AUC), and no evidence of altered protein binding \nbetween subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers. Umeclidinium bromide has not \nbeen evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nOther special populations \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that no dose adjustment is required for umeclidinium \nbromide based on the effect of age, race, gender, inhaled corticosteroid use or weight. A study in CYP2D6 \npoor metabolisers showed no evidence of a clinically significant effect of CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism on \nsystemic exposure to umeclidinium bromide. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, \nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. In nonclinical studies with umeclidinium \nbromide, findings were those typically associated with the primary pharmacology of muscarinic receptor \nantagonists and/or local irritancy.  \n \nToxicity to reproduction \nUmeclidinium bromide was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits. In a pre- and post-natal study, subcutaneous \nadministration of umeclidinium bromide to rats resulted in lower maternal body weight gain and food \nconsumption and slightly decreased pre-weaning pup body weights in dams given 180 micrograms/kg/day \ndose (approximately 80-times the human clinical exposure of umeclidinium 55 micrograms, based on AUC). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n6.

bromide, which belongs to a group of medicines called bronchodilators. what rolufta ellipta is used for this medicine is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) in adults. copd is a long-term condition in which the airways and air-sacs in the lungs gradually become blocked or damaged, leading to breathing difficulties that slowly get worse. difficulties in breathing is added to by tightening of the muscles around the airways, which narrows the airways and so restricts the flow of air. this medicine blocks the tightening of these muscles, making it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. when used regularly, it can help control your breathing difficulties and reduce the effects of copd on your everyday life. rolufta ellipta should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. if you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting reliever inhaler (such as salbutamol). if you do not have a quick-acting inhaler contact your doctor.",
