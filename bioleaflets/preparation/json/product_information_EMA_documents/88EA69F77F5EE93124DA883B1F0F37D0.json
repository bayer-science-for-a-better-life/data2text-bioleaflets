This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section \n4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nKetoconazole HRA 200 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 200 mg ketoconazole. \n \nExcipient with known effect:  \nEach tablet contains 19 mg of lactose (as monohydrate). \n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \n \nOff-white to light cream, round, 10 mm diameter, biconvex. \n\n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKetoconazole HRA is indicated for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in adults and adolescents \nabove the age of 12 years. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in endocrinology or internal medicine \nand having the appropriate facilities for monitoring of biochemical responses since the dose must be adjusted \nto meet the patient’s therapeutic need, based on the normalisation of cortisol levels. \n \nPosology \n \nInitiation \nThe recommended dose at initiation in adults and adolescents is 400-600 mg/day taken orally in two or three \ndivided doses and this dose can be increased rapidly to 800-1,200 mg/day in two or three divided doses.  \n \nAt treatment initiation, 24-hour urinary free cortisol should be controlled every few days/weeks. \n \nAdjustment of the posology \nKetoconazole daily dose should be periodically adjusted on an individual basis with the aim to normalise \nurinary free cortisol and/or plasma cortisol levels. \n\n- A dose increase of  200 mg/day every 7 to 28 days may be considered if urinary free cortisol and/or \nplasma cortisol levels are above the normal range, as long as the dose is tolerated by the patient; \n\n\n\n3 \n\n- A maintenance dose from 400 mg/day to a maximal dose of 1,200 mg/day taken orally in 2 to 3 divided \ndoses may be required to restore normal cortisol levels. In most of the publications the maintenance \ndose varied between 600 mg/day and 800 mg/day; \n\n- When the effective dose of ketoconazole  is established, monitoring of urinary free cortisol and/or \nplasma cortisol levels may be performed every 3 to 6 months (see section 4.4); \n\n- In the case of adrenal insufficiency and depending on the severity of the event, the dose of \nketoconazole should be decreased by at least 200 mg/day or the treatment should be temporarily \ndiscontinued and/or a corticosteroid therapy should be added until the resolution of the event. \nKetoconazole can be reintroduced thereafter at a lower dose (see section 4.4); \n\n- Treatment with ketoconazole can be stopped abruptly without a need for progressive dose decrease \nwhere a change in the therapeutic strategy (e.g. surgery) is desired.  \n \n\nMonitoring of liver function \n \nBefore starting the treatment, it is mandatory: \n- to measure liver enzymes (ASAT, ALAT, gammaGT and alkaline phosphatase) and bilirubin \n- to inform the patients about the risk of hepatotoxicity, including to stop the treatment and to contact their \n\ndoctor immediately if they feel unwell or in the event of symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, \nfatigue, jaundice, abdominal pain or dark urine. If these occur, treatment should be stopped immediately \nand liver function tests should be performed. \n\n \nDue to the known hepatotoxicity of ketoconazole, the treatment must not be initiated in patients with liver \nenzymes levels above 2 times the upper limit of normal (see section 4.3). \n\n \nDuring the treatment: \n- close clinical follow-up should be undertaken  \n- measurement of liver enzymes (ASAT, ALAT, gamma GT and alkaline phosphatase) and bilirubin, should \n\nbe performed at frequent intervals:  \n \n\no weekly for one month after initiation of the treatment \no then monthly for 6 months \no weekly during one month whenever the dose was increased.  \n\n \nIn the case of an increase in liver enzymes of less than 3 times the upper limit of normal, more frequent \nmonitoring of liver function tests should be performed and the daily dose should be decreased by at least \n200 mg.  \n \nIn the case of an increase in liver enzymes equal to or greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, \nketoconazole should be stopped immediately and should not be reintroduced due to the risk of serious hepatic \ntoxicity. Ketoconazole should be discontinued without any delay if clinical symptoms of hepatitis develop. \n \nIn case of long term treatment (more than 6 months): \nAlthough hepatotoxicity is usually observed at treatment initiation and within the first six months of treatment, \nmonitoring of liver enzymes should be done under medical criteria. As a precautionary measure, in case of a \ndose increase after the first six months of treatment, monitoring of liver enzymes should be repeated on a \nweekly basis for one month. \n \nDosing regimens for maintenance therapy \nSubsequent maintenance therapy can be administered in one of two ways: \n\n- Block-only regimen: the maintenance dose of ketoconazole may be continued as described above; \n- Block-and-replace regimen: the maintenance dose of ketoconazole should be further increased by \n\n200 mg and concomitant corticosteroid replacement therapy should be added (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients  \n\n\n\n4 \n\nData on the use of ketoconazole in patients older than 65 years are limited, but there is no evidence to suggest \nthat specific dose adjustment is required in these patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment  \nAlthough data are limited, the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole are not significantly different in patients with \nrenal failure compared to healthy subjects, and no specific dose adjustment is recommended in this population.  \n \nHepatic impairment  \nKetoconazole is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and \n5.3). The treatment must not be initiated in patients with liver enzymes levels above 2 times the upper \nlimit of normal \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Ketoconazole HRA in children aged less than 12 years have not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can \nbe made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n- Hypersensitivity to any imidazole antifungal medicinal product; \n- Acute or chronic liver disease and/or if pre-treatment liver enzymes levels are above 2 times the upper \n\nlimit of normal (see sections 4.2 and 4.4): \n\n- Pregnancy (see section 4.6); \n- Breastfeeding (see section 4.6); \n- Congenital or documented acquired QTc prolongation ; \n- Concomitant therapy with any of the following medicinal products which may interact and result in \n\npotentially life-threatening adverse reactions (see section 4.5): \n\no CYP3A4 metabolised HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g. simvastatin, atorvastatin and \nlovastatin) due to an increased risk of skeletal muscle toxicity including rhabdomyolysis; \n\no eplerenone due to an increased risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension; \no substances that may have their plasma concentrations increased and have QT prolonging potential: \n\nmethadone, disopyramide, quinidine, dronedarone, pimozide, sertindole, saquinavir \n(saquinavir/ritonavir 1000/100 mg bid), ranolazine, mizolastine, halofantrine; \n\no dabigatran due to an increased bleeding risk; \no triazolam, oral midazolam and alprazolam due to potential for prolonged or increased sedation and \n\nrespiratory depression; \n\no ergot alkaloids (eg dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine and \nmethylergometrine (methylergonovine) due to an increased risk of ergotism and other serious \nvasospastic adverse reactions; \n\no lurasidone; \no quetiapine due to an increased risk of toxicity; \no telithromycin and clarithromycin in patients with severe renal impairment due to an increased risk \n\nof hepatotoxicity and QT interval prolongation; \n\no felodipine, nisoldipine due to an increased risk of oedema and congestive heart failure; \n\n\n\n5 \n\no colchicine in patients with renal impairment due to an increased risk of severe adverse reactions; \no irinotecan due to an alteration of the metabolism of this medicinal product; \no everolimus, sirolimus (also known as rapamycin) due to an increase of the plasma concentrations \n\nof these medicinal products; \n\no vardenafil in men older than 75-years due to increased risk of adverse reactions; \no paritaprevir/ombitasvir (ritonavir) due to increased risk of adverse reactions; \no fesoterodine and solifenacin in patients with renal impairment; \n\no tolvaptan used for a specific disease called “syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone \nsecretion”. \n \n\nThe list above is not an inclusive list of compounds that may interact with ketoconazole and result in \npotentially life-threatening reactions. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMonitoring of liver function \n \nLiver enzymes should be monitored in all patients receiving ketoconazole. Due to the risk of serious hepatic \ntoxicity, close follow-up of patients is required (see section 4.2). \n \nMonitoring of adrenal function \n \nAdrenal function should be monitored at regular intervals since adrenal insuficiency can occur during the \ntreatment under conditions of a relative cortisol deficiency due to an increased glucocorticoid demand (e.g. in \ncase of stress, surgery, or infection); and/or in case of ketoconazole overtreatment (for the patients treated with \na block-only regimen); or if there is insufficient glucocorticoid replacement therapy (for the patients treated \nwith a block-and-replace regimen). Serum or plasma and/or salivary cortisol and/or urinary free cortisol levels \nshould be monitored, within one week following ketoconazole initiation as a minimum, and then periodically \nthereafter. When urinary free/serum/ plasma cortisol levels are normalised or close to target and the effective \ndose of ketoconazole is established, monitoring can be undertaken every 3 to 6 months (see section 4.2 for \ndose adjustment in case of adrenal insufficiency). \n \nAll patients should be monitored and informed about the signs and symptoms associated with hypocortisolism \n(e.g. weakness, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight-loss, hypotension, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia \nand/or hypoglycaemia). \n \nIf clinical symptoms are suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, cortisol levels should be measured and \nketoconazole should be temporarily discontinued or the dose reduced and if necessary corticosteroid \nsubstitution should be initiated. Ketoconazole can be resumed thereafter at a lower dose (see section 4.2). \n \nBlock and replace regimen \n \nPatients treated with a block-and-replace regimen should be taught to adjust their glucocorticoid replacement \ntherapy dose under conditions of stress (see section 4.2). In addition, they should receive an emergency card \nand be equipped with an emergency glucocorticoid set.  \n \nMonitoring of the QTc interval \n  \nMonitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable. An ECG should be performed: \n \n\n- Prior to the start of ketoconazole \n- Within one week after the beginning of the treatment \n- As clinically indicated thereafter. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nIn case of co-administration of an medicinal product known to increase QTc interval (see section 4.5), ECG \nmonitoring is recommended. \n \nContraception \n \nWomen must be provided with comprehensive information on pregnancy prevention. As a minimum \nrequirement, women of childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception (see section 4.6).  \n \nDecreased gastric acidity \n \nAbsorption is impaired when gastric acidity is decreased. Acid-neutralising medicines (e.g. aluminium \nhydroxide) should not be administered for at least 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole. In patients with \nachlorhydria, such as certain AIDS patients and patients on acid secretion suppressors (e.g. H2-antagonists, \nproton pump inhibitors), it is advised to administer ketoconazole with an acidic beverage e.g. cola beverage, \norange juice. \nIf acid secretion suppressors are added to or removed from the concomitant medicinal products then \nketoconazole dose should be adjusted according to cortisol levels. \n \nPotential interaction with medicinal products \n \nKetoconazole has a high potential for clinically important medicinal products interactions. \nKetoconazole is mainly metabolised through CYP3A4. Coadministration of potent enzyme inducers of \nCYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailibity of ketoconazole. A review of concomitant medicinal products should \nbe conducted when initiating ketoconazole treatment since ketoconazole is a known strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. \nThe SmPC for concomitantly used products must be consulted for the recommendations regarding co-\nadministration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. \n\nKetoconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4: inhibition of CYP3A4 by ketoconazole can increase patients’ \nexposure to a number of medicinal products which are metabolised through this enzymatic system (see section \n4.5). \n\nKetoconazole is also a potent inhibitor of P-gp: inhibition of P-gp by ketoconazole can increase patients’ \nexposure to medicinal products which are P-gp substrates (see section 4.5). \n\nCYP3A4-metabolised and/or P-gp substrates known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated or not \nrecommended depending on the observed or expected effect with ketoconazole (i.e. resulting in augmentation \nof the plasma concentration, AUC, Cmax of the drugs) and the known therapeutic margins of the drugs. Some \ncombinations may lead to an increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade \nde pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia (see Table 1 Interactions and recommendations for co-administration, \nsection 4.5). \n \nUse with hepatotoxic medicinal products \nCo-administration of ketoconazole and other medicinal products known to have potentially hepatotoxic effect \n(eg paracetamol) is not recommended since the combination may lead to increased risk of liver damage. \n \nUse with pasireotide \n \nCo-administration of ketoconazole and pasireotide is not recommended since the combination can lead to QT \nprolongation in patients with known cardiac rhythm disorders (see section 4.5). \n \nCoexisting inflammatory/autoimmune disorders \n \nExacerbation or development of inflammatory/autoimmune disorders has been described after Cushing’s \nsyndrome remission, including after treatment with ketoconazole. Patients with Cushing's syndrome and \ncoexisting inflammatory/autoimmune disorders should be supervised after normalisation of cortisol levels on \nketoconazole. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nAlcohol \n \nPatients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment (see section 4.5). \n \nWarning regarding excipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose.  \nPatients with congenital lactase deficiency, galactosaemia or glucose-galactose intolerance must not be given \nthis medicine unless strictly necessary. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n \nConcomitant therapy with medicinal products that are contraindicated during treatment with ketoconazole \nand resulting in potentially life-threatening adverse reactions : \n \no CYP3A4 metabolised HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g. simvastatin, atorvastatin and lovastatin)  \ndue to an increased risk of skeletal muscle toxicity including rhabdomyolysis; \no eplerenone due to an increased risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension; \no substances that may have their plasma concentrations increased and have QT prolonging potential : \nmethadone, disopyramide, quinidine, dronedarone, pimozide, sertindole, saquinavir (saquinavir/ritonavir \n1000/100 mg bid), ranolazine, mizolastine, halofantrine; \no dabigatran due to an increased bleeding risk; \no triazolam, oral midazolam and alprazolam due to potential for prolonged or increased sedation and \nrespiratory depression; \no ergot alkaloids (eg dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine and methylergometrine \n(methylergonovine) due to an increased risk of ergotism and other serious vasospastic adverse \nreactionsevents \no lurasidone;  \no quetiapine due to an increased risk of toxicity; \no telithromycin and clarithromycin in patients with severe renal impairment due to an increased risk of \nhepatotoxicity and QT interval prolongation; \no felodipine, nisoldipine due to an increased risk of oedema and congestive heart failure; \no colchicine in patients with renal impairment due to an increased risk of severe adverse reactions; \no irinotecan  due to an alteration of the metabolism of this medicinal product; \no everolimus, sirolimus (also known as rapamycin) due to an increase of the plasma concentrations of \nthese medicinal products; \no vardenafil in men older than 75-years due to increased risk of adverse reactions \no paritaprevir/ombitasvir (ritonavir) due to increased risk of adverse reactions; \no fesoterodine and solifenacin in patients with renal impairment; \no tolvaptan used for a specific disease called “syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone \n\nsecretion”. \n \nThe list above is not an inclusive list of compounds that may interact with ketoconazole and result in \npotentially life-threatening reactions. \n \nMedicinal products affecting the absorption of ketoconazole \n \nMedicinal products affecting gastric acidity impair the absorption of ketoconazole (see section 4.4). \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on the metabolism of ketoconazole \n \nKetoconazole is mainly metabolised by cytochrome CYP3A4. \nEnzyme-inducing medicinal products such as rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, isoniazid, nevirapine, \nmitotane and phenytoin may significantly reduce the bioavailability of ketoconazole. Use of ketoconazole with \npotent enzyme inducers is not recommended.  \n\n\n\n8 \n\nPotent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-\nboosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole, these medicinal products should be \nused with caution when co-administered with ketoconazole and patients should be monitored closely for signs \nand symptoms of adrenal insuficiency. Ketoconazole dose should be adjusted accordingly. \n \nEffects of ketoconazole on the metabolism of the other medicinal products  \n \n- Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and can inhibit the metabolism of medicinal products \n\nmetabolised by this enzyme. This can result in an increase and/or prolongation of their effects, including \nadverse reactions. \n\n- In vitro data indicate that ketoconazole is an inhibitor of CYP1A2 and does not significantly inhibit CYP \n2A6 and 2E1. At clinically relevant concentrations inhibition of CYP2B6, 2C9/C8, 2C19 and 2D6 by \nketoconazole cannot be excluded. \n\n- Ketoconazole can inhibit the transport of medicinal products by P-gp, which may result in an increased \nplasma concentration of these medicinal products. \n\n- Ketoconazole inhibits BCRP (Breast Cancer Resistance Protein) in in vitro studies. Data of inhibition \nindicate that risk of interaction with BCRP substrates cannot be excluded at the systemic level with very \nhigh doses of ketoconazole. However, ketoconazole may be an inhibitor of BCRP at the intestinal level at \nclinically relevant concentrations. Considering the rapid absorption of ketoconazole, intake of BCRP \nsubstrates should be postponed for 2 hours after ketoconazole intake. \n\n \nTable 1 Interactions and recommendations for co-administration. \n \nInteractions between ketoconazole and other medicinal products are listed in the table below (increase is \nindicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, an  no change as “↔”). The degrees of interaction mentioned below are not \nabsolute values and may be dependent on the ketoconazole dose given, i.e. many results are reported following \na ketoconazole dose of 200 mg and a stronger interaction may be expected at a higher dose and/or shorter \ndosing interval.

Ketoconazole did not produce any change in rosuvastatin \npharmacokinetics, therefore, co-administration of ketoconazole and rosuvastatin is unlikely to increase the risk \nof toxicity of rosuvastatin. Other statins that are not CYP3A4 substrates (pravastatin and fluvastatin) can be \nco-administered with ketoconazole. \n \nOther interactions \n \nExceptional cases of a disulfiram-like reaction have been reported when ketoconazole was co-administered \nwith alcohol, characterised by flushing, rash, peripheral oedema, nausea and headache, have been reported. \nAll symptoms resolved completely within a few hours. \n \nCo-administration of ketoconazole and pasireotide is not recommended since the combination can lead to a \nQT prolongation in patients with known cardiac rhythm disorders. \n \nThere is no evidence to suggest that there is an interaction between ketoconazole and other steroidogenesis \ninhibitors (i.e. metyrapone). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of Ketoconazole HRA in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimal have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Preclinical data show that ketoconazole crosses the \nplacenta and is teratogenic. Ketoconazole is contraindicated during pregnancy and it should not be used in \nwomen of childbearing potential not using an effective method of contraception (see section 4.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nSince ketoconazole is excreted in the milk, mothers who are under treatment must not breast-feed whilst being \ntreated with Ketoconazole HRA (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \n \nStudies in animals have shown effects on male and female reproductive parameters (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nKetoconazole has a moderate influence in the ability to drive and use machines Patients should be warned \nabout the potential for dizziness and somnolence (see section 4.8) and should be advised not to drive or operate \nmachines if any of these symptoms occur. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions are adrenal insufficiency, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, \npruritus, rash and the hepatic enzymes increased. \nThe most serious adverse reaction is hepatotoxicity, primarily as acute hepatocellular toxicity, but may also \nresult in cholestatic injury or a mixed pattern of toxicity. ASAT, ALAT, gammaGT, bilirubin and alkaline \nphosphatase should be monitored at frequent intervals during treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe safety of ketoconazole has been evaluated based on published literature and use of ketoconazole as an \nantifungal treatment. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nThe adverse reactions listed below in table 2 are classified according to System Organ Class. Frequency \ngroupings are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < \n1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known: \ncannot be estimated from the available data. \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 2: Incidence of adverse reactions and marked laboratory abnormalities reported in the literature in \nadults and adolescents patients \n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nUncommon Thrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Allergic conditions including anaphylactic \nshock, anaphylactoid reaction and \nanaphylactic reaction and angioedema \n\nEndocrine disorders Common Adrenal insufficiency \nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nNot known \n \n\nAlcohol intolerance, anorexia, increased \nappetite \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nNot Known Insomnia, nervousness \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Headache, dizziness, somnolence \n\n Not known \n \n\nIntracranial pressure increased \n(papilloedema, fontanelle bulging), \nparaesthesia \n\nEye disorders Not known Photophobia \nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\nNot known Epistaxis \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders  \n\nCommon Nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, \ndiarrhoea \n\n Not known Dyspepsia, flatulence, tongue discoloration, \ndry mouth, dysgeusia \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\nVery common Liver function tests abnormal \n\n Rare Serious hepatotoxicity, including jaundice, \nhepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, \nhepatic failure including cases necessitating \ntransplantation or resulting in death.  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon Pruritus, rash \n\n Uncommon Urticaria, alopecia \n Not known Photosensitivity, erythema multiforme, \n\ndermatitis, erythema, , xeroderma \nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorder \n\nNot known \n \n\nMyalgia, arthralgia \n\nReproductive system \nand breast disorders    \n\nNot known \n \n\nMenstrual disorder, azoospermia, erectile \ndysfunction, gynaecomastia \n\n\n\n17 \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nUncommon Asthenia \n\n Very rare Pyrexia \n Not known Oedema peripheral, malaise, hot flush \nInvestigations Very common Hepatic enzyme increased \n Uncommon Platelet count decreased \n Not known Transient decrease of testosterone \n\nconcentrations \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHepatotoxicity \nSerious hepatic toxicity caused by ketoconazole treatment is rare (1/15000). Acute hepatocellular injury has \nbeen primarily observed as has cholestatic injury or a mixed pattern of toxicity. Fatal cases have been reported \nparticularly when treatment is continued despite liver enzyme elevation. Increases in liver enzymes (≤ 5N and \n> 5N) were observed in ~13.5 % and ~2.5% of patients respectively occurring mostly within the first 6 months \nof treatment. Liver enzyme levels returned to normal within 2-12 weeks after a dose decrease or withdrawal \nof ketoconazole. Hepatotoxicity does not appear to be dose dependent. All potential associated factors of \nhepatotoxicity, and abnormal liver enzyme levels detected before ketoconazole initiation, should be taken into \naccount before considering ketoconazole treatment. Ketoconazole should not be administered when liver \nenzymes are greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal or in association with other hepatotoxic medicinal \nproducts. Liver enzyme monitoring should be performed once weekly during the first month of treatment and \nthen monthly for 6 months. In the case an increase of liver enzymes is detected which is less than 3 times the \nupper limit of normal, closer monitoring of liver function should be performed and the daily dose should be \ndecreased by at least 200 mg. In the case of increase of liver enzymes levels above 3 times the upper limit of \nnormal, Ketoconazole should be stopped immediately and should not be reintroduced because of the risk of \nserious hepatic toxicity. \n \nAdrenal insufficiency \nAdrenal insufficiency may occur in patients on ketoconazole without corticosteroid substitution (block-only \nregimen) or if there is an insufficient glucocorticoid replacement therapy (for the patients treated with a block-\nand-replace regimen). Monitor and instruct patients on the signs and symptoms associated with \nhypocortisolism (e.g. weakness, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hyperkalemia, \nhyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia or hypoglycaemia). Adrenal insufficiency may be detected by periodic clinical \nassessment and monitoring of plasma/serum or salivary cortisol levels. In case of adrenal insufficiency, \nKetoconazole HRA treatment should be temporarily discontinued or the dose reduced and, if needed, a \ncorticosteroid substitution therapy added.  \n \nPaediatric population \nFrequency of hepatotoxicity could be higher in adolescents than in adults. In the literature, among 24 paediatric \npatients treated with ketoconazole, two developed severe hepatoxicity. A 14 year-old girl who was treated for \nCushing’s disease with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily presented one month later with jaundice, fever \nanorexia, nausea and vomiting. Ketoconazole was stopped, but she deteriorated rapidly and died. A 17 years \nold girl was treated on ketoconazole 1,200 mg/day for an adrenal carcinoma with liver metastasis and had \naltered liver function tests at 22 days. After ketoconazole withdrawal, liver enzymes returned to normal levels \nwithin 3 weeks (section 5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n4.9. Overdose \n \nThere is no known antidote to ketoconazole. The maximal dose that was used for treatment of Cushing’s \nsyndrome is 1,600 mg/day. \nIn the event of accidental overdose, treatment consists of supportive measures. Within the first hour after \ningestion gastric lavage may be performed. Activated charcoal may be given if considered appropriate. \nIn the case of  signs suggestive of an adrenal insufficiency, in addition to the general measures to eliminate the \nmedicinal product and reduce its absorption, a 100 mg dose of hydrocortisone should be administered at once, \ntogether with saline and glucose infusions. Close surveillance will be necessary: blood pressure and fluid and \nelectrolyte balance should be monitored for a few days. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, imidazole derivatives, ATC code: J02AB02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nKetoconazole is a steroidogenesis inhibitor. Ketoconazole is an imidazole derivative that is a potent inhibitor \nof cortisol synthesis resulting from its ability to inhibit several cytochrome P450 enzymes in the adrenal glands. \nKetoconazole inhibits primarily the activity of 17α-hydroxylase, but it also inhibits 11-hydroxylation steps, \nand at higher doses the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme. Therefore, ketoconazole is an inhibitor of \ncortisol and aldosterone synthesis. Ketoconazole is also a potent inhibitor of androgens synthesis, inhibiting \nthe activity of C17-20 lyase in the adrenals and also in Leydig cells. \nApart from adrenal blocking effect, ketoconazole may also have direct effects on corticotropic tumour cells in \npatients with Cushing’s disease. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nThe efficacy and safety of ketoconazole in the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome from all causes have been \ndescribed through several published retrospective studies, chart reviews and case reports. Control of cortisol \nlevels, either in serum/plasma or urine, was used to assess the efficacy of the treatment, along with the \nevaluation of clinical symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome. More than 800 patients have been treated with \nketoconazole with variable treatment duration and modalities. About 200 patients were treated for more than \n6 months and some of them were treated for several years. \n \nUrinary free cortisol (UFC) levels were normalised in about 50% of patients on ketoconazole. Response rates \nvaried between 43 and 80% depending on the studies and the criteria to define a response. About 75% of \npatients achieved a decrease of more than 50% of UFC levels on ketoconazole, compared to pre-treatment \nlevels \n \nCombination therapy \nKetoconazole has been used both as sole medical therapy and in combination with other medicinal products, \nmainly with metyrapone, in patients with more severe disease or in those not completely responding to a single \nactive substance or in those requiring a dose reduction of at least one of the medicinal products to improve \ntolerance. Ketoconazole has also been used with other therapies including surgery and pituitary radiation. \nOverall, ketoconazole was shown to be an effective medicinal product for normalising cortisol levels in all \ncauses of Cushing’s syndrome and, if tolerated, ketoconazole treatment can be maintained for a long period.  \n \nEscape phenomenon \nIn approximately 10 to 15 % of ketoconazole treated patients, an \"escape phenomenon\" is observed and \nreinforces the need for a long-term clinical and biochemical follow-up of these patients. If such a phenomenon \noccurs, a further dose increase may be required  to maintain cortisol levels within the normal range. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nUse in Cushing’s disease \nData from 535 patients with Cushing’s disease treated with ketoconazole, along with 13 individual case reports \nare available in the literature. In a retrospective study conducted in several French centres, 200 patients with \nCushing’s disease were followed between 1995 and 2012. At the last visit, 78 patients (49.3%) were controlled, \n37 patients (23.4%) had partial control with at least 50% decrease of UFC (without normalisation), and 43 \npatients (27.2%) had unchanged UFC levels. At the last follow-up, clinical signs were improved in 74/134 \npatients (55.2%), hypertension in 36/90 patients (40), hypokalaemia in 10/26 patients (38.4%), and diabetes \nmellitus in 23/39 patients (59%). \n \nUse in ectopic Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) syndrome \nData from 91 patients with the ectopic ACTH syndrome treated with ketoconazole were reviewed, along with \n18 individual case reports. In a Canadian study, of the 12 assessable patients (out of 15), 10 showed a reduction \nin urinary free cortisol levels, but only five had complete resolution on ketoconazole doses 400 to 1200 mg/day. \nClinical improvement in hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension occurred even \nin the absence of complete hormonal response.  \n \nUse in ACTH-independent Cushing’s syndrome \nData from 17 patients with adrenal tumours and from 2 patients with primary nodular adrenocortical \nhyperplasia (NAH) treated with ketoconazole are available in the literature along with 17 individual case \nreports of patients with benign or malignant tumours or NAH and 2 paediatric cases of McCune Albright \nsyndrome. Improvement of clinical symptoms was noted in most patients after initiation of treatment. However \nin patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma, improvement of hypercortisolism on ketoconazole was limited in \nsome cases. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nData on 24 paediatric patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome treated with ketoconazole are available \nin the literature, among which 16 were aged over 12 years old and 8 were aged less than 12 years old.  \nTreatment with ketoconazole in paediatric patients allowed normalisation of urinary free cortisol levels and \nclinical improvement, including recovering of growth rate and gonadal function, normalisation of blood \npressure, Cushing’s syndrome features and weight loss in most of the cases. The doses used in adolescents \nabove 12 years old were similar to the doses used in adults’ patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nKetoconazole is a weak dibasic active substance and thus requires acidity for dissolution and absorption. Mean \npeak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 μg/ml are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral \nadministration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. \nCmax and AUC increase more than proportionally with dose. At steady state, mean peak concentrations of \n1.7µg/mL to 15.6µg/mL were reported for total daily doses of 200 mg to 1,200 mg. \n \nDistribution \n \nIn vitro, the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Ketoconazole is widely \ndistributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion of ketoconazole reaches the cerebral-spinal fluid. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nKetoconazole is extensively metabolised to a large number of inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown \nthat CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. \nThe major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, \noxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation. \nKetoconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce \nits own metabolism. \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \nElimination \n \nPlasma elimination is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. The \nhalf-life of ketoconazole increases with dose and duration of treatment. At doses > 400 mg/day, half-lives of \n3 to 10 hours have been reported. About 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged \nmedicinal product. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract. \n \nSpecial population \n \nPaediatrics \nBased on limited data, pharmacokinetics parameters (AUC, Cmax and half-life) of ketoconazole for doses of 5 \nto 10 mg/kg/days, corresponding approximately to daily doses of 200-800 mg, are similar in paediatric and \nadult population. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole were not significantly different in patients with renal failure compared \nto healthy subjects.  \n \nElderly patients \nNo formal evaluation of the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole has been performed. There \nare no data suggesting a need for a specific dose adjustment in this population. \n \nIn vitro data indicate that ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3, OCT1 and OCT2 \nand to a lesser extent of OAT1 and BSEP. Inhibition of these different transporters at clinically relevant \nconcentrations of ketoconazole cannot be excluded. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe toxicological profile of ketoconazole has been established from long term studies in rats and dogs. \n\nBone fragility and broken legs were reported in rats but were not observed in other species.  \n\nConsistent with the pharmacological action of ketaconazole, effects were observed on adrenal and gonads in \nrats and dogs. \n\nElevated liver enzymes and histological changes in the liver consisting in dose–related lipofuscin accumulation \nin hepatocytes were reported in rats and dogs after repeated administration of ketoconazole. \n\nElectrophysiological studies have shown that ketoconazole inhibits the rapidly activating component of the \ncardiac delayed rectifier potassium current, prolongs the action potential duration, and may prolong the QT \ninterval. However no modifications of ECG were recorded in dogs at daily doses up to 40 mg/kg administered \nfor 12 months. \n\nKetoconazole was not genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. However, the genotoxic potential was not properly \ndetermined for the proposed dosing regimen in the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. \nKetoconazole is not carcinogenic. \n\nIn reproduction studies, ketoconazole impaired fertility in males and females. Doses of 25 mg/kg and higher \nin male rats and dogs produced sperm abnormalities and decreased fertility in rats. Ketoconazole at doses up \nto 40 mg/kg had no effects on female fertility in the rat, whilst doses of 75 mg/kg and higher decreased the \npregnancy rate and the number of implantation sites. Doses of 80 and 160 mg/kg inhibited ovulation in \nimmature rats. Ketoconazole at doses of 40 mg/kg/day and higher produces evidence of embryotoxicity and \nteratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Observed teratogenic effects were mainly skeletal anomalies, including cleft \npalate, brachydactylia, ectrodactylia and syndactylia. Treatment of juvenile rats for 30 day beginning at 21 \ndays of age delayed the puberty onset. Effects on human reproduction cannot be excluded. \n\nStudies in pregnant rats and in guinea pigs with 3H-ketoconazole indicate that ketoconazole crosses the \nplacenta. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ketoconazole HRA is and what it is used for \n \nKetoconazole HRA is a medicine that contains the active substance ketoconazole. It is used to treat endogenous \nCushing’s syndrome (when the body produces an excess of cortisol) in adults and adolescents above the age \nof 12 years. \n \nCushing’s syndrome is caused by overproduction of a hormone called cortisol which is produced by the adrenal \nglands. Ketoconazole HRA is able to block the activity of the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of cortisol \nand consequently is able to decrease the over-production of cortisol by your body and to improve the symptoms \nof Cushing’s syndrome. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Ketoconazole HRA \n \nDo not take Ketoconazole HRA \n \n- if you are allergic to ketoconazole and/or to any imidazole antifungal medicine, or to any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n\n- if you have liver problems \n- if you are pregnant  \n- if you are breastfeeding \n- if you have a history of an irregular heart beat \n- if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- certain medicines for lowering blood cholesterol: simvastatin, atorvastatin, lovastatin  \n- certain heart medicines: epleronone, dronedarone, disopyramide, felodipine, nisoldipine, \n\nranolazine  \n\n\n\n32 \n\n- certain medicines used for the treatment of the paludism: quinidine, halofantrine \n- certain medicines  used for severe mental health disorders and severe depression: pimozide, \n\nsertindole, lurasidone, quetiapine \n- certain medicines used for the allergies: mizolastine  \n- dabigatran – medicine used to prevent the formation of blood clots  \n- certain medicines to help to sleep and for anxiety: triazolam, alprazolam, midazolam (taken by \n\nmouth) \n- certain medicines used for migraine attacks: dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine) \n\nergotamine and methylergometrine (methylergonovine)  \n- certain medicines used in cancers: irinotecan, everolimus  \n- sirolimus: used to prevent your body from rejecting a kidney transplant \n- tolvaptan used for a specific disease called “syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone \n\nsecretion” \n- vardenafil in men older than 75 years – medicine to treat erectile dysfunction in adults men \n- certain medicines for HIV: saquinavir/ritonavir, saquinavir \n- certain medicines to treat long-term (chronic) hepatitis C (an infectious disease that affects the \n\nliver, caused by the hepatitis C virus): Paritaprevir/Ombitasvir (ritonavir) \n- methadone: medicine to treat dependence to drugs \n- In patients with renal disorders: \n\n colchicine: medicine to treat gout \n fesoterodine and solifenacin: medicines to treat the symptoms of an overactive bladder \n telithromycin and clarithromycin: medicine used to treat infections \n\n \nDo not take Ketoconazole HRA if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking Ketoconazole HRA. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ketoconazole HRA. \n \nLiver disease \nSpeak with your doctor if you have a history of liver disease. You should know that your liver enzyme tests \nwill be regularly monitored before starting the treatment, once weekly during the first month after \nKetoconazole HRA initiation and then monthly for 6 months due to the risk of serious hepatic toxicity.
