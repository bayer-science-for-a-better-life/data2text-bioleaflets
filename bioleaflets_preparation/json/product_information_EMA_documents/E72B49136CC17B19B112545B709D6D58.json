Approximate size: 19 mm (length) x 7.5 mm (width). \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is \n\nadequately controlled on the combination of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), \n\ntaken either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-component and a single-component \n\nformulation. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Exforge HCT is one tablet per day, to be taken preferably in the morning. \n\n \n\nBefore switching to Exforge HCT patients should be controlled on stable doses of the \n\nmonocomponents taken at the same time. The dose of Exforge HCT should be based on the doses of \n\nthe individual components of the combination at the time of switching. \n\n \n\nThe maximum recommended dose of Exforge HCT is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Exforge HCT is contraindicated for use in patients with \n\nanuria (see section 4.3) and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n\n<30 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nDue to the valsartan component, Exforge HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (see section 4.3). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without \n\ncholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan and therefore Exforge HCT is not \n\nsuitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). Amlodipine dose recommendations \n\nhave not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. When switching \n\neligible hypertensive patients (see section 4.1) with hepatic impairment to Exforge HCT, the lowest \n\navailable dose of the amlodipine component should be used. \n\n \n\nHeart failure and coronary artery disease \n\nThere is limited experience with the use of Exforge HCT, particulary at the maximum dose, in patients \n\nwith heart failure and coronary artery disease. Caution is advised in patients with heart failure and \n\ncoronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Exforge HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nCaution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, \n\nparticularly at the maximum dose of Exforge HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this \n\npatient population are limited. When switching eligible elderly hypertensive patients (see section 4.1) \n\nto Exforge HCT, the lowest available dose of the amlodipine component should be used. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Exforge HCT in the paediatric population (patients below age 18 years) for \n\nthe indication of essential hypertension. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nOral use. \n\nExforge HCT can be taken with or without food. \n\nThe tablets should be swallowed whole with some water, at the same time of the day and preferably in \n\nthe morning. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to other sulphonamide derivatives, to dihydropyridine \nderivatives, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n Hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2), anuria and patients undergoing dialysis. \n\n Concomitant use of Exforge HCT with aliskiren-containing products in patients with diabetes \nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. \n\n Severe hypotension. \n\n Shock (including cardiogenic shock). \n\n Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. hypertrophic obstructive \ncardiomyopathy and high grade aortic stenosis). \n\n Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. \n\n \n\nSodium- and/or volume-depleted patients \n\n \n\nExcessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with \n\nthe maximum dose of Exforge HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of \n\nvalsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg) \n\npatients, and 0.2% of hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in \n\npatients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. \n\n \n\nIn sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, \n\nsymptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Exforge HCT. Exforge HCT \n\nshould be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. \n\n \n\nIf excessive hypotension occurs with Exforge HCT, the patient should be placed in the supine position \n\nand, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once \n\nblood pressure has been stabilised. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nSerum electrolyte changes \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nIn the controlled trial of Exforge HCT, the counteracting effects of valsartan 320 mg and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide 25 mg on serum potassium approximately balanced each other in many patients. \n\nIn other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic determinations of serum \n\nelectrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. \n\n \n\nPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes and potassium in particular should be performed at \n\nappropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance, especially in patients with other risk \n\nfactors such as impaired renal function, treatment with other medicinal products or history of prior \n\nelectrolyte imbalances. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nConcomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) is not \n\nrecommended. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nTreatment with Exforge HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy, Exforge HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Exforge HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Exforge \n\nHCT is used in patients with renal impairment periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes (including \n\npotassium), creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Exforge HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment of Exforge HCT is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \n\n(GFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\n \n\nExforge HCT should be used with caution to treat hypertension in patients with unilateral or bilateral \n\nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney since blood urea and serum creatinine may \n\nincrease in such patients. \n\n \n\nKidney transplantation \n\n \n\nTo date there is no experience of the safe use of Exforge HCT in patients who have had a recent \n\nkidney transplantation. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nValsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile. The half-life of amlodipine is prolonged and \n\nAUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver function; dose recommendations have not been \n\nestablished. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum \n\nrecommended dose is 80 mg valsartan, and therefore, Exforge HCT is not suitable in this group of \n\npatients (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nAngioedema \n\n \n\nAngioedema, including swelling of the larynx and glottis, causing airway obstruction and/or swelling \n\nof the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue, has been reported in patients treated with valsartan. Some of \n\nthese patients previously experienced angioedema with other medicinal products including ACE \n\ninhibitors. Exforge HCT should be discontinued immediately in patients who develop angioedema and \n\nshould not be re-administered. \n\n \n\nHeart failure and coronary artery disease/post-myocardial infarction \n\n \n\nAs a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal \n\nfunction may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose \n\nrenal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with \n\nACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or \n\nprogressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar outcomes have been \n\nreported with valsartan. Evaluation of patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction should \n\nalways include assessment of renal function. \n\n \n\nIn a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New \n\nYork Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine \n\nwas associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the \n\nincidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nCaution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the \n\nmaximum dose of Exforge HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in these patient \n\npopulations is limited. \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis \n\n \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients with mitral stenosis or significant \n\naortic stenosis that is not high grade. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless \n\ncontinued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to \n\nalternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. \n\nWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if \n\nappropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n\n \n\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism \n\n \n\nPatients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist \n\nvalsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is not activated. Therefore, Exforge HCT is not \n\nrecommended in this population. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nOther metabolic disturbances \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic agents may be required. \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Exforge HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of \n\nuric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout in susceptible \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause intermittant and slight elevation of serum \n\ncalcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Exforge HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Exforge HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. \n\nSerum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\n \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Exforge HCT, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a readministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nChoroidal effusion, acute myopia and secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nchoroidal effusion with visual field defect, acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. \n\nSymptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within \n\nhours to a week of treatment initiation. Untreated acute-angle closure glaucoma can lead to permanent \n\nvision loss. \n\n \n\nThe primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or \n\nsurgical treatment may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk \n\nfactors for developing acute angle closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or \n\npenicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to other angiotensin II \n\nreceptor antagonists. Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide are more likely in patients with \n\nallergy and asthma. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n8 \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\n \n\nCaution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, \n\nparticularly at the maximum dose of Exforge HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this \n\npatient population are limited. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\n \n\nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren increases the risk of \n\nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \n\nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren is therefore not \n\nrecommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \n\nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. \n\nACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy. \n\n \n\nNon-melanoma skin cancer \n\n \n\nAn increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \n\ncell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide exposure has been \n\nobserved in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. \n\nPhotosensitising actions of hydrochlorothiazide could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. \n\n \n\nPatients taking hydrochlorothiazide should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly \n\ncheck their skin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible \n\npreventive measures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, \n\nadequate protection should be advised to the patients in order to minimise the risk of skin cancer. \n\nSuspicious skin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations \n\nof biopsies. The use of hydrochlorothiazide may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have \n\nexperienced previous NMSC (see also section 4.8). \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nNo formal interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed with Exforge HCT. \n\nThus, only information on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual \n\nactive substances is provided in this section. \n\n \n\nHowever, it is important to take into account that Exforge HCT may increase the hypotensive effect of \n\nother antihypertensive agents. \n\n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\n \n\nExforge \n\nHCT \n\nindividual \n\ncomponent \n\nKnown interactions \n\nwith the following \n\nagents \n\nEffect of the interaction with other medicinal products \n\nValsartan \n\nand \n\nHCT \n\nLithium Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and \n\ntoxicity have been reported during concomitant \n\nadministration of lithium with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin \n\nII receptor antagonists including valsartan or thiazides. \n\nSince renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, \n\nthe risk of lithium toxicity may presumably be increased \n\nfurther with Exforge HCT. Therefore careful monitoring \n\nof serum lithium concentrations is recommended during \n\nconcomitant use. \n\nValsartan Potassium-sparing \n\ndiuretics, potassium \n\nsupplements, salt \n\nsubstitutes containing \n\npotassium and other \n\nsubstances that may \n\nincrease potassium \n\nlevels \n\nIf a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is \n\nconsidered necessary in combination with valsartan, \n\nfrequent monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised. \n\nAmlodipine Grapefruit or grapefruit \n\njuice \n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit \n\njuice is not recommended as bioavailability may be \n\nincreased in some patients, resulting in increased blood \n\npressure lowering effects. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n \n\nExforge \n\nHCT \n\nindividual \n\ncomponent \n\nKnown interactions \n\nwith the following \n\nagents \n\nEffect of the interaction with other medicinal products \n\nAmlodipine CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\n(i.e. ketoconazole, \n\nitraconazole, ritonavir) \n\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, \n\nmacrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil \n\nor diltiazem) may give rise to significant increase in \n\namlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these \n\npharmacokinetic variations may be more pronounced in \n\nthe elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may \n\nthus be required. \n\nCYP3A4 inducers \n\n(anticonvulsant agents \n\n[e.g. carbamazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, \n\nphenytoin, \n\nfosphenytoin, \n\nprimidone], rifampicin, \n\nHypericum perforatum \n\n[St. John’s wort]) \n\nUpon co-administration of known inducers of the \n\nCYP3A4, the plasma concentration of amlodipine may \n\nvary. Therefore, blood pressure should be monitored and \n\ndose regulation considered both during and after \n\nconcomitant medication particularly with strong CYP3A4 \n\ninducers (e.g. rifampicin, hypericum perforatum). \n\nSimvastatin Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine \n\nwith 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in \n\nexposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It \n\nis recommended to limit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg \n\ndaily in patients on amlodipine. \n\nDantrolene (infusion) In animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and \n\ncardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and \n\nintravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of hyperkalaemia, it is \n\nrecommended that the co-administration of calcium \n\nchannel blockers such as amlodipine be avoided in \n\npatients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the \n\nmanagement of malignant hyperthermia. \n\nValsartan \n\nand HCT \n\nNon-steroidal anti-\n\ninflammatory drugs \n\n(NSAIDs), including \n\nselective \n\ncyclooxygenase-2 \n\ninhibitors (COX-2 \n\ninhibitors), \n\nacetylsalicylic acid \n\n(>3 g/day), and non-\n\nselective NSAIDs \n\nNSAIDS can attenuate the antihypertensive effect of both \n\nangiotensin II antagonists and hydrochlorothiazide when \n\nadministered simultaneously. Furthermore, concomitant \n\nuse of Exforge HCT and NSAIDs may lead to worsening \n\nof renal function and an increase in serum potassium. \n\nTherefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of \n\nthe treatment is recommended, as well as adequate \n\nhydration of the patient. \n\nValsartan Inhibitors of the uptake \n\ntransporter (rifampicin, \n\nciclosporin) or efflux \n\ntransporter (ritonavir) \n\nThe results of an in vitro study with human liver tissue \n\nindicate that valsartan is a substrate of the hepatic uptake \n\ntransporter OATP1B1 and of the hepatic efflux transporter \n\nMRP2. Co-administration of inhibitors of the uptake \n\ntransporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux transporter \n\n(ritonavir) may increase the systemic exposure to \n\nvalsartan. \n\n\n\n11 \n\nHCT Alcohol, barbiturates \n\nor narcotics \n\nConcomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with \n\nsubstances that also have a blood pressure lowering effect \n\n(e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system \n\nactivity or direct vasodilatation) may potentiate orthostatic \n\nhypotension. \n\nAmantadine Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase \n\nthe risk of adverse reactions caused by amantadine. \n\nAnticholinergic agents \n\nand other medicinal \n\nproducts affecting \n\ngastric motility \n\nThe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be \n\nincreased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, \n\nbiperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal \n\nmotility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, it is \n\nanticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride \n\nmay decrease the bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics. \n\nAntidiabetic agents \n\n(e.g. insulin and oral \n\nantidiabetic agents) \n\nThiazides may alter glucose tolerance. Dose adjustment of \n\nthe antidiabetic medicinal product may be necessary. \n\n Metformin Metformin should be used with caution because of the risk \nof lactic acidosis induced by possible functional renal \n\nfailure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nBeta blockers and \n\ndiazoxide \n\nConcomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, with beta blockers may increase the \n\nrisk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the hyperglycaemic \n\neffect of diazoxide. \n\n Ciclosporin Concomitant treatment with ciclosporin may increase the \n\nrisk of hyperuricaemia and gout-type complications. \n\n Cytotoxic agents Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the \n\nrenal excretion of cytotoxic agents (e.g. \n\ncyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \n\nmyelosuppressive effects. \n\n Digitalis glycosides Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia may \n\noccur as undesirable effects, favouring the onset of \n\ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias. \n\n Iodine contrasting \n\nagents \n\nIn case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an \n\nincreased risk of acute renal failure, especially with high \n\ndoses of iodine products. Patients should be re-hydrated \n\nbefore the administration. \n\n Ion exchange resins Absorption of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by cholestyramine or \n\ncolestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of \n\nthiazide diuretics. However, staggering the dosage of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide and resin such that \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before \n\nor 4-6 hours after the administration of resins would \n\npotentially minimise the interaction. \n\n Medicinal products \n\naffecting serum \n\npotassium level \n\nThe hypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide may be \n\nincreased by concomitant administration of kaliuretic \n\ndiuretics, corticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocorticotropic \n\nhormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G and salicylic acid derivatives or \n\nantiarrhythmics. If these medicinal products are to be \n\nprescribed with the amlodipine /valsartan \n\n/hydrochlorothiazide combination, monitoring of \n\npotassium plasma levels is advised. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n Medicinal products \n\naffecting serum sodium \n\nlevel \n\nThe hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be intensified \n\nby concomitant administration of medicinal products such \n\nas antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. \n\nCaution is indicated in long-term administration of these \n\nmedicinal products. \n\n Medicinal products that \n\ncould induce torsades \n\nde pointes \n\nDue to the risk of hypokalaemia, hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould be administered with caution when associated with \n\nmedicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes, \n\nin particular Class Ia and Class III antiarrhythmics and \n\nsome antipsychotics. \n\n Medicinal products \n\nused in the treatment of \n\ngout (probenecid, \n\nsulfinpyrazone and \n\nallopurinol) \n\nDose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be \n\nnecessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of \n\nserum uric acid. Increase of dose of probenecid or \n\nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. \n\nCo-administration of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n Methyldopa There have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia \n\noccurring with concomitant use of hydrochlorothiazide \n\nand methyldopa. \n\n Non-depolarising \n\nskeletal muscle \n\nrelaxants (e.g. \n\ntubocurarine) \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the \n\naction of curare derivatives. \n\nOther anti-hypertensive \n\nmedicinal products \n\nThiazides potentiate the antihypertensive action of other \n\nantihypertensive drugs (e.g. guanethidine, methyldopa, \n\nbeta-blockers, vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, \n\nACE inhibitors, ARBs and Direct Renin Inhibitors \n\n[DRIs]). \n\nPressor amines (e.g. \n\nnoradrenaline, \n\nadrenaline) \n\nHydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor \n\namines such as noradrenaline. The clinical significance of \n\nthis effect is uncertain and not sufficient to preclude their \n\nuse. \n\nVitamin D and calcium \n\nsalts \n\nAdministration of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, with vitamin D or with calcium salts \n\nmay potentiate the rise in serum calcium. Concomitant use \n\nof thiazide type diuretics may lead to hypercalcaemia in \n\npatients pre-disposed for hypercalcaemia (e.g. \n\nhyperparathyroidism, malignancy or vitamin-D-mediated \n\nconditions) by increasing tubular calcium reabsorption. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the RAAS with ARBs, ACE inhibitors or aliskiren \n\nClinical trial data have shown that dual blockade of the RAAS through the combined use of ACE \n\ninhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as \n\nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to \n\nthe use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, \n\nreproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only \n\nrecommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the \n\nmother and foetus. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nThe use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first \n\ntrimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and \n\nthird trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \n\nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \n\nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \n\nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \n\nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \n\npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and if appropriate, \n\nalternative therapy should be started. \n\n \n\nExposure to AIIRAs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \n\nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \n\ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \n\nof renal function and skull is recommended. \n\n \n\nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \n\nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \n\ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and \n\nthrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nThere is no experience on the use of Exforge HCT in pregnant women. Based on the existing data with \n\nthe components, the use of Exforge HCT is not recommended during first trimester and contra-\n\nindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nAmlodipine is excreted in human milk. The proportion of the maternal dose received by the infant has \n\nbeen estimated with an interquartile range of 3-7%, with a maximum of 15%. The effect of amlodipine \n\non infants is unknown. No information is available regarding the use of valsartan during breast-\n\nfeeding. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses \n\ncausing intense diuresis can inhibit milk production. The use of Exforge HCT during breast-feeding is \n\nnot recommended. If Exforge HCT is used during breast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as \n\npossible. Alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are \n\npreferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical studies on fertility with Exforge HCT. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses \n\nup to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis \n\n(calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nPatients taking Exforge HCT and driving vehicles or using machines should take into account that \n\ndizziness or weariness may occasionally occur. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine can have mild or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients \n\ntaking Exforge HCT suffer from dizziness, headache, fatigue or nausea the ability to react may be \n\nimpaired. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of Exforge HCT presented below is based on clinical studies performed with \n\nExforge HCT and the known safety profile of the individual components amlodipine, valsartan and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe safety of Exforge HCT has been evaluated at its maximum dose of 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg in one \n\ncontrolled short-term (8 weeks) clinical study with 2,271 patients, 582 of whom received valsartan in \n\ncombination with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Adverse reactions were generally mild and \n\ntransient in nature and only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. In this active controlled \n\nclinical trial, the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Exforge HCT were \n\ndizziness and hypotension (0.7%). \n\n \n\nIn the 8-week controlled clinical study, no significant new or unexpected adverse reactions were \n\nobserved with triple therapy treatment compared to the known effects of the monotherapy or dual \n\ntherapy components. \n\n \n\nIn the 8-week controlled clinical study, changes in laboratory parameters observed with the \n\ncombination of Exforge HCT were minor and consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of \n\naction of the monotherapy agents. The presence of valsartan in the triple combination attenuated the \n\nhypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions, listed by MedDRA System Organ Class and frequency, concern \n\nExforge HCT (amlodipine/valsartan/HCT) and amlodipine, valsartan and HCT individually. \n\nVery common: ≥1/10; common:

\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nNon-melanoma skin cancer: based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative \n\ndose-dependent association between hydrochlorothiazide and NMSC has been observed (see also \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\n \n\nThere is no experience of overdose with Exforge HCT. The major symptom of overdose with valsartan \n\nis possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in excessive \n\nperipheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged systemic \n\nhypotension, including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to Exforge HCT overdose calls for active cardiovascular \n\nsupport, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, \n\nand attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in \n\nrestoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. \n\nIntravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nIf ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of \n\nactivated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine \n\nhas been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. \n\nAmlodipine is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\nValsartan is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common signs and \n\nsymptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and or \n\naccentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain \n\nanti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n\nThe degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II antagonists, \n\nother combinations, ATC code: C09DX01. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nExforge HCT combines three antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to \n\ncontrol blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium \n\nantagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide belongs to the thiazide diuretics class of medicines. The combination of these \n\nsubstances has an additive antihypertensive effect. \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nExforge HCT was studied in a double-blind, active controlled study in hypertensive patients. A total of \n\n2,271 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood pressure \n\nwas 170/107 mmHg) received treatments of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320 mg/25 mg, amlodipine/valsartan \n\n10 mg/320 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine 25 mg/10 mg. At study initiation patients were \n\nassigned lower doses of their treatment combination and were titrated to their full treatment dose by \n\nweek 2. \n\n \n\nAt week 8, the mean reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were 39.7/24.7 mmHg with \n\nExforge HCT, 32.0/19.7 mmHg with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 33.5/21.5 mmHg with \n\namlodipine/valsartan, and 31.5/19.5 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The triple \n\ncombination therapy was statistically superior to each of the three dual combination treatments in \n\nreduction of diastolic and systolic blood pressures. The reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure \n\nwith Exforge HCT were 7.6/5.0 mmHg greater than with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, \n\n6.2/3.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/valsartan, and 8.2/5.3 mmHg greater than with \n\namlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after \n\nbeing on their maximal dose of Exforge HCT. Statistically greater proportions of patients achieved \n\nblood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg) with Exforge HCT (71%) compared to each of the three dual \n\ncombination therapies (45-54%) (p<0.0001). \n\n \n\nIn a subgroup of 283 patients focusing on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinically and \n\nstatistically superior reductions in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed with \n\nthe triple combination compared to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nThe amlodipine component of Exforge HCT inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into \n\ncardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is \n\ndue to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular \n\nresistance and in blood pressure. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nExperimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine \n\nbinding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent \n\nupon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood \n\npressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with \n\nchronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and increases in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nAs with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and \n\nduring exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have \n\ngenerally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on \n\nleft ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been \n\nassociated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact \n\nanimals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals \n\nor humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta \n\nblockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic \n\nparameters were observed. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine has been studied in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and \n\nangiographically documented coronary artery disease. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nUse in patients with hypertension \n\nA randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering \n\ntreatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer therapies: \n\namlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-inhibitor) as \n\nfirst-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild to moderate \n\nhypertension. \n\n \n\nA total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of \n\n4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: \n\nprevious myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other \n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density \n\nlipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed \n\nby electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial \n\ninfarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based \n\ntherapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among \n\nsecondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined \n\ncardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the \n\nchlorthalidone group (10.2% versus 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there was \n\nno significant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and chlorthalidone-\n\nbased therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nValsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively \n\non the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nAdministration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without \n\naffecting pulse rate. \n\n \n\nIn most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs \n\nwithin 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4-6 hours. The antihypertensive \n\neffect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the maximum \n\nreduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2-4 weeks. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na+Cl- symporter perhaps by competing for the Cl- site, \n\nthereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride \n\nexcretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly, by this diuretic action, reducing plasma \n\nvolume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary \n\npotassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nNon-melanoma skin cancer \n\nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose-dependent association between \n\nhydrochlorothiazide and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of \n\n71,533 cases of BCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population \n\ncontrols, respectively. High hydrochlorothiazide use (≥50000 mg cumulative) was associated with an \n\nadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. \n\nA clear cumulative dose response relationship was observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study \n\nshowed a possible association between lip cancer (SCC) and exposure to hydrochlorothiazide: \n\n633 cases of lip cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, using a risk-set sampling \n\nstrategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an adjusted OR 2.1 (95% \n\nCI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25000 mg) and OR 7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the \n\nhighest cumulative dose (~100000 mg) (see also section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nExforge HCT in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nOther: dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\n \n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET [ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \n\ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial] and VA NEPHRON-D [The Veterans Affairs \n\nNephropathy in Diabetes]) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE inhibitor with an \n\nARB. \n\n \n\nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular \n\ndisease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-\n\nD was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. \n\n \n\nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \n\nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \n\ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \n\nresults are also relevant for other ACE inhibitors and ARBs. \n\n \n\nACE inhibitors and ARBs should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \n\nnephropathy (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \n\nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE inhibitor \n\nor an ARB in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular \n\ndisease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes. \n\nCardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than in \n\nthe placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the \n\nplacebo group. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\n \n\nAmlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n \n\nFollowing oral administration of Exforge HCT in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations \n\nof amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide are reached in 6-8 hours, 3 hours, and 2 hours, \n\nrespectively. The rate and extent of absorption of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide from \n\nExforge HCT are the same as when administered as individual dosage forms. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of \n\namlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and \n\n80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nVolume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that \n\napproximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nAmlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately \n\n30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. Ten \n\nper cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine. \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are reached \n\nin 2-4 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as measured by AUC) to \n\nvalsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, although from about 8 h \n\npost dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted groups. This reduction in \n\nAUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and \n\nvalsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is about 17 litres, \n\nindicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is highly bound to \n\nserum proteins (94-97%), mainly serum albumin. \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nBiotransformation \n\nValsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is recovered as metabolites. A \n\nhydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations (less than 10% of the valsartan \n\nAUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nValsartan shows multiexponential decay kinetics (t½α <1 h and t½ß about 9 h). Valsartan is primarily \n\neliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug. \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/h and its renal \n\nclearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 hours). The increase in \n\nmean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum \n\nproteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at \n\napproximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is eliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal \n\nelimination phase. There is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and \n\naccumulation is minimal when dosed once daily. More than 95% of the absorbed dose is being \n\nexcreted as unchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration \n\nand active secretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients (age below 18 years) \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or over) \n\nTime to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly \n\npatients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) \n\nand elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the \n\nyoung, therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage. \n\n \n\nSystemic exposure to valsartan is slightly elevated in the elderly as compared to the young, but this \n\nhas not been shown to have any clinical significance. \n\n \n\nLimited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and \n\nhypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nSince the three components are equally well tolerated in younger and elderly patients, normal dose \n\nregimens are recommended (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As expected \n\nfor a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no correlation \n\nwas seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan. \n\n \n\nPatients with mild to moderate renal impairment may therefore receive the usual initial dose (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide \n\nare increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Exforge HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nVery limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Patients with hepatic impairment have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting \n\nincrease of approximately 40–60% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic \n\nliver disease, exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy \n\nvolunteers (matched by age, sex and weight). Due to the valsartan component, Exforge HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nAmlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide \n\n \n\nIn a variety of preclinical safety studies conducted in several animal species with amlodipine, \n\nvalsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/valsartan and \n\namlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Exforge HCT), there was no evidence of systemic or target \n\norgan toxicity that would adversely affect the development of Exforge HCT for clinical use in humans. \n\n \n\nPreclinical safety studies of up to 13 weeks in duration were conducted with \n\namlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in rats. The combination resulted in expected reduction of \n\nred blood cell mass (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and reticulocytes), increase in serum \n\nurea, increase in serum creatinine, increase in serum potassium, juxtaglomerular (JG) hyperplasia in \n\nthe kidney and focal erosions in the glandular stomach in rats. All these changes were reversible after \n\na 4-week recovery period and were considered to be exaggerated pharmacological effects. \n\n \n\nThe amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination was not tested for genotoxicity or \n\ncarcinogenicity as there was no evidence of any interaction between these substances, which have \n\nbeen on the market for a long time. However, amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide have \n\nbeen tested individually for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity with negative results. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to provide \n\ndaily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. The \n\nhighest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of \n\n10 mg on a mg/m2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. \n\n \n\n* Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nValsartan \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \n\nand development. \n\n \n\nIn rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to \n\nlower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) \n\nin the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the \n\nmaximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of \n\n320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a \n\nreduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of \n\nchanges in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised blood urea nitrogen, and renal tubular hyperplasia \n\nand basophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and \n\n18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose \n\nof 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). \n\n \n\nIn marmosets at comparable doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the \n\nkidney where the changes developed to a nephropathy including raised blood urea nitrogen and \n\ncreatinine. \n\n \n\nHypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were \n\nconsidered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged \n\nhypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy \n\nof the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n27 \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Exforge HCT is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nExforge HCT tablets contain three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nAll of these substances help to control high blood pressure. \n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine \nstops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall, which stops the blood vessels from \n\ntightening. \n\n Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. \nAngiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the \n\nblood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. \n\n Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of substances called “thiazide diuretics”. \nHydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. \n\nAs a result of all three mechanisms, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. \n\n \n\nExforge HCT is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients whose blood pressure is already \n\ncontrolled while taking amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide and who may benefit from \n\ntaking one tablet containing all three substances. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n76 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Exforge HCT \n\n \n\nDo not take Exforge HCT \n\n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also recommended to avoid Exforge HCT in early \npregnancy – see Pregnancy section.) \n\n if you are allergic to amlodipine or to any other calcium channel blockers, valsartan, \nhydrochlorothiazide, sulphonamide-derived medicines (medicines used to treat chest or urinary \n\ninfections), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic, do not take Exforge HCT and talk to your doctor. \n\n if you have liver disease, destruction of the small bile ducts within the liver (biliary cirrhosis) \nleading to the build up of bile in the liver (cholestasis). \n\n if you have severe kidney problems or if you are having dialysis. \n\n if you are unable to produce urine (anuria). \n\n if the level of potassium or sodium in your blood is too low despite treatment to increase the \npotassium or sodium levels in your blood. \n\n if the level of calcium in your blood is too high despite treatment to reduce the calcium levels in \nyour blood. \n\n if you have gout (uric acid crystals in the joints). \n\n if you have severe low blood pressure (hypotension). \n\n if you have narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition \nwhere your heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body). \n\n if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack. \n\n if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \nlowering medicine containing aliskiren. \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Exforge HCT and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Exforge HCT \n\n if you have a low level of potassium or magnesium in your blood (with or without symptoms \nsuch as muscle weakness, muscle spasms, abnormal heart rhythm). \n\n if you have a low level of sodium in your blood (with or without symptoms such as tiredness, \nconfusion, muscle twitching, convulsions). \n\n if you have a high level of calcium in your blood (with or without symptoms such as nausea, \nvomiting, constipation, stomach pain, frequent urination, thirst, muscle weakness and \n\ntwitching). \n\n if you have kidney problems, have had a kidney transplant or if you had been told that you have \na narrowing of your kidney arteries. \n\n if you have liver problems. \n\n if you have or have had heart failure or coronary artery disease, particularly if you are \nprescribed the maximum dose of Exforge HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg). \n\n if you have experienced a heart attack. Follow your doctor’s instructions for the starting dose \ncarefully. Your doctor may also check your kidney function. \n\n if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called “aortic \nor mitral stenosis”) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called \n\n“obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy”). \n\n if you suffer from aldosteronism. This is a disease in which the adrenal glands make too much \nof the hormone aldosterone If this applies to you, the use of Exforge HCT is not recommended. \n\n if you suffer from a disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or \n“SLE”). \n\n if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). \n\n if you have high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood. \n\n if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure. \n\n if you had an allergic reaction to other high blood pressure medicines or diuretics (a type of \nmedicine also known as “water tablets”), especially if you suffer from asthma and allergies \n\n if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea). \n\n\n\n77 \n\n if you have experienced swelling, particularly of the face and throat, while taking other \nmedicines (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). If you get these symptoms, \n\nstop taking Exforge HCT and contact your doctor straight away. You should never take Exforge \n\nHCT again. \n\n if you experience dizziness and/or fainting during treatment with Exforge HCT, tell your doctor \nas soon as possible. \n\n if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain. These could be symptoms of fluid \naccumulation in the vascular layer of the eye (choroidal effusion) or an increase of pressure in \n\nyour eye and can happen within hours to a week of taking Exforge HCT. This can lead to \n\npermanent vision impairment, if not treated. \n\n if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n an ACE inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \n\n aliskiren. \n\n if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. \nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase \n\nthe risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin \n\nfrom sun exposure and UV rays while taking Exforge HCT. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \n\npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n\n \n\nSee also information under the heading “Do not take Exforge HCT”. \n\n \n\nIf any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor. \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe use of Exforge HCT in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended. \n\n \n\nElderly people (age 65 years and older) \n\nExforge HCT can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults and in \n\nthe same way as they have already taken the three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide.
