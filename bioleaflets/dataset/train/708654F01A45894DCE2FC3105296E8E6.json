QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains nominally 250/500/1000/2000/3000 IU human coagulation factor VIII.  \n \n\uf0b7 One mL Iblias 250 IU contains approximately 100 IU (250 IU / 2.5 mL) of recombinant human \n\ncoagulation factor VIII (INN: octocog alfa) after reconstitution with water for injections. \n\n\uf0b7 One mL Iblias 500 IU contains approximately 200 IU (500 IU / 2.5 mL) of recombinant human \ncoagulation factor VIII (INN: octocog alfa) after reconstitution with water for injections. \n\n\uf0b7 One mL Iblias 1000 IU contains approximately 400 IU (1000 IU / 2.5 mL) of recombinant \nhuman coagulation factor VIII (INN: octocog alfa) after reconstitution with water for injections. \n\n\uf0b7 One mL Iblias 2000 IU contains approximately 400 IU (2000 IU / 5 mL) of recombinant human \ncoagulation factor VIII (INN: octocog alfa) after reconstitution with water for injections. \n\n\uf0b7 One mL Iblias 3000 IU contains approximately 600 IU (3000 IU / 5 mL) of recombinant human \ncoagulation factor VIII (INN: octocog alfa) after reconstitution with water for injections. \n\n \nThe potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic assay. The specific \nactivity of Iblias is approximately 4000 IU/mg protein. \n \nOctocog alfa (Full length recombinant human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein \nthat has 2,332 amino acids. It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in baby hamster kidney \ncells (BHK) into which the human factor VIII gene has been introduced. Iblias is prepared without the \naddition of any human or animal derived protein in the cell culture process, purification or final \nformulation.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). Iblias can be used for all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition. \n \nThe number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are \nrelated to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is \nexpressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative \nto an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in \none mL of normal human plasma. \n \nOn Demand Treatment \n \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that \n1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% \nto 2.5% of normal activity. \nThe required dose is determined using the following formulae: \n \nRequired units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% or IU/dL) x reciprocal of observed \nrecovery (i.e. 0.5 for recovery of 2.0%). \n \nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be targeted to the \nclinical effectiveness required in the individual case. \n \nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the \ngiven level (in % of normal) in the corresponding period. The following table can be used to guide \ndosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 1: Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \nDegree of haemorrhage/ \nType of surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (%) (IU/dL) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/ \nDuration of therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding \n\n \n \n\n20 - 40 \n\nRepeat every 12 to 24 hours. At \nleast 1 day, until the bleeding \nepisode as indicated by pain is \nresolved or healing is achieved. \n\nMore extensive \nhaemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or haematoma \n\n30 - 60 Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours \nfor 3 - 4 days or more until pain and \nacute disability are resolved. \n\nLife threatening \nhaemorrhages \n\n60 - 100 Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours \nuntil threat is resolved \n\nSurgery \nMinor surgery \nincluding tooth extraction \n\n \n \n\n30 - 60 \n\n \nEvery 24 hours, at least 1 day, until \nhealing is achieved. \n\nMajor surgery 80 - 100 \n(pre- and post-\n\noperative) \n\nRepeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours \nuntil adequate wound healing, then \ntherapy for at least another 7 days to \nmaintain a factor VIII activity of \n30% to 60% (IU/dL). \n\n \nProphylaxis \nFor long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses for \nadolescents (\u2265 12 years age) and adult patients are 20 to 40 IU of Iblias per kg body weight two to \nthree times per week. \nIn some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary. \n \nPreviously untreated patients \nThe safety and efficacy of Iblias in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. \nLimited data are available. \n \nPaediatric population \nA safety and efficacy study has been performed in children of 0-12 years (see section 5.1); limited data \nare available for children below 1 year. \nThe recommended prophylaxis doses are 20-50 IU/kg twice weekly, three times weekly or every other \nday according to individual requirements. For paediatric patients above the age of 12, the dose \nrecommendations are the same as for adults.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nIntravenous use. \n \nIblias should be injected intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume. The rate of \nadministration should be determined by the patient\u2019s comfort level (maximal rate of infusion: \n2 mL/min). \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and \nthe package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\uf0b7 Known allergic reactions to mouse or hamster proteins. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with Iblias. \nIf symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue the use of the \nmedicinal product immediately and contact their physician. \nPatients should be informed of  the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, nausea, \ngeneralised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \n \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) \nper mL of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the \nseverity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first \n20 exposure days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days. \n \nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less risk of insufficient \nclinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. \nIf the expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with \nan appropriate dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with \nhigh levels of inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should \nbe considered. Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the \ncare of haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n \nCardiovascular events \n \nHaemophilic patients with cardiovascular risk factors or diseases may be at the same risk to develop \ncardiovascular events as non-haemophilic patients when clotting has been normalised by treatment \nwith FVIII. Elevation of FVIII levels following administration, in particular in those with existing \ncardiovascular risk factors, might cause a patient to have the same risk for vessel closure or \nmyocardial infarction as for the non-haemophilic population. Consequently, patients should be \nevaluated for cardiac risk factors. \n \nCatheter-related complications \n \nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteraemia  and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. These complications \nhave not been associated with the product itself. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nDocumentation \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time Iblias is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. \n \nSodium content \n \nFor 250/500/1000 IU strength: \nAfter reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.081 mmol sodium per vial of reconstituted \nsolution (corresponding to 1.86 mg per vial).

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol \nsodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium- free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have \nbeen reported. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nBased on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII \nduring pregnancy is not available. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with \nfactor VIII. \nTherefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy only if clearly indicated. \n \nBreast feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether Iblias is excreted in human milk. The excretion in animals has not been studied. \nTherefore, factor VIII should be used during breast-feeding only if clearly indicated. \n \nFertility \n \nNo animal fertility studies have been conducted with Iblias and its effect on human fertility has not \nbeen established in controlled clinical trials. Since Iblias is a replacement protein of endogenous \nfactor VIII, no adverse effects on fertility are expected. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines \n \nIf patients experience dizziness or other symptoms affecting their ability to concentrate and react, it is \nrecommended that they do not drive or use machines until the reaction subsides. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing)  have been observed and \nmay in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nDevelopment of antibodies to mouse and hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions may \noccur. \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with IbliasIf such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an \ninsufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre \nbe contacted. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihemorrhagics: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and \nvWF) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII \nbinds to vWF in the patient\u2019s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated \nfactor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts \nprothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. \nHaemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \nfactor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels \nof factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and \ncorrection of the bleeding tendencies. \n \nIblias does not contain von Willebrand factor. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is prolonged in people with haemophilia. \nDetermination of aPTT is a conventional in vitro assay for biological activity of factor VIII. Treatment \nwith rFVIII normalizes the aPTT similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor VIII. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nControl and Prevention of Bleeding \nTwo multi-center, open-label, cross-over, uncontrolled, randomized studies in previously treated \nadults/adolescents with severe haemophilia A (< 1%) and one multicenter, open label, uncontrolled \nstudy in previously treated children < 12 years with severe haemophilia A were conducted. \n \nA total of 204 subjects have been included in the clinical trial program, 153 subjects \u2265 12 years and \n51 subjects < 12 years. 140 subjects were treated for at least 12 months, and 55 of these subjects for a \nmedian of 24 months. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 3: Consumption and overall success rates (patients treated with prophylaxis only) \n Younger \n\nchildren \n(0 <6  \nyears) \n\nOlder \nchildren \n(6 <12  \nyears) \n\nAdolescents and adults \n12-65 years \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n\n  Study 1 Study 2 \n \n\n2 x/week \ndosing \n\nStudy 2 \n \n\n3 x/week \ndosing \n\n \n\nStudy \nparticipants \n\n25 26 62 28 31 172 \n\n       \nDose/prophylaxis \ninjection, IU/kg \nBW \nmedian (min, \nmax) \n\n36 IU/kg \n(21; \n\n58 IU/kg) \n\n32 IU/kg \n(22; \n\n50 IU/kg) \n\n31 IU/kg \n(21; \n\n43 IU/kg) \n\n30 IU/kg \n(21; \n\n34 IU/kg) \n\n37 IU/kg \n(30; \n\n42 IU/kg) \n\n32 IU/kg \n(21; \n\n58 IU/kg) \n \n\n       \nABR \u2013 all bleeds \n(median, Q1,Q3) \n\n2.0 \n(0.0; 6.0) \n\n0.9 \n(0.0; 5.8) \n\n1.0 \n(0.0; 5.1) \n\n4.0 \n(0.0; 8.0) \n\n2.0 \n(0.0; 4.9) \n\n2.0 \n(0.0; 6.1) \n\n       \nDose/injection for \nbleed treatment \nMedian (min; \nmax) \n\n39 IU/kg \n(21;72 IU\n\n/kg) \n\n32 IU/kg \n(22; \n\n50 IU/kg) \n\n29 IU/kg \n(13; \n\n54 IU/kg) \n\n28 IU/kg \n(19; \n\n39 IU/kg) \n\n31 IU/kg \n(21; \n\n49 IU/kg) \n\n31 IU/kg \n(13; \n\n72 IU/kg) \n\nSuccess rate* 92.4% 86.7% 86.3% 95.0% 97.7% 91.4% \n\nABR annualized bleed rate \nQ1 first quartile; Q3 third quartile \nBW: Body weight \n*Success rate defined as % of bleeds treated successfully with =/< 2 infusions \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of Iblias was evaluated in PTPs with severe haemophilia A \nfollowing 50 IU/kg in 21 subjects \u2265 18 years, 5 subjects \u2265 12 years and < 18 years and 19 subjects \n< 12 years of age.  \n \nA population PK model was developed based on all available FVIII measurements (from dense PK \nsampling and all recovery samples) throughout the 3 clinical studies allowing calculation of PK \nparameters for subjects in the various studies.

Consistent results were \ndetermined for both products. The FVIII:C of Iblias can be measured in plasma with a one-stage \ncoagulation assay as well as with a chromogenic assay using the routine methods of the laboratory. \n \nThe analysis of all recorded incremental recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a \nmedian rise of > 2% (> 2 IU/dL) per IU/kg body weight for Iblias. This result is similar to the reported \nvalues for factor VIII derived from human plasma.

What Iblias is and what it is used for \n \nIblias is a medicine that contains the active substance human recombinant coagulation factor VIII, also \ncalled octocog alfa. Iblias is prepared by recombinant technology without addition of any human- or \nanimal-derived components in the manufacturing process. Factor VIII is a protein naturally found in \nthe blood that helps to clot it. \n \nIblias is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in adults, adolescents and children of all ages \nwith haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Iblias \n \nDo not use Iblias  \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to octocog alfa or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6 and end of section 2).  \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins. \nDo not use Iblias if either of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \nusing this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTake special care with Iblias and talk to your doctor or pharmacist if: \n\uf0b7 you experience tightness in the chest, dizziness (including when you get up from sitting or lying \n\ndown), hives, itchy rash (urticaria), wheezing, or feeling sick or faint. These may be signs of a \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nrare severe sudden allergic reaction (an anaphylactic reaction) to Iblias. If this occurs, stop \nadministering the product immediately and seek medical advice. \n\n\uf0b7 your bleeding is not being controlled with your usual dose of Iblias. The formation of inhibitors \n(antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with all Factor VIII \nmedicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working properly and \nyou or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If your or \nyour child\u2019s bleeding is not being controlled with Iblias, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n\uf0b7 you have previously developed factor VIII inhibitors to a different product. If you switch \nfactor VIII products, you may be at risk of your inhibitor coming back. \n\n\uf0b7 you have been told you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease.  \n\uf0b7 you require a central venous access device (CVAD) for the administration of Iblias. You may be \n\nat  risk of CVAD-related complications including local infections, bacteria in the blood \n(bacteraemia) and the formation of a blood clot in the blood vessel (thrombosis) where the \ncatheter is inserted. \n\n \nOther medicines and Iblias \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to patients of all ages, adults and children. \n \nPregnancy and  breast-feeding \nExperience with the use of factor VIII products during pregnancy and breast-feeding are not available \nsince haemophilia A rarely occurs in women. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be \npregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. \n \nIblias is not likely to affect the fertility in male or female patients, as the active substance is naturally \noccurring in the body. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIf you experience dizziness or any other symptoms affecting your ability to concentrate and react, do \nnot drive or use machines until the reaction subsides. \n \nIblias contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, and is therefore considered \nessentially \u2018sodium- free\u2019. \n \nDocumentation \nIt is recommended that every time that you use Iblias, you note down name and batch number of the \nproduct. \n \n \n3. How to use Iblias \n \nTreatment with Iblias will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia A.Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor or \npharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nMe\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\nTreatment of bleeding \nYour doctor will calculate the dose of this medicine and how frequently you should use it to get the \nnecessary level of factor VIII activity in your blood. The doctor should always adjust the dose and the \nfrequency of administration according to your individual needs. How much Iblias you should use and \nhow often you should use it depends on many factors such as:  \n\n\uf0b7 your weight \n\uf0b7 the severity of your haemophilia \n\uf0b7 where the bleed is and how serious it is \n\uf0b7 whether you have inhibitors and how high the inhibitor titre is \n\uf0b7 the factor VIII level that is needed. \n\n \nPrevention of bleeding \nIf you are using Iblias to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis), your doctor will calculate the dose for you. \nThis will usually be in the range of 20 to 40 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight, injected two or \nthree times per week. However, in some cases, especially for younger patients, shorter dose intervals \nor higher doses may be necessary. \n \nLaboratory tests \nIt is strongly recommended that appropriate laboratory tests be performed on your plasma at suitable \nintervals to ensure that adequate factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained. For major \nsurgery in particular, close monitoring of the replacement therapy by means of coagulation analysis \nmust be carried out. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nIblias can be used in children of all ages. In children below the age of 12 higher doses or more \nfrequent injections than in adults may be needed. \n \nPatients with inhibitors \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you may need to \nuse a larger dose of Iblias to control bleeding. If this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor \nmay consider giving you another product. \nSpeak to your doctor if you would like further information on this. \nDo not increase the dose of Iblias to control your bleeding without checking with  your doctor. \n \nDuration of treatment \nYour doctor will tell you how often and at what intervals this medicine is to be administered. \nUsually, treatment for haemophilia needs to be given throughout your life-time. \n \nHow Iblias is given \nThis medicine is intended for injection into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume \nand your comfort level and should be used  within 3 hours after preparing the solution.  \n \nHow Iblias is prepared for administration \nUse only the items that are provided with each package of this medicine. If these components cannot \nbe used, please contact your doctor. If any component of the package is opened or damaged, do not \nuse it. \n \nYou must filter the reconstituted product before administration to remove any possible particles  in the \nsolution. You are filtering by using the Mix2Vial adapter. \n \nThis medicine must not be mixed with other infusion solutions. Do not use solutions containing \nvisible particles or that are cloudy. Follow the directions given by your doctor closely and use the \ndetailed instructions for reconstitution and administration provided at the end of this leaflet.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\nIf you use more Iblias than you should \nNo cases of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.  \nIf you have used more Iblias than you should, please tell your doctor. \n \nIf you forget to use Iblias \n\u2022 Administer your next dose immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your \n\ndoctor.  \n\u2022 Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  \n \nIf you stop using Iblias \nDo not stop using Iblias without checking with your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions regarding this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most serious side effects are allergic reactions or anaphylactic shock (an uncommon, severe \nallergic reaction affecting blood pressure and breathing). If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, \nstop the injection/infusion immediately and speak to your doctor at once. Any of the following \nsymptoms during injection/infusion can be an early warning for allergic and anaphylactic reactions: \n\uf0b7 chest tightness/general feeling of being unwell  \n\uf0b7 dizziness \n\uf0b7 mild hypotension (mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon \n\nstanding) \n\uf0b7 nausea \n \nFor patients who have received previous treatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) \ninhibitor antibodies (see section 2) may form uncommonly (less than 1 in 100 patients). If this happens \nyour medicine may stop working properly and you may experience persistent bleeding. If this \nhappens, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n \nOther possible side effects: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 users): \n\n\uf0b7 lymph nodes enlarged (swelling under the skin of the neck, armpit or groin) \n\uf0b7 heart palpitations (feeling your heart beating hard, rapidly, or irregularly) \n\uf0b7 rapid heartbeat \n\uf0b7 stomach pain or discomfort \n\uf0b7 indigestion  \n\uf0b7 fever \n\uf0b7 chest pain or discomfort \n\uf0b7 local reactions where you injected the medication (e.g. bleeding under the skin, intense \n\nitching, swelling, burning sensation, temporary redness) \n\uf0b7 headache \n\uf0b7 dizziness \n\uf0b7 trouble falling asleep \n\uf0b7 rash/itchy rash \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n28 \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 users): \n\uf0b7 allergic reactions including severe sudden allergic reaction  \n\uf0b7 dysgeusia (strange  taste) \n\uf0b7 urticaria (itchy rash) \n\uf0b7 flushing (redness of the face) \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor.

Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. \n \n2. Warm both unopened vials in your hands to a comfortable temperature (do not exceed 37 \u00b0C). \n \n3. Ensure product and solvent vial flip caps are removed and the stoppers are treated with an \n\nantiseptic solution and allowed to dry prior to opening the Mix2Vial package. \n \n4. Open the Mix2Vial package by peeling away the lid. Do not remove the \n\nMix2Vial from the blister package! \n \n\n4 \n5. Place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface and hold the vial tight. Take \n\nthe Mix2Vial together with the blister package and push the spike of the \nblue adapter end straight down through the solvent vial stopper. \n\n \n\n5 \n6. Carefully remove the blister package from the Mix2Vial set by holding at \n\nthe rim, and pulling vertically upwards. Make sure that you only pull away \nthe blister package and not the Mix2Vial set. \n\n \n\n6 \n7. Place the product vial on an even and firm surface. Invert the solvent vial \n\nwith the Mix2Vial set attached and push the spike of the transparent \nadapter end straight down through the product vial stopper. The solvent \nwill automatically flow into the product vial. \n\n \n\n7 \n8. With one hand grasp the product-side of the Mix2Vial set and with the other \n\nhand grasp the solvent-side and unscrew counter clockwise the set carefully \ninto two pieces. Discard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial adapter \nattached. \n\n \n\n8 \n9. Gently swirl the product vial with the transparent adapter attached until the \n\nsubstance is fully dissolved. Do not shake. Carefully check for particles and \ndiscoloration before administration. Do not use solutions containing visible \nparticles or that are cloudy. \n\n 9 \n10.  Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While the product vial is upright, \n\nconnect the syringe to the Mix2Vial\u00b4s Luer Lock fitting by screwing \nclockwise. Inject air into the product vial. \n\n \n\n10\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n32 \n\n11. While keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the system upside down and \ndraw the solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly. \n\n \n\n11 \n12. Now that the solution has been transferred into the syringe, firmly hold on to \n\nthe barrel of the syringe (keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and \ndisconnect the transparent Mix2Vial adapter from the syringe by unscrewing \ncounter clockwise. Hold the syringe upright and push the plunger until no air \nis left in the syringe. \n\n12 \n13. Apply a tourniquet to your arm. \n \n14. Determine the point of injection and clean the skin with an alcohol swab.  \n \n15. Puncture the vein and secure the venipuncture set with a plaster. \n \n16. Let blood flow back to the open end of the venipuncture set and then attach the syringe with the \n\nsolution. Make sure that no blood enters the syringe. \n \n17. Remove tourniquet. \n \n18. Inject the solution into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes, keeping an eye on the position of the needle. \n\nThe speed of injection should be based on your comfort, but should not be faster than 2.0 mL \nper minute. \n\n \n19. If a further dose needs to be administered, use a new syringe with product reconstituted as \n\ndescribed above. \n \n20. If no further dose is required, remove the venipuncture set and syringe. Hold a pad firmly over \n\nthe injection site on your outstretched arm for about  2 minutes. Finally, apply a small pressure \ndressing to the injection site  and consider if a plaster is necessary. \n\n \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnnex IV \n\nScientific conclusions  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n34 \n\nScientific conclusions  \n\nTreatment of congenital haemophilia is currently based on prophylactic or on-demand replacement \ntherapy with coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). FVIII replacement therapy can be generally \ncategorised into two broad classes of products; plasma derived (pdFVIII) and recombinant (rFVIII) \nFVIII. A wide range of individual pdFVIII and rFVIII products are authorised for use in the \nEuropean Union.  \n\nA major complication of FVIII therapy is the occurrence of IgG alloantibodies (inhibitors) that \nneutralise FVIII activity, causing loss of bleeding control. Treatment of patients who have \ndeveloped inhibitors requires careful individual management and can be resistant to therapy.  \n\nTreatment with both pdFVIII and rFVIII can lead to development of inhibitors (tested with the \nNijmegen method of the Bethesda assay and defined as \u2265 0.6 Bethesda units (BU) for \u201ca low titre\u201d \ninhibitor and >5 BU for a \u201chigh-titre\u201d inhibitor). \n\nThe occurrence of inhibitor development in haemophilia A patients receiving FVIII products mostly \noccurs in previously-untreated patients (PUPs) or minimally treated patients (MTPs) who are still \nwithin the first 50 days of exposure (EDs) to the treatment. Inhibitors are less likely to occur in \npreviously-treated patients (PTPs).  \n\nThe known risk factors for inhibitor development can be grouped into patient and treatment-related \nfactors:  \n\n\uf0b7 Patient-related risk factors include type of F8 gene mutation, severity of haemophilia, \nethnicity, family history of inhibitor development and possibly HLA-DR (Human Leukocyte \nAntigen - antigen D Related) constitution.  \n\n\uf0b7 Treatment-related factors include intensity of exposure, number of exposure days (EDs), on \ndemand treatment posing a greater risk than prophylaxis, particularly in the context of \ndanger signals such as trauma or surgery, and young age at first treatment poses a higher \nrisk.  \n\nWhether there are significant differences in the risk of inhibitor development between different \ntypes of FVIII replacement product remains an area of uncertainty. Differences between products \nin each FVIII class  and consequently differential risks between individual products, are biologically \nplausible. The pdFVIII class consists of products with or without Von Willebrand Factor (VWF), and \nthose with VWF contain a range of VWF levels. Some experimental studies have suggested a role \nfor VWF in protecting FVIII epitopes from recognition by the antigen-presenting cells, thereby \nreducing immunogenicity, although this remains theoretical. VWF is not present in rFVIII, but there \nis significant heterogeneity within the rFVIII class for instance due to the different manufacturing \nprocesses used, with a wide range of products from different manufacturers produced over the past \n20 years. These different manufacturing processes (including the different cell lines used to \nengineer the rFVIII products) can in theory lead to differential immunogenicity. \n\nIn May 2016, an open-label, randomised controlled trial aimed at addressing the incidence of \ninhibitors between the two classes (pdFVIII vs. rFVIII products) was published in the New England \nJournal of Medicine1. This trial, known as the SIPPET study (\u201cSurvey of Inhibitors in Plasma-Product \nExposed Toddlers\u201d) was conducted to evaluate the relative risk of inhibitors in patients treated with \npdFVIII compared to rFVIII. It found that patients treated with rFVIII products had an 87% higher \nincidence of all inhibitors than those treated with pdFVIII (which contained VWF) (hazard ratio, \n1.87; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.96).  \n\n                                                      \n1 F.

The \nreferral focuses on the risk of inhibitor development in PUPs.  \n\nFurther to the recent publication on the SIPPET study, the MAHs were requested to assess the \npotential impact of the results of this study and other relevant safety data on inhibitor development \nin PUPs on the MA of their FVIII product including consideration on risk minimisation measures.  \n\nThe lead authors of the SIPPET study were also invited to respond to a list of questions regarding \nthe study methods and findings and to present their conclusions at the February 2017 PRAC \nplenary meeting. Information submitted by the lead authors of the SIPPET study during the course \nof the referral was also taken into consideration by PRAC in reaching its conclusion.  \n\n \n\nClinical discussion  \n\nPublished observational studies \n\nThe responses of MAHs referred to a range of published observational studies (the CANAL, RODIN, \nFranceCoag, UKHCDO, amongst others) which have sought to evaluate any differential risks of \ninhibitor development between the classes of pdFVIII and rFVIII, as well as any differential risk of \ninhibitor development between products within the rFVIII class.  \n\nThese studies have yielded different results and suffer from the limitations of observational studies, \nand in particular from possible selection bias. The risk of inhibitor development is multifactorial \n(aside from any putative product-specific risk), and such studies have not always been able to \ncollect information on relevant covariates and to adjust the analyses accordingly; residual \nconfounding is inevitably a significant uncertainty. Furthermore, over time there have been \nchanges in manufacturing process of individual products and changes in treatment regimens \nbetween centres, hence \u201clike for like\u201d comparisons between products is not always possible. These \nfactors make control of such studies and interpretation of the results challenging. \n\nThe CANAL study2 found no evidence of a class difference, including pdFVIII products with \nconsiderable quantities of von Willebrand factor; for \u2018clinically relevant\u2019 inhibitors the adjusted \nhazard ratio was 0.7 (95% CI 0.4-1.1), and for high titre inhibitors (\u22655 BU) was 0.8 (95% CI 0.4-\n1.3).  \n\nThe RODIN/Pednet study3 also found no evidence of a class difference in inhibitor risk between all \npdFVIII vs all rFVIII; for \u2018clinically relevant\u2019 inhibitors the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.96 (95% CI \n0.62-1.49), and for high titre inhibitors (\u22655 BU/ml) was 0.95 (95% CI 0.56-1.61). However, the \nstudy found evidence of an increased risk of inhibitors (all and high titre) for 2nd generation rFVIII \noctocog alfa (Kogenate FS/Helixate NexGen) compared with 3rd generation rFVIII octocog alfa \n(which was driven solely by data for Advate). \n\nSimilar to RODIN/Pednet, the UKHCDO study found a significant increased risk of inhibitors (all and \nhigh titre) for Kogenate FS/Helixate NexGen (2nd generation rFVIII) compared to Advate (3rd \ngeneration rFVIII). Although this became non-significant when UK patients (also included in the \n                                                      \n2 http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/109/11/4648.full.pdf \n3 Gouw SC et al.

There was also evidence for an increased risk with Refacto AF \n(another 3rd generation rFVIII) vs Advate, but only for all inhibitor development. Like the UKHCDO \nstudy, the FranceCoag study also found no statistically significant increased risk for any rFVIII \nproducts vs Advate when French patients (also in the RODIN/Pednet study) were excluded.  \n\nPrior to the current referral, it was noted that PRAC had already considered the implications of the \nRODIN/Pednet, the UKHCDO and the FranceCoag studies for the EU marketing authorisations for \nFVIII products. In 2013, PRAC had concluded that the RODIN/Pednet findings were not sufficiently \nrobust to support a conclusion that Kogenate FS/Helixate NexGen was associated with an increased \nrisk of developing factor VIII inhibitors compared with other products. In 2016, PRAC had \nconsidered the findings of meta-analysis of all three studies (RODIN/Pednet, UKHCDO and \nFranceCoag studies), and again concluded that the currently available evidence does not confirm \nthat Kogenate Bayer/Helixate NexGen is associated with an increased risk of factor VIII inhibitors, \ncompared with other recombinant factor VIII products in PUPs. \n\n  MAH-sponsored studies \n\nThe MAHs provided an analysis of low and high titre inhibitor development in PUPs with severe \nhaemophilia A (FVIII < 1%) from all clinical trials and observational studies conducted with their \nproducts, along with critical discussion on the limitations of these studies.   \n\nThe data came from a very wide range of heterogenous studies across products and over time. Many of \nthese studies were small and not specifically designed to evaluate the inhibitor risk in PUPs with \nsevere haemophilia A. The studies were mostly single arm and do not provide data to perform \ncomparative analysis (either between pdFVIII and rFVIII as a class comparison, or within the rFVIII \nclass). However, the general estimates of inhibitor rates from these studies for individual products are \nbroadly in line with the findings from large observational studies. \n\nOf the larger and more relevant studies for pdFVIII products, inhibitor rates observed (often not stated \nif high or low titre) ranged from 3.5 to 33%, with most around 10-25%. However, in many cases little \ninformation was provided on the methods, patient populations and nature of the inhibitors to assess the \ninformation in the context of more recent published data. For most rFVIII products, newer and more \nrelevant information from clinical trials in PUPs is available. Inhibitor rates in these studies range \nfrom 15 to 38% for all inhibitors and 9 to 22.6% for high titre inhibitors; i.e. within the range of \u2018very \ncommon\u2019.  \n\nThe PRAC also considered interim results submitted by the MAHs from ongoing studies from CSL \n(CRD019_5001) and Bayer (Leopold KIDS, 13400, part B.). \n\nFurthermore, the PRAC examined clinical trials and the scientific literature for de novo inhibitors in \nPTPs. The analysis demonstrated that the frequency of inhibitor development is much lower in PTPs \ncompared to PUPs. The available data showed that in many studies including the EUHASS registry \n(Iorio A, 20174; Fischer K, 20155) the frequency could be classified as \u201cuncommon\u201d.  \n\nThe SIPPET study \n\nThe SIPPET study was an open-label, randomized, multi-centre, multi-national trial investigating \nthe incidence of neutralising allo-antibodies in patients with severe congenital haemophilia A \n                                                      \n4 Iorio A, Barbara AM, Makris M, Fischer K, Castaman G, Catarino C, Gilman E, Kavakli K, Lambert T, \nLassila R, Lissitchkov T, Mauser-Bunschoten E, Mingot-Castellano ME0, Ozdemir N1, Pabinger I, Parra R1, \nPasi J, Peerlinck K, Rauch A6, Roussel-Robert V, Serban M, Tagliaferri A, Windyga J, Zanon E: Natural \nhistory and clinical characteristics of inhibitors in previously treated haemophilia A patients: a case series. \nHaemophilia. 2017 Mar;23(2):255-263. doi: 10.1111/hae.13167.

Eligible \npatients (<6 years, male, severe haemophilia A, no previous treatment with any FVIII concentrate \nor only minimal treatment with blood components) were included from 42 sites. The primary and \nsecondary outcomes assessed in the study were the incidence of all inhibitors (\u22650.4 BU/ml) and \nthe incidence of high-titre inhibitors (\u22655 BU/ml), respectively. \n\nInhibitors developed in 76 patients, 50 of whom had high-titre inhibitors (\u22655 BU). Inhibitors \ndeveloped in 29 of the 125 patients treated with pdFVIII (20 patients had high-titre inhibitors) and \nin 47 of the 126 patients treated with rFVIII (30 patients had high-titre inhibitors). The cumulative \nincidence of all inhibitors was 26.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.4 to 35.2) with pdFVIII and \n44.5% (95% CI, 34.7 to 54.3) with rFVIII; the cumulative incidence of high-titre inhibitors was \n18.6% (95% CI, 11.2 to 26.0) and 28.4% (95% CI, 19.6 to 37.2), respectively. In Cox regression \nmodels for the primary end point of all inhibitors, rFVIII was associated with an 87% higher \nincidence than pdFVIII (hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.96). This association was \nconsistently observed in multivariable analysis. For high-titre inhibitors, the hazard ratio was 1.69 \n(95% CI, 0.96 to 2.98).  \n\n Ad hoc expert group meeting \n\nThe PRAC considered the views expressed by experts during an ad-hoc meeting. The expert group \nwas of the view that the relevant available data sources have been considered. The expert group \nsuggested that further data are needed to establish if there are clinically relevant differences in \nfrequency of inhibitor development between different factor VIII products and that, in principle, \nsuch data should be collected separately for individual products, as degree of immunogenicity will \nbe difficult to generalise across the classes of products (i.e. recombinant vs. plasma-derived). \n\nThe experts also agreed that the degree of immunogenicity of different products was adequately \ndescribed overall with the amendments to the SmPC proposed by the PRAC highlighting the clinical \nrelevance of inhibitor development (in particular low compared to high titre inhibitors), as well as \nthe  frequency of \u2018very common\u2019 in PUPs and \u2018uncommon\u2019 in PTPs. The experts also suggested \nstudies which could further characterise the immunogenic properties of the factor VIII medicinal \nproducts (e.g. mechanistic, observational studies).   \n\n \n\nDiscussion  \n\nThe PRAC considered that as a prospective randomised trial, the SIPPET study avoided many of the \ndesign limitations of the observational and registry-based studies undertaken so far to evaluate the \nrisk of inhibitor development in PUPs. However the PRAC is of the view that there are uncertainties \nwith regards to the findings of the SIPPET study which preclude the conclusion that there is a \nhigher risk of inhibitor development in PUPs treated with rFVIII products than pdFVIII products \nstudied in this clinical trial, as detailed below:   \n\n\uf0b7 The SIPPET analysis does not allow for product-specific conclusions to be made as it relates \nonly to a small number of certain FVIII products. The study was not designed and powered \nto generate sufficient product-specific data and, therefore, to draw any conclusions on the \nrisk of inhibitor development for individual products. In particular, only 13 patients (10% of \nthe FVIII arm) received a third generation rFVIII product. However, despite the lack of \nrobust evidence to support differential risks between rFVIII products, differential risks \ncannot be excluded, as this is a heterogeneous product class with differences in \ncomposition and formulations. Therefore, there is a high degree of uncertainty around \nextrapolating the SIPPET findings to the entire rFVIII class, particularly for more recently-\nauthorised rFVIII products which were not included in the SIPPET trial.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n38 \n\n\uf0b7 The SIPPET study has methodological limitations, with particular uncertainty around whether \nthe randomisation process (block size of 2) may have introduced a selection bias in the \nstudy.   \n\n\uf0b7 There were also deviations from the final protocol and statistical analysis plan. The statistical \nconcerns include the fact that no pre-specified primary analysis has been published and the \nfact that the study was stopped early following the publication of the RODIN study \nindicating that Kogenate FS might be associated with an increased risk of inhibitor \nformation. Although this could not have been prevented, an early termination of an open \nlabel trial raises the possibility of investigator bias and inflation of the probability of \ndetecting an effect that is not present. \n\n\uf0b7 Treatment regimens in EU are different from those in the SIPPET study. The relevance for \nclinical practice in the EU (and therefore for the products subject to this procedure) is \ntherefore questioned. It is uncertain whether the findings of SIPPET can be extrapolated to \nthe risk of inhibitors in PUPs in current clinical practice in the EU as treatment modality and \nintensity have been suggested as risk factors for inhibitor development in previous studies. \nImportantly, the EU SmPCs do not include modified prophylaxis (as defined in the SIPPET \nstudy) as an authorised posology, and the impact of the apparent imbalance in the \nunspecified other combinations of treatment modality on the SIPPET findings is unclear. \nTherefore, it remains uncertain whether the same differential risk of inhibitor development \nobserved in the SIPPET study would be apparent in patient populations treated in routine \ncare in other countries where the modality of treatment (i.e. primary prophylaxis) is \ndifferent from that in the study. The additional points of clarification provided by the \nSIPPET authors do not fully resolve this uncertainty. \n\nHaving considered the abovementioned results from SIPPET, the published literature and all the \ninformation submitted by the MAHs, as well as the views expressed by experts expressed at the \nad-hoc expert meeting, the PRAC concluded that: \n\n\uf0b7 Inhibitor development is an identified risk with both pdFVIII and rFVIII products. Although \nthe clinical studies for some individual products have identified limited numbers of cases of \ninhibitor development, these tend to be small studies with methodological limitations, or \nstudies not adequately designed to evaluate this risk. \n\n\uf0b7 The FVIII products are heterogenous, and the plausibility of different rates of inhibitor \ndevelopment between individual products cannot be excluded.  \n\n\uf0b7 Individual studies have identified a wide range of inhibitor development across products, but \nthe direct comparability of study results is questionable based on diversity of study \nmethods and patient populations over time.  \n\n\uf0b7 The SIPPET study was not designed to evaluate the risk of inhibitor development for \nindividual products, and included a limited number of FVIII products. Due to heterogeneity \nacross products, there is considerable uncertainty in extrapolating the findings of studies \nthat have evaluated only class effects to individual products; and particularly to products \n(including more recently authorised products) which are not included in such studies. \n\n\uf0b7 Finally, the PRAC noted that to date most studies evaluating a differential risk of inhibitor \ndevelopment between classes of FVIII products suffer from a variety of potential \nmethodological limitations and based on the available data considered there is no clear and \nconsistent evidence to suggest differences in relative risk between classes of FVIII \nproducts. Specifically, the findings from the SIPPET study, as well as those from the \nindividual clinical trials and observational studies included in the MAH responses, are not \nsufficient to confirm any consistent statistically and clinically meaningful differences in \ninhibitor risk between the rFVIII and pdFVIII product classes. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n39 \n\nIn view of the above, the PRAC recommended the following updates of sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of \nthe SmPC as well as sections 2 and 4 of the Package Leaflet for the FVIII products indicated for the \ntreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency) as follows: \n\n\uf0b7 The section 4.4 of the SmPC should be amended to include a warning on the clinical \nimportance of monitoring patients for FVIII inhibitor development (in particular warning on \nthe clinical consequences of low compared to high titre inhibitors).  \n\n\uf0b7 With regards to sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC, the PRAC noted that several FVIII \nproducts currently include reference to data from study results which do not allow for a \ndefinite conclusion on the inhibitor risk for individual products. As the evidence suggests \nthat all human FVIII products carry a risk of inhibitor development such statements should \nbe removed. The available data supports a frequency of FVIII inhibitor development within \nthe frequency of \u2018very common\u2019 and \u2018uncommon\u2019, for PUPs and PTPs respectively, therefore \nthe PRAC recommends that the SmPCs should be aligned with these frequencies unless \njustified by product specific data. For products for which section 4.2 contains the following \nstatement for PUPs: \u201c<Previously untreated patients. The safety and efficacy of \n{(Invented) name} in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. No data \nare available. >), the above frequency for PUPs should not be implemented. In relation to \nsection 5.1, any reference to inhibitor development studies in PUPs and PTPs should be \ndeleted unless the studies were conducted in compliance with a Paediatric Investigation \nPlan or the studies provide robust evidence of a frequency of inhibitors in PUP which is less \nthan \u2018very common\u2019 or for PTPs which is different from \u2018uncommon\u2019 (as laid down in the \nattachments of the PRAC AR). \n\nFurther to the assessment of the totality of the responses submitted by the MAH for susoctocog \nalfa (Obizur), the PRAC is of the opinion that the outcome of this article 31 referral procedure does \nnot apply to this product in view of the indication of Obizur (acquired haemophilia A due to \ninhibitory antibodies to endogenous FVIII) and the different target population. \n\n \n\nBenefit \u2013risk balance \n\nBased on the current evidence from the SIPPET study, as well as data from the individual clinical \ntrials and observational studies included in the MAH responses, and the views expressed by the \nexperts of the ad-hoc expert meeting, the PRAC agreed that the current evidence does not provide \nclear and consistent evidence of any statistically and clinically meaningful differences in inhibitor \nrisk between rFVIII and pdFVIII products. No conclusions can be drawn on any role of VWF in \nprotecting against inhibitor development. \n\nGiven these are heterogenous products, this does not preclude individual products being associated \nwith an increased risk of inhibitor development in ongoing or future PUP studies. \n\nIndividual studies have identified a wide range of inhibitor frequency in PUPs across products, and \nthe SIPPET study was not designed to differentiate between individual products in each class. Due \nto very different study methods and patient populations that have been studied over time, and \ninconsistent findings across studies, the PRAC found that the totality of evidence does not support \na conclusion that recombinant factor VIII medicines, as a class, poses a greater risk of inhibitor \ndevelopment than the class derived from plasma. \n\nBesides, the PRAC noted that several FVIII products currently include in their product information \nreference to data from study results which do not allow a definite conclusion on the inhibitor risk \nfor individual products. As the evidence suggests that all human FVIII products carry a risk of \ninhibitor development, within the frequency of \u2018very common\u2019 and \u2018uncommon\u2019 for PUPs and PTPs \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40 \n\nrespectively, the PRAC recommends that the SmPCs should be aligned with these frequencies \nunless justified by product specific data. \n\nIn view of the above, the PRAC concluded that the benefit-risk balance of Factor VIII products \nindicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital \nfactor VIII deficiency), remains favourable subject to the changes to the product information \nagreed (section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC).  \n\nRe-examination procedure \n\nFollowing the adoption of the PRAC recommendation during the May 2017 PRAC meeting, the MAH \nLFB Biomedicaments expressed their disagreement with the initial PRAC recommendation.  \n\nGiven the detailed grounds provided by the MAH, the PRAC carried out a new assessment of the \navailable data in the context of the re-examination.  \n\nPRAC discussion on grounds for re-examination \n\nThe SIPPET study was not designed to evaluate the risk of inhibitor development for individual \nproducts, and included a limited number of FVIII products. Due to heterogeneity across products, \nthere is considerable uncertainty in extrapolating the findings of studies that have evaluated only \nclass effects to individual products; and particularly to products (including more recently authorised \nproducts) which are not included in such studies. The findings from the SIPPET study, as well as \nthose from the individual clinical trials and observational studies, are not sufficient to confirm any \nconsistent statistically and clinically meaningful differences in inhibitor risk between the rFVIII and \npdFVIII product classes. \n\nOverall, the PRAC maintains its conclusions that standardised information on the frequency for \nFVIII products in PUP and PTP should be reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC, unless another \nfrequency range for a specific medicinal product is demonstrated by robust clinical studies for \nwhich the results would be summarised in section 5.1. \n\nExpert consultation \n\nThe PRAC consulted an ad-hoc expert meeting on some of the aspects that formed part of the \ndetailed grounds submitted by LFB Biomedicaments. \n\nOverall, the expert group supported the PRAC initial conclusions and agreed that the proposed \nproduct information provides an adequate level of information to appropriately communicate to \nprescribers and patients about the risk of inhibitor development. No additional communication, on \nrisk factors for inhibitor development beyond the product information or any additional risk \nminimisation measures was recommended. \n\nThe group also agreed that specific data about frequency of inhibitors for each product should not \nbe included in the SmPC as the available studies are not adequately powered to draw precise \nconclusions on the absolute frequency for each product or on the relative frequency of inhibitors \nbetween products.  \n\nThe experts emphasized that collaboration between academia, industry and regulators should be \nencouraged to collect harmonised data through registries.  \n\nPRAC conclusions \n\nIn conclusion, further to the initial assessment and the re-examination procedure, PRAC maintains \nits conclusion that the benefit-risk balance of the human plasma derived and recombinant \ncoagulation Factor VIII containing medicinal products remains favourable subject to the agreed \nchanges to the product information (section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41 \n\nThe PRAC adopted a recommendation on 01 September 2017 which was then considered by the \nCHMP, in accordance with Article 107k of Directive 2001/83/EC. \n\n \n\nOverall summary of the scientific evaluation by the PRAC \n\nWhereas,  \n\n\u2022 The PRAC considered the procedure under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC resulting from \npharmacovigilance data, for human plasma derived and recombinant coagulation factor \nVIII containing medicinal products (see Annex I and Annex A).  \n\n\u2022 The PRAC considered the totality of the data submitted with regards to the risk of inhibitor \ndevelopment for the classes of recombinant and plasma derived FVIII products, in \npreviously untreated patients (PUPs). This included published literature (SIPPET study6), \ndata generated in individual clinical trials and a range of observational studies submitted by \nthe marketing authorisation holders, including the data generated in large multicentre \ncohort studies, data submitted by the national competent authorities of the EU Member \nStates as well as responses provided by the Authors of the SIPPET study. PRAC also \nconsidered grounds submitted by LFB Biomedicaments as basis for their request for re-\nexamination of the PRAC recommendation and the views of two experts meetings held on \n22 February and 3 August 2017. \n\n\u2022 The PRAC noted that the SIPPET study was not designed to evaluate the risk of inhibitor \ndevelopment for individual products, and included a limited number of FVIII products in \ntotal. Due to the heterogeneity across products, there is considerable uncertainty in \nextrapolating the findings of studies evaluating only class effects to individual products; \nand particularly to the products that are not included in such studies. \n\n\u2022 The PRAC also considered that studies conducted to date suffer from a variety of \nmethodological limitations and, on balance, there is no clear and consistent evidence to \nsuggest differences in relative risks between FVIII product classes based on available data. \nSpecifically, the findings from the SIPPET study, as well as those from the individual clinical \ntrials and observational studies included in the MAH responses, are not sufficient to confirm \nany consistent statistically and clinically meaningful differences in inhibitor risk between \nrFVIII and pdFVIII product classes. Given these are heterogenous products, this does not \npreclude individual products being associated with an increased risk of inhibitor \ndevelopment in ongoing or future PUP studies. \n\n\uf0b7 The PRAC noted that the efficacy and safety of Factor VIII products as indicated in the \ntreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A have been \nestablished.Based on the available data, the PRAC considered that SmPC updates for the \nFVIII products are warranted: section 4.4 should be amended to include a warning on the \nclinical importance of monitoring patients for FVIII inhibitor development. With regards to \nsections 4.8 and 5.1, the PRAC noted that several FVIII products currently include \nreference to data from study results which do not allow a definite conclusion on the \ninhibitor risk for individual products. Results of clinical studies not sufficiently robust (e.g. \nsuffering from methodolical limitations) should not be reflected in the product information \non FVIIII products. The PRAC recommended changes to the product information \naccordingly. Besides, as the evidence suggests that all human FVIII products carry a risk of \ninhibitor development, within the frequency of \u2018very common\u2019 and \u2018uncommon\u2019, for PUPs \n\n                                                      \n6 Peyvandi F, Mannucci PM, Garagiola I, et al.
