NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nCufence 200 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach hard capsule contains 300 mg trientine dihydrochloride equivalent to 200 mg trientine. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nHard capsule. \n\n \n\nWhite, oval-shaped size 0 capsule printed with ‘Cufence’ in grey ink. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nCufence is indicated for the treatment of Wilson’s disease in patients intolerant to D-Penicillamine \n\ntherapy, in adults, adolescents and children aged 5 years or older. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment should only be initiated by specialist physicians with experience in the management of \n\nWilson’s disease. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe starting dose would usually correspond to the lowest recommended dose and the dose should \n\nsubsequently be adapted according to the patient’s clinical response (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 800 – 1,600 mg (4-8 capsules) daily in 2 to 4 divided doses. \n\n \n\nThe recommended doses of Cufence are expressed as mg of trientine base (i.e. not in mg of the \n\ntrientine dihydrochloride salt) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nThere is insufficient clinical information available for Cufence to determine whether there exist \n\ndifferences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be \n\ncautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range as recommended for adults, reflecting the \n\ngreater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other \n\ndrug therapy.  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThere is limited information in patients with renal impairment. Therefore, the recommended dose in \n\npatients with renal impairment is the same as for adults. For specific precautions see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n\n\n3 \n\nThere is limited information in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, the recommended dose in \n\npatients with hepatic impairment is the same as for adults. For specific precautions see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nPatients primarily presenting hepatic symptoms \n\nThe recommended dose in patients primarily presenting hepatic symptoms is the same as the \n\nrecommended adult dose.  It is advised, however, to monitor patients presenting with hepatic \n\nsymptoms every two to three weeks after initiation of treatment with Cufence. \n\n \n\nPatients primarily presenting neurological symptoms \n\nDose recommendations are the same as for adults. However, up titration should be done with \n\nmoderation and consideration, and adapted according to the patient’s clinical response such as \n\nworsening of tremor as patients could be at risk of neurological deterioration at initiation of treatment \n\n(see section 4.4). It is further advised to monitor patients presenting with neurological symptoms every \n\none to two weeks after initiation of treatment with Cufence until target dose is reached. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe dose is lower than for adults and depends on age and body weight. The dose should be adjusted \n\naccording to clinical response; 400 – 1,000 mg (2-5 capsules) have been used at initiation of therapy \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nChildren < 5 years  \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Cufence in children aged 0 to 5 years have not yet been established. No data \n\nare available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nFor oral use.  \n\n \n\nCapsules should be swallowed whole with water.  \n\n \n\nIt is important that Cufence is given on an empty stomach, at least one hour before meals or two hours \n\nafter meals, and at least one hour apart from any other medicinal product, food or milk (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nWhen switching a patient from another trientine formulation, caution is advised because different \n\ntrientine salts are available which may have a different trientine content (base) and a different \n\nbioavailability. Dose adjustment may be required (see section 4.2).   \n\n \n\nTrientine is a chelating agent which has been found to reduce serum iron levels. Iron supplementation \n\nmay be necessary in some cases. Concomitant oral iron should be administred at a different time than \n\ntrientine (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nThe combination of trientine with zinc is not recommended. There are only limited data on \n\nconcomitant use available and no specific dose recommendations can be made. \n\n \n\nThere is no evidence that calcium and magnesium antacids alter the efficacy of trientine but it is \n\nrecommended to separate their administration (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nIn patients who were previously treated with D-Penicillamine, lupus-like reactions have been reported \n\nduring subsequent treatment with trientine, however it is not possible to determine if there is a causal \n\nrelationship with trientine. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nMonitoring \n\nPatients receiving Cufence should remain under regular medical supervision and be monitored using \n\nall available clinical data for appropriate control of clinical symptoms and copper levels in order to \n\noptimise treatment. Frequency of monitoring is recommended to be at least twice a year. More \n\nfrequent monitoring is advised during the initial phase of treatment and during phases of disease \n\nprogression or when dose adjustments are made as to be decided by the treating physician (see \n\nsection 4.2).  \n\n \n\nThe aim of maintenance treatment is to maintain free copper levels in plasma (also known as non-\n\nceruloplasmin plasma copper) and the urinary copper excretion within the acceptable limits.  \n\n \n\nThe determination of serum free copper, calculated using the difference between the total copper and \n\nthe ceruloplasmin-bound copper (normal level of free copper in the serum is usually 100 to \n\n150 microgram/L), can be a useful index for monitoring therapy. \n\n \n\nThe measurement of copper excretion in the urine may be performed during therapy. Since chelation \n\ntherapy leads to an increase in urinary copper levels, this may/will not give an accurate reflection of \n\nthe excess copper load in the body but may be a useful measure of treatment compliance. \n\n \n\nThe use of appropriate copper parameter target ranges is described in clinical practice guidelines \n\nrelated to Wilson’s disease. \n\n \n\nLike with all anti-copper agents, overtreatment carries the risk of copper deficiency, which is \n\nespecially harmful for children and pregnant women (see section 4.6) since copper is required for \n\nproper growth and mental development. Therefore, monitoring for manifestations of overtreatment \n\nshould be undertaken. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal and/or hepatic impairment receiving trientine should remain under regular medical \n\nsupervision for appropriate control of symptoms and copper levels. Close monitoring of renal and/or \n\nliver function is also recommended in these patients (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nWorsening of neurological symptoms may occur at the beginning of chelation therapy due to excess of \n\nfree serum copper during the initial response to treatment. It is possible that this effect may be more \n\nevident in patients with pre-existing neurological symptoms. It is recommended to monitor patients \n\nclosely for such signs and symptoms and to consider careful titration to reach the recommended \n\ntherapeutic dose and to reduce dose when necessary.  \n\n \n\nDose adjustments in the trientine dose should be considered in case of signs of reduced efficacy such \n\nas (persistent) increase in liver enzymes, and worsening of tremor. When trientine doses are adjusted \n\nthis should be done in small steps. The trientine dose may also be reduced in case of side effects of \n\ntrientine, such as gastrointestinal complaints and haematological changes. Trientine doses should be \n\nreduced to a more tolerable dose and may be increased again, once side effects have been resolved. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed.  \n\n \n\nZinc \n\nThere are insufficient data to support the concomitant use of zinc and trientine. The combination of \n\ntrientine with zinc is not recommended as interaction of zinc with trientine is likely, thereby reducing \n\nthe effect of both active substances. \n\n \n\nOther anti-copper agents \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed on the concomitant administration of trientine with D-\n\nPenicillamine. \n\n \n\nFood \n\n\n\n5 \n\nTrientine is poorly absorbed following oral intake and food further inhibits trientine absorption. \n\nSpecific food interaction studies have been performed with trientine in healthy subjects, showing a \n\nreduction of the extent of absorption of trientine up to 45%. Systemic exposure is critical for its \n\nprincipal mechanism of action, copper chelation (see section 5.1). Therefore,  it is recommended that \n\ntrientine is taken at least 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals and at least one hour apart from \n\nany other medicinal product, food, or milk to allow for maximum absorption and reduce the likelihood \n\nof the formation of complexes by metal binding in the gastrointestinal tract (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nOther products \n\nTrientine has been found to reduce serum iron levels. Therefore, iron supplementation may be \n\nnecessary in some cases. Concomitant oral iron or other heavy metals should be administred at a \n\ndifferent time than trientine to prevent the formation of complexes (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAlthough there is no evidence that calcium and magnesium antacids alter the efficacy of trientine, it is \n\ngood practice to separate their administration (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of trientine in pregnant women.  \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity, which was probably a result of trientine-induced \n\ncopper deficiency (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nTrientine should be used in pregnancy only after careful consideration of the benefits compared with \n\nthe risks of discontinuing treatment in the individual patient. Factors to consider include the known \n\nrisks associated with untreated or undertreated Wilson’s disease, risks associated with the stage of \n\ndisease, the risk of those alternative treatments which are available and the possible effects of trientine \n\n(see section 5.3).  \n\n \n\nIf treatment with trientine is to be continued following a risk-benefit analysis, consideration should be \n\ngiven to reducing the dose of trientine to the lowest effective dose and monitoring compliance with the \n\ntreatment regimen. \n\n \n\nThe pregnancy should be closely monitored in order to detect possible foetal abnormality and to assess \n\nmaternal serum copper levels throughout the pregnancy. The dose of trientine used should be adjusted \n\nin order to maintain serum copper levels within the normal range. Since copper is required for proper \n\ngrowth and mental development, dose adjustments may be required to ensure that the foetus will not \n\nbecome copper deficient and close monitoring of the patient is essential (see section 4.4) \n\n \n\nBabies born to mothers being treated with trientine should be monitored for serum copper and \n\nceruloplasmin levels where appropriate. \n\n \n\nBreastfeeding \n\nThere is limited clinical data suggesting that trientine is not excreted in breast milk. However, a risk to \n\nthe newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  \n\n \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \n\ntrientine therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \n\ntherapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nIt is unknown whether trientine has an effect on human fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nTrientine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nNausea can commonly occur on initial treatment and occasionally skin rash can occur. Duodenitis and \n\nsevere colitis have been reported. Neurological deterioration can occur at the start of the treatment.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \n\nPreferred Term Level). Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to \n\n< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not \n\nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nMedDRA- system organ class database Adverse reaction \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: Uncommon: Anaemia \n\nUncommon: Aplastic anaemia \n\nUncommon: Sideroblastic \n\nanaemia \n\nNervous system disorders: Uncommon: Dystonia \n\nUncommon: Tremor  \n\nNot known: Dysarthria  \n\nNot known: Muscle rigidity \n\nNot known: Neurological  \n\ndeterioration \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: Lupus-like \n\nsyndrome  \n\nNot known: Lupus nephritis \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Common: Nausea  \n\nNot known: Colitis \n\nNot known: Duodenitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Uncommon: Rash \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nThere have been reports of neurological deterioration at the start of treatment in Wilson’s disease \n\npatients treated with copper chelators including trientine, with symptoms of, for example, dystonia, \n\nrigidity, tremor and dysarthria (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nClinical trials with Cufence including a limited number of children in the age range of 5 to 17 years at \n\nthe start of treatment indicate that frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are \n\nexpected to be the same as in adults. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nOccasional cases of trientine overdose have been reported. In cases up to 20 g of trientine base there \n\nwere no apparent adverse effects reported. A large overdose of 40 g of trientine base resulted in self-\n\nlimiting dizziness and vomiting with no other clinical sequelae or significant biochemical \n\nabnormalities reported.  \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nIn the event of overdose the patient should be observed, appropriate biochemical analysis performed \n\nand symptomatic treatment given. There is no antidote. \n\n \n\nChronic overtreatment can lead to copper deficiency and reversible sideroblastic anaemia. \n\nOvertreatment and excess copper removal can be monitored using values of urine copper excretion \n\nand of non-ceruloplasmin bound copper. Close monitoring is required to optimise the dose or adapt \n\ntreatment if necessary (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism, various alimentary tract and \n\nmetabolism products, ATC code: A16AX12 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nTrientine is a copper-selective chelator that enhances systemic elimination of divalent copper by \n\nforming a stable complex that is readily excreted by the kidneys. Trientine is a chelator with a \n\npolyamine-like structure and copper is chelated by forming a stable complex with the four constituent \n\nnitrogens in a planar ring. Thus, the pharmacodynamic action of trientine is dependent on its chemical \n\nproperty of chelating copper and not on its interaction with receptors, enzyme systems or any other \n\nbiological system that might differ between species. Trientine may also chelate copper in the intestinal \n\ntract and so inhibit copper absorption. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe bioavailability of trientine capsules in human beings has not been established. Based on \n\npreclinical data, the mechanism of absorption and the high first pass effect, it is expected that trientine \n\nbioavailability is low and highly variable following oral administration. Clinical studies showed that \n\ntrientine is absorbed with tmax occurring between 0.5 and 6 hours post-dose in healthy volunteers and \n\npatients. Exposure to trientine is highly variable between subjects, with a variation of up to 60%. \n\n \n\nThe intake of food within 30 minutes prior to trientine administration delays the time to peak \n\nconcentrations by 2 hours and reduces the extent of absorption of trientine by approximately 45%. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nTrientine has low human plasma protein binding and is widely distributed in tissues with relatively \n\nhigh concentrations measured in liver, heart, and kidney in the rat.  \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nTrientine is acetylated in two major metabolites, N(1)-acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT) and \n\nN(1),N(10)-diacetyltriethylenetetramine (DAT). Clinical data in healthy subjects indicate that the \n\nplasma exposure to the MAT metabolite is approximately 3 times that of unchanged trientine, while \n\nexposure to the DAT metabolite is slightly lower compared to trientine. The metabolites of trientine \n\nhave Cu-chelating properties, however the stability of these Cu-complexes is low due to the \n\nintroduction of the acetyl groups. Clinical data in healthy volunteers suggest limited contribution of \n\nchelating activity by the MAT and DAT metabolites.The extent of MAT and DAT’s contribution to \n\nthe overall effect of Cufence on copper levels in Wilson’s Disease patients remains to be determined. \n\n \n\nTrientine is metabolised by acetylation via spermidine/spermine N-acetyltransferase and not via \n\nN-acetyltransferase 2. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n\n\n8 \n\nAfter absorption trientine and its metabolites are rapidly excreted in the urine, either bound to copper \n\nor unbound. The unabsorbed fraction of orally administered trientine is bound to intestinal copper and \n\neliminated through faecal excretion. \n\nThe elimination half-life of trientine is approximately 4 hours (mean t1/2 of 3.8 ± 1.3 hours measured at \n\nsteady state in WD patients and 4.4 ± 4.7 hours measured after a single dose in healthy volunteers). \n\nThe elimination half-lives of the two metabolites were 14.1 ±  3.7 hours for MAT and 8.5 ± 3.0 hours \n\nfor DAT after a single dose administration of trientine in healthy subjects. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nAge /Gender/ Body weight \n\nData from clinical studies conducted in adult healthy subjects indicate that age, gender and body \n\nweight do not seem to influence the pharmacokinetics of trientine.  \n\n \n\nEthnicity \n\nNo pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed on interethnic differences.     \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on a series of studies investigating \n\ncardiovascular safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to embryofoetal \n\ndevelopment. \n\n \n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were largely consistent with induced copper deficiency in the plasma \n\nand liver of previously copper normative animals and as such could be attributed to the \n\npharmacological action of trientine. The main toxicological findings associated with trientine, which \n\nwere generally seen across all species examined, included body weight loss or lower body weight \n\ngain, altered urinary electrolytes, low plasma copper levels and various histopathological changes in \n\nthe lungs (mainly interstitial pneumonitis). All effects were reversible with the exception of the lung \n\nfindings; however the dose levels where these effects were observed are far in excess of those used \n\nclinically. Moreover, there was some doubt about the relationship to trientine, as the lung findings \n\nwere also observed in most of the control dogs in the 26 week study. In dogs, ataxia, tremors, \n\nabnormal gait and underactivity were observed following administration of very high levels of \n\ntrientine. Some functional neurological abnormalities were also identified, particularly in severly \n\naffected animals, however no associated nerve damage was observed. Electrocardiography was also \n\nunaffected. \n\n \n\nIn pregnant animals, high dose trientine associated with significant reductions in serum copper, \n\nrevealed an early effect on embryo survival and a marginally lower foetal weight.  There was no \n\nevidence of embryo-foetal toxicity at lower dose levels despite dose-related reductions in serum \n\ncopper. These effects were observed only at exposures sufficiently in excess of maximum human \n\nexposure to indicate little relevance to clinical use. \n\n \n\nNo fertility data are available but estrous cyclicity was unaffected and reproductive organs were not \n\nidentified as target organs in general repeat dose toxicity studies.  \n\n \n\nThe OECD SIDS triethylenetetramine 2002 classifies the genotoxic profile of trientine as low \n\npriority/concern. Some positive in vitro mutagenicity data were obtained but in vivo test systems \n\nshowed no mutagenic activity. No long term animal carcinogenicity trials have to date been performed \n\nwith trientine via the oral route, but via the dermal route, there was no increases in cancers above \n\nbaseline. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that trientine actually reduces endogenous DNA \n\ndamage in a strain of rat (Long-Evans Cinnamon) considered to represent an appropriate model of \n\nWilson’s disease. This suggests a reduced carcinogenic risk for Wilson’s disease patients as a result of \n\ntrientine therapy. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTrientine dihydrochloride is a known irritant, especially to mucus membranes, upper respiratory tract \n\nand skin, and induces skin sensitisation in guinea pigs, mice and man (OECD SIDS \n\ntriethylenetetramine 2002).  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Cufence is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Cufence \n\n3. How to take Cufence \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Cufence \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Cufence is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nCufence is a medicine used for the treatment of Wilson’s disease in adults, adolescents and children \n\naged 5 years or older. It is for use by patients who cannot take another medicine, D-Penicillamine, \n\nbecause of side effects. \n\n \n\nCufence contains the active substance trientine, a copper-chelating agent that is used to remove excess \n\nof copper from the body. Cufence attaches to the copper, which is then passed from the body.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Cufence  \n\n \n\nDo not take Cufence \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to trientine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n\n \n\nSigns of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling of the face, fainting and breathing \n\nproblems. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\nYour doctor will need to regularly check for symptoms of the disease and copper levels in your blood \n\nand urine. Regular monitoring is especially important at the start of your treatment or when your dose \n\nis changed, in growing children and pregnant women to ensure that copper levels are maintained at a \n\nsuitable level. The doctor may need to increase or decrease your dose of Cufence.  \n\n \n\nNervous system problems can occur (for example, shaking, lack of coordination, slurred speech, \n\nmuscle stiffness and worsening of muscle spasms), especially in patients just starting treatment with \n\nCufence. If you notice these whilst taking Cufence, you must tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nLupus-like reactions (symptoms may include persistent rash, fever, joint pain, and tiredness) have \n\nbeen reported in some patients switched to trientine medicine after penicillamine medicine. However, \n\n\n\n20 \n\nit was not possible to determine if the reaction was due to trientine or to previous penicillamine \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Cufence \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nIf you are taking iron tablets or medicines that neutralise the acid in your stomach, leave at least \n\n2 hours before or after you have taken Cufence because they may reduce Cufence’s effect. \n\nIt is recommended that trientine is taken at least one hour apart from any other medicinal product. \n\n \n\nCufence with food and drink \n\n \n\nTake this medicine with water only. Do not take it with other drinks, milk or food because they may \n\nreduce the medicine’s effect. Avoid eating or drinking (except water) for 1 hour before, or 2 hours \n\nafter taking Cufence. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. It is very important to continue \n\ntreatment to maintain normal copper levels during pregnancy. You and your doctor should fully \n\ndiscuss the potential benefits of treatment whilst considering any possible risks that there may be. \n\nYour doctor will advise you which treatment and which dose is best in your situation. If you become \n\npregnant whilst taking Cufence, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant and taking Cufence, you will be monitored throughout your pregnancy for any \n\neffects on the baby or changes in your copper levels.  \n\n \n\nThe limited information available suggests that Cufence does not pass into breast milk, but it is not \n\ncertain that there is no risk to the baby.  It is important to tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or \n\nplan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding or to stop taking \n\nCufence, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Cufence to the \n\nmother. Your doctor will decide which treatment and which dose is best in your situation. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nTrientine is not likely to have an effect on your ability to drive or use machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Cufence \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nAdults (including the elderly) \n\n \n\nThe usual dose is between 4 and 8 capsules per day, to be taken by mouth. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents (5 to 17 years) \n\n \n\nIn children and adolescents, the dose depends on age and body weight and will be adjusted by your \n\ndoctor. At the start of treatment the dose varies between 2 and 5 capsules per day. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nYour doctor will decide the correct dose for you. \n\nThe total daily dose can be divided into 2 to 4 smaller doses, as indicated by your doctor. Swallow the \n\ncapsules whole with a drink of water on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after food.  \n\n \n\nPatients who have difficulties swallowing should contact their doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Cufence than you should \n\n \n\nIf you take more medicine than you should, you may get nausea, vomiting and dizziness. You must \n\ncontact your doctor or another health care provider immediately. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Cufence \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take a dose take your next dose at its usual scheduled time. \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Cufence \n\n \n\nThis medicine is for long-term use because Wilson’s disease is a life-long condition. Do not stop or \n\nchange your treatment without speaking with your doctor even if you feel better. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nOccasionally (frequency unknown; cannot be estimated from available data), treatment with this \n\nmedicine can cause inflammation of the small intestine or colon.  If you have any of the following side \n\neffects contact your doctor immediately: \n\n- Severe stomach pains \n- Persistent diarrhoea \n- Nervous system problems (for example shaking, lack of coordination, slurred speech, muscle \n\nstiffness, worsening of muscle spasms).  \n\n \n\nOther side effects may include: \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n- Nausea (especially when starting treatment) \n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n- Skin rashes \n- Anaemia (you may feel unusually tired) \n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.
