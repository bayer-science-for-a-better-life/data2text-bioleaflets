NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nCONTROLOC Control 20 mg gastro-resistant tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach gastro-resistant tablet contains 20 mg pantoprazole (as sodium sesquihydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nGastro-resistant tablet.\n\nYellow, oval biconvex film-coated tablets imprinted with \u201cP20\u201d in brown ink on one side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nCONTROLOC Control is indicated for short-term treatment of reflux symptoms (e.g. heartburn, acid \nregurgitation) in adults.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose is 20 mg pantoprazole (one tablet) per day. \n\nIt might be necessary to take the tablets for 2-3 consecutive days to achieve improvement of symptoms. \nOnce complete relief of symptoms has occurred, treatment should be discontinued.\nThe treatment should not exceed 4 weeks without consulting a doctor.\n\nIf no symptom relief is obtained within 2 weeks of continuous treatment, the patient should be instructed \nto consult a doctor.\n\nSpecial populations\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients or in those with impaired renal or liver function.\n\nPaediatric population\nCONTROLOC Control is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age \ndue to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.\n\nMethod of administration\nCONTROLOC Control 20 mg gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, and should be \nswallowed whole with liquid before a meal.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n\n\n3\n\nCo-administration of Pantoprazole is not recommended with HIV protease inhibitors for which \nabsorption is dependent on acidic intragastric pH such as atazanavir, nelfinavir; due to significant \nreduction in their bioavailability (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPatients should be instructed to consult a doctor if:\n\n\uf0b7 They have unintentional weight loss, anaemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, dysphagia, persistent \nvomiting or vomiting with blood, since it may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis of a severe \ncondition. In these cases, malignancy should be excluded.\n\n\uf0b7 They have had previous gastric ulcer or gastrointestinal surgery.\n\n\uf0b7 They are on continuous symptomatic treatment of indigestion or heartburn for 4 or more weeks. \n\n\uf0b7 They have jaundice, hepatic impairment, or liver disease.\n\n\uf0b7 They have any other serious disease affecting general well-being.\n\n\uf0b7 They are aged over 55 years with new or recently changed symptoms.\n\nPatients with long-term recurrent symptoms of indigestion or heartburn should see their doctor at \nregular intervals. Especially, patients over 55 years taking any non-prescription indigestion or heartburn \nremedy on a daily basis should inform their pharmacist or doctor.\n\nPatients should not take another proton pump inhibitor or H2 antagonist concomitantly.\n\nPatients should consult their doctor before taking this medicinal product if they are due to have an \nendoscopy or urea breath test.\n\nPatients should be advised that the tablets are not intended to provide immediate relief.\nPatients may start to experience symptomatic relief after approximately one day of treatment with \npantoprazole, but it might be necessary to take it for 7 days to achieve complete heartburn control. \nPatients should not take pantoprazole as a preventive medicinal product.\n\nGastrointestinal infections caused by bacteria\nDecreased gastric acidity, due to any means - including proton pump inhibitors - increases gastric \ncounts of bacteria normally present in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment with acid-reducing medicinal \nproducts leads to a slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, \nCampylobacter, or Clostridium difficile.\n\nSubacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) \nProton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially \nin sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help \npromptly and the health care professional should consider stopping CONTROLOC Control. SCLE after \nprevious treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump \ninhibitors.\n\nInterference with Laboratory Tests\nIncreased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. \nTo avoid this interference, CONTROLOC Control treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days \nbefore CgA measurements (see section 5.1). If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference \n\n\n\n4\n\nrange after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton \npump inhibitor treatment.\n\nThis medicinal product is intended for short-term use (up to 4 weeks) only (Refer to section 4.2). \nPatients should be warned about additional risks with long-term use of the medicinal products and the \nneed for prescription and regular surveillance should be emphasized.\n\nThe following additional risks are considered relevant for long-term use:\n\nInfluence on Vitamin B12 Absorption\nPantoprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 \n(cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced \nbody stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective \nclinical symptoms are observed.\n\nBone Fracture\nProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (> 1 year), may \nmodestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in older people or in presence \nof other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase \nthe overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients \nat risk of osteoporosis should receive care according to current clinical guidelines and they should have \nan adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\n\nHypomagnesemia\nSevere hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like pantoprazole for at least \nthree months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, \ntetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness, and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin \ninsidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium \nreplacement and discontinuation of the PPI.\n\nFor patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or medicinal products \nthat may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g. diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring \nmagnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nCONTROLOC Control may reduce the absorption of active substances whose bioavailability is \ndependent on the gastric pH (e.g. ketoconazole).\n\nHIV Protease Inhibitors\nCo-administration of pantoprazole is contraindicated with HIV protease inhibitors for which absorption \nis dependent on acidic intragastric pH such as atazanavir, nelfinavir; due to significant reduction in their \nbioavailability (see section 4.3).\n\nAlthough no interaction during concomitant administration of phenprocoumon or warfarin has been \nobserved in clinical pharmacokinetic studies, a few isolated cases of changes in International \nNormalised Ratio (INR) have been reported during concomitant treatment in the post-marketing period. \nTherefore, in patients treated with coumarin anticoagulants (e.g. phenprocoumon or warfarin), \nmonitoring of prothrombin time/INR is recommended after initiation, termination or during irregular use \nof pantoprazole.\n\nConcomitant use of high dose methotrexate (e.g. 300 mg) and proton-pump inhibitors has been reported \nto increase methotrexate levels in some patients. Therefore in settings where high-dose methotrexate is \nused, for example cancer and psoriasis, a temporary withdrawal of pantoprazole may need to be \nconsidered.\n\n\n\n5\n\nPantoprazole is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Interaction studies \nwith carbamazepine, caffeine, diazepam, diclofenac, digoxin, ethanol, glibenclamide, metoprolol, \nnaproxen, nifedipine, phenytoin, piroxicam, theophylline and an oral contraceptive containing \nlevonorgestrel and ethinyl oestradiol did not reveal clinically significant interactions. However, an \ninteraction of pantoprazole with other substances which are metabolised by the same enzyme system \ncannot be excluded.\nThere were no interactions with concomitantly administered antacids.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of pantoprazole in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity. Preclinical studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or teratogenic \neffects (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Pantoprazole should not be used \nduring pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nPantoprazole/metabolites have been identified in human milk. The effect of pantoprazole on \nnewborns/infants is unknown. CONTROLOC Control should not be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\nThere was no evidence of impaired fertility following the administration of pantoprazole in animal \nstudies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nCONTROLOC Control has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nHowever adverse reactions such as dizziness and visual disturbances may occur (see section 4.8). If \naffected, patients should not drive or use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nApproximately 5% of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions. The most commonly \nreported adverse reactions are diarrhoea and headache, both occurring in approximately 1% of patients. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with pantoprazole.\n\nWithin the following table, adverse reactions are ranked under the MedDRA frequency classification:\n\nVery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata).\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\n\n\n6\n\nTable 1.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDoses up to 240 mg administered intravenously over 2 minutes were well tolerated.\nAs pantoprazole is extensively protein bound, it is not readily dialysable.\n\nIn the case of overdose with clinical signs of intoxication, apart from symptomatic and supportive \ntreatment, no specific therapeutic recommendations can be made.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for acid related disorders Proton pump inhibitors, ATC code: \nA02BC02\n\n\n\n8\n\nMechanism of action\nPantoprazole is a substituted benzimidazole which inhibits the secretion of hydrochloric acid in the \nstomach by specific blockade of the proton pumps of the parietal cells.\n\nPantoprazole is converted to its active form, a cyclic sulphenamide, in the acidic environment in the \nparietal cells where it inhibits the H+, K+-ATPase enzyme, i. e. the final stage in the production of \nhydrochloric acid in the stomach. \nThe inhibition is dose-dependent and affects both basal and stimulated acid secretion. In most patients, \nfreedom from heartburn and acid reflux symptoms is achieved in 1 week. Pantoprazole reduces acidity \nin the stomach and thereby increases gastrin in proportion to the reduction in acidity. The increase in \ngastrin is reversible. Since pantoprazole binds to the enzyme distal to the receptor level, it can inhibit \nhydrochloric acid secretion independently of stimulation by other substances (acetylcholine, histamine, \ngastrin). The effect is the same whether the active substance is given orally or intravenously.\n\nThe fasting gastrin values increase under pantoprazole. On short-term use, in most cases they do not \nexceed the upper limit of normal. During long-term treatment, gastrin levels double in most cases. An \nexcessive increase, however, occurs only in isolated cases. As a result, a mild to moderate increase in \nthe number of specific endocrine (ECL) cells in the stomach is observed in a minority of cases during \nlong-term treatment (simple to adenomatoid hyperplasia). However, according to the studies conducted \nso far, the formation of carcinoid precursors (atypical hyperplasia) or gastric carcinoids as were found \nin animal experiments (see section 5.3) have not been observed in humans.\n\nDuring treatment with antisecretory medicinal products, serum gastrin increases in response to the \ndecreased acid secretion. Also CgA increases due to decreased gastric acidity. The increased CgA level \nmay interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours.\n\nAvailable published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be discontinued between 5 \ndays and 2 weeks prior to CgA measurements. This is to allow CgA levels that might be spuriously \nelevated following PPI treatment to return to reference range.\n\nClinical efficacy \nIn a retrospective analysis of 17 studies in 5960 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease \n(GORD) who were treated with 20 mg pantoprazole monotherapy, the symptoms associated with acid \nreflux e.g. heartburn and acid regurgitation were evaluated according to a standardised methodology. \nStudies selected had to have at least one acid reflux symptom recording point at 2 weeks. GORD \ndiagnosis in these studies was based on endoscopic assessment, with the exception of one study in which \nthe inclusion of the patients was based on symptomatology alone. \n\nIn these studies, the percentage of patients experiencing complete relief from heartburn after 7 days was \nbetween 54.0% and 80.6% in the pantoprazole group. After 14 and 28 days, complete heartburn relief \nwas experienced in 62.9% to 88.6% and 68.1% to 92.3% of the patients, respectively. \n\nFor the complete relief from acid regurgitation, similar results were obtained as for heartburn. After \n7 days the percentage of patients experiencing complete relief from acid regurgitation was between \n61.5% and 84.4%, after 14 days between 67.7% and 90.4%, and after 28 days between 75.2% and \n94.5%, respectively.\n\nPantoprazole was consistently shown to be superior to placebo and H2RA and non-inferior to other \nPPIs. Acid-reflux symptom relief rates were largely independent of the initial GORD stage.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nPharmacokinetics do not vary after single or repeated administration. In the dose range of 10 to 80 mg, \nthe plasma kinetics of pantoprazole are linear after both oral and intravenous administration.\n\n\n\n9\n\nAbsorption\nPantoprazole is completely and rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability \nfrom the tablet was found to be about 77%. On average, at about 2.0 h - 2.5 h post administration (tmax) \nof a single 20 mg oral dose, the maximum serum concentrations (Cmax) of about 1-1.5 \u00b5g/ml are \nachieved, and these values remain constant after multiple administration. Concomitant intake of food \nhad no influence on bioavailability (AUC or Cmax), but increased the variability of the lag-time (tlag).\n\nDistribution\nVolume of distribution is about 0.15 l/kg and serum protein binding is about 98%.\n\nBiotransformation\nPantoprazole is almost exclusively metabolized in the liver.\n\nElimination\nClearance is about 0.1 l/h/kg, and terminal half-life (t1/2) about 1 h. There were a few cases of subjects \nwith delayed elimination. Due to the specific binding of pantoprazole to the proton pumps within the \nparietal cell, the elimination half-life does not correlate with the much longer duration of action \n(inhibition of acid secretion).\n\nRenal elimination represents the major route of excretion (about 80%) for the metabolites of \npantoprazole; the rest is excreted with the faeces. The main metabolite in both serum and urine is \ndesmethylpantoprazole, which is conjugated with sulphate. The half-life of the main metabolite (about \n1.5 h) is not much longer than that of pantoprazole.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose reduction is recommended when pantoprazole is administered to patients with impaired renal \nfunction (including patients on dialysis, which removes only negligible amounts of pantoprazole). As \nwith healthy subjects, the half-life of pantoprazole is short. Although the main metabolite has a longer \nhalf-life (2-3h), excretion is still rapid and thus accumulation does not occur.\n\nHepatic impairment\nAfter administration of pantoprazole to patients with liver impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B and C) \nthe half-life values increased to between 3 and 7 h and the AUC values increased by a factor of 3-6, \nwhereas the Cmax only increased slightly by a factor of 1.3 compared with healthy subjects. \n\nElderly\nThe slight increase in AUC and Cmax in elderly volunteers compared with younger subjects was not \nclinically relevant.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity.\n\nIn the 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats, neuroendocrine neoplasms were found. In addition, \nsquamous cell papillomas were found in the forestomach of rats in one study. The mechanism leading to \nthe formation of gastric carcinoids by substituted benzimidazoles has been carefully investigated and \nallows the conclusion that it is a secondary reaction to the massively elevated serum gastrin levels \noccurring in the rat during chronic high-dose treatment.\n\nIn the 2-year rodent studies an increased number of liver tumors was observed in rats (in one rat study \nonly) and in female mice and was interpreted as being due to pantoprazole's high metabolic rate in the \nliver.\n\n\n\n10\n\nA slight increase of neoplastic changes of the thyroid was observed in the group of rats receiving the \nhighest dose (200 mg/kg) in one 2-year study. The occurrence of these neoplasms is associated with the \npantoprazole-induced changes in the breakdown of thyroxine in the rat liver. As the therapeutic dose in \nman is low, no side effects on the thyroid glands are expected.\n\nIn a peri-postnatal rat reproduction study designed to assess bone development, signs of offspring \ntoxicity (mortality, lower mean body weight, lower mean body weight gain and reduced bone growth) \nwere observed at exposures (Cmax) approximately 2x the human clinical exposure. By the end of the \nrecovery phase, bone parameters were similar across groups and body weights were also trending \ntoward reversibility after a drug-free recovery period. The increased mortality has only been reported in \npre-weaning rat pups (up to 21 days age) which is estimated to correspond to infants up to the age of 2 \nyears old. The relevance of this finding to the paediatric population is unclear. A previous peri-postnatal \nstudy in rats at slightly lower doses found no adverse effects at 3 mg/kg compared with a low dose of \n5 mg/kg in this study. Investigations revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or teratogenic effects. \nPenetration of the placenta was investigated in the rat and was found to increase with advanced \ngestation. As a result, concentration of pantoprazole in the foetus is increased shortly before birth.\n\n6.

What CONTROLOC Control is and what it is used for\n\nCONTROLOC Control contains the active substance pantoprazole, which blocks the \u2018pump\u2019 that \nproduces stomach acid. Hence it reduces the amount of acid in your stomach. \n\nCONTROLOC Control is used for the short-term treatment of reflux symptoms (for example heartburn, \nacid regurgitation) in adults. \nReflux is the backflow of acid from the stomach into the gullet (\u201cfoodpipe\u201d), which may become \ninflamed and painful. This may cause you symptoms such as a painful burning sensation in the chest \nrising up to the throat (heartburn) and a sour taste in the mouth (acid regurgitation).\n\nYou may experience relief from your acid reflux and heartburn symptoms after just one day of \ntreatment with CONTROLOC Control, but this medicine is not meant to bring immediate relief. It may \nbe necessary to take the tablets for 2-3 consecutive days to relieve the symptoms. \n\nYou must talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse after 2 weeks.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take CONTROLOC Control\n\nDo not take CONTROLOC Control: \n- if you are allergic to pantoprazole or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in\n\nsection 6)\n- if you are taking HIV protease inhibitors such as atazanavir; nelfinavir (for the treatment of\n\nHIV-infection) See \u2018Other medicines and CONTROLOC Control\u2019.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before taking CONTROLOC Control:\n\n\n\n23\n\n- if you have been treated for heartburn or indigestion continuously for 4 or more weeks\n- if you are over 55 years old and taking non-prescription indigestion treatment on a daily basis\n- if you are over 55 years old with any new or recently changed reflux symptoms\n- if you have previously had a gastric ulcer or stomach surgery\n- if you have liver problems or jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes)\n- if you regularly see your doctor for serious complaints or conditions\n- if you are due to have an endoscopy or a breath test called a C-urea test.\n- if you have ever had a skin reaction after treatment with a medicine similar to CONTROLOC\n\nControl that reduces stomach acid.\n- if you are due to have a specific blood test (Chromogranin A)\n- if you are taking HIV protease inhibitors such as atazanavir; nelfinavir (for the treatment of\n\nHIV-infection) at the same time as pantoprazole, ask your doctor for specific advice.\n\nDo not take this product for longer than 4 weeks without consulting your doctor. If your reflux \nsymptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation) persist for longer than 2 weeks, consult your doctor who \nwill decide about the need for long-term intake of this medicinal product.\n\nIf you take CONTROLOC Control for longer periods, this may cause additional risks, such as:\n\n- reduced absorption of Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B12 deficiency if you already have low body\nstores of Vitamin B12.\n\n- fracture of your hip, wrist or spine, especially if you already suffer from osteoporosis or if you\nare taking corticosteroids (which can increase the risk of osteoporosis).\n\n- falling magnesium levels in your blood (potential symptoms: fatigue, involuntary muscle\ncontractions, disorientation, convulsions, dizziness, increased heart rate). Low levels of\nmagnesium can also lead to a reduction in potassium or calcium levels in the blood. You should\ntalk to your doctor if you have been using this product for more than 4 weeks. Your doctor may\ndecide to perform regular blood tests to monitor your levels of magnesium.\n\nTell your doctor immediately, before or after taking this medicine, if you notice any of the following \nsymptoms, which could be a sign of another, more serious, disease:\n- an unintentional loss of weight (not related to a diet or an exercise programme)\n- vomiting, particularly if repeated\n- vomiting blood; this may appear as dark coffee grounds in your vomit\n- you notice blood in your stools; which may be black or tarry in appearance\n- difficulty in swallowing or pain when swallowing\n- you look pale and feel weak (anaemia)\n- chest pain\n- stomach pain\n- severe and/or persistent diarrhoea, because this medicine has been associated with a small\n\nincrease in infectious diarrhoea.\n- if you get a rash on your skin, especially in areas exposed to the sun tell your doctor as soon as\n\nyou can, as you may need to stop your treatment with CONTROLOC Control. Remember to also\nmention any other ill-effects like pain in your joints.\n\nYour doctor may decide that you need some tests. \n\nIf you are due to have a blood test, tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine.\n\nYou may experience relief from your acid reflux and heartburn symptoms after just one day of \ntreatment with CONTROLOC Control, but this medicine is not meant to bring immediate relief.\nYou should not take it as a preventive measure.\n\nIf you have been suffering from repetitive heartburn or indigestion symptoms for some time, remember \nto see your doctor regularly.\n\n\n\n24\n\nChildren and adolescents\nCONTROLOC Control should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to a \nlack of safety information in this younger age group.\n\nOther medicines and CONTROLOC Control\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nCONTROLOC Control may stop certain other medicines from working properly.

You may need further blood\n\ntests.\n- methotrexate (used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and cancer) \u2013 if you are taking\n\nmethotrexate your doctor may temporarily stop your CONTROLOC Control treatment because\npantoprazole can increase levels of methotrexate in the blood.\n\nDo not take CONTROLOC Control with other medicines which limit the amount of acid produced in \nyour stomach, such as another proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole, lansoprazole or rabeprazole) or an \nH2 antagonist (e.g. ranitidine, famotidine).\nHowever, you may take CONTROLOC Control with antacids (e.g. magaldrate, alginic acid, sodium \nbicarbonate, aluminium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, or combinations thereof), if needed.\n\nPregnancy and, breast-feeding\nYou should not take this medicine if you are pregnant or while-breastfeeding.\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nIf you experience side effects like dizziness or disturbed vision, you should not drive or use machines.\n\n3.

- if you are allergic to pantoprazole or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) - if you are taking hiv protease inhibitors such as atazanavir; nelfinavir (for the treatment of hiv-infection) see 'other medicines and controloc control'. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before taking controloc control: 23 - if you have been treated for heartburn or indigestion continuously for 4 or more weeks - if you are over 55 years old and taking non-prescription indigestion treatment on a daily basis - if you are over 55 years old with any new or recently changed reflux symptoms - if you have previously had a gastric ulcer or stomach surgery - if you have liver problems or jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes) - if you regularly see your doctor for serious complaints or conditions - if you are due to have an endoscopy or a breath test called a c-urea test. - if you have ever had a skin reaction after treatment with a medicine similar to controloc control that reduces stomach acid. - if you are due to have a specific blood test (chromogranin a) - if you are taking hiv protease inhibitors such as atazanavir; nelfinavir (for the treatment of hiv-infection) at the same time as pantoprazole, ask your doctor for specific advice. do not take this product for longer than 4 weeks without consulting your doctor. if your reflux symptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation) persist for longer than 2 weeks, consult your doctor who will decide about the need for long-term intake of this medicinal product. if you take controloc control for longer periods, this may cause additional risks, such as: - reduced absorption of vitamin b12, and vitamin b12 deficiency if you already have low body stores of vitamin b12. - fracture of your hip, wrist or spine, especially if you already suffer from osteoporosis or if you are taking corticosteroids (which can increase the risk of osteoporosis). - falling magnesium levels in your blood (potential symptoms: fatigue, involuntary muscle contractions, disorientation, convulsions, dizziness, increased heart rate). low levels of magnesium can also lead to a reduction in potassium or calcium levels in the blood. you should talk to your doctor if you have been using this product for more than 4 weeks. your doctor may decide to perform regular blood tests to monitor your levels of magnesium. tell your doctor immediately, before or after taking this medicine, if you notice any of the following symptoms, which could be a sign of another, more serious, disease: - an unintentional loss of weight (not related to a diet or an exercise programme) - vomiting, particularly if repeated - vomiting blood; this may appear as dark coffee grounds in your vomit - you notice blood in your stools; which may be black or tarry in appearance - difficulty in swallowing or pain when swallowing - you look pale and feel weak (anaemia) - chest pain - stomach pain - severe and/or persistent diarrhoea, because this medicine has been associated with a small increase in infectious diarrhoea. - if you get a rash on your skin, especially in areas exposed to the sun tell your doctor as soon as you can, as you may need to stop your treatment with controloc control. remember to also mention any other ill-effects like pain in your joints. your doctor may decide that you need some tests. if you are due to have a blood test, tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine. you may experience relief from your acid reflux and heartburn symptoms after just one day of treatment with controloc control, but this medicine is not meant to bring immediate relief. you should not take it as a preventive measure. if you have been suffering from repetitive heartburn or indigestion symptoms for some time, remember to see your doctor regularly. children and adolescents controloc control should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to a lack of safety information in this younger age group. other medicines and controloc control tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. controloc control may stop certain other medicines from working properly. especially medicines containing one of the following active substances: - hiv protease inhibitors such as atazanavir, nelfinavir (for the treatment of hiv-infection). you must not use controloc control if you are taking hiv protease inhibitors. see 'do not take controloc control'. - ketoconazole (used for fungal infections). - warfarin and phenprocoumon (used to thin blood and prevent clots). you may need further blood tests. - methotrexate (used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and cancer) if you are taking methotrexate your doctor may temporarily stop your controloc control treatment because pantoprazole can increase levels of methotrexate in the blood. do not take controloc control with other medicines which limit the amount of acid produced in your stomach, such as another proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole, lansoprazole or rabeprazole) or an h2 antagonist (e.g. ranitidine, famotidine). however, you may take controloc control with antacids (e.g. magaldrate, alginic acid, sodium bicarbonate, aluminium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, or combinations thereof), if needed. pregnancy and, breast-feeding you should not take this medicine if you are pregnant or while-breastfeeding. if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. driving and using machines if you experience side effects like dizziness or disturbed vision, you should not drive or use machines.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "controloc
