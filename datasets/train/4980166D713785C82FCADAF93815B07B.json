NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nViramune 200 mg tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains 200 mg of nevirapine (as anhydrous). \n\nExcipients with known effect\nEach tablet contains 318 mg of lactose (as monohydrate).\nEach tablet contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg), that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nTablet.\n\nWhite, oval, biconvex tablets. One side is embossed with the code \u201c54 193\u201d, with a single bisect \nseparating the \u201c54\u201d and \u201c193\u201d. The opposite side is marked with the company symbol. The score line \nis not intended for breaking the tablet.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nViramune is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of \nHIV-1 infected adults, adolescents, and children of any age (see section 4.2).\n\nMost of the experience with Viramune is in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors (NRTIs). The choice of a subsequent therapy after Viramune should be based on clinical \nexperience and resistance testing (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nViramune should be administered by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV \ninfection.\n\nPosology\n\nPatients 16 years and older\nThe recommended dose of Viramune is one 200 mg tablet daily for the first 14 days (this lead-in \nperiod should be used because it has been found to lessen the frequency of rash), followed by one \n200 mg tablet twice daily, in combination with at least two additional antiretroviral agents.\n\nIf a dose is recognized as missed within 8 hours of when it was due, the patient should take the missed \ndose as soon as possible. If a dose is missed and it is more than 8 hours later, the patient should only \ntake the next dose at the usual time.\n\nDose management considerations\nPatients experiencing rash during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day should not have their \nViramune dose increased until the rash has resolved. The isolated rash should be closely monitored \n(see section 4.4). The 200 mg once daily dosing regimen should not be continued beyond 28 days at \n\n\n\n3\n\nwhich point in time an alternative treatment should be sought due to the possible risk of underexposure \nand resistance.\n\nPatients who interrupt nevirapine dosing for more than 7 days should restart the recommended dosing \nregimen using the two week lead-in period.\n\nThere are toxicities that require interruption of Viramune therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nElderly\nNevirapine has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.\n\nRenal impairment\nFor patients with renal dysfunction requiring dialysis an additional 200 mg dose of nevirapine\nfollowing each dialysis treatment is recommended. Patients with CLcr \uf0b3 20 ml/min do not require a \ndose adjustment, see section 5.2.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNevirapine should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, see section \n4.3). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nPaediatric population\nViramune 200 mg tablets, following the dosing schedule described above, are suitable for larger \nchildren, particularly adolescents, below the age of 16 who weigh more than 50 kg or whose body \nsurface area is above 1.25 m2 according to the Mosteller formula. An oral suspension dosage form, \nwhich can be dosed according to body weight or body surface area, is available for children in this age \ngroup weighing less than 50 kg or whose body surface area is below 1.25 m2 (please refer to the \nSummary of Product Characteristics of Viramune oral suspension).\n\nChildren less than three years old.\n\nFor patients less than 3 years and for all other age groups, an immediate-release oral suspension \ndosage form is available (please refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe tablets shall be taken with liquid, and should not be crushed or chewed. Viramune may be taken \nwith or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nReadministration to patients who have required permanent discontinuation for severe rash, rash \naccompanied by constitutional symptoms, hypersensitivity reactions, or clinical hepatitis due to \nnevirapine.  \n\nPatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) or pre-treatment ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN \nuntil baseline ASAT/ALAT are stabilised < 5 ULN.\n\nReadministration to patients who previously had ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN during nevirapine therapy \nand had recurrence of liver function abnormalities upon readministration of nevirapine (see section \n4.4). \n\nCoadministration with herbal preparations containing St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to \nthe risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of nevirapine (see section 4.5).\n\n\n\n4\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nViramune should only be used with at least two other antiretroviral agents (see section 5.1).\n\nViramune should not be used as the sole active antiretroviral, as monotherapy with any antiretroviral \nhas shown to result in viral resistance.\n\nThe first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring of patients to disclose the potential appearance of severe and life-threatening skin \nreactions (including cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis\n(TEN)) and serious hepatitis/hepatic failure. The greatest risk of hepatic and skin reactions \noccurs in the first 6 weeks of therapy. However, the risk of any hepatic event continues past this \nperiod and monitoring should continue at frequent intervals. Female gender and higher CD4 \ncounts (>250/mm3 in adult females and >400/mm3 in adult males) at the initiation of nevirapine\ntherapy are associated with a greater risk of hepatic adverse reactions if the patient has \ndetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA - i.e. a concentration \u2265 50 copies/ml - at the initiation of \nnevirapine. As serious and life threatening hepatotoxicity has been observed in controlled and \nuncontrolled studies predominantly in patients with a plasma HIV-1 viral load of 50 copies/ml or\nhigher, nevirapine should not be initiated in adult females with CD4 cell counts greater than 250 \ncells/mm3 or in adult males with CD4 cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3, who have a \ndetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA unless the benefit outweighs the risk. \nIn some cases, hepatic injury has progressed despite discontinuation of treatment. Patients \ndeveloping signs or symptoms of hepatitis, severe skin reaction or hypersensitivity reactions \nmust discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately. Nevirapine must not be \nrestarted following severe hepatic, skin or hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.3).\n\nThe dose must be strictly adhered to, especially the 14-days lead-in period (see section 4.2).\n\nCutaneous reactions\n\nSevere and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have occurred in patients treated with \nnevirapine mainly during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity reactions characterised by rash, \nconstitutional findings and visceral involvement. Patients should be intensively monitored during the \nfirst 18 weeks of treatment. Patients should be closely monitored if an isolated rash occurs. Nevirapine\nmust be permanently discontinued in any patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by \nconstitutional symptoms (such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, muscle \nor joint aches, or general malaise), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis. Nevirapine must be permanently discontinued in any patient experiencing hypersensitivity \nreaction (characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms, plus visceral involvement, such as \nhepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction), see section 4.4.\n\nViramune administration above the recommended dose might increase the frequency and seriousness \nof skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.\n\nRhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with \nViramune use.\n\nConcomitant prednisone use (40 mg/day for the first 14 days of Viramune administration) has been \nshown not to decrease the incidence of nevirapine-associated rash, and may be associated with an \nincrease in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. \n\nSome risk factors for developing serious cutaneous reactions have been identified; they include failure \nto follow the initial dosing of 200 mg daily during the lead-in period and a long delay between the \n\n\n\n5\n\ninitial symptoms and medical consultation. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing \nrash, whether receiving nevirapine or non-nevirapine containing therapy.\n\nPatients should be instructed that a major toxicity of nevirapine is rash. They should be advised to \npromptly notify their physician of any rash and avoid delay between the initial symptoms and medical \nconsultation. The majority of rashes associated with nevirapine occur within the first 6 weeks of \ninitiation of therapy. Therefore, patients should be monitored carefully for the appearance of rash \nduring this period. Patients should be instructed that dose escalation is not to occur if any rash occurs \nduring the two-week lead-in dosing period, until the rash resolves. The 200 mg once daily dosing \nregimen should not be continued beyond 28 days at which point in time an alternative treatment \nshould be sought due to the possible risk of underexposure and resistance.\n\nAny patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, \nblistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, muscle or joint aches, or general malaise should \ndiscontinue the medicinal product and immediately seek medical evaluation. In these patients \nnevirapine must not be restarted.\n\nIf patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, liver function tests should be \nperformed. Patients with moderate to severe elevations (ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN) should be \npermanently discontinued from nevirapine.\n\nIf a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as fever, \narthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, eosinophilia, \ngranulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction, nevirapine must be permanently stopped and not be re-\nintroduced (see section 4.3).\n\nHepatic reactions\n\nSevere and life-threatening hepatotoxicity, including fatal fulminant hepatitis, has occurred in patients \ntreated with nevirapine. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring. The risk of hepatic reactions is greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. However the risk \ncontinues past this period and monitoring should continue at frequent intervals throughout treatment. \n\nRhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with \nnevirapine use.\n\nIncreased ASAT or ALAT levels > 2.5 ULN and/or co-infection with hepatitis B and/or C at the start \nof antiretroviral therapy is associated with greater risk of hepatic adverse reactions during \nantiretroviral therapy in general, including nevirapine containing regimens. \n\nFemale gender and higher CD4 counts at the initiation of nevirapine therapy in treatment-na\u00efve\npatients is associated with increased risk of hepatic adverse reactions. Women have a three fold higher \nrisk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (5.8 % versus 2.2 %), and \ntreatment-na\u00efve patients of either gender with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma with higher CD4 \ncounts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with \nnevirapine. In a retrospective review of predominantly patients with a plasma HIV-1 viral load of 50 \ncopies/ml or higher, women with CD4 counts >250 cells/mm3 had a 12 fold higher risk of \nsymptomatic hepatic adverse reactions compared to women with CD4 counts <250 cells/mm3 (11.0 % \nversus 0.9 %). An increased risk was observed in men with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma and CD4 \ncounts > 400 cells/mm3 (6.3 % versus 1.2 % for men with CD4 counts <400 cells/mm3). This \nincreased risk for toxicity based on CD4 count thresholds has not been detected in patients with \nundetectable (i.e. < 50 copies/ml) plasma viral load.\n\nPatients should be informed that hepatic reactions are a major toxicity of nevirapine requiring close \nmonitoring during the first 18 weeks. They should be informed that occurrence of symptoms \n\n\n\n6\n\nsuggestive of hepatitis should lead them to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical \nevaluation, which should include liver function tests.\n\nLiver monitoring\n\nClinical chemistry tests, which include liver function tests, should be performed prior to initiating \nnevirapine therapy and at appropriate intervals during therapy.\n\nAbnormal liver function tests have been reported with nevirapine, some in the first few weeks of \ntherapy. \n\nAsymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes are frequently described and are not necessarily a \ncontraindication to use nevirapine. Asymptomatic GGT elevations are not a contraindication to \ncontinue therapy.\n\nMonitoring of hepatic tests should be done every two weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, at \nthe 3rd month and then regularly thereafter. Liver test monitoring should be performed if the patient \nexperiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity. \n\nIf ASAT or ALAT > 2.5 ULN before or during treatment, then liver tests should be monitored more \nfrequently during regular clinic visits. Nevirapine must not be administered to patients with pre-\ntreatment ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN until baseline ASAT/ALAT are stabilised < 5 ULN (see section \n4.3).\n\nPhysicians and patients should be vigilant for prodromal signs or findings of hepatitis, such as \nanorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, hepatomegaly or liver tenderness. Patients \nshould be instructed to seek medical attention promptly if these occur.\n\nIf ASAT or ALAT increase to > 5 ULN during treatment, nevirapine should be immediately \nstopped. If ASAT and ALAT return to baseline values and if the patient had no clinical signs or \nsymptoms of hepatitis, rash, constitutional symptoms or other findings suggestive of organ \ndysfunction, it may be possible to reintroduce nevirapine, on a case by case basis, at the starting \ndose regimen of 200 mg/day for 14 days followed by 400 mg/day. In these cases, more frequent \nliver monitoring is required. If liver function abnormalities recur, nevirapine should be \npermanently discontinued.\n\nIf clinical hepatitis occurs, characterised by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, icterus AND laboratory \nfindings (such as moderate or severe liver function test abnormalities (excluding GGT)), \nnevirapine must be permanently stopped. Viramune must not be readministered to patients who \nhave required permanent discontinuation for clinical hepatitis due to nevirapine.\n\nLiver disease\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Viramune has not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders. Viramune is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, \nsee section 4.3). Pharmacokinetic results suggest caution should be exercised when nevirapine is \nadministered to patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh B). Patients with chronic \nhepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe \nand potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In the case of concomitant antiviral therapy for \nhepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products.\n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.\n\n\n\n7\n\nOther warnings\n\nPost-Exposure-Prophylaxis: Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure requiring transplantation, \nhas been reported in HIV-uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of Viramune in the setting of \npost-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. The use of Viramune has not been evaluated \nwithin a specific study on PEP, especially in term of treatment duration and therefore, is strongly \ndiscouraged.\n\nCombination therapy with nevirapine is not a curative treatment of patients infected with HIV-1; \npatients may continue to experience illnesses associated with advanced HIV-1 infection, including \nopportunistic infections.\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nHormonal methods of birth control other than Depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) should not \nbe used as the sole method of contraception in women taking Viramune, since nevirapine might lower \nthe plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. For this reason, and to reduce the risk of HIV \ntransmission, barrier contraception (e.g., condoms) is recommended. Additionally, when \npostmenopausal hormone therapy is used during administration of nevirapine, its therapeutic effect \nshould be monitored.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters:\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.\n\nIn clinical studies, Viramune has been associated with an increase in HDL- cholesterol and an overall \nimprovement in the total to HDL-cholesterol ratio. However, in the absence of specific studies, the \nclinical impact of these findings is not known. In addition, Viramune has not been shown to cause \nglucose disturbances.\n\nOsteonecrosis: Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, \nalcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis \nhave been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to \ncombination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they \nexperience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time \nof institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to \nasymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or \naggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or \nmonths of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or \nfocal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms \nshould be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 \ndisease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune \nreactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many \nmonths after initiation of treatment.\n\nThe available pharmacokinetic data suggest that the concomitant use of rifampicin and nevirapine is \nnot recommended. Furthermore, combining the following compounds with Viramune is not \nrecommended: efavirenz, ketoconazole, delavirdine, etravirine, rilpivirine, elvitegravir (in \n\n\n\n8\n\ncombination with cobicistat), atazanavir (in combination with ritonavir), boceprevir; fosamprenavir (if \nnot co-administered with low dose ritonavir) (see section 4.5).\n\nGranulocytopenia is commonly associated with zidovudine. Therefore, patients who receive \nnevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly and especially paediatric patients and patients who receive \nhigher zidovudine doses or patients with poor bone marrow reserve, in particular those with advanced \nHIV disease, have an increased risk of granulocytopenia. In such patients haematological parameters \nshould be carefully monitored.\n\nLactose: Viramune tablets contain 636 mg of lactose per maximum recommended daily dose.\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNevirapine is an inducer of CYP3A and potentially CYP2B6, with maximal induction occurring \nwithin 2-4 weeks of initiating multiple-dose therapy. \n\nCompounds using this metabolic pathway may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-\nadministered with nevirapine. Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effectiveness of P450 metabolised \nmedicinal products is recommended when taken in combination with nevirapine.\n\nThe absorption of nevirapine is not affected by food, antacids or medicinal products which are \nformulated with an alkaline buffering agent.\n\nThe interaction data is presented as geometric mean value with 90% confidence interval (90% CI) \nwhenever these data were available.

No \ndrug-drug interaction study of \ntelaprevir with nevirapine has been \nconducted, however, interaction \nstudies of telaprevir with an NNRTI \nwith a similar metabolic pathway as \nnevirapine demonstrated reduced \nlevels of both. Results of DDI \nstudies of telaprevir with efavirenz \nindicate that caution should be \nexercised when co-administering \ntelaprevir with P450 inducers. \n\nCaution should be exercised when \nco-administering telaprevir with \nnevirapine. \nIf co-administered with Viramune, an \nadjustment in the telaprevir dose \nshould be considered.\n\nTelbivudine Telbivudine is not a substrate, \ninducer or inhibitor of the \ncytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme \nsystem.

This is due \nto induction of medicinal product \nmetabolism enzymes and/or \ntransport proteins by St. John\u2019s \nWort.\n\nHerbal preparations containing St. \nJohn\u2018s Wort and Viramune must not \nbe co-administered (see section 4.3). \nIf a patient is already taking St. \nJohn\u2018s Wort check nevirapine and if \npossible viral levels and stop St. \nJohn\u2018s Wort. Nevirapine levels may \nincrease on stopping St. John\u2018s Wort. \nThe dose of Viramune may need \nadjusting. The inducing effect may \npersist for at least 2 weeks after \ncessation of treatment with St. John\u2018s \nWort.\n\nOther information:\n\nNevirapine metabolites: Studies using human liver microsomes indicated that the formation of \nnevirapine hydroxylated metabolites was not affected by the presence of dapsone, rifabutin, \nrifampicin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Ketoconazole and erythromycin significantly \ninhibited the formation of nevirapine hydroxylated metabolites.\n\n\n\n16\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females\nWomen of childbearing potential should not use oral contraceptives as the sole method for birth \ncontrol, since nevirapine might lower the plasma concentrations of these medicinal products (see \nsections 4.4 & 4.5).\n\nPregnancy\nCurrently available data on pregnant women indicate no malformative or foeto/ neonatal toxicity. To \ndate no other relevant epidemiological data are available. No observable teratogenicity was detected in \nreproductive studies performed in pregnant rats and rabbits (see section 5.3). There are no adequate \nand well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Caution should be exercised when prescribing \nnevirapine to pregnant women (see section 4.4). As hepatotoxicity is more frequent in women with \nCD4 cell counts above 250 cells/mm3 with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma (50 or more copies/ml), \nthese conditions should be taken in consideration on therapeutic decision (see section 4.4). There is \nnot enough evidence to substantiate that the absence of an increased risk for toxicity seen in pre-\ntreated women initiating nevirapine with an undetectable viral load (less than 50 copies/ml of HIV-1 \nin plasma) and CD4 cell counts above 250 cells/mm3 also applies to pregnant women. All the \nrandomised studies addressing this issue specifically excluded pregnant women, and pregnant women \nwere under-represented in cohort studies as well as in meta-analyses.\n\nBreast-feeding\nNevirapine readily crosses the placenta and is found in breast milk. \n\nIt is recommended that HIV-infected mothers do not breast-feed their infants to avoid risking postnatal \ntransmission of HIV and that mothers should discontinue breast-feeding if they are receiving \nnevirapine.\n\nFertility\nIn reproductive toxicology studies, evidence of impaired fertility was seen in rats.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nThere are no specific studies about the ability to drive vehicles and use machinery.\nHowever, patients should be advised that they may experience adverse reactions such as fatigue during \ntreatment with Viramune. Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or operating \nmachinery. If patients experience fatigue they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving \nor operating machinery. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions related to Viramune therapy, across all clinical studies, \nwere rash, allergic reactions, hepatitis, abnormal liver function tests, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, \nabdominal pain, fatigue, fever, headache and myalgia.\n\nThe postmarketing experience has shown that the most serious adverse reactions are Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis, serious hepatitis/hepatic failure, and drug reaction with \neosinophilia and systemic symptoms, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as \nfever, arthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, \neosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical \nperiod which requires close monitoring (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n17\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions which may be causally related to the administration of Viramune have \nbeen reported. The frequencies estimated are based on pooled clinical study data for adverse reactions \nconsidered related to Viramune treatment. \n\nFrequency is defined using the following convention: very common (\uf0b31/10); common (\uf0b31/100 to \n<1/10); uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000).\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\nCommon granulocytopenia\nUncommon anaemia\n\nImmune system disorders\nCommon hypersensitivity (incl. anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, urticaria)\nUncommon anaphylactic reaction  \nRare drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon headache\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nCommon hepatitis (including severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity) (1.9%)\nUncommon jaundice\nRare hepatitis fulminant (which may be fatal)\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nVery common rash (12.5 %)\nUncommon Stevens-Johnson syndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis (which may be fatal) \n\n(0.2 %), angioedema, urticaria\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nUncommon arthralgia, myalgia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon pyrexia, fatigue\n\nInvestigations\nCommon liver function test abnormal (alanine aminotransferase increased; transaminases \n\nincreased; aspartate aminotransferase increased; gamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased; hepatic enzyme increased; hypertransaminasaemia)\n\nUncommon blood phosphorus decreased ; blood pressure increased\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nIn study 1100.1090, from which the majority of related adverse events (n=28) were received, patients \non placebo had a higher incidence of events of granulocytopenia (3.3 %) than patients on nevirapine \n(2.5 %).\n\nAnaphylactic reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in \nrandomised, controlled clinical studies. The frequency category was estimated from a statistical \ncalculation based on the total number of patients exposed to nevirapine in randomised controlled \nclinical studies (n=2,718).\n\n\n\n18\n\nDecreased blood phosphorus and increased blood pressure were observed in clinical studies with co-\nadministration of tenofovir/emtricitabine.\n\nMetabolic parameters\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4)\n\nThe following adverse reactions have also been reported when nevirapine has been used in \ncombination with other anti-retroviral agents: pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy and \nthrombocytopaenia. These adverse reactions are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents \nand may be expected to occur when nevirapine is used in combination with other agents; however it is \nunlikely that these adverse reactions are due to nevirapine treatment. Hepatic-renal failure syndromes \nhave been reported rarely.\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissues\n\nThe most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, with Viramune attributable rash occurring in \n12.5% of patients in combination regimens in controlled studies.\n\nRashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or \nwithout pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. Hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction, \nangioedema and urticaria) have been reported. Rashes occur alone or in the context of drug reaction\nwith eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as \nfever, arthralgia, myalgia and lympadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, \neosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction.\n\nSevere and life-threatening skin reactions have occurred in patients treated with nevirapine, including \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Fatal cases of SJS, TEN and \ndrug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported. The majority of severe \nrashes occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment and some required hospitalisation, with one \npatient requiring surgical intervention (see section 4.4). \n\nHepato-biliary\n\nThe most frequently observed laboratory test abnormalities are elevations in liver function tests \n(LFTs), including ALAT, ASAT, GGT, total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Asymptomatic \nelevations of GGT levels are the most frequent. Cases of jaundice have been reported. Cases of \nhepatitis (severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity, including fatal fulminant hepatitis) have been \nreported in patients treated with nevirapine. The best predictor of a serious hepatic event was elevated \nbaseline liver function tests. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nBased on clinical study experience of 361 paediatric patients the majority of which received \ncombination treatment with ZDV or/and ddI, the most frequently reported adverse events related to \nnevirapine were similar to those observed in adults. Granulocytopenia was more frequently observed \n\n\n\n19\n\nin children. In an open-label clinical study (ACTG 180) granulocytopenia assessed as medicinal \nproduct-related occurred in 5/37 (13.5 %) of patients. In ACTG 245, a double-blind placebo controlled \nstudy, the frequency of serious medicinal product-related granulocytopenia was 5/305 (1.6%). Isolated \ncases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/ toxic epidermal necrolysis transition \nsyndrome have been reported in this population.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no known antidote for nevirapine overdose. Cases of Viramune overdose at doses ranging \nfrom 800 to 6,000 mg per day for up to 15 days have been reported. Patients have experienced \noedema, erythema nodosum, fatigue, fever, headache, insomnia, nausea, pulmonary infiltrates, rash, \nvertigo, vomiting, increase in transaminases and weight decrease. All of these effects subsided \nfollowing discontinuation of nevirapine. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nOne case of massive accidental overdose in a newborn was reported. The ingested dose was 40 times \nthe recommended dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Mild isolated neutropenia and hyperlactataemia was observed, \nwhich spontaneously disappeared within one week without any clinical complications. One year later, \nthe child\u2019s development remained normal.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors, ATC code J05AG01.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nNevirapine is a NNRTI of HIV-1. Nevirapine is a non-competitive inhibitor of the HIV-1 reverse \ntranscriptase, but it does not have a biologically significant inhibitory effect on the HIV-2 reverse \ntranscriptase or on eukaryotic DNA polymerases \uf061, \uf062, \uf067, or \uf064.\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\n\nNevirapine had a median EC50 value (50 % inhibitory concentration) of 63 nM against a panel of \ngroup M HIV-1 isolates from clades A, B, C, D, F, G, and H, and circulating recombinant forms \n(CRF), CRF01_AE, CRF02_AG and CRF12_BF replicating in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. In \na panel of 2,923 predominantly subtype B HIV-1 clinical isolates, the mean EC50 value was 90nM. \nSimilar EC50 values are obtained when the antiviral activity of nevirapine is measured in peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells, monocyte derived macrophages or lymphoblastoid cell line. Nevirapine had \nno antiviral activity in cell culture against group O HIV-1 isolates or HIV-2 isolates.\n\nNevirapine in combination with efavirenz exhibited a strong antagonistic anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro\n(see section 4.5) and was additive to antagonistic with the protease inhibitor ritonavir or the fusion \ninhibitor enfuvirtide. Nevirapine exhibited additive to synergistic anti-HIV-1 activity in combination \nwith the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, saquinavir and tipranavir, and \nthe NRTIs abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine. The \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n20\n\nanti-HIV-1 activity of nevirapine was antagonized by the anti-HBV medicinal product adefovir and by \nthe anti-HCV medicinal product ribavirin in vitro.\n\nResistance\n\nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility (100-250-fold) to nevirapine emerge in cell culture. \nGenotypic analysis showed mutations in the HIV-1 RT gene Y181C and/or V106A depending upon \nthe virus strain and cell line employed. Time to emergence of nevirapine resistance in cell culture was \nnot altered when selection included nevirapine in combination with several other NNRTIs.\n\nGenotypic analysis of isolates from antiretroviral na\u00efve patients experiencing virologic failure (n=71) \nreceiving nevirapine once daily (n=25) or twice daily (n=46) in combination with lamivudine and \nstavudine for 48 weeks showed that isolates from 8/25 and 23/46 patients, respectively, contained one \nor more of the following NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions:\nY181C, K101E, G190A/S, K103N, V106A/M, V108I, Y188C/L, A98G, F227L and M230L.\n\nCross-resistance\n\nRapid emergence of HIV-strains which are cross-resistant to NNRTIs has been observed in vitro. \nCross resistance to delavirdine and efavirenz is expected after virologic failure with nevirapine. \nDepending on resistance testing results, an etravirine-containing regimen may be used subsequently. \nCross-resistance between nevirapine and either HIV protease inhibitors, HIV integrase inhibitors or \nHIV entry inhibitors is unlikely because the enzyme targets involved are different. Similarly the \npotential for cross-resistance between nevirapine and NRTIs is low because the molecules have \ndifferent binding sites on the reverse transcriptase.\n\nClinical results\n\nViramune has been evaluated in both treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients. \n\nStudies in treatment-na\u00efve patients\n\n2NN study\n\nThe double non-nucleoside study 2 NN was a randomised, open-label, multicentre prospective study \ncomparing the NNRTIs nevirapine, efavirenz and both medicinal products given together. \n\n1,216 antiretroviral-therapy na\u00efve patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA > 5,000 copies/ml at baseline \nwere assigned to Viramune 400 mg once daily, Viramune 200 mg twice daily, efavirenz 600 mg once \ndaily, or Viramune (400 mg) and efavirenz (800 mg) once daily, plus stavudine and lamivudine for 48 \nweeks. \nThe primary endpoint, treatment failure, was defined as less than 1 log10 decline in plasma HIV-1 \nRNA in the first 12 weeks, or two consecutive measurements of more than 50 copies/ ml from week \n24 onwards, or disease progression. \n\nMedian age was 34 years and about 64% were male patients, median CD4 cell count was 170 and 190 \ncells per mm3 in the Viramune twice daily and efavirenz groups, respectively. There were no \nsignificant differences in demographic and baseline characteristics between the treatment groups. \n\nThe predetermined primary efficacy comparison was between the Viramune twice daily and the \nefavirenz treatment groups. \n\nThe nevirapine twice daily regimen and the efavirenz regimen were not significantly different \n(p=0.091) in terms of efficacy as measured by treatment failure, or any component of treatment failure \nincluding virological failure.\nThe simultaneous use of nevirapine (400 mg) plus efavirenz (800 mg) was associated with the highest \n\n\n\n21\n\nfrequency of clinical adverse events and with the highest rate of treatment failure (53.1 %). As the \nregimen of nevirapine plus efavirenz did not have additional efficacy and caused more adverse events \nthan each medicinal product separately, this regimen is not recommended.\nTwenty per cent of patients assigned to nevirapine twice daily and 18% of patients assigned to \nefavirenz had at least one grade 3 or 4 clinical adverse event. Clinical hepatitis reported as clinical \nadverse event occurred in 10 (2.6 %) and 2 (0.5 %) patients in the nevirapine twice daily and efavirenz \ngroups respectively. The proportion of patients with at least one grade 3 or 4 liver-associated \nlaboratory toxicity was 8.3 % for nevirapine twice daily and 4.5 % for efavirenz. Of the patients with \ngrade 3 or 4 liver-associated laboratory toxicity, the proportions coinfected with hepatitis B or \nhepatitis C virus were 6.7 % and 20.0 % in the nevirapine twice daily group, 5.6 % and 11.1 % in the \nefavirenz group.\n\n2NN Three-year follow-up-study\n\nThis is a retrospective multicentre study comparing the 3-year antiviral efficacy of Viramune and \nefavirenz in combination with stavudine and lamivudine in 2NN patients from week 49 to week 144. \nPatients who participated in the 2NN study and were still under active follow-up at week 48 when the \nstudy closed and were still being treated at the study clinic, were asked to participate in this study. \nPrimary study endpoints (percentage of patients with treatment failures) and secondary study \nendpoints as well as backbone therapy were similar to the original 2NN study. \n\nA durable response to Viramune for at least three years was documented in this study, and equivalence \nwithin a 10 % range was demonstrated between Viramune 200 mg twice daily and efavirenz with \nrespect to treatment failure. Both, the primary (p = 0.92) and secondary endpoints showed no \nstatistically significant differences between efavirenz and Viramune 200 mg twice daily.\n\nStudies in treatment-experienced patients\n\nNEFA study\n\nThe NEFA study is a controlled prospective randomised study which evaluated treatment options for \npatients who switch from protease inhibitor (PI) based regimen with undetectable load to either \nViramune, efavirenz or abacavir.\nThe study randomly assigned 460 adults who were taking two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase \ninhibitors and at least one PI and whose plasma HIV-1 RNA levels had been less than 200 c/ml for at \nleast the previous six months to switch from the PI to Viramune (155 patients), efavirenz (156), or \nabacavir (149).\nThe primary study endpoint was death, progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or an \nincrease in HIV-1 RNA levels to 200 copies or more per millilitre. \n\nAt 12 months, the Kaplan\u2013Meier estimates of the likelihood of reaching the endpoint were 10 % in the \nViramune group, 6 % in the efavirenz group, and 13 percent in the abacavir group (P=0.10 according \nto an intention-to-treat analysis). \n\nThe overall incidence of adverse events was significantly lower (61 patients, or 41 %) in the abacavir \ngroup than in the nevirapine group (83 patients, or 54 %) or the efavirenz group (89 patients, or 57 %). \nSignificantly fewer patients in the abacavir group (9 patients, or 6 %) than in the nevirapine group (26 \npatients, or 17 %) or the efavirenz group (27 patients, or 17 %) discontinued the medicinal product\nbecause of adverse events.\n\nPerinatal Transmission \n\nNumerous studies have been performed examining the use of Viramune in regards to perinatal \ntransmission, most notably HIVNET 012. This study demonstrated a significant reduction in \ntransmission using single dose nevirapine (13.1 % (n = 310) in the Viramune group, versus 25.1 % (n \n= 308) in the ultra-short zidovudine group (p = 0.00063)). Monotherapy with Viramune has been \n\n\n\n22\n\nassociated with the development of NNRTI resistance. Single dose nevirapine in mothers or infants \nmay lead to reduced efficacy if an HIV treatment regimen using nevirapine is later instituted within 6 \nmonths or less in these patients. Combination of other antiretrovirals with single-dose nevirapine \nattenuates the emergence of nevirapine resistance. Where other antiretroviral medicines are accessible, \nthe single dose Viramune regimen should be combined with additional effective antiretroviral \nmedicines (as recommended in internationally recognized guidelines).   \n\nThe clinical relevance of these data in European populations has not been established. Furthermore, in \nthe case Viramune is used as single dose to prevent vertical transmission of HIV-1 infection, the risk \nof hepatotoxicity in mother and child cannot be excluded. \n\nPaediatric population\nResults of a 48-week analysis of the South African study BI 1100.1368 confirmed that the 4/7 mg/kg \nand 150 mg/m2 nevirapine dose groups were well tolerated and effective in treating antiretroviral naive \npaediatric patients. A marked improvement in the CD4+ cell percent was observed through Week 48 \nfor both dose groups. Also, both dosing regimens were effective in reducing the viral load. In this \n48-week study no unexpected safety findings were observed in either dosing group.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nViramune tablets and oral suspension have been shown to be comparably bioavailable and \ninterchangeable at doses up to 200 mg.\n\nAbsorption: Nevirapine is readily absorbed (> 90 %) after oral administration in healthy volunteers \nand in adults with HIV-1 infection. Absolute bioavailability in 12 healthy adults following single-dose \nadministration was 93 \uf0b1 9 % (mean SD) for a 50 mg tablet and 91 \uf0b1 8 % for an oral solution. Peak \nplasma nevirapine concentrations of 2 \uf0b1 0.4 \u00b5g/ml (7.5 \u00b5M) were attained by 4 hours following a \nsingle 200 mg dose. Following multiple doses, nevirapine peak concentrations appear to increase \nlinearly in the dose range of 200 to 400 mg/day. Data reported in the literature from 20 HIV-infected\npatients suggest a steady state Cmax of 5.74 \u00b5g/ml (5.00-7.44) and Cmin of 3.73 \u00b5g/ml (3.20-5.08) with \nan AUC of 109.0 h*\u00b5g/ml (96.0-143.5) in patients taking 200 mg of nevirapine bid. Other published \ndata support these conclusions. Long-term efficacy appears to be most likely in patients whose \nnevirapine trough levels exceed 3.5 \u00b5g/ml. \n\nDistribution: Nevirapine is lipophilic and is essentially nonionized at physiologic pH. Following \nintravenous administration to healthy adults, the volume of distribution (Vdss) of nevirapine was 1.21 \n\uf0b1 0.09 l/kg, suggesting that nevirapine is widely distributed in humans. Nevirapine readily crosses the \nplacenta and is found in breast milk. Nevirapine is about 60 % bound to plasma proteins in the plasma \nconcentration range of 1-10 \u00b5g/ml. Nevirapine concentrations in human cerebrospinal fluid (n = 6) \nwere 45 % (\uf0b1 5 %) of the concentrations in plasma; this ratio is approximately equal to the fraction not \nbound to plasma protein.\n\nBiotransformation and elimination: In vivo studies in humans and in vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes have shown that nevirapine is extensively biotransformed via cytochrome P450 \n(oxidative) metabolism to several hydroxylated metabolites. In vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes suggest that oxidative metabolism of nevirapine is mediated primarily by cytochrome \nP450 isozymes from the CYP3A family, although other isozymes may have a secondary role. In a \nmass balance/excretion study in eight healthy male volunteers dosed to steady state with nevirapine \n200 mg given twice daily followed by a single 50 mg dose of 14C-nevirapine, approximately 91.4 \uf0b1\n10.5 % of the radiolabelled dose was recovered, with urine (81.3 \uf0b1 11.1 %) representing the primary \nroute of excretion compared to faeces (10.1 \uf0b1 1.5 %). Greater than 80 % of the radioactivity in urine \nwas made up of glucuronide conjugates of hydroxylated metabolites. Thus cytochrome P450 \nmetabolism, glucuronide conjugation, and urinary excretion of glucuronidated metabolites represent \nthe primary route of nevirapine biotransformation and elimination in humans. Only a small fraction \n(< 5 %) of the radioactivity in urine (representing < 3 % of the total dose) was made up of parent \ncompound; therefore, renal excretion plays a minor role in elimination of the parent compound.\n\n\n\n23\n\nNevirapine has been shown to be an inducer of hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic enzymes. The \npharmacokinetics of autoinduction is characterised by an approximately 1.5 to 2 fold increase in the \napparent oral clearance of nevirapine as treatment continues from a single dose to two-to-four weeks \nof dosing with 200-400 mg/day. Autoinduction also results in a corresponding decrease in the terminal \nphase half-life of nevirapine in plasma from approximately 45 hours (single dose) to approximately \n25-30 hours following multiple dosing with 200-400 mg/day.\n\nRenal impairment: The single-dose pharmacokinetics of nevirapine has been compared in 23 patients \nwith either mild (50 \uf0a3 CLcr \uf03c 80 ml/min), moderate (30 \uf0a3 CLcr \uf03c 50 ml/min) or severe renal \ndysfunction (CLcr \uf03c 30 ml/min), renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring \ndialysis, and 8 patients with normal renal function (CLcr \uf03e 80 ml/min). Renal impairment (mild, \nmoderate and severe) resulted in no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine. \nHowever, patients with ESRD requiring dialysis exhibited a 43.5 % reduction in nevirapine AUC over \na one-week exposure period. There was also accumulation of nevirapine hydroxy-metabolites in \nplasma. The results suggest that supplementing nevirapine therapy with an additional 200 mg dose of \nViramune following each dialysis treatment would help offset the effects of dialysis on nevirapine \nclearance. Otherwise patients with CLcr \uf0b3 20 ml/min do not require an adjustment in nevirapine\ndosing. \n\nHepatic impairment:A steady state study comparing 46 patients with \nmild (n=17: Ishak Score 1-2), \nmoderate (n=20; Ishak Score 3-4), \nor severe (n=9; Ishak Score 5-6, Child-Pugh A in 8 pts., for 1 Child-Pugh score not applicable) \nliver fibrosis as a measure of hepatic impairment was conducted. \n\nThe patients studied were receiving antiretroviral therapy containing Viramune 200 mg twice daily for \nat least 6 weeks prior to pharmacokinetic sampling, with a median duration of therapy of 3.4 years. In \nthis study, the multiple dose pharmacokinetic disposition of nevirapine and the five oxidative \nmetabolites were not altered.  \n\nHowever, approximately 15 % of these patients with hepatic fibrosis had nevirapine trough \nconcentrations above 9,000 ng/ml (2 fold the usual mean trough). Patients with hepatic impairment \nshould be monitored carefully for evidence of medicinal product induced toxicity.\n\nIn a 200 mg nevirapine single dose pharmacokinetic study of HIV-negative patients with mild and \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, n=6; Child-Pugh B, n=4), a significant increase in the \nAUC of nevirapine was observed in one Child-Pugh B patient with ascites suggesting that patients \nwith worsening hepatic function and ascites may be at risk of accumulating nevirapine in the systemic \ncirculation. Because nevirapine induces its own metabolism with multiple dosing, this single dose \nstudy may not reflect the impact of hepatic impairment on multiple dose pharmacokinetics (see section \n4.4).\n\nGender and elderly\nIn the multinational 2NN study, a population pharmacokinetic substudy of 1,077 patients was \nperformed that included 391 females. Female patients showed a 13.8 % lower clearance of nevirapine \nthan did male patients. This difference is not considered clinically relevant. Since neither body weight \nnor Body Mass Index (BMI) had influence on the clearance of nevirapine, the effect of gender cannot \nbe explained by body size. Nevirapine pharmacokinetics in HIV-1 infected adults does not appear to \nchange with age (range 19-68 years) or race (Black, Hispanic, or Caucasian). Nevirapine has not been \nspecifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.\n\nPaediatric population\nData concerning the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine have been derived from two major sources: a 48 \nweek paediatric study in South Africa (BI 1100.1368) involving 123 HIV-1 positive, antiretroviral \nna\u00efve patients aged 3 months to 16 years; and a consolidated analysis of five Paediatric AIDS Clinical \n\n\n\n24\n\nTrials Group (PACTG) protocols comprising 495 patients aged 14 days to 19 years. \n\nPharmacokinetic data on 33 patients (age range 0.77 \u2013 13.7 years) in the intensive sampling group \ndemonstrated that clearance of nevirapine increased with increasing age in a manner consistent with \nincreasing body surface area. Dosing of nevirapine at 150 mg/m2 BID (after a two-week lead in at \n150 mg/m2 QD) produced geometric mean or mean trough nevirapine concentrations between 4-\n6 \u00b5g/ml (as targeted from adult data). In addition, the observed trough nevirapine concentrations were \ncomparable between the two methods.\n\nThe consolidated analysis of Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocols 245, 356, 366, \n377, and 403 allowed for the evaluation of paediatric patients less than 3 months of age (n=17) \nenrolled in these PACTG studies. The plasma nevirapine concentrations observed were within the \nrange observed in adults and the remainder of the paediatric population, but were more variable \nbetween patients, particularly in the second month of age.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans other than those observed in clinical studies \nbased on conventional studies of safety, pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. In \ncarcinogenicity studies, nevirapine induces hepatic tumours in rats and mice. These findings are most \nlikely related to nevirapine being a strong inducer of liver enzymes, and not due to a genotoxic mode \nof action. \n\n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach ml of oral suspension contains 10 mg of nevirapine (as hemihydrate).\n\nEach bottle contains 2.4 g of nevirapine (as hemihydrate) in 240 ml of Viramune oral suspension.\n\nExcipients with known effect\nEach ml of oral suspension contains 150 mg sucrose, 162 mg sorbitol, 1.8 mg of methyl \nparahydroxybenzoate and 0.24 mg of propyl parahydroxybenzoate.\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nOral suspension\n\nWhite to off-white homogenous suspension.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nViramune is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of \nHIV-1 infected adults, adolescents, and children of any age (see section 4.2).\n\nMost of the experience with Viramune is in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors (NRTIs). The choice of a subsequent therapy after Viramune should be based on clinical \nexperience and resistance testing (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nViramune should be administered by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV \ninfection.\n\nPosology\n\nPatients 16 years and older\nThe recommended dose for Viramune is 20 ml (200 mg) oral suspension once daily for the first \n14 days (this lead-in period should be used because it has been found to lessen the frequency of rash), \nfollowed by 20 ml (200 mg) oral suspension twice daily, in combination with at least two additional \nantiretroviral agents.\n\nViramune is also available as a 200 mg tablet for patients 16 years and older, or for older children, \nparticularly adolescents, weighing 50 kg or more or whose BSA is above 1.25 m2.\n\nIf a dose is recognized as missed within 8 hours of when it was due, the patient should take the missed \ndose as soon as possible. If a dose is missed and it is more than 8 hours later, the patient should only \n\n\n\n27\n\ntake the next dose at the usual time.\n\nDose management considerations\nPatients experiencing rash during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (4 mg/kg/day or \n150 mg/m2/day for paediatric patients) should not have their Viramune dose increased until the rash \nhas resolved. The isolated rash should be closely monitored (see section 4.4). The 200 mg once daily \ndosing regimen should not be continued beyond 28 days at which point in time an alternative \ntreatment should be sought due to the possible risk of underexposure and resistance.\n\nPatients who interrupt nevirapine dosing for more than 7 days should restart the recommended dosing \nregimen using the two week lead-in period.\n\nThere are toxicities that require interruption of Viramune therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nElderly\nNevirapine has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.\n\nRenal impairment\nFor patients with renal dysfunction requiring dialysis an additional 200 mg dose of nevirapine\nfollowing each dialysis treatment is recommended. Patients with CLcr \uf0b3 20 ml/min do not require a \ndose adjustment, see section 5.2.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNevirapine should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, see section \n4.3). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe total daily dose should not exceed 400 mg for any patient. Viramune may be dosed in paediatric \npatients either by body surface area (BSA) or by body weight as follows:\nBy BSA using the Mosteller formula the recommended oral dose for paediatric patients of all ages is \n150 mg/m2 once daily for two weeks followed by 150 mg/m2 twice daily thereafter.\n\nCalculation of the volume of Viramune oral suspension (50 mg/5 ml) required for paediatric dosing on \na body surface basis of 150 mg/m2:\n\nBSA range (m2) Volume (ml)\n0.08 \u2013 0.25 2.5\n0.25 \u2013 0.42 5\n0.42 \u2013 0.58 7.5\n0.58 \u2013 0.75 10\n0.75 \u2013 0.92 12.5\n0.92 \u2013 1.08 15\n1.08 \u2013 1.25 17.5\n1.25+ 20\n\nMosteller Formula:    BSA (m2) =\n3600\n\n(kg) x Wt (cm)Height \n\nBy weight the recommended oral dose for paediatric patients up to 8 years of age is 4 mg/kg once \ndaily for two weeks followed by 7 mg/kg twice daily thereafter.

This is \nassisted by the use of the supplied dispensing syringe. If an alternative measuring device is used (e.g. a \ndispensing cup or teaspoon for larger doses) it is important that the device is rinsed to ensure complete \nremoval of residual oral suspension. Viramune may be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nReadministration to patients who have required permanent discontinuation for severe rash, rash \naccompanied by constitutional symptoms, hypersensitivity reactions, or clinical hepatitis due to \nnevirapine.\n\nPatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) or pre-treatment ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN \nuntil baseline ASAT/ALAT are stabilised < 5 ULN.\n\nReadministration to patients who previously had ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN during nevirapine therapy \nand had recurrence of liver function abnormalities upon readministration of nevirapine (see section \n4.4).\n\nCoadministration with herbal preparations containing St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to \nthe risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of nevirapine (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nViramune should only be used with at least two other antiretroviral agents (see section 5.1).\n\nViramune should not be used as the sole active antiretroviral, as monotherapy with any antiretroviral \nhas shown to result in viral resistance.\n\n\n\n29\n\nThe first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring of patients to disclose the potential appearance of severe and life-threatening skin \nreactions (including cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis\n(TEN)) and serious hepatitis/hepatic failure. The greatest risk of hepatic and skin reactions \noccurs in the first 6 weeks of therapy. However, the risk of any hepatic event continues past this \nperiod and monitoring should continue at frequent intervals. Female gender and higher CD4 \ncounts (>250/mm3 in adult females and >400/mm3 in adult males) at the initiation of nevirapine\ntherapy are associated with a greater risk of hepatic adverse reactions if the patient has \ndetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA - i.e. a concentration \u2265 50 copies/ml - at the initiation of \nnevirapine. As serious and life threatening hepatotoxicity has been observed in controlled and \nuncontrolled studies predominantly in patients with a plasma HIV-1 viral load of 50 copies/ml or \nhigher, nevirapine should not be initiated in adult females with CD4 cell counts greater than 250 \ncells/mm3 or in adult males with CD4 cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3, who have a \ndetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA unless the benefit outweighs the risk. \n\nIn some cases, hepatic injury has progressed despite discontinuation of treatment. Patients \ndeveloping signs or symptoms of hepatitis, severe skin reaction or hypersensitivity reactions \nmust discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately. Nevirapinemust not be \nrestarted following severe hepatic, skin or hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.3).\n\nThe dose must be strictly adhered to, especially the 14-days lead-in period (see section 4.2).\n\nCutaneous reactions\n\nSevere and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have occurred in patients treated with \nnevirapine mainly during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity reactions characterised by rash, \nconstitutional findings and visceral involvement. Patients should be intensively monitored during the \nfirst 18 weeks of treatment. Patients should be closely monitored if an isolated rash occurs. Nevirapine\nmust be permanently discontinued in any patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by \nconstitutional symptoms (such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, muscle \nor joint aches, or general malaise), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis. Nevirapine must be permanently discontinued in any patient experiencing hypersensitivity \nreaction (characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms, plus visceral involvement, such as \nhepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction) see section 4.4.\n\nNevirapine administration above the recommended dose might increase the frequency and seriousness \nof skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.\n\nRhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with \nnevirapine use.\n\nConcomitant prednisone use (40 mg/day for the first 14 days of Viramune administration) has been \nshown not to decrease the incidence of nevirapine-associated rash, and may be associated with an \nincrease in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. \n\nSome risk factors for developing serious cutaneous reactions have been identified, they include failure \nto follow the initial dosing of 200 mg daily (4 mg/kg or 150 mg/m2 for paediatric patients) during the \nlead-in period and a long delay between the initial symptoms and medical consultation. Women \nappear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash, whether receiving nevirapine or non-\nnevirapine containing therapy.\n\nPatients should be instructed that a major toxicity of nevirapine is rash. They should be advised to \npromptly notify their physician of any rash and avoid delay between the initial symptoms and medical \nconsultation. The majority of rashes associated with nevirapine occur within the first 6 weeks of \ninitiation of therapy. Therefore, patients should be monitored carefully for the appearance of rash \n\n\n\n30\n\nduring this period. Patients should be instructed that dose escalation is not to occur if any rash occurs \nduring the two-week lead-in dosing period, until the rash resolves. The 200 mg once daily dosing \nregimen should not be continued beyond 28 days at which point in time an alternative treatment \nshould be sought due to the possible risk of underexposure and resistance. Careful monitoring of \npaediatric patients is especially warranted, particularly in the first 18 weeks of treatment, since these \npatients may be less likely than adults to notice, or report, skin reactions.\n\nAny patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, \nblistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, muscle or joint aches, or general malaise should \ndiscontinue the medicinal product and immediately seek medical evaluation. In these patients \nnevirapine must not be restarted.\n\nIf patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, liver function tests should be \nperformed. Patients with moderate to severe elevations (ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN) should be \npermanently discontinued from nevirapine.\n\nIf a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as fever, \narthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, eosinophilia, \ngranulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction, nevirapine must be permanently stopped and not be re-\nintroduced (see section 4.3).\n\nHepatic reactions\n\nSevere and life-threatening hepatotoxicity, including fatal fulminant hepatitis, has occurred in patients \ntreated with nevirapine. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring. The risk of hepatic reactions is greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. However the risk \ncontinues past this period and monitoring should continue at frequent intervals throughout treatment.\n\nRhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with \nnevirapine use.\n\nIncreased ASAT or ALAT levels > 2.5 ULN and/or co-infection with hepatitis B and/or C at the start \nof antiretroviral therapy is associated with greater risk of hepatic adverse reactions during \nantiretroviral therapy in general, including nevirapine containing regimens. \n\nFemale gender and higher CD4 counts at the initiation of nevirapine therapy in treatment-na\u00efve\npatients is associated with increased risk of hepatic adverse reactions. Women have a three fold higher \nrisk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (5.8 % versus 2.2 %), and \ntreatment-na\u00efve patients of either gender with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma with higher CD4 \ncounts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with \nnevirapine. In a retrospective review of predominantly patients with a plasma HIV-1 viral load of 50 \ncopies/ml or higher, women with CD4 counts >250 cells/mm3 had a 12 fold higher risk of \nsymptomatic hepatic adverse reactions compared to women with CD4 counts <250 cells/mm3 (11.0% \nversus 0.9 %). An increased risk was observed in men with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma and CD4 \ncounts > 400 cells/mm3 (6.3 % versus 1.2 % for men with CD4 counts <400 cells/mm3). This \nincreased risk for toxicity based on CD4 count thresholds has not been detected in patients with \nundetectable (i.e. < 50 copies/ml) plasma viral load.\n\nPatients should be informed that hepatic reactions are a major toxicity of nevirapine requiring a close \nmonitoring during the first 18 weeks. They should be informed that occurrence of symptoms \nsuggestive of hepatitis should lead them to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical \nevaluation, which should include liver function tests.\n\n\n\n31\n\nLiver monitoring\n\nClinical chemistry tests, which include liver function tests, should be performed prior to initiating \nnevirapine therapy and at appropriate intervals during therapy.\n\nAbnormal liver function tests have been reported with nevirapine, some in the first few weeks of \ntherapy. \n\nAsymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes are frequently described and are not necessarily a \ncontraindication to use nevirapine. Asymptomatic GGT elevations are not a contraindication to \ncontinue therapy.\n\nMonitoring of hepatic tests should be done every two weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, at \nthe 3rd month and then regularly thereafter. Liver test monitoring should be performed if the patient \nexperiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity.\n\nIf ASAT or ALAT > 2.5 ULN before or during treatment, then liver tests should be monitored more \nfrequently during regular clinic visits. Nevirapine must not be administered to patients with pre-\ntreatment ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN until baseline ASAT/ALAT are stabilised < 5 ULN (see section \n4.3).\n\nPhysicians and patients should be vigilant for prodromal signs or findings of hepatitis, such as \nanorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, hepatomegaly or liver tenderness. Patients \nshould be instructed to seek medical attention promptly if these occur.\n\nIf ASAT or ALAT increase to > 5 ULN during treatment, nevirapine should be immediately \nstopped. If ASAT and ALAT return to baseline values and if the patient had no clinical signs or \nsymptoms of hepatitis, rash, constitutional symptoms or other findings suggestive of organ \ndysfunction, it may be possible to reintroduce nevirapine, on a case by case basis, at the starting \ndose regimen of 200 mg/day for 14 days followed by 400 mg/day. In these cases, more frequent \nliver monitoring is required. If liver function abnormalities recur, nevirapine should be \npermanently discontinued. \n\nIf clinical hepatitis occurs, characterised by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, icterus AND laboratory \nfindings (such as moderate or severe liver function test abnormalities (excluding GGT)), \nnevirapine must be permanently stopped. Viramune must not be readministered to patients who \nhave required permanent discontinuation for clinical hepatitis due to nevirapine.\n\nLiver disease\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Viramune has not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders. Viramune is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, \nsee section 4.3). Pharmacokinetic results suggest caution should be exercised when nevirapine is \nadministered to patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh B). Patients with chronic \nhepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe \nand potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In the case of concomitant antiviral therapy for \nhepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products.\n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.\n\n\n\n32\n\nOther warnings\n\nPost-Exposure-Prophylaxis: Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure requiring transplantation, \nhas been reported in HIV-uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of Viramune in the setting of \npost-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. The use of Viramune has not been evaluated \nwithin a specific study on PEP, especially in term of treatment duration and therefore, is strongly \ndiscouraged.\n\nCombination therapy with nevirapine is not a curative treatment of patients infected with HIV-1; \npatients may continue to experience illnesses associated with advanced HIV-1 infection, including \nopportunistic infections.\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nHormonal methods of birth control other than Depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) should not \nbe used as the sole method of contraception in women taking Viramune, since nevirapine might lower \nthe plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. For this reason, and to reduce the risk of HIV \ntransmission, barrier contraception (e.g. condoms) is recommended. Additionally, when \npostmenopausal hormone therapy is used during administration of nevirapine, its therapeutic effect \nshould be monitored.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters:\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.\n\nIn clinical studies, Viramune has been associated with an increase in HDL- cholesterol and an overall \nimprovement in the total to HDL-cholesterol ratio. However, in the absence of specific studies, the \nclinical impact of these findings is not known. In addition, Viramune has not been shown to cause \nglucose disturbances.\n\nOsteonecrosis: Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, \nalcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis \nhave been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to \ncombination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they \nexperience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time \nof institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to \nasymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or \naggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or \nmonths of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or \nfocal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms \nshould be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 \ndisease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune \nreactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many \nmonths after initiation of treatment.\n\nThe available pharmacokinetic data suggest that the concomitant use of rifampicin and nevirapine is \nnot recommended. Furthermore, combining the following compounds with Viramune is not \nrecommended: efavirenz, ketoconazole, delavirdine, etravirine, rilpivirine, elvitegravir (in \ncombination with cobicistat), atazanavir (in combination with ritonavir), boceprevir; fosamprenavir (if \n\n\n\n33\n\nnot co-administered with low dose ritonavir) (see section 4.5).\n\nGranulocytopenia is commonly associated with zidovudine. Therefore, patients who receive \nnevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly and especially paediatric patients and patients who receive \nhigher zidovudine doses or patients with poor bone marrow reserve, in particular those with advanced \nHIV disease, have an increased risk of granulocytopenia. In such patients haematological parameters \nshould be carefully monitored.\n\nHypersensitivity\nSucrose: Viramune oral suspension contains 150 mg of sucrose per ml. Patients with rare hereditary \nproblems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency \nshould not take this medicine.\n\nSorbitol: Viramune oral suspension contains 162 mg of sorbitol per ml. Patients with hereditary \nfructose intolerance (HFI) should not take/be given this medicinal product.\n\nMethyl and propyl parahydroxybenzoates: Viramune oral suspension contains methyl \nparahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate, which may cause allergic reaction (possibly \ndelayed).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNevirapine is an inducer of CYP3A and potentially CYP2B6, with maximal induction occurring \nwithin 2-4 weeks of initiating multiple-dose therapy. \n\nCompounds using this metabolic pathway may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-\nadministered with nevirapine. Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effectiveness of P450 metabolised \nmedicinal products is recommended when taken in combination with nevirapine.\n\nThe absorption of nevirapine is not affected by food, antacids or medicinal products which are \nformulated with an alkaline buffering agent.\n\nThe interaction data is presented as geometric mean value with 90% confidence interval (90% CI) \nwhenever these data were available.

Ketoconazole and erythromycin significantly \ninhibited the formation of nevirapine hydroxylated metabolites.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females\nWomen of childbearing potential should not use oral contraceptives as the sole method for birth \ncontrol, since nevirapine might lower the plasma concentrations of these medicinal products (see \nsections 4.4 & 4.5).\n\nPregnancy\nCurrently available data on pregnant women indicate no malformative or foeto/ neonatal toxicity. To \ndate no other relevant epidemiological data are available. No observable teratogenicity was detected in \nreproductive studies performed in pregnant rats and rabbits (see section 5.3). There are no adequate \nand well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Caution should be exercised when prescribing \nnevirapine to pregnant women (see section 4.4). As hepatotoxicity is more frequent in women with \nCD4 cell counts above 250 cells/mm3 with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma (50 or more copies/ml), \nthese conditions should be taken in consideration on therapeutic decision (see section 4.4). There is \nnot enough evidence to substantiate that the absence of an increased risk for toxicity seen in pre-\ntreated women initiating nevirapine with an undetectable viral load (less than 50 copies/ml of HIV-1 \nin plasma) and CD4 cell counts above 250 cells/mm3 also applies to pregnant women. All the \nrandomised studies addressing this issue specifically excluded pregnant women, and pregnant women\nwere under-represented in cohort studies as well as in meta-analyses.\n\nBreast-feeding\nNevirapine readily crosses the placenta and is found in breast milk. \n\nIt is recommended that HIV-infected mothers do not breast-feed their infants to avoid risking postnatal \ntransmission of HIV and that mothers should discontinue breast-feeding if they are receiving \nnevirapine.\n\nFertility\nIn reproductive toxicology studies, evidence of impaired fertility was seen in rats.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nThere are no specific studies about the ability to drive vehicles and use machinery.\nHowever, patients should be advised that they may experience adverse reactions such as fatigue during \ntreatment with Viramune. Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or operating \nmachinery. If patients experience fatigue they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving \nor operating machinery. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions related to Viramune therapy, across all clinical studies, \nwere rash, allergic reactions, hepatitis, abnormal liver function tests, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, \nabdominal pain, fatigue, fever, headache and myalgia.\n\n\n\n42\n\nThe postmarketing experience has shown that the most serious adverse reactions are Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis, serious hepatitis/hepatic failure, and drug reaction with \neosinophilia and systemic symptoms, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as \nfever, arthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, \neosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical \nperiod which requires close monitoring (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions which may be causally related to the administration of Viramune have \nbeen reported. The frequencies estimated are based on pooled clinical study data for adverse reactions\nconsidered related to Viramune treatment. \n\nFrequency is defined using the following convention: very common (\uf0b31/10); common (\uf0b31/100 to \n<1/10); uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000).\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\nCommon granulocytopenia\nUncommon anaemia\n\nImmune system disorders\nCommon hypersensitivity (incl. anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, urticaria)\nUncommon anaphylactic reaction\nRare drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon headache\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nCommon hepatitis (including severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity) (1.9%)\nUncommon jaundice\nRare hepatitis fulminant (which may be fatal)\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nVery common rash (12.5 %)\nUncommon Stevens-Johnson syndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis (which may be fatal) \n\n(0.2 %), angioedema, urticaria\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nUncommon arthralgia, myalgia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon pyrexia, fatigue\n\nInvestigations\nCommon liver function test abnormal (alanine aminotransferase increased; transaminases \n\nincreased; aspartate aminotransferase increased; gamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased; hepatic enzyme increased; hypertransaminasaemia)\n\nUncommon blood phosphorus decreased; blood pressure increased\n\n\n\n43\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nIn study 1100.1090, from which the majority of related adverse events (n=28) were received, patients \non placebo had a higher incidence of events of granulocytopenia (3.3 %) than patients on nevirapine \n(2.5 %).\n\nAnaphylactic reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in \nrandomised, controlled clinical studies. The frequency category was estimated from a statistical \ncalculation based on the total number of patients exposed to nevirapine in randomised controlled \nclinical studies (n=2,718).\n\nDecreased blood phosphorus and increased blood pressure were observed in clinical studies with co-\nadministration of tenofovir/emtricitabine.\n\nMetabolic parameters\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4)\n\nThe following adverse reactions have also been reported when nevirapine has been used in \ncombination with other anti-retroviral agents: pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy and \nthrombocytopaenia. These adverse reactions are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents \nand may be expected to occur when nevirapine is used in combination with other agents; however it is \nunlikely that these adverse reactions are due to nevirapine treatment. Hepatic-renal failure syndromes \nhave been reported rarely.\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissues\n\nThe most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, with Viramune attributable rash occurring in \n12.5 % of patients in combination regimens in controlled studies.\n\nRashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or \nwithout pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. Hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction, \nangioedema and urticaria) have been reported. Rashes occur alone or in the context of drug reaction\nwith eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as \nfever, arthralgia, myalgia and lympadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, \neosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction.\n\nSevere and life-threatening skin reactions have occurred in patients treated with nevirapine, including \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Fatal cases of SJS, TEN and \ndrug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported. The majority of severe \nrashes occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment and some required hospitalisation, with one \npatient requiring surgical intervention (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n44\n\nHepato-biliary\n\nThe most frequently observed laboratory test abnormalities are elevations in liver function tests \n(LFTs), including ALAT, ASAT, GGT, total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Asymptomatic \nelevations of GGT levels are the most frequent. Cases of jaundice have been reported. Cases of \nhepatitis (severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity, including fatal fulminant hepatitis) have been \nreported in patients treated with nevirapine. The best predictor of a serious hepatic event was elevated \nbaseline liver function tests. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nBased on clinical study experience of 361 paediatric patients the majority of which received \ncombination treatment with ZDV or/and ddI, the most frequently reported adverse events related to \nnevirapine were similar to those observed in adults. Granulocytopenia was more frequently observed \nin children. In an open-label clinical study (ACTG 180) granulocytopenia assessed as medicinal \nproduct-related occurred in 5/37 (13.5 %) of patients. In ACTG 245, a double-blind placebo controlled \nstudy, the frequency of serious medicinal product-related granulocytopenia was 5/305 (1.6 %).\nIsolated cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/ toxic epidermal necrolysis transition \nsyndrome have been reported in this population.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no known antidote for nevirapine overdose. Cases of Viramune overdose at doses ranging \nfrom 800 to 6,000 mg per day for up to 15 days have been reported. Patients have experienced \noedema, erythema nodosum, fatigue, fever, headache, insomnia, nausea, pulmonary infiltrates, rash, \nvertigo, vomiting, increase in transaminases and weight decrease. All of these effects subsided \nfollowing discontinuation of nevirapine. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nOne case of massive accidental overdose in a newborn was reported. The ingested dose was 40 times \nthe recommended dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Mild isolated neutropenia and hyperlactataemia was observed, \nwhich spontaneously disappeared within one week without any clinical complications. One year later, \nthe child\u2019s development remained normal. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors, ATC code J05AG01.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nNevirapine is a NNRTI of HIV-1. Nevirapine is a non-competitive inhibitor of the HIV-1 reverse \ntranscriptase, but it does not have a biologically significant inhibitory effect on the HIV-2 reverse \ntranscriptase or on eukaryotic DNA polymerases \uf061, \uf062, \uf067, or \uf064.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n45\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\n\nNevirapine had a median EC50 value (50% inhibitory concentration) of 63 nM against a panel of group \nM HIV-1 isolates from clades A, B, C, D, F, G, and H, and circulating recombinant forms (CRF), \nCRF01_AE, CRF02_AG and CRF12_BF replicating in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. In a panel \nof 2,923 predominantly subtype B HIV-1 clinical isolates, the mean EC50 value was 90nM. Similar \nEC50 values are obtained when the antiviral activity of nevirapine is measured in peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells, monocyte derived macrophages or lymphoblastoid cell line. Nevirapine had no \nantiviral activity in cell culture against group O HIV-1 isolates or HIV-2 isolates.\n\nNevirapine in combination with efavirenz exhibited a strong antagonistic anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro \n(see section 4.5) and was additive to antagonistic with the protease inhibitor ritonavir or the fusion \ninhibitor enfuvirtide. Nevirapine exhibited additive to synergistic anti-HIV-1 activity in combination \nwith the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, saquinavir and tipranavir, and \nthe NRTIs abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine. The \nanti-HIV-1 activity of nevirapine was antagonized by the anti-HBV medicinal product adefovir and by \nthe anti-HCV medicinal product ribavirin in vitro.\n\nResistance\n\nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility (100-250-fold) to nevirapine emerge in cell culture. \nGenotypic analysis showed mutations in the HIV-1 RT gene Y181C and/or V106A depending upon \nthe virus strain and cell line employed. Time to emergence of nevirapine resistance in cell culture was \nnot altered when selection included nevirapine in combination with several other NNRTIs.\n\nGenotypic analysis of isolates from antiretroviral na\u00efve patients experiencing virologic failure (n=71) \nreceiving nevirapine once daily (n=25) or twice daily (n=46) in combination with lamivudine and \nstavudine for 48 weeks showed that isolates from 8/25 and 23/46 patients, respectively, contained one \nor more of the following NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions:\nY181C, K101E, G190A/S, K103N, V106A/M, V108I, Y188C/L, A98G, F227L and M230L.\n\nCross-resistance\n\nRapid emergence of HIV-strains which are cross-resistant to NNRTIs has been observed in vitro. \nCross resistance to delavirdine and efavirenz is expected after virologic failure with nevirapine. \nDepending on resistance testing results, an etravirine-containing regimen may be used subsequently. \nCross-resistance between nevirapine and either HIV protease inhibitors, HIV integrase inhibitors or \nHIV entry inhibitors is unlikely because the enzyme targets involved are different. Similarly the \npotential for cross-resistance between nevirapine and NRTIs is low because the molecules have \ndifferent binding sites on the reverse transcriptase. \n\nClinical results\n\nViramune has been evaluated in both treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients.\n\nStudies in treatment-na\u00efve patients\n\n2NN study\n\nThe double non-nucleoside study 2 NN was a randomised, open-label, multicentre prospective study \ncomparing the NNRTIs nevirapine, efavirenz and both medicinal products given together. \n\n1,216 antiretroviral-therapy na\u00efve patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA > 5,000 copies/ml at baseline \nwere assigned to Viramune 400 mg once daily, Viramune 200 mg twice daily, efavirenz 600 mg once \ndaily, or Viramune (400 mg) and efavirenz (800 mg) once daily, plus stavudine and lamivudine for 48 \nweeks. \n\n\n\n46\n\nThe primary endpoint, treatment failure, was defined as less than 1 log10 decline in plasma HIV-1 \nRNA in the first 12 weeks, or two consecutive measurements of more than 50 copies/ ml from week \n24 onwards, or disease progression. \n\nMedian age was 34 years and about 64 % were male patients, median CD4 cell count was 170 and 190 \ncells per mm3 in the Viramune twice daily and efavirenz groups, respectively. There were no \nsignificant differences in demographic and baseline characteristics between the treatment groups. \n\nThe predetermined primary efficacy comparison was between the Viramune twice daily and the \nefavirenz treatment groups. \n\nThe nevirapine twice daily regimen and the efavirenz regimen were not significantly different (p= \n0.091) in terms of efficacy as measured by treatment failure, or any component of treatment failure \nincluding virological failure.\nThe simultaneous use of nevirapine (400 mg) plus efavirenz (800 mg) was associated with the highest \nfrequency of clinical adverse events and with the highest rate of treatment failure (53.1 %). As the\nregimen of nevirapine plus efavirenz did not have additional efficacy and caused more adverse events \nthan each medicinal product separately, this regimen is not recommended.\n\nTwenty per cent of patients assigned to nevirapine twice daily and 18% of patients assigned to \nefavirenz had at least one grade 3 or 4 clinical adverse event. Clinical hepatitis reported as clinical \nadverse event occurred in 10 (2.6 %) and 2 (0.5 %) patients in the nevirapine twice daily and efavirenz \ngroups respectively. The proportion of patients with at least one grade 3 or 4 liver-associated \nlaboratory toxicity was 8.3 % for nevirapine twice daily and 4.5 % for efavirenz. Of the patients with \ngrade 3 or 4 liver-associated laboratory toxicity, the proportions coinfected with hepatitis B or \nhepatitis C virus were 6.7 % and 20.0 % in the nevirapine twice daily group, 5.6 % and 11.1 % in the \nefavirenz group.\n\n2NN Three-year follow-up-study\n\nThis is a retrospective multicentre study comparing the 3-year antiviral efficacy of Viramune and \nefavirenz in combination with stavudine and lamivudine in 2NN patients from week 49 to week 144. \nPatients who participated in the 2NN study and were still under active follow-up at week 48 when the \nstudy closed and were still being treated at the study clinic, were asked to participate in this study. \nPrimary study endpoints (percentage of patients with treatment failures) and secondary study \nendpoints as well as backbone therapy were similar to the original 2NN study. \n\nA durable response to Viramune for at least three years was documented in this study, and \nequivalence within a 10 % range was demonstrated between Viramune 200 mg twice daily and \nefavirenz with respect to treatment failure. Both, the primary (p = 0.92) and secondary endpoints \nshowed no statistically significant differences between efavirenz and Viramune 200 mg twice daily.\n\nStudies in treatment-experienced patients\n\nNEFA study\n\nThe NEFA study is a controlled prospective randomised study which evaluated treatment options for \npatients who switch from protease inhibitor (PI) based regimen with undetectable load to either \nViramune, efavirenz or abacavir.\nThe study randomly assigned 460 adults who were taking two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase \ninhibitors and at least one PI and whose plasma HIV-1 RNA levels had been less than 200 c/ml for at \nleast the previous six months to switch from the PI to Viramune (155 patients), efavirenz (156), or \nabacavir (149).\nThe primary study endpoint was death, progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or an \nincrease in HIV-1 RNA levels to 200 copies or more per millilitre. \nAt 12 months, the Kaplan\u2013Meier estimates of the likelihood of reaching the endpoint were 10 % in the \n\n\n\n47\n\nViramune group, 6 % in the efavirenz group, and 13 percent in the abacavir group (P=0.10 according \nto an intention-to-treat analysis). \n\nThe overall incidence of adverse events was significantly lower (61 patients, or 41 %) in the abacavir \ngroup than in the nevirapine group (83 patients, or 54 %) or the efavirenz group (89 patients, or 57 %). \nSignificantly fewer patients in the abacavir group (9 patients, or 6 %) than in the nevirapine group (26 \npatients, or 17 %) or the efavirenz group (27 patients, or 17 %) discontinued the medicinal product\nbecause of adverse events.\n\nPerinatal Transmission\n\nNumerous studies have been performed examining the use of Viramune in regards to perinatal \ntransmission, most notably HIVNET 012. This study demonstrated a significant reduction in \ntransmission using single dose nevirapine (13.1 % (n = 310) in the Viramune group, versus 25.1 % (n \n= 308) in the ultra-short zidovudine group (p = 0.00063)). Monotherapy with Viramune has been \nassociated with the development of NNRTI resistance. Single dose nevirapine in mothers or infants \nmay lead to reduced efficacy if an HIV treatment regimen using nevirapine is later instituted within 6 \nmonths or less in these patients. Combination of other antiretrovirals with single-dose nevirapine \nattenuates the emergence of nevirapine resistance. Where other antiretroviral medicines are accessible, \nthe single dose Viramune regimen should be combined with additional effective antiretroviral \nmedicines (as recommended in internationally recognized guidelines).\n\nThe clinical relevance of these data in European populations has not been established. Furthermore, in \nthe case Viramune is used as single dose to prevent vertical transmission of HIV-1 infection, the risk \nof hepatotoxicity in mother and child cannot be excluded. \n\nPaediatric population\nResults of a 48-week analysis of the South African study BI 1100.1368 confirmed that the 4/7 mg/kg \nand 150 mg/m2 nevirapine dose groups were well tolerated and effective in treating antiretroviral \nnaive paediatric patients. A marked improvement in the CD4+ cell percent was observed through \nWeek 48 for both dose groups. Also, both dosing regimens were effective in reducing the viral load. In \nthis 48-week study no unexpected safety findings were observed in either dosing group.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nViramune tablets and oral suspension have been shown to be comparably bioavailable and \ninterchangeable at doses up to 200 mg.\n\nAbsorption: Nevirapine is readily absorbed (> 90 %) after oral administration in healthy volunteers \nand in adults with HIV-1 infection. Absolute bioavailability in 12 healthy adults following single-dose \nadministration was 93 \uf0b1 9 % (mean SD) for a 50 mg tablet and 91 \uf0b1 8% for an oral solution. Peak \nplasma nevirapine concentrations of 2 \uf0b1 0.4 \u00b5g/ml (7.5 \u00b5M) were attained by 4 hours following a \nsingle 200 mg dose. Following multiple doses, nevirapine peak concentrations appear to increase \nlinearly in the dose range of 200 to 400 mg/day. Data reported in the literature from 20 HIV-infected\npatients suggest a steady state Cmax of 5.74 \u00b5g/ml (5.00-7.44) and Cmin of 3.73 \u00b5g/ml (3.20-5.08) with \nan AUC of 109.0 h*\u00b5g/ml (96.0-143.5) in patients taking 200 mg of nevirapine bid. Other published \ndata support these conclusions. Long-term efficacy appears to be most likely in patients whose \nnevirapine trough levels exceed 3.5 \u00b5g/ml. \n\nDistribution: Nevirapine is lipophilic and is essentially nonionized at physiologic pH. Following \nintravenous administration to healthy adults, the volume of distribution (Vdss) of nevirapine was 1.21 \n\uf0b1 0.09 l/kg, suggesting that nevirapine is widely distributed in humans. Nevirapine readily crosses the \nplacenta and is found in breast milk. Nevirapine is about 60% bound to plasma proteins in the plasma \nconcentration range of 1-10 \u00b5g/ml. Nevirapine concentrations in human cerebrospinal fluid (n = 6) \nwere 45 % (\uf0b1 5 %) of the concentrations in plasma; this ratio is approximately equal to the fraction not \nbound to plasma protein.\n\n\n\n48\n\nBiotransformation and elimination: In vivo studies in humans and in vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes have shown that nevirapine is extensively biotransformed via cytochrome P450 \n(oxidative) metabolism to several hydroxylated metabolites. In vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes suggest that oxidative metabolism of nevirapine is mediated primarily by cytochrome \nP450 isozymes from the CYP3A family, although other isozymes may have a secondary role. In a \nmass balance/excretion study in eight healthy male volunteers dosed to steady state with nevirapine \n200 mg given twice daily followed by a single 50 mg dose of 14C-nevirapine, approximately 91.4 \uf0b1\n10.5 % of the radiolabelled dose was recovered, with urine (81.3 \uf0b1 11.1 %) representing the primary \nroute of excretion compared to faeces (10.1 \uf0b1 1.5 %). Greater than 80 % of the radioactivity in urine \nwas made up of glucuronide conjugates of hydroxylated metabolites. Thus cytochrome P450 \nmetabolism, glucuronide conjugation, and urinary excretion of glucuronidated metabolites represent \nthe primary route of nevirapine biotransformation and elimination in humans. Only a small fraction \n(< 5 %) of the radioactivity in urine (representing < 3 % of the total dose) was made up of parent \ncompound; therefore, renal excretion plays a minor role in elimination of the parent compound.\n\nNevirapine has been shown to be an inducer of hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic enzymes. The \npharmacokinetics of autoinduction is characterized by an approximately 1.5 to 2 fold increase in the \napparent oral clearance of nevirapine as treatment continues from a single dose to two-to-four weeks \nof dosing with 200-400 mg/day. Autoinduction also results in a corresponding decrease in the terminal \nphase half-life of nevirapine in plasma from approximately 45 hours (single dose) to approximately \n25-30 hours following multiple dosing with 200-400 mg/day.\n\nRenal impairment: The single-dose pharmacokinetics of nevirapine has been compared in 23 patients \nwith either mild (50 \uf0a3 CLcr \uf03c 80 ml/min), moderate (30 \uf0a3 CLcr \uf03c 50 ml/min) or severe renal \ndysfunction (CLcr \uf03c 30 ml/min), renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring \ndialysis, and 8 patients with normal renal function (CLcr \uf03e 80 ml/min). Renal impairment (mild, \nmoderate and severe) resulted in no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine. \nHowever, patients with ESRD requiring dialysis exhibited a 43.5 % reduction in nevirapine AUC over \na one-week exposure period. There was also accumulation of nevirapine hydroxy-metabolites in \nplasma. The results suggest that supplementing nevirapine therapy with an additional 200 mg dose of \nViramune following each dialysis treatment would help offset the effects of dialysis on nevirapine \nclearance. Otherwise patients with CLcr \uf0b3 20 ml/min do not require an adjustment in nevirapine\ndosing. \n\nHepatic impairment: A steady state study comparing 46 patients with \nmild (n=17: Ishak Score 1-2), \nmoderate (n=20; Ishak Score 3-4), \nor severe (n=9; Ishak Score 5-6, Child-Pugh A in 8 pts., for 1 Child-Pugh score not applicable) \nliver fibrosis as a measure of hepatic impairment was conducted. \n\nThe patients studied were receiving antiretroviral therapy containing Viramune 200 mg twice daily for \nat least 6 weeks prior to pharmacokinetic sampling, with a median duration of therapy of 3.4 years. In \nthis study, the multiple dose pharmacokinetic disposition of nevirapine and the five oxidative \nmetabolites were not altered.  \n\nHowever, approximately 15 % of these patients with hepatic fibrosis had nevirapine trough \nconcentrations above 9,000 ng/ml (2 fold the usual mean trough). Patients with hepatic impairment \nshould be monitored carefully for evidence of medicinal product induced toxicity.\n\nIn a 200 mg nevirapine single dose pharmacokinetic study of HIV-negative patients with mild and \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, n=6; Child-Pugh B, n=4), a significant increase in the \nAUC of nevirapine was observed in one Child-Pugh B patient with ascites suggesting that patients \nwith worsening hepatic function and ascites may be at risk of accumulating nevirapine in the systemic \ncirculation. Because nevirapine induces its own metabolism with multiple dosing, this single dose \nstudy may not reflect the impact of hepatic impairment on multiple dose pharmacokinetics (see section \n\n\n\n49\n\n4.4).\n\nGender and elderly\nIn the multinational 2NN study, a population pharmacokinetic substudy of 1,077 patients was \nperformed that included 391 females. Female patients showed a 13.8 % lower clearance of nevirapine \nthan did male patients. This difference is not considered clinically relevant. Since neither body weight \nnor Body Mass Index (BMI) had influence on the clearance of nevirapine, the effect of gender cannot \nbe explained by body size. Nevirapine pharmacokinetics in HIV-1 infected adults does not appear to \nchange with age (range 19-68 years) or race (Black, Hispanic, or Caucasian). Nevirapine has not been \nspecifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.\n\nPaediatric population\nData concerning the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine have been derived from two major sources: a 48 \nweek paediatric study in South Africa (BI 1100.1368) involving 123 HIV-1 positive, antiretroviral \nna\u00efve patients aged 3 months to 16 years; and a consolidated analysis of five Paediatric AIDS Clinical \nTrials Group (PACTG) protocols comprising 495 patients aged 14 days to 19 years. \n\nPharmacokinetic data on 33 patients (age range 0.77 \u2013 13.7 years) in the intensive sampling group \ndemonstrated that clearance of nevirapine increased with increasing age in a manner consistent with \nincreasing body surface area. Dosing of nevirapine at 150 mg/m2 BID (after a two-week lead in at \n150 mg/m2 QD) produced geometric mean or mean trough nevirapine concentrations between 4-\n6 \u00b5g/ml (as targeted from adult data). In addition, the observed trough nevirapine concentrations were \ncomparable between the two methods.\n\nThe consolidated analysis of Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocols 245, 356, 366, \n377, and 403 allowed for the evaluation of paediatric patients less than 3 months of age (n=17) \nenrolled in these PACTG studies. The plasma nevirapine concentrations observed were within the \nrange observed in adults and the remainder of the paediatric population, but were more variable \nbetween patients, particularly in the second month of age.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans other than those observed in clinical studies \nbased on conventional studies of safety, pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. In \ncarcinogenicity studies, nevirapine induces hepatic tumours in rats and mice. These findings are most \nlikely related to nevirapine being a strong inducer of liver enzymes, and not due to a genotoxic mode \nof action. \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nViramune 100 mg prolonged-release tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach prolonged-release tablet contains 100 mg of nevirapine (as anhydrous). \n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach prolonged-release tablet contains 100 mg of lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nProlonged-release tablet\n\nYellow, round and biconvex prolonged-release tablets. The prolonged-release tablets are \napproximately 9 mm in diameter, debossed with V01 on one side and company symbol on the other \nside. The prolonged-release tablet should not be divided.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nViramune is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of \nHIV-1 infected adolescents and children three years and above and able to swallow tablets (see section \n4.2).\n\nProlonged-release tablets are not suitable for the 14-day lead-in phase for patients starting nevirapine. \nOther nevirapine formulations, such as immediate-release tablets or oral suspension should be used \n(see section 4.2). \n\nMost of the experience with Viramune is in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors (NRTIs). The choice of a subsequent therapy after Viramune should be based on clinical \nexperience and resistance testing (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nViramune should be administered by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV \ninfection.\n\nPosology\n\nPaediatric population\n\nChildren three years and older and adolescents\n\nViramune prolonged-release tablets may be dosed based on a patient\u2019s weight or body surface area \n(BSA). \n\nLead-in dosing with Viramune 200 mg tablets or Viramune 50 mg/5 ml oral suspension (first 14 days): \nAll paediatric patients should initiate therapy with 150 mg/m2 (calculated using the Mosteller formula) \n\n\n\n53\n\nor 4 mg/kg body weight administered once daily for the first 14 days. This lead-in period should be \nused because it has been found to lessen the frequency of rash. The lead-in period is not required if the \npatient is already on chronic Viramune 200 mg tablets or Viramune oral suspension twice daily \ntreatment.\n\nOnce daily maintenance dosing with Viramune prolonged-release tablets (after the lead-in): \nThe recommended oral doses for paediatric patients based upon their BSA are described in the table \nbelow. \n\nRecommended paediatric dosing by BSA after the lead-in period\nBSA (m2) Viramune prolonged-release tablets dose (mg)\n0.58-0.83 200 (2 x 100 mg)\n0.84-1.16 300 (3 x 100 mg)\n\u2265 1.17 400 (1 x 400 mg)\n\nMosteller Formula:   BSA (m2) =\n3600\n\n(kg) x Wt (cm)Height \n\nThe recommended oral doses for paediatric patients based upon their weight are described in the table \nbelow. The recommended weight-based paediatric dose is dependent upon the patient\u2019s age, with\ndifferent recommended doses for children from 3 to < 8 years of age and children 8 years or older. \n\nWeight Range (kg) for \npatients < 8 yrs of age \n\nWeight Range (kg) for patients \n\uf0b3 8 years of age \n\nViramune prolonged-release tablets \ndose (mg)\n\n12.5-17.8 17.9 to 31.2 200 (2 x 100 mg)\n\n17.9-24.9 31.3 to 43.7 300 (3 x 100 mg)\n\n25 and above 43.8 and above 400 (1 x 400 mg)\n\nAll paediatric patients should have their weight or BSA checked frequently to assess if dose \nadjustments are necessary.\n\nViramune should be combined with at least two additional antiretroviral agents. For concomitantly \nadministered therapy, the manufacturers recommended dose should be followed.\n\nIf a dose is recognized as missed within 12 hours of when it was due, the patient should take the\nmissed dose as soon as possible. If a dose is missed and it is more than 12 hours later, the patient \nshould only take the next dose at the usual time. \n\nFurthermore, an immediate-release oral suspension dosage form is available for all age groups for a \ntwice daily administration (please refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics).\n\nChildren less than three years old\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Viramune prolonged-release tablets in children aged less than 3 years has \nnot been established. No data are available.\n\nFor patients less than 3 years and for all other age groups, an immediate-release oral suspension \ndosage form is available (please refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics).\n\nDose management considerations\nThe total daily dose at any time during treatment should not exceed 400 mg for any patient. Patients \nshould be advised of the need to take Viramune every day as prescribed.\n\nPatients experiencing rash during the 14-day lead-in period should not initiate treatment with \nViramune prolonged-release tablets until the rash has resolved. The isolated rash should be closely \n\n\n\n54\n\nmonitored (see section 4.4). The once daily Viramune immediate-release lead-in dosing regimen \nshould not be continued beyond 28 days at which point in time an alternative treatment should be \nsought due to the possible risk of underexposure and resistance.\n\nPatients who interrupt nevirapine dosing for more than 7 days should restart the recommended dosing \nregimen using the two week lead-in period of Viramune immediate-release.\n\nThere are toxicities that require interruption of Viramune therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nElderly\nNevirapine has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.\n\nRenal impairment \nIn adult patients with renal dysfunction requiring dialysis an additional 200 mg dose of nevirapine \nimmediate-release following each dialysis treatment is recommended. Patients with CLcr \uf0b3 20 ml/min \ndo not require a dose adjustment, see section 5.2. In paediatric patients with renal dysfunction who are \nundergoing dialysis it is recommended that following each dialysis treatment patients receive an \nadditional dose of Viramune oral suspension or immediate-release tablets representing 50% of the \nrecommended daily dose of Viramune oral suspension or immediate-release tablets which would help \noffset the effects of dialysis on nevirapine clearance. Viramune prolonged-release tablets have not \nbeen studied in patients with renal dysfunction and Viramune immediate-release should be used.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNevirapine should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, see section \n4.3). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Viramune prolonged-release tablets have not been studied in patients with \nhepatic impairment and Viramune immediate-release should be used.\n\nMethod of administration\nThe prolonged-release tablets shall be taken with liquid, and should not be broken or chewed. \nViramune can be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nReadministration to patients who have required permanent discontinuation for severe rash, rash \naccompanied by constitutional symptoms, hypersensitivity reactions, or clinical hepatitis due to \nnevirapine\n\nPatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) or pre-treatment ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN \nuntil baseline ASAT/ALAT are stabilised < 5 ULN.\n\nReadministration to patients who previously had ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN during nevirapine therapy \nand had recurrence of liver function abnormalities upon readministration of nevirapine (see section \n4.4)\n\nCoadministration with herbal preparations containing St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to \nthe risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of nevirapine (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nViramune should only be used with at least two other antiretroviral agents (see section 5.1).\n\nViramune should not be used as the sole active antiretroviral, as monotherapy with any antiretroviral \nhas shown to result in viral resistance.\n\n\n\n55\n\nThe first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring of patients to disclose the potential appearance of severe and life-threatening skin \nreactions (including cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis \n(TEN)) and serious hepatitis/hepatic failure. The greatest risk of hepatic and skin reactions \noccurs in the first 6 weeks of therapy. However, the risk of any hepatic event continues past this \nperiod and monitoring should continue at frequent intervals. Female gender and higher CD4 \ncounts (>250/mm3 in adult females and >400/mm3 in adult males) at the initiation of nevirapine \ntherapy are associated with a greater risk of hepatic adverse reactions if the patient has \ndetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA - i.e. a concentration \u2265 50 copies/ml - at the initiation of \nnevirapine. As serious and life threatening hepatotoxicity has been observed in controlled and \nuncontrolled studies predominantly in patients with a plasma HIV-1 viral load of 50 copies/ml or \nhigher, nevirapine should not be initiated in adult females with CD4 cell counts greater than 250 \ncells/mm3 or in adult males with CD4 cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3, who have a \ndetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA unless the benefit outweighs the risk. \nIn some cases, hepatic injury has progressed despite discontinuation of treatment. Patients \ndeveloping signs or symptoms of hepatitis, severe skin reaction or hypersensitivity reactions \nmust discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately. Nevirapine must not be \nrestarted following severe hepatic, skin or hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.3).\n\nThe dose must be strictly adhered to, especially the 14-days lead-in period (see section 4.2).\n\nCutaneous reactions\n\nSevere and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have occurred in patients treated with \nnevirapine mainly during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity reactions characterised by rash, \nconstitutional findings and visceral involvement. Patients should be intensively monitored during the \nfirst 18 weeks of treatment. Patients should be closely monitored if an isolated rash occurs. Nevirapine \nmust be permanently discontinued in any patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by \nconstitutional symptoms (such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, muscle \nor joint aches, or general malaise), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis. Nevirapine must be permanently discontinued in any patient experiencing hypersensitivity \nreaction (characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms, plus visceral involvement, such as \nhepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction), see section 4.4.\n\nViramune administration above the recommended dose might increase the frequency and seriousness \nof skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.\n\nRhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with \nViramune use.\n\nConcomitant prednisone use (40 mg/day for the first 14 days of Viramune immediate-release \nadministration) has been shown not to decrease the incidence of nevirapine-associated rash, and may \nbe associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine \ntherapy. \n\nSome risk factors for developing serious cutaneous reactions have been identified; they include failure \nto follow the initial dosing during the lead-in period and a long delay between the initial symptoms \nand medical consultation. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash, whether \nreceiving nevirapine or non-nevirapine containing therapy.\n\nPatients should be instructed that a major toxicity of nevirapine is rash. They should be advised to \npromptly notify their physician of any rash and avoid delay between the initial symptoms and medical \nconsultation. The majority of rashes associated with nevirapine occur within the first 6 weeks of \n\n\n\n56\n\ninitiation of therapy. Therefore, patients should be monitored carefully for the appearance of rash \nduring this period. \n\nPatients should be instructed that they should not begin Viramune prolonged-release tablets until any \nrash that has occurred during the 14-day lead-in period of Viramune immediate-release has resolved. \nThe once daily dosing regimen of Viramune immediate-release should not be continued beyond 28 \ndays at which point in time an alternative treatment should be sought due to the possible risk of \nunderexposure and resistance.\n\nAny patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, \nblistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, muscle or joint aches, or general malaise should \ndiscontinue the medicinal product and immediately seek medical evaluation. In these patients \nnevirapine must not be restarted.\n\nIf patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, liver function tests should be \nperformed. Patients with moderate to severe elevations (ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN) should be \npermanently discontinued from nevirapine.\n\nIf a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as fever, \narthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, eosinophilia, \ngranulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction, nevirapine must be permanently stopped and not be re-\nintroduced (see section 4.3).\n\nHepatic reactions\n\nSevere and life-threatening hepatotoxicity, including fatal fulminant hepatitis, has occurred in patients \ntreated with nevirapine. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring. The risk of hepatic reactions is greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. However the risk \ncontinues past this period and monitoring should continue at frequent intervals throughout treatment. \n\nRhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with \nnevirapine use.\n\nIncreased ASAT or ALAT levels > 2.5 ULN and/or co-infection with hepatitis B and/or C at the start \nof antiretroviral therapy is associated with greater risk of hepatic adverse reactions during \nantiretroviral therapy in general, including nevirapine containing regimens. \n\nFemale gender and higher CD4 counts at the initiation of nevirapine therapy in treatment-na\u00efve \npatients is associated with increased risk of hepatic adverse reactions. In a retrospective analysis of \npooled clinical studies with Viramune immediate-release tablets, women had a three fold higher risk \nthan men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (5.8% versus 2.2 %), and treatment-\nna\u00efve patients of either gender with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma with higher CD4 counts at \ninitiation of nevirapine therapy were at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. \nPredominantly patients with a plasma HIV-1 viral load of 50 copies/ml or higher, women with CD4 \ncounts >250 cells/mm3 had a 12 fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse reactions compared to \nwomen with CD4 counts <250 cells/mm3 (11.0 % versus 0.9 %). An increased risk was observed in \nmen with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma and CD4 counts > 400 cells/mm3 (6.3 % versus 1.2 % for \nmen with CD4 counts <400 cells/mm3). This increased risk for toxicity based on CD4 count thresholds \nhas not been detected in patients with undetectable (i.e. < 50 copies/ml) plasma viral load.\n\nPatients should be informed that hepatic reactions are a major toxicity of nevirapine requiring close \nmonitoring during the first 18 weeks. They should be informed that occurrence of symptoms \nsuggestive of hepatitis should lead them to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical \nevaluation, which should include liver function tests.\n\n\n\n57\n\nLiver monitoring\n\nClinical chemistry tests, which include liver function tests, should be performed prior to initiating \nnevirapine therapy and at appropriate intervals during therapy.\n\nAbnormal liver function tests have been reported with nevirapine, some in the first few weeks of \ntherapy. \n\nAsymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes are frequently described and are not necessarily a \ncontraindication to use nevirapine. Asymptomatic GGT elevations are not a contraindication to \ncontinue therapy.\n\nMonitoring of hepatic tests should be done every two weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, at \nthe 3rd month and then regularly thereafter. Liver test monitoring should be performed if the patient \nexperiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity. \n\nFor patients already on a regimen of Viramune immediate-release twice daily who switch to Viramune \nprolonged-release once daily there is no need for a change in their monitoring schedule.\n\nIf ASAT or ALAT > 2.5 ULN before or during treatment, then liver tests should be monitored more \nfrequently during regular clinic visits. Nevirapine must not be administered to patients with pre-\ntreatment ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN until baseline ASAT/ALAT are stabilised < 5 ULN (see section \n4.3).\n\nPhysicians and patients should be vigilant for prodromal signs or findings of hepatitis, such as \nanorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, hepatomegaly or liver tenderness. Patients \nshould be instructed to seek medical attention promptly if these occur.\n\nIf ASAT or ALAT increase to > 5 ULN during treatment, nevirapine should be immediately \nstopped. If ASAT and ALAT return to baseline values and if the patient had no clinical signs or \nsymptoms of hepatitis, rash, constitutional symptoms or other findings suggestive of organ \ndysfunction, it may be possible to reintroduce nevirapine, on a case by case basis, at the starting \ndose regimen of Viramune immediate-release once daily for 14 days followed by Viramune \nprolonged-release tablets once daily. In these cases, more frequent liver monitoring is required. \nIf liver function abnormalities recur, nevirapine should be permanently discontinued.\n\nIf clinical hepatitis occurs, characterised by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, icterus AND laboratory \nfindings (such as moderate or severe liver function test abnormalities (excluding GGT)), \nnevirapine must be permanently stopped. Viramune must not be readministered to patients who \nhave required permanent discontinuation for clinical hepatitis due to nevirapine.\n\nLiver disease\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Viramune has not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders. Viramune is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, \nsee section 4.3). Pharmacokinetic results suggest caution should be exercised when nevirapine is \nadministered to patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh B). Patients with chronic \nhepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe \nand potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In the case of concomitant antiviral therapy for \nhepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products.\n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.\n\n\n\n58\n\nOther warnings\n\nPost-Exposure-Prophylaxis: Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure requiring transplantation, \nhas been reported in HIV-uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of Viramune in the setting of \npost-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. The use of Viramune has not been evaluated \nwithin a specific study on PEP, especially in term of treatment duration and therefore, is strongly \ndiscouraged.\n\nCombination therapy with nevirapine is not a curative treatment of patients infected with HIV-1; \npatients may continue to experience illnesses associated with advanced HIV-1 infection, including \nopportunistic infections.\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nHormonal methods of birth control other than Depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) should not \nbe used as the sole method of contraception in women taking Viramune, since nevirapine might lower \nthe plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. For this reason, and to reduce the risk of HIV \ntransmission, barrier contraception (e.g., condoms) is recommended. Additionally, when \npostmenopausal hormone therapy is used during administration of nevirapine, its therapeutic effect \nshould be monitored.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters:\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.\n\nIn clinical studies, Viramune has been associated with an increase in HDL- cholesterol and an overall \nimprovement in the total to HDL-cholesterol ratio. However, in the absence of specific studies, the \nclinical impact of these findings is not known. In addition, Viramune has not been shown to cause \nglucose disturbances.\n\nOsteonecrosis: Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, \nalcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis \nhave been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to \ncombination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they \nexperience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time \nof institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to \nasymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or \naggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or \nmonths of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or \nfocal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms \nshould be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 \ndisease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune \nreactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many \nmonths after initiation of treatment.\n\nThe available pharmacokinetic data suggest that the concomitant use of rifampicin and nevirapine is \nnot recommended. Furthermore, combining the following compounds with Viramune is not \nrecommended: efavirenz, ketoconazole, delavirdine, etravirine, rilpivirine, elvitegravir (in \n\n\n\n59\n\ncombination with cobicistat), atazanavir (in combination with ritonavir), boceprevir; fosamprenavir (if \nnot co-administered with low dose ritonavir) (see section 4.5).\n\nGranulocytopenia is commonly associated with zidovudine. Therefore, patients who receive\nnevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly and especially paediatric patients and patients who receive \nhigher zidovudine doses or patients with poor bone marrow reserve, in particular those with advanced \nHIV disease, have an increased risk of granulocytopenia. In such patients haematological parameters \nshould be carefully monitored.\n\nThere are no data on the interchangeability of 100 mg compared to 400 mg prolonged-release tablets \nand therefore, 100 mg prolonged-release tablets should not be taken by adults.\n\nLactose: Viramune prolonged-release tablets contain 400 mg of lactose per maximum recommended \ndaily dose.\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\n\nSome patients have reported the occurrence of remnants in faeces which may resemble intact tablets. \nBased on the data available so far, this has not been shown to affect the therapeutic response. If \npatients report such an event, reassurance should be obtained on the lack of impact on therapeutic \nresponse.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe following data were generated using the Viramune immediate-release tablets but are expected to \napply to all dosage forms.\n\nNevirapine is an inducer of CYP3A and potentially CYP2B6, with maximal induction occurring \nwithin 2-4 weeks of initiating multiple-dose therapy. \n\nCompounds using this metabolic pathway may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-\nadministered with nevirapine. Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effectiveness of P450 metabolised \nmedicinal products is recommended when taken in combination with nevirapine.\n\nThe absorption of nevirapine is not affected by food, antacids or medicinal products which are \nformulated with an alkaline buffering agent.\n\nThe interaction data is presented as geometric mean value with 90% confidence interval (90 % CI) \nwhenever these data were available.

No \n\nCaution should be exercised when \nco-administering telaprevir with \nnevirapine. \nIf co-administered with Viramune, an \nadjustment in the telaprevir dose \nshould be considered.\n\n\n\n66\n\ndrug-drug interaction study of \ntelaprevir with nevirapine has been \nconducted, however, interaction \nstudies of telaprevir with an NNRTI \nwith a similar metabolic pathway as \nnevirapine demonstrated reduced \nlevels of both. Results of DDI \nstudies of telaprevir with efavirenz \nindicate that caution should be \nexercised when co-administering \ntelaprevir with P450 inducers. \n\nTelbivudine Telbivudine is not a substrate, \ninducer or inhibitor of the \ncytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme \nsystem.

This is due \nto induction of medicinal product \nmetabolism enzymes and/or \ntransport proteins by St. John\u2019s \nWort.\n\nHerbal preparations containing St. \nJohn\u2018s Wort and Viramune must not \nbe co-administered (see section 4.3). \nIf a patient is already taking St. \nJohn\u2018s Wort check nevirapine and if \npossible viral levels and stop St. \nJohn\u2018s Wort. Nevirapine levels may \nincrease on stopping St. John\u2018s Wort. \nThe dose of Viramune may need \nadjusting. The inducing effect may \npersist for at least 2 weeks after \ncessation of treatment with St. John\u2018s \nWort.\n\nOther information:\n\nNevirapine metabolites: Studies using human liver microsomes indicated that the formation of \nnevirapine hydroxylated metabolites was not affected by the presence of dapsone, rifabutin, \nrifampicin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Ketoconazole and erythromycin significantly \ninhibited the formation of nevirapine hydroxylated metabolites.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females\nWomen of childbearing potential should not use oral contraceptives as the sole method for birth \ncontrol, since nevirapine might lower the plasma concentrations of these medicinal products (see \nsections 4.4 & 4.5).\n\nPregnancy\nCurrently available data on pregnant women indicate no malformative or foeto/ neonatal toxicity. To \ndate no other relevant epidemiological data are available. No observable teratogenicity was detected in \nreproductive studies performed in pregnant rats and rabbits (see section 5.3). There are no adequate \nand well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Caution should be exercised when prescribing \nnevirapine to pregnant women (see section 4.4). As hepatotoxicity is more frequent in women with \nCD4 cell counts above 250 cells/mm3 with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma (50 or more copies/ml), \nthese conditions should be taken in consideration on therapeutic decision (see section 4.4). There is \nnot enough evidence to substantiate that the absence of an increased risk for toxicity seen in pre-\ntreated women initiating nevirapine with an undetectable viral load (less than 50 copies/ml of HIV-1 \nin plasma) and CD4 cell counts above 250 cells/mm3 also applies to pregnant women. All the \nrandomised studies addressing this issue specifically excluded pregnant women, and pregnant women \nwere under-represented in cohort studies as well as in meta-analyses.\n\nBreast-feeding\nNevirapine readily crosses the placenta and is found in breast milk. \n\nIt is recommended that HIV-infected mothers do not breast-feed their infants to avoid risking postnatal \ntransmission of HIV and that mothers should discontinue breast-feeding if they are receiving \nnevirapine.\n\n\n\n68\n\nFertility\nIn reproductive toxicology studies, evidence of impaired fertility was seen in rats.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nThere are no specific studies about the ability to drive vehicles and use machinery. However, patients \nshould be advised that they may experience adverse reactions such as fatigue during treatment with \nnevirapine. Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or operating machinery. If \npatients experience fatigue they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating \nmachinery. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions related to Viramune prolonged-release therapy in \ntreatment na\u00efve patients (including lead-in phase with immediate-release) in clinical study 1100.1486 \n(VERxVE) were rash, nausea, liver function test abnormal, headache, fatigue, hepatitis, abdominal \npain, diarrhoea and pyrexia. There are no new adverse drug reactions for Viramune prolonged-release \ntablets that have not been previously identified for Viramune immediate-release tablets and oral \nsuspension.\n\nThe nevirapine postmarketing experience has shown that the most serious adverse reactions are \nStevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, serious hepatitis/hepatic failure, and drug \nreaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms \nsuch as fever, arthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, \neosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical \nperiod which requires close monitoring (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions which may be causally related to the administration of Viramune \nprolonged-release tablets have been reported. The frequencies given below are based on crude \nincidence rates of adverse reactions observed in the Viramune immediate-release (lead-in phase, table \n1) and Viramune prolonged-release (randomised-phase/maintenance phase, table 2) groups of clinical \nstudy 1100.1486 with 1,068 patients exposed to Viramune on a backbone of tenofovir/emtricitabine. \n\nFrequency is defined using the following convention: very common (\uf0b31/10); common (\uf0b31/100 to \n<1/10); uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000)\n\nTable 1: Lead-in phase with Viramune immediate-release\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\nUncommon granulocytopenia\nRare anaemia\n\nImmune system disorders\nUncommon hypersensitivity (incl. anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, urticaria), drug reaction\n\nwith eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, anaphylactic reaction\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon headache\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea\nUncommon vomiting\n\n\n\n69\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nUncommon jaundice, hepatitis fulminant (which may be fatal)\nRare hepatitis (incl. severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity)(0.09%)\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nCommon rash (6.7 %)\nUncommon Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (which may be fatal) \n\n(0.2 %), angioedema, urticaria\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nUncommon arthralgia, myalgia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon fatigue, pyrexia\n\nInvestigations\nUncommon liver function test abnormal (alanine aminotransferase increased; transaminases \n\nincreased; aspartate aminotransferase increased; gamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased; hepatic enzyme increased; hypertransaminasaemia), blood phosphorus \ndecreased, blood pressure increased\n\nTable 2: Maintenance phase of Viramune prolonged-release \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\nUncommon anaemia, granulocytopenia\n\nImmune system disorders\nUncommon hypersensitivity (incl. anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, urticaria), drug reaction\n\nwith eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, anaphylactic reaction\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon headache\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nCommon hepatitis (incl. severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity) (1.6 %)\nUncommon jaundice, hepatitis fulminant (which may be fatal)\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nCommon rash (5.7 %)\nUncommon Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (which may be fatal) \n\n(0.6 %), angioedema, urticaria\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nUncommon arthralgia, myalgia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon fatigue\nUncommon pyrexia\n\n\n\n70\n\nInvestigations\nCommon liver function test abnormal (alanine aminotransferase increased; transaminases \n\nincreased; aspartate aminotransferase increased; gamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased; hepatic enzyme increased; hypertransaminasaemia), blood phosphorus \ndecreased, blood pressure increased\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions were identified in other nevirapine studies or by post-marketing \nsurveillance but not observed in the randomised, controlled clinical study 1100.1486. \nAs granulocytopenia, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, anaphylactic reaction, \njaundice, hepatitis fulminant (which may be fatal), urticaria, decreased blood phosphorus and \nincreased blood pressure during the lead-in phase with Viramune immediate release were not seen in \nstudy 1100.1486 the frequency category was estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total \nnumber of patients exposed to nevirapine immediate-release in the lead-in phase of the randomised \ncontrolled clinical study 1100.1486 (n= 1,068).\nAccordingly, as anaemia, granulocytopenia, anaphylactic reaction, jaundice, Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (which may be fatal), angioedema, decreased blood phosphorus\nand increased blood pressure during maintenance phase with Viramune prolonged-release tablets were \nnot seen in study 1100.1486 the frequency category was estimated from a statistical calculation based \non the total number of patients exposed to nevirapine prolonged-release in the maintenance phase of \nthe randomised controlled clinical study 1100.1486 (n= 505).\n\nMetabolic parameters\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4)\n\nThe following adverse reactions have also been reported when nevirapine has been used in \ncombination with other anti-retroviral agents: pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy and \nthrombocytopaenia. These adverse reactions are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents \nand may be expected to occur when nevirapine is used in combination with other agents; however it is \nunlikely that these adverse reactions are due to nevirapine treatment. Hepatic-renal failure syndromes \nhave been reported rarely.\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissues\n\nThe most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, \nmaculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face \nand extremities. Hypersensitivity (incl. anaphylactic reaction, angioedema and urticaria) has been \nreported. Rashes occur alone or in the context of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \nsymptoms, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, myalgia and \nlympadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and \nrenal dysfunction.\n\nSevere and life-threatening skin reactions have occurred in patients treated with nevirapine, including \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Fatal cases of SJS, TEN and \ndrug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported. The majority of severe \n\n\n\n71\n\nrashes occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment and some required hospitalisation, with one \npatient requiring surgical intervention (see section 4.4). \n\nIn study 1100.1486 (VERxVE) antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients received a lead-in dose of Viramune \n200 mg immediate-release once daily for 14 days (n=1068) and then were randomised to receive either \nViramune 200 mg immediate-release twice daily or Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release once daily. \nAll patients received tenofovir + emtricitabine as background therapy. Safety data included all the \npatient visits up to the point in time when the last patient completed 144 weeks in the trial. This also \nincludes safety data for patient visits in the post-week 144 open label extension (which patients in \neither treatment group who completed the 144 week blinded phase could enter). Severe or life-\nthreatening rash considered related to nevirapine treatment occurred in 1.1 % of patients during the \nlead-in phase with Viramune immediate-release. Severe rash occurred in 1.4 % and 0.2 % of the \nViramune immediate-release and Viramune prolonged-release groups respectively during the \nrandomised phase. No life-threatening (Grade 4) rash events considered related to Viramune were \nreported during the randomised phase of this study. Six cases of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome were \nreported in the study; all but one occurred within the first 30 days of nevirapine treatment. \n\nIn study 1100.1526 (TRANxITION) patients on Viramune 200 mg immediate-release twice daily \ntreatment for at least 18 weeks were randomised to either receive Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release \nonce daily (n=295) or remain on their Viramune immediate-release treatment (n=148). In this study, \nno Grade 3 or 4 rash was observed in either treatment group.\n\nHepato-biliary\n\nThe most frequently observed laboratory test abnormalities are elevations in liver function tests \n(LFTs), including ALAT, ASAT, GGT, total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Asymptomatic \nelevations of GGT levels are the most frequent. Cases of jaundice have been reported. Cases of \nhepatitis (severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity, including fatal fulminant hepatitis) have been \nreported in patients treated with nevirapine. The best predictor of a serious hepatic event was elevated \nbaseline liver function tests. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring (see section 4.4).\n\nIn study 1100.1486 (VERxVE) treatment-na\u00efve patients received a lead-in dose of Viramune 200 mg \nimmediate-release once daily for 14 days and then were randomised to receive either Viramune \n200 mg immediate-release twice daily or Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release once daily. All patients \nreceived tenofovir + emtricitabine as background therapy. Patients were enrolled with CD4 counts \n<250 cells/mm3 for women and <400 cells/mm3 for men. Data on potential symptoms of hepatic \nevents were prospectively collected in this study. The safety data include all patient visits up to the \ntime of the last patient\u2019s completion of study week 144. The incidence of symptomatic hepatic events \nduring the Viramune immediate-release lead-in phase was 0.5 %. After the lead-in period the \nincidence of symptomatic hepatic events was 2.4 % in the Viramune immediate-release group and \n1.6% in the Viramune prolonged-release group. Overall, there was a comparable incidence of \nsymptomatic hepatic events among men and women enrolled in VERxVE.\n\nIn study 1100.1526 (TRANxITION) no Grade 3 or 4 clinical hepatic events were observed in either \ntreatment group.\n\nPaediatric population\nBased on clinical study experience with Viramune immediate-release tablets and oral suspension of \n361 paediatric patients the majority of which received combination treatment with ZDV or/and ddI,\nthe most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine were similar to those observed in \nadults. Granulocytopenia was more frequently observed in children. In an open-label clinical study\n(ACTG 180) granulocytopenia assessed as medicinal product-related occurred in 5/37 (13.5 %) of \npatients. In ACTG 245, a double-blind placebo controlled study, the frequency of serious medicinal \nproduct-related granulocytopenia was 5/305 (1.6 %). Isolated cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or \nStevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome have been reported in this population. \n\n\n\n72\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no known antidote for nevirapine overdose. Cases of overdose with Viramune immediate-\nrelease at doses ranging from 800 to 6,000 mg per day for up to 15 days have been reported. Patients \nhave experienced oedema, erythema nodosum, fatigue, fever, headache, insomnia, nausea, pulmonary \ninfiltrates, rash, vertigo, vomiting, increase in transaminases and weight decrease. All of these effects \nsubsided following discontinuation of nevirapine. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nOne case of massive accidental overdose in a newborn was reported. The ingested dose was 40 times \nthe recommended dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Mild isolated neutropenia and hyperlactataemia was observed, \nwhich spontaneously disappeared within one week without any clinical complications. One year later, \nthe child\u2019s development remained normal. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors, ATC code J05AG01.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nNevirapine is a NNRTI of HIV-1. Nevirapine is a non-competitive inhibitor of the HIV-1 reverse \ntranscriptase, but it does not have a biologically significant inhibitory effect on the HIV-2 reverse \ntranscriptase or on eukaryotic DNA polymerases \uf061, \uf062, \uf067, or \uf064.\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\n\nNevirapine had a median EC50 value (50 % inhibitory concentration) of 63 nM against a panel of \ngroup M HIV-1 isolates from clades A, B, C, D, F, G, and H, and circulating recombinant forms \n(CRF), CRF01_AE, CRF02_AG and CRF12_BF replicating in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. In \na panel of 2,923 predominantly subtype B HIV-1 clinical isolates, the mean EC50 value was 90nM. \nSimilar EC50 values are obtained when the antiviral activity of nevirapine is measured in peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells, monocyte derived macrophages or lymphoblastoid cell line. Nevirapine had \nno antiviral activity in cell culture against group O HIV-1 isolates or HIV-2 isolates.\n\nNevirapine in combination with efavirenz exhibited a strong antagonistic anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro\n(see section 4.5) and was additive to antagonistic with the protease inhibitor ritonavir or the fusion \ninhibitor enfuvirtide. Nevirapine exhibited additive to synergistic anti-HIV-1 activity in combination \nwith the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, saquinavir and tipranavir, and \nthe NRTIs abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine. The \nanti-HIV-1 activity of nevirapine was antagonized by the anti-HBV medicinal product adefovir and by \nthe anti-HCV medicinal product ribavirin in vitro.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n73\n\nResistance\n\nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility (100-250-fold) to nevirapine emerge in cell culture. \nGenotypic analysis showed mutations in the HIV-1 RT gene Y181C and/or V106A depending upon \nthe virus strain and cell line employed. Time to emergence of nevirapine resistance in cell culture was \nnot altered when selection included nevirapine in combination with several other NNRTIs.\n\nGenotypic analysis of isolates from antiretroviral na\u00efve patients experiencing virologic failure (n=71) \nreceiving nevirapine once daily (n=25) or twice daily (n=46) in combination with lamivudine and \nstavudine for 48 weeks showed that isolates from 8/25 and 23/46 patients, respectively, contained one \nor more of the following NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions: Y181C, K101E, G190A/S, \nK103N, V106A/M, V108I, Y188C/L, A98G, F227L and M230L.\n\nGenotypic analysis was performed on isolates from 86 antiretroviral na\u00efve patients who discontinued \nthe VERxVE study (1100.1486) after experiencing virologic failure (rebound, partial response) or due \nto an adverse event or who had transient increase in viral load during the course of the study. The \nanalysis of these samples of patients receiving Viramune immediate-release twice daily or Viramune\nprolonged-release once daily in combination with tenofovir and emtricitabine showed that isolates \nfrom 50 patients contained resistance mutations expected with a nevirapine-based regimen. Of these \n50 patients, 28 developed resistance to efavirenz and 39 developed resistance to etravirine (the most \nfrequently emergent resistance mutation being Y181C). There were no differences based on the \nformulation taken (immediate-release twice daily or prolonged-release once daily).\n\nThe observed mutations at failure were those expected with a nevirapine-based regimen. Two new \nsubstitutions on codons previously associated with nevirapine resistance were observed: one patient \nwith Y181I in the Viramune prolonged-release group and one patient with Y188N in the Viramune\nimmediate-release group; resistance to nevirapine was confirmed by phenotype.\n\nCross-resistance\n\nRapid emergence of HIV-strains which are cross-resistant to NNRTIs has been observed in vitro. \nCross resistance to delavirdine and efavirenz is expected after virologic failure with nevirapine. \nDepending on resistance testing results, an etravirine-containing regimen may be used subsequently. \nCross-resistance between nevirapine and either HIV protease inhibitors, HIV integrase inhibitors or \nHIV entry inhibitors is unlikely because the enzyme targets involved are different. Similarly the \npotential for cross-resistance between nevirapine and NRTIs is low because the molecules have \ndifferent binding sites on the reverse transcriptase.\n\nClinical results\n\nViramune has been evaluated in both treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients. \n\nClinical studies with prolonged-release tablets\n\nThe clinical efficacy of Viramune prolonged-release is based on 48-week data from arandomised, \ndouble-blind, double-dummy phase 3 study (VERxVE \u2013 study 1100.1486) in treatment-na\u00efve patients \nand on 24-week data from a randomised, open-label study in patients who transitioned from Viramune\nimmediate-release tablets administered twice daily to Viramune prolonged-release tablets \nadministered once daily (TRANxITION \u2013 study 1100.1526). \n\n\n\n74\n\nTreatment-na\u00efve patients\nVERxVE (study 1100.1486) is a phase 3 study in which treatment-na\u00efve patients received Viramune\n200 mg immediate-release once daily for 14 days and then were randomised to receive either \nViramune 200 mg immediate-release twice daily or Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release once daily. \nAll patients received tenofovir + emtricitabine as background therapy. Randomisation was stratified \nby screening HIV-1 RNA level (<100,000 copies/ml and >100,000 copies/ml).

In this open-label study, \n443 patients already on an antiviral regimen containing Viramune 200 mg immediate-release twice \ndaily with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to Viramune 400 mg prolonged-\nrelease once daily or Viramune 200 mg immediate-release twice daily. Approximately half of the \npatients had tenofovir + emtricitabine as their background therapy, with the remaining patients \nreceiving abacavir sulfate + lamivudine or zidovudine + lamivudine. Approximately half of the \npatients had at least 3 years of prior exposure to Viramune immediate-release prior to entering study\n1100.1526. \n\nAt 24 weeks after randomisation in the TRANxITION study, 92.6 % and 93.6 % of patients receiving \nViramune 200 mg immediate-release twice daily or Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release once daily, \nrespectively, continued to have HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml.\n\nPaediatric population\nResults of a 48-week analysis of the South African study BI 1100.1368 confirmed that the 4/7 mg/kg \nand 150 mg/m2 nevirapine dose groups were well tolerated and effective in treating antiretroviral naive \npaediatric patients. A marked improvement in the CD4+ cell percent was observed through Week 48 \nfor both dose groups. Also, both dosing regimens were effective in reducing the viral load. In this 48-\nweek study no unexpected safety findings were observed in either dosing group.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThere are no data available on interchangeability for 400 mg prolonged-release tablets and 100 mg \nprolonged-release tablets.\n\nAbsorption:\nThe pharmacokinetics of nevirapine has been studied in a single dose study (study 1100.1485) of \nViramune prolonged-release in 17 healthy volunteers. The relative bioavailability of nevirapine when \ndosed as one 400 mg Viramune prolonged-release tablet, relative to two 200 mg Viramune immediate-\nrelease tablets, was approximately 75 %. The mean peak plasma concentration of nevirapine was \n2,060 ng/ml measured at a mean 24.5 hours after administration of 400 mg Viramune prolonged-\nrelease tablets.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Viramune prolonged-release has also been studied in a multiple dose \npharmacokinetics study (study 1100.1489) in 24 HIV-1 infected patients who switched from chronic \nViramune immediate-release therapy to Viramune prolonged-release. The nevirapine AUC0-24,ss and \n\n\n\n77\n\nCmin,ss measured after 19 days of fasted dosing of Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release tablets once \ndaily were approximately 80 % and 90 %, respectively, of the AUC0-24,ss and Cmin,ss measured when \npatients were dosed with Viramune 200 mg immediate-release tablets twice daily. The geometric \nmean nevirapine Cmin,ss was 2,770 ng/ml.\n\nWhen Viramune prolonged-release was dosed with a high fat meal, the nevirapine AUC0-24,ss and Cmin,ss\nwere approximately 94 % and 98 %, respectively, of the AUC0-24,ss and Cmin,ss measured when patients \nwere dosed with Viramune immediate-release tablets. The difference in nevirapine pharmacokinetics \nobserved when Viramune prolonged-release tablets are dosed under fasted or fed conditions is not \nconsidered clinically relevant. Viramune prolonged-release tablets can be taken with or without food.\n\nSome patients have reported the occurrence of remnants in faeces which may resemble intact tablets. \nBased on the data available so far, this has not been shown to affect the therapeutic response. If \npatients report such an event, reassurance should be obtained on the lack of impact on therapeutic \nresponse.\n\nDistribution: Nevirapine is lipophilic and is essentially nonionized at physiologic pH. Following \nintravenous administration to healthy adults, the volume of distribution (Vdss) of nevirapine was 1.21 \n\uf0b1 0.09 l/kg, suggesting that nevirapine is widely distributed in humans. Nevirapine readily crosses the \nplacenta and is found in breast milk. Nevirapine is about 60 % bound to plasma proteins in the plasma \nconcentration range of 1-10 \u00b5g/ml. Nevirapine concentrations in human cerebrospinal fluid (n = 6) \nwere 45 % (\uf0b1 5 %) of the concentrations in plasma; this ratio is approximately equal to the fraction not \nbound to plasma protein.\n\nBiotransformation and elimination: In vivo studies in humans and in vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes have shown that nevirapine is extensively biotransformed via cytochrome P450 \n(oxidative) metabolism to several hydroxylated metabolites. In vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes suggest that oxidative metabolism of nevirapine is mediated primarily by cytochrome \nP450 isozymes from the CYP3A family, although other isozymes may have a secondary role. In a \nmass balance/excretion study in eight healthy male volunteers dosed to steady state with nevirapine \n200 mg given twice daily followed by a single 50 mg dose of 14C-nevirapine, approximately 91.4 \uf0b1\n10.5 % of the radiolabelled dose was recovered, with urine (81.3 \uf0b1 11.1 %) representing the primary \nroute of excretion compared to faeces (10.1 \uf0b1 1.5 %). Greater than 80 % of the radioactivity in urine \nwas made up of glucuronide conjugates of hydroxylated metabolites. Thus cytochrome P450 \nmetabolism, glucuronide conjugation, and urinary excretion of glucuronidated metabolites represent \nthe primary route of nevirapine biotransformation and elimination in humans. Only a small fraction (< \n5%) of the radioactivity in urine (representing < 3 % of the total dose) was made up of parent \ncompound; therefore, renal excretion plays a minor role in elimination of the parent compound.\n\nNevirapine has been shown to be an inducer of hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic enzymes. The \npharmacokinetics of autoinduction is characterised by an approximately 1.5 to 2 fold increase in the \napparent oral clearance of nevirapine as treatment continues from a single dose to two-to-four weeks \nof dosing with 200-400 mg/day. Autoinduction also results in a corresponding decrease in the terminal \nphase half-life of nevirapine in plasma from approximately 45 hours (single dose) to approximately \n25-30 hours following multiple dosing with 200-400 mg/day.\n\nRenal impairment: The single-dose pharmacokinetics of nevirapine immediate-release has been \ncompared in 23 patients with either mild (50 \uf0a3 CLcr \uf03c 80 ml/min), moderate (30 \uf0a3 CLcr \uf03c 50 ml/min) \nor severe renal dysfunction (CLcr \uf03c 30 ml/min), renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) \nrequiring dialysis, and 8 patients with normal renal function (CLcr \uf03e 80 ml/min). Renal impairment \n(mild, moderate and severe) resulted in no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine. \nHowever, patients with ESRD requiring dialysis exhibited a 43.5 % reduction in nevirapine AUC over \na one-week exposure period. There was also accumulation of nevirapine hydroxy-metabolites in \nplasma. The results suggest that supplementing nevirapine therapy for adults with an additional \n200 mg immediate-release tablet following each dialysis treatment would help offset the effects of \n\n\n\n78\n\ndialysis on nevirapine clearance. Otherwise patients with CLcr \uf0b3 20 ml/min do not require an \nadjustment in nevirapine dosing. In paediatric patients with renal dysfunction who are undergoing \ndialysis it is recommended following each dialysis treatment patients receive an additional dose of \nViramune oral suspension or immediate-release tablets representing 50 % of the recommended daily \ndose of Viramune oral suspension or immediate-release tablets, which would help offset the effects of \ndialysis on nevirapine clearance. Viramune prolonged-release tablets have not been studied in patients \nwith renal dysfunction and Viramune immediate-release should be used.\n\nHepatic impairment: A steady state study comparing 46 patients with \nmild (n=17: Ishak Score 1-2), \nmoderate (n=20; Ishak Score 3-4), \nor severe (n=9; Ishak Score 5-6, Child-Pugh A in 8 pts., for 1 Child-Pugh score not applicable) \nliver fibrosis as a measure of hepatic impairment was conducted. \n\nThe patients studied were receiving antiretroviral therapy containing Viramune 200 mg immediate-\nrelease tablets twice daily for at least 6 weeks prior to pharmacokinetic sampling, with a median \nduration of therapy of 3.4 years. In this study, the multiple dose pharmacokinetic disposition of \nnevirapine and the five oxidative metabolites were not altered.\n\nHowever, approximately 15 % of these patients with hepatic fibrosis had nevirapine trough \nconcentrations above 9,000 ng/ml (2 fold the usual mean trough). Patients with hepatic impairment \nshould be monitored carefully for evidence of medicinal product induced toxicity.\n\nIn a single dose pharmacokinetic study of 200 mg Viramune immediate-release tablets in \nHIV-negative patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, n=6; Child-Pugh B, \nn=4), a significant increase in the AUC of nevirapine was observed in one Child-Pugh B patient with \nascites suggesting that patients with worsening hepatic function and ascites may be at risk of \naccumulating nevirapine in the systemic circulation. Because nevirapine induces its own metabolism \nwith multiple dosing, this single dose study may not reflect the impact of hepatic impairment on \nmultiple dose pharmacokinetics (see section 4.4). Viramune prolonged-release tablets have not been \nevaluated in patients with hepatic impairment and Viramune immediate-release should be used.\n\nGender \nIn the multinational 2NN study with Viramune immediate-release, a population pharmacokinetic \nsubstudy of 1077 patients was performed that included 391 females. Female patients showed a 13.8 % \nlower clearance of nevirapine than did male patients. This difference is not considered clinically \nrelevant. Since neither body weight nor Body Mass Index (BMI) had influence on the clearance of \nnevirapine, the effect of gender cannot be explained by body size.\n\nThe effects of gender on the pharmacokinetics of Viramune prolonged-release have been investigated \nin study 1100.1486. Female patients tend to have higher (approximately 20 \u2013 30 %) trough \nconcentrations in both Viramune prolonged-release and Viramune immediate-release treatment \ngroups. \n\nElderly\nNevirapine pharmacokinetics in HIV-1 infected adults does not appear to change with age (range 18 -\n68 years). Nevirapine has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65. Black \npatients (n=80/group) in study 1100.1486 showed approximately 30 % higher trough concentrations \nthan Caucasian patients (250-325 patients/group) in both the Viramune immediate-release and \nViramune prolonged-release treatment groups over 48 weeks of treatment at 400 mg/day.\n\nPaediatric population\nData concerning the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine has been derived from two major sources: a 48 \nweek paediatric study in South Africa (BI 1100.1368) involving 123 HIV-1 positive, antiretroviral \nna\u00efve patients aged 3 months to 16 years; and a consolidated analysis of five Paediatric AIDS Clinical \nTrials Group (PACTG) protocols comprising 495 patients aged 14 days to 19 years. \n\n\n\n79\n\nPharmacokinetic data on 33 patients (age range 0.77 \u2013 13.7 years) in the intensive sampling group \ndemonstrated that clearance of nevirapine increased with increasing age in a manner consistent with \nincreasing body surface area. Dosing of nevirapine at 150 mg/m2 BID (after a two-week lead in at \n150 mg/m2 QD) produced geometric mean or mean trough nevirapine concentrations between 4-\n6 \u00b5g/ml (as targeted from adult data). In addition, the observed trough nevirapine concentrations were \ncomparable between the two methods.\n\nThe consolidated analysis of Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocols 245, 356, 366, \n377, and 403 allowed for the evaluation of paediatric patients less than 3 months of age (n=17) \nenrolled in these PACTG studies. The plasma nevirapine concentrations observed were within the \nrange observed in adults and the remainder of the paediatric population, but were more variable \nbetween patients, particularly in the second month of age.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Viramune prolonged-release was assessed in study 1100.1518. Eighty-five \npatients (3 to < 18 years) received weight or body surface area dose-adjusted Viramune immediate-\nrelease for a minimum of 18 weeks and then were switched to Viramune prolonged-release tablets (2 x \n100 mg, 3 x 100 mg or 1 x 400 mg once daily) in combination with other antiretrovirals for 10 days. \nThe observed geometric mean ratios of Viramune prolonged-release to Viramune immediate-release \nwere ~90 % for Cmin,ss and AUCss with 90 % confidence intervals within 80 %-125 %; the ratio for \nCmax,ss was lower and consistent with a once-daily prolonged-release dosage form. Geometric mean \nsteady-state plasma Viramune prolonged-release pre-dose trough concentrations were 3,880 ng/ml, \n3,310 ng/ml and 5,350 ng/ml in age groups 3 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years of age, \nrespectively. Overall, the exposure in children was similar to that observed in adults receiving \nViramune prolonged-release in study 1100.1486. \n\nIn single dose, parallel group bioavailability studies (studies 1100.1517 and 1100.1531), the Viramune \n50 and 100 mg prolonged-release tablets exhibited extended release characteristics of prolonged \nabsorption and lower maximal concentrations, similar to the findings when a 400 mg prolonged-\nrelease tablet was compared to the Viramune immediate-release 200 mg tablet. Dividing a 200 mg \ntotal dose into four 50 mg doses rather than two 100 mg doses produced a 7-11 % greater overall \nabsorption, but with comparable medicinal product release rates. The observed pharmacokinetic \ndifference between the 50 mg and 100 mg Viramune prolonged-release tablets is not clinically \nrelevant, and the 50 mg prolonged-release tablet can be used as an alternative to the slightly larger \n100 mg tablet.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans other than those observed in clinical studies \nbased on conventional studies of safety, pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. In \ncarcinogenicity studies, nevirapine induces hepatic tumours in rats and mice. These findings are most \nlikely related to nevirapine being a strong inducer of liver enzymes, and not due to a genotoxic mode \nof action. \n\n6.

DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT\n\nDetailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines \nAgency http://www.ema.europa.eu\n\n\n\n81\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nViramune 400 mg prolonged-release tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach prolonged-release tablet contains 400 mg of nevirapine (as anhydrous). \n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach prolonged-release tablet contains 400 mg of lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nProlonged-release tablet\n\nYellow, oval, biconvex prolonged-release tablets. The prolonged-release tablets are about 9.3 x \n19.1 mm, debossed with V04 on one side and the company symbol on the other side. The prolonged-\nrelease tablet should not be divided.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nViramune is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of \nHIV-1 infected adults, adolescents, and children three years and above and able to swallow tablets (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nProlonged-release tablets are not suitable for the 14-day lead-in phase for patients starting nevirapine. \nOther nevirapine formulations, such as immediate-release tablets or oral suspension should be used \n(see section 4.2). \n\nMost of the experience with Viramune is in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors (NRTIs). The choice of a subsequent therapy after Viramune should be based on clinical \nexperience and resistance testing (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nViramune should be administered by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV \ninfection.\n\nPosology\n\nAdults\nThe recommended dose of Viramune for patients initiating nevirapine therapy is one 200 mg \nimmediate-release tablet daily for the first 14 days (this lead-in period should be used because it has \nbeen found to lessen the frequency of rash), followed by one 400 mg prolonged-release tablet once \ndaily, in combination with at least two additional antiretroviral agents. \n\nPatients currently on a Viramune immediate-release twice daily regimen:\nPatients already on a regimen of Viramune immediate-release twice daily in combination with other \nantiretroviral agents can be switched to Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release tablets once daily in \n\n\n\n82\n\ncombination with other antiretroviral agents without a lead-in period of Viramune immediate-release.\n\nViramune should be combined with at least two additional antiretroviral agents. For concomitantly \nadministered therapy, the manufacturers recommended dose should be followed.\n\nIf a dose is recognized as missed within 12 hours of when it was due, the patient should take the \nmissed dose as soon as possible. If a dose is missed and it is more than 12 hours later, the patient \nshould only take the next dose at the usual time. \n\nPaediatric population\nChildren three years and older and adolescents\n\nAccording to paediatric dose recommendations Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release tablets can be \nalso taken by children, following the adult dosing schedule, if they \n\n\uf0b7 are \uf0b3 8 years of age and weigh 43.8 kg or more or\n\uf0b7 are < 8 years of age and weigh 25 kg or more or\n\uf0b7 have a body surface area of 1.17 m2 or above according to the Mosteller formula. \n\nFor paediatric patients aged 3 years and older, 100 mg prolonged-release tablets are available. \n\nChildren less than three years old\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Viramune prolonged-release tablets in children aged less than 3 years has \nnot been established. No data are available.\n\nFor patients less than 3 years and for all other age groups, an immediate-release oral suspension \ndosage form is available (please refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics).\n\nDose management considerations\nThe total daily dose at any time during treatment should not exceed 400 mg for any patient. Patients \nshould be advised of the need to take Viramune every day as prescribed.\n\nPatients experiencing rash during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day should not initiate \ntreatment with Viramune prolonged-release tablets until the rash has resolved. The isolated rash \nshould be closely monitored (see section 4.4). The 200 mg once daily Viramune immediate-release \nlead-in dosing regimen should not be continued beyond 28 days at which point in time an alternative \ntreatment should be sought due to the possible risk of underexposure and resistance.\n\nPatients who interrupt nevirapine dosing for more than 7 days should restart the recommended dosing \nregimen using the two week lead-in period of Viramune immediate-release.\n\nThere are toxicities that require interruption of Viramune therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nElderly\nNevirapine has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.\n\nRenal impairment \nIn adult patients with renal dysfunction requiring dialysis an additional 200 mg dose of nevirapine \nimmediate-release following each dialysis treatment is recommended. Patients with CLcr \uf0b3 20 ml/min \ndo not require a dose adjustment, see section 5.2. In paediatric patients with renal dysfunction who are \nundergoing dialysis it is recommended that following each dialysis treatment patients receive an \nadditional dose of Viramune oral suspension or immediate-release tablets representing 50 % of the \nrecommended daily dose of Viramune oral suspension or immediate-release tablets which would help \noffset the effects of dialysis on nevirapine clearance. Viramune prolonged-release tablets have not \nbeen studied in patients with renal dysfunction and Viramune immediate-release should be used.\n\n\n\n83\n\nHepatic impairment\nNevirapine should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, see section \n4.3). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Viramune prolonged-release tablets have not been studied in patients with \nhepatic impairment and Viramune immediate-release should be used.\n\nMethod of administration\nThe prolonged-release tablets shall be taken with liquid, and should not be broken or chewed. \nViramune can be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nReadministration to patients who have required permanent discontinuation for severe rash, rash \naccompanied by constitutional symptoms, hypersensitivity reactions, or clinical hepatitis due to \nnevirapine\n\nPatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) or pre-treatment ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN \nuntil baseline ASAT/ALAT are stabilised < 5 ULN\n\nReadministration to patients who previously had ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN during nevirapine therapy \nand had recurrence of liver function abnormalities upon readministration of nevirapine (see section \n4.4)\n\nCoadministration with herbal preparations containing St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to \nthe risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of nevirapine (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nViramune should only be used with at least two other antiretroviral agents (see section 5.1).\n\nViramune should not be used as the sole active antiretroviral, as monotherapy with any antiretroviral \nhas shown to result in viral resistance.\n\n\n\n84\n\nThe first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring of patients to disclose the potential appearance of severe and life-threatening skin \nreactions (including cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis \n(TEN)) and serious hepatitis/hepatic failure. The greatest risk of hepatic and skin reactions \noccurs in the first 6 weeks of therapy. However, the risk of any hepatic event continues past this \nperiod and monitoring should continue at frequent intervals. Female gender and higher CD4 \ncounts (>250/mm3 in adult females and >400/mm3 in adult males) at the initiation of nevirapine \ntherapy are associated with a greater risk of hepatic adverse reactions if the patient has \ndetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA - i.e. a concentration \u2265 50 copies/ml - at the initiation of \nnevirapine. As serious and life threatening hepatotoxicity has been observed in controlled and \nuncontrolled studies predominantly in patients with a plasma HIV-1 viral load of 50 copies/ml or \nhigher, nevirapine should not be initiated in adult females with CD4 cell counts greater than 250 \ncells/mm3 or in adult males with CD4 cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3, who have a \ndetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA unless the benefit outweighs the risk. \nIn some cases, hepatic injury has progressed despite discontinuation of treatment. Patients \ndeveloping signs or symptoms of hepatitis, severe skin reaction or hypersensitivity reactions \nmust discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately. Nevirapine must not be \nrestarted following severe hepatic, skin or hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.3).\n\nThe dose must be strictly adhered to, especially the 14-days lead-in period (see section 4.2).\n\nCutaneous reactions\n\nSevere and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have occurred in patients treated with \nnevirapine mainly during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity reactions characterised by rash, \nconstitutional findings and visceral involvement. Patients should be intensively monitored during the \nfirst 18 weeks of treatment. Patients should be closely monitored if an isolated rash occurs. Nevirapine \nmust be permanently discontinued in any patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by \nconstitutional symptoms (such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, muscle \nor joint aches, or general malaise), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis. Nevirapine must be permanently discontinued in any patient experiencing hypersensitivity \nreaction (characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms, plus visceral involvement, such as \nhepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction), see section 4.4.\n\nViramune administration above the recommended dose might increase the frequency and seriousness \nof skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.\n\nRhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with \nViramune use.\n\nConcomitant prednisone use (40 mg/day for the first 14 days of Viramune immediate-release \nadministration) has been shown not to decrease the incidence of nevirapine-associated rash, and may \nbe associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine \ntherapy. \n\nSome risk factors for developing serious cutaneous reactions have been identified; they include failure \nto follow the initial dosing of 200 mg daily during the lead-in period and a long delay between the \ninitial symptoms and medical consultation. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing \nrash, whether receiving nevirapine or non-nevirapine containing therapy.\n\n\n\n85\n\nPatients should be instructed that a major toxicity of nevirapine is rash. They should be advised to \npromptly notify their physician of any rash and avoid delay between the initial symptoms and medical \nconsultation. The majority of rashes associated with nevirapine occur within the first 6 weeks of \ninitiation of therapy. Therefore, patients should be monitored carefully for the appearance of rash \nduring this period. \n\nPatients should be instructed that they should not begin Viramune prolonged-release tablets until any \nrash that has occurred during the 14-day lead-in period of Viramune immediate-release has resolved. \nThe 200 mg once daily dosing regimen of Viramune immediate-release should not be continued \nbeyond 28 days at which point in time an alternative treatment should be sought due to the possible \nrisk of underexposure and resistance.\n\nAny patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, \nblistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, muscle or joint aches, or general malaise should \ndiscontinue the medicinal product and immediately seek medical evaluation. In these patients \nnevirapine must not be restarted.\n\nIf patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, liver function tests should be \nperformed. Patients with moderate to severe elevations (ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN) should be \npermanently discontinued from nevirapine.\n\nIf a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as fever, \narthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, eosinophilia, \ngranulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction, nevirapine must be permanently stopped and not be re-\nintroduced (see section 4.3).\n\nHepatic reactions\n\nSevere and life-threatening hepatotoxicity, including fatal fulminant hepatitis, has occurred in patients \ntreated with nevirapine. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring. The risk of hepatic reactions is greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. However the risk \ncontinues past this period and monitoring should continue at frequent intervals throughout treatment. \n\nRhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with \nnevirapine use.\n\nIncreased ASAT or ALAT levels > 2.5 ULN and/or co-infection with hepatitis B and/or C at the start \nof antiretroviral therapy is associated with greater risk of hepatic adverse reactions during \nantiretroviral therapy in general, including nevirapine containing regimens. \n\nFemale gender and higher CD4 counts at the initiation of nevirapine therapy in treatment-na\u00efve \npatients is associated with increased risk of hepatic adverse reactions. In a retrospective analysis of \npooled clinical studies with Viramune immediate-release tablets, women had a three fold higher risk \nthan men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (5.8 % versus 2.2 %), and treatment-\nna\u00efve patients of either gender with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma with higher CD4 counts at \ninitiation of nevirapine therapy were at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. \nPredominantly patients with a plasma HIV-1 viral load of 50 copies/ml or higher, women with CD4 \ncounts >250 cells/mm3 had a 12 fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse reactions compared to \nwomen with CD4 counts <250 cells/mm3 (11.0 % versus 0.9 %). An increased risk was observed in \nmen with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma and CD4 counts > 400 cells/mm3 (6.3 % versus 1.2 % for \nmen with CD4 counts <400 cells/mm3). This increased risk for toxicity based on CD4 count thresholds \nhas not been detected in patients with undetectable (i.e. < 50 copies/ml) plasma viral load.\n\nPatients should be informed that hepatic reactions are a major toxicity of nevirapine requiring close \nmonitoring during the first 18 weeks. They should be informed that occurrence of symptoms \n\n\n\n86\n\nsuggestive of hepatitis should lead them to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical \nevaluation, which should include liver function tests.\n\nLiver monitoring\n\nClinical chemistry tests, which include liver function tests, should be performed prior to initiating \nnevirapine therapy and at appropriate intervals during therapy.\n\nAbnormal liver function tests have been reported with nevirapine, some in the first few weeks of \ntherapy. \n\nAsymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes are frequently described and are not necessarily a \ncontraindication to use nevirapine. Asymptomatic GGT elevations are not a contraindication to \ncontinue therapy.\n\nMonitoring of hepatic tests should be done every two weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, at \nthe 3rd month and then regularly thereafter. Liver test monitoring should be performed if the patient \nexperiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity. \n\nFor patients already on a regimen of Viramune immediate-release twice daily who switch to Viramune \nprolonged-release once daily there is no need for a change in their monitoring schedule.\n\nIf ASAT or ALAT > 2.5 ULN before or during treatment, then liver tests should be monitored more\nfrequently during regular clinic visits. Nevirapine must not be administered to patients with pre-\ntreatment ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN until baseline ASAT/ALAT are stabilised < 5 ULN (see section \n4.3).\n\nPhysicians and patients should be vigilant for prodromal signs or findings of hepatitis, such as \nanorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, hepatomegaly or liver tenderness. Patients \nshould be instructed to seek medical attention promptly if these occur.\n\nIf ASAT or ALAT increase to > 5 ULN during treatment, nevirapine should be immediately \nstopped. If ASAT and ALAT return to baseline values and if the patient had no clinical signs or \nsymptoms of hepatitis, rash, constitutional symptoms or other findings suggestive of organ \ndysfunction, it may be possible to reintroduce nevirapine, on a case by case basis, at the starting \ndose regimen of one immediate-release 200 mg Viramune tablet daily for 14 days followed by \none Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release tablet daily. In these cases, more frequent liver \nmonitoring is required. If liver function abnormalities recur, nevirapine should be permanently \ndiscontinued.\n\nIf clinical hepatitis occurs, characterised by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, icterus AND laboratory \nfindings (such as moderate or severe liver function test abnormalities (excluding GGT)), \nnevirapine must be permanently stopped. Viramune must not be readministered to patients who \nhave required permanent discontinuation for clinical hepatitis due to nevirapine.\n\nLiver disease\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Viramune has not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders. Viramune is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, \nsee section 4.3). Pharmacokinetic results suggest caution should be exercised when nevirapine is \nadministered to patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh B). Patients with chronic \nhepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe \nand potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In the case of concomitant antiviral therapy for \nhepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products.\n\n\n\n87\n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.\n\nOther warnings\n\nPost-Exposure-Prophylaxis: Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure requiring transplantation, \nhas been reported in HIV-uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of Viramune in the setting of \npost-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. The use of Viramune has not been evaluated \nwithin a specific study on PEP, especially in term of treatment duration and therefore, is strongly \ndiscouraged.\n\nCombination therapy with nevirapine is not a curative treatment of patients infected with HIV-1; \npatients may continue to experience illnesses associated with advanced HIV-1 infection, including \nopportunistic infections.\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nHormonal methods of birth control other than Depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) should not \nbe used as the sole method of contraception in women taking Viramune, since nevirapine might lower \nthe plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. For this reason, and to reduce the risk of HIV \ntransmission, barrier contraception (e.g., condoms) is recommended. Additionally, when \npostmenopausal hormone therapy is used during administration of nevirapine, its therapeutic effect \nshould be monitored.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters:\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.\n\nIn clinical studies, Viramune has been associated with an increase in HDL- cholesterol and an overall \nimprovement in the total to HDL-cholesterol ratio. However, in the absence of specific studies, the \nclinical impact of these findings is not known. In addition, Viramune has not been shown to cause \nglucose disturbances.\n\nOsteonecrosis: Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, \nalcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis \nhave been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to \ncombination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they \nexperience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time \nof institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to \nasymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or \naggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or \nmonths of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or \nfocal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms \nshould be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 \ndisease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune \nreactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many \nmonths after initiation of treatment.\n\n\n\n88\n\nThe available pharmacokinetic data suggest that the concomitant use of rifampicin and nevirapine is \nnot recommended. Furthermore, combining the following compounds with Viramune is not \nrecommended: efavirenz, ketoconazole, delavirdine, etravirine, rilpivirine, elvitegravir (in \ncombination with cobicistat), atazanavir (in combination with ritonavir), boceprevir; \nfosamprenavir (if not co-administered with low dose ritonavir) (see section 4.5).\n\nGranulocytopenia is commonly associated with zidovudine. Therefore, patients who receive \nnevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly and especially paediatric patients and patients who receive \nhigher zidovudine doses or patients with poor bone marrow reserve, in particular those with advanced \nHIV disease, have an increased risk of granulocytopenia. In such patients haematological parameters \nshould be carefully monitored.\n\nLactose: Viramune prolonged-release tablets contain 400 mg of lactose per maximum recommended \ndaily dose.\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\n\nSome patients have reported the occurrence of remnants in faeces which may resemble intact tablets. \nBased on the data available so far, this has not been shown to affect the therapeutic response. If \npatients report such an event, reassurance should be obtained on the lack of impact on therapeutic\nresponse.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe following data were generated using the Viramune immediate-release tablets but are expected to \napply to all dosage forms.\n\nNevirapine is an inducer of CYP3A and potentially CYP2B6, with maximal induction occurring \nwithin 2-4 weeks of initiating multiple-dose therapy. \n\nCompounds using this metabolic pathway may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-\nadministered with nevirapine. Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effectiveness of P450 metabolised \nmedicinal products is recommended when taken in combination with nevirapine.\n\nThe absorption of nevirapine is not affected by food, antacids or medicinal products which are \nformulated with an alkaline buffering agent.\n\nThe interaction data is presented as geometric mean value with 90% confidence interval (90 % CI) \nwhenever these data were available.

Ketoconazole and erythromycin significantly \ninhibited the formation of nevirapine hydroxylated metabolites.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females\nWomen of childbearing potential should not use oral contraceptives as the sole method for birth \ncontrol, since nevirapine might lower the plasma concentrations of these medicinal products (see \nsections 4.4 & 4.5).\n\nPregnancy\nCurrently available data on pregnant women indicate no malformative or foeto/ neonatal toxicity. To \ndate no other relevant epidemiological data are available. No observable teratogenicity was detected in \nreproductive studies performed in pregnant rats and rabbits (see section 5.3). There are no adequate \nand well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Caution should be exercised when prescribing \nnevirapine to pregnant women (see section 4.4). As hepatotoxicity is more frequent in women with \nCD4 cell counts above 250 cells/mm3 with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma (50 or more copies/ml), \nthese conditions should be taken in consideration on therapeutic decision (see section 4.4). There is \nnot enough evidence to substantiate that the absence of an increased risk for toxicity seen in pre-\ntreated women initiating nevirapine with an undetectable viral load (less than 50 copies/ml of HIV-1 \nin plasma) and CD4 cell counts above 250 cells/mm3 also applies to pregnant women. All the \nrandomised studies addressing this issue specifically excluded pregnant women, and pregnant women \nwere under-represented in cohort studies as well as in meta-analyses.\n\nBreast-feeding\nNevirapine readily crosses the placenta and is found in breast milk. \n\nIt is recommended that HIV-infected mothers do not breast-feed their infants to avoid risking postnatal \ntransmission of HIV and that mothers should discontinue breast-feeding if they are receiving \nnevirapine.\n\nFertility\nIn reproductive toxicology studies, evidence of impaired fertility was seen in rats.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nThere are no specific studies about the ability to drive vehicles and use machinery. However, patients \nshould be advised that they may experience adverse reactions such as fatigue during treatment with \nnevirapine. Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or operating machinery. If \npatients experience fatigue they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating \nmachinery. \n\n\n\n97\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions related to Viramune prolonged-release therapy in\ntreatment na\u00efve patients (including lead-in phase with immediate-release) in clinical study 1100.1486 \n(VERxVE) were rash, nausea, liver function test abnormal, headache, fatigue, hepatitis, abdominal \npain, diarrhoea and pyrexia. There are no new adverse drug reactions for Viramune prolonged-release \ntablets that have not been previously identified for Viramune immediate-release tablets and oral \nsuspension.\n\nThe nevirapine postmarketing experience has shown that the most serious adverse reactions are \nStevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, serious hepatitis/hepatic failure, and drug \nreaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms \nsuch as fever, arthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, \neosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical \nperiod which requires close monitoring (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions which may be causally related to the administration of Viramune \nprolonged-release tablets have been reported. The frequencies given below are based on crude \nincidence rates of adverse reactions observed in the Viramune immediate-release (lead-in phase, table \n1) and Viramune prolonged-release (randomised-phase/maintenance phase, table 2) groups of clinical \nstudy 1100.1486 with 1,068 patients exposed to Viramune on a backbone of tenofovir/emtricitabine. \n\nFrequency is defined using the following convention: very common (\uf0b31/10); common (\uf0b31/100 to \n<1/10); uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000)\n\nTable 1: Lead-in phase with Viramune immediate-release\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\nUncommon granulocytopenia\nRare anaemia\n\nImmune system disorders\nUncommon hypersensitivity (incl. anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, urticaria), drug reaction\n\nwith eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, anaphylactic reaction\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon headache\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea\nUncommon vomiting\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nUncommon jaundice, hepatitis fulminant (which may be fatal)\nRare hepatitis (incl. severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity)(0.09 %)\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nCommon rash (6.7 %)\nUncommon Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (which may be fatal) \n\n(0.2 %), angioedema, urticaria\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nUncommon arthralgia, myalgia\n\n\n\n98\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon fatigue, pyrexia\n\nInvestigations\nUncommon liver function test abnormal (alanine aminotransferase increased; transaminases \n\nincreased; aspartate aminotransferase increased; gamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased; hepatic enzyme increased; hypertransaminasaemia), blood phosphorus \ndecreased, blood pressure increased\n\nTable 2: Maintenance phase of Viramune prolonged-release \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\nUncommon anaemia, granulocytopenia\n\nImmune system disorders\nUncommon hypersensitivity (incl. anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, urticaria), drug reaction\n\nwith eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, anaphylactic reaction\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon headache\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nCommon hepatitis (incl. severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity) (1.6%)\nUncommon jaundice, hepatitis fulminant (which may be fatal)\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nCommon rash (5.7 %)\nUncommon Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (which may be fatal) \n\n(0.6 %), angioedema, urticaria\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nUncommon arthralgia, myalgia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon fatigue\nUncommon pyrexia\n\nInvestigations\nCommon liver function test abnormal (alanine aminotransferase increased; transaminases \n\nincreased; aspartate aminotransferase increased; gamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased; hepatic enzyme increased; hypertransaminasaemia), blood phosphorus \ndecreased, blood pressure increased\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions were identified in other nevirapine studies or by post-marketing \nsurveillance but not observed in the randomised, controlled clinical study 1100.1486. \nAs granulocytopenia, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, anaphylactic reaction, \njaundice, hepatitis fulminant (which may be fatal), urticaria, decreased blood phosphorus and \nincreased blood pressure during the lead-in phase with Viramune immediate release were not seen in \nstudy 1100.1486 the frequency category was estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total \nnumber of patients exposed to nevirapine immediate-release in the lead-in phase of the randomised \ncontrolled clinical study 1100.1486 (n= 1,068).\n\n\n\n99\n\nAccordingly, as anaemia, granulocytopenia, anaphylactic reaction, jaundice, Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (which may be fatal), angioedema, decreased blood phosphorus\nand increased blood pressure during maintenance phase with Viramune prolonged-release tablets were \nnot seen in study 1100.1486 the frequency category was estimated from a statistical calculation based \non the total number of patients exposed to nevirapine prolonged-release in the maintenance phase of \nthe randomised controlled clinical study 1100.1486 (n= 505).\n\nMetabolic parameters\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4)\n\nThe following adverse reactions have also been reported when nevirapine has been used in \ncombination with other anti-retroviral agents: pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy and \nthrombocytopaenia. These adverse reactions are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents \nand may be expected to occur when nevirapine is used in combination with other agents; however it is \nunlikely that these adverse reactions are due to nevirapine treatment. Hepatic-renal failure syndromes \nhave been reported rarely.\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have\nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissues\n\nThe most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, \nmaculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face \nand extremities. Hypersensitivity (incl. anaphylactic reaction, angioedema and urticaria) has been \nreported. Rashes occur alone or in the context of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \nsymptoms, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, myalgia and \nlympadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and \nrenal dysfunction.\n\nSevere and life-threatening skin reactions have occurred in patients treated with nevirapine, including \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Fatal cases of SJS, TEN and \ndrug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported. The majority of severe \nrashes occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment and some required hospitalisation, with one \npatient requiring surgical intervention (see section 4.4). \n\nIn study 1100.1486 (VERxVE) antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients received a lead-in dose of Viramune \n200 mg immediate-release once daily for 14 days (n=1068) and then were randomised to receive either \nViramune 200 mg immediate-release twice daily or Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release once daily. \nAll patients received tenofovir + emtricitabine as background therapy. Safety data included all the \npatient visits up to the point in time when the last patient completed 144 weeks in the trial. This also \nincludes safety data for patient visits in the post-week 144 open label extension (which patients in \neither treatment group who completed the 144 week blinded phase could enter). Severe or life-\nthreatening rash considered related to nevirapine treatment occurred in 1.1 % of patients during the \nlead-in phase with Viramune immediate-release. Severe rash occurred in 1.4 % and 0.2 % of the \nViramune immediate-release and Viramune prolonged-release groups respectively during the \nrandomised phase. No life-threatening (Grade 4) rash events considered related to Viramune were \nreported during the randomised phase of this study.Six cases of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome were \n\n\n\n100\n\nreported in the study; all but one occurred within the first 30 days of nevirapine treatment. \n\nIn study 1100.1526 (TRANxITION) patients on Viramune 200 mg immediate-release twice daily \ntreatment for at least 18 weeks were randomised to either receive Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release \nonce daily (n=295) or remain on their Viramune immediate-release treatment (n=148). In this study, \nno Grade 3 or 4 rash was observed in either treatment group.\n\nHepato-biliary\n\nThe most frequently observed laboratory test abnormalities are elevations in liver function tests \n(LFTs), including ALAT, ASAT, GGT, total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Asymptomatic \nelevations of GGT levels are the most frequent. Cases of jaundice have been reported. Cases of \nhepatitis (severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity, including fatal fulminant hepatitis) have been \nreported in patients treated with nevirapine. The best predictor of a serious hepatic event was elevated \nbaseline liver function tests. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring (see section 4.4).\n\nIn study 1100.1486 (VERxVE) treatment-na\u00efve patients received a lead-in dose of Viramune 200 mg \nimmediate-release once daily for 14 days and then were randomised to receive either Viramune \n200 mg immediate-release twice daily or Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release once daily. All patients \nreceived tenofovir + emtricitabine as background therapy. Patients were enrolled with CD4 counts \n<250 cells/mm3 for women and <400 cells/mm3 for men. Data on potential symptoms of hepatic \nevents were prospectively collected in this study. The safety data include all patient visits up to the \ntime of the last patient\u2019s completion of study week 144. The incidence of symptomatic hepatic events \nduring the Viramune immediate-release lead-in phase was 0.5 %. After the lead-in period the \nincidence of symptomatic hepatic events was 2.4 % in the Viramune immediate-release group and \n1.6 % in the Viramune prolonged-release group. Overall, there was a comparable incidence of \nsymptomatic hepatic events among men and women enrolled in VERxVE.\n\nIn study 1100.1526 (TRANxITION) no Grade 3 or 4 clinical hepatic events were observed in either \ntreatment group.\n\nPaediatric population\nBased on clinical study experience with Viramune immediate-release tablets and oral suspension of \n361 paediatric patients the majority of which received combination treatment with ZDV or/and ddI,\nthe most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine were similar to those observed in \nadults. Granulocytopenia was more frequently observed in children. In an open-label clinical study\n(ACTG 180) granulocytopenia assessed as medicinal product-related occurred in 5/37 (13.5 %) of \npatients. In ACTG 245, a double-blind placebo controlled study, the frequency of serious medicinal \nproduct-related granulocytopenia was 5/305 (1.6 %). Isolated cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or \nStevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome have been reported in this population. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no known antidote for nevirapine overdose. Cases of overdose with Viramune immediate-\nrelease at doses ranging from 800 to 6,000 mg per day for up to 15 days have been reported. Patients \nhave experienced oedema, erythema nodosum, fatigue, fever, headache, insomnia, nausea, pulmonary \ninfiltrates, rash, vertigo, vomiting, increase in transaminases and weight decrease. All of these effects \nsubsided following discontinuation of nevirapine. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n101\n\nPaediatric population\n\nOne case of massive accidental overdose in a newborn was reported. The ingested dose was 40 times \nthe recommended dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Mild isolated neutropenia and hyperlactataemia was observed, \nwhich spontaneously disappeared within one week without any clinical complications. One year later, \nthe child\u2019s development remained normal. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors, ATC code J05AG01.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nNevirapine is a NNRTI of HIV-1. Nevirapine is a non-competitive inhibitor of the HIV-1 reverse \ntranscriptase, but it does not have a biologically significant inhibitory effect on the HIV-2 reverse \ntranscriptase or on eukaryotic DNA polymerases \uf061, \uf062, \uf067, or \uf064.\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\n\nNevirapine had a median EC50 value (50% inhibitory concentration) of 63 nM against a panel of group \nM HIV-1 isolates from clades A, B, C, D, F, G, and H, and circulating recombinant forms (CRF), \nCRF01_AE, CRF02_AG and CRF12_BF replicating in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. In a panel \nof 2,923 predominantly subtype B HIV-1 clinical isolates, the mean EC50 value was 90nM. Similar \nEC50 values are obtained when the antiviral activity of nevirapine is measured in peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells, monocyte derived macrophages or lymphoblastoid cell line. Nevirapine had no \nantiviral activity in cell culture against group O HIV-1 isolates or HIV-2 isolates.\n\nNevirapine in combination with efavirenz exhibited a strong antagonistic anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro\n(see section 4.5) and was additive to antagonistic with the protease inhibitor ritonavir or the fusion \ninhibitor enfuvirtide. Nevirapine exhibited additive to synergistic anti-HIV-1 activity in combination \nwith the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, saquinavir and tipranavir, and \nthe NRTIs abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine. The \nanti-HIV-1 activity of nevirapine was antagonized by the anti-HBV medicinal product adefovir and by \nthe anti-HCV medicinal product ribavirin in vitro.\n\nResistance\n\nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility (100-250-fold) to nevirapine emerge in cell culture. \nGenotypic analysis showed mutations in the HIV-1 RT gene Y181C and/or V106A depending upon \nthe virus strain and cell line employed. Time to emergence of nevirapine resistance in cell culture was \nnot altered when selection included nevirapine in combination with several other NNRTIs.\n\nGenotypic analysis of isolates from antiretroviral na\u00efve patients experiencing virologic failure (n=71) \nreceiving nevirapine once daily (n=25) or twice daily (n=46) in combination with lamivudine and \nstavudine for 48 weeks showed that isolates from 8/25 and 23/46 patients, respectively, contained one \nor more of the following NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions: Y181C, K101E, G190A/S, \nK103N, V106A/M, V108I, Y188C/L, A98G, F227L and M230L.\n\nGenotypic analysis was performed on isolates from 86 antiretroviral na\u00efve patients who discontinued \nthe VERxVE study (1100.1486) after experiencing virologic failure (rebound, partial response) or due \nto an adverse event or who had transient increase in viral load during the course of the study. The \nanalysis of these samples of patients receiving Viramune immediate-release twice daily or Viramune\n\n\n\n102\n\nprolonged-release once daily in combination with tenofovir and emtricitabine showed that isolates \nfrom 50 patients contained resistance mutations expected with a nevirapine-based regimen. Of these \n50 patients, 28 developed resistance to efavirenz and 39 developed resistance to etravirine (the most \nfrequently emergent resistance mutation being Y181C). There were no differences based on the \nformulation taken (immediate-release twice daily or prolonged-release once daily).\n\nThe observed mutations at failure were those expected with a nevirapine-based regimen. Two new \nsubstitutions on codons previously associated with nevirapine resistance were observed: one patient \nwith Y181I in the Viramune prolonged-release group and one patient with Y188N in the Viramune\nimmediate-release group; resistance to nevirapine was confirmed by phenotype.\n\nCross-resistance\n\nRapid emergence of HIV-strains which are cross-resistant to NNRTIs has been observed in vitro. \nCross resistance to delavirdine and efavirenz is expected after virologic failure with nevirapine. \nDepending on resistance testing results, an etravirine-containing regimen may be used subsequently. \nCross-resistance between nevirapine and either HIV protease inhibitors, HIV integrase inhibitors or \nHIV entry inhibitors is unlikely because the enzyme targets involved are different. Similarly the \npotential for cross-resistance between nevirapine and NRTIs is low because the molecules have \ndifferent binding sites on the reverse transcriptase.\n\nClinical results\n\nViramune has been evaluated in both treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients. \n\nClinical studies with prolonged-release tablets\n\nThe clinical efficacy of Viramune prolonged-release is based on 48-week data from a randomised, \ndouble-blind, double-dummy phase 3 study (VERxVE \u2013 study 1100.1486) in treatment-na\u00efve patients \nand on 24-week data from a randomised, open-label study in patients who transitioned from Viramune\nimmediate-release tablets administered twice daily to Viramune prolonged-release tablets \nadministered once daily (TRANxITION \u2013 study 1100.1526). \n\nTreatment-na\u00efve patients\nVERxVE (study 1100.1486) is a phase 3 study in which treatment-na\u00efve patients received Viramune\n200 mg immediate-release once daily for 14 days and then were randomised to receive either \nViramune 200 mg immediate-release twice daily or Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release once daily. \nAll patients received tenofovir + emtricitabine as background therapy. Randomisation was stratified \nby screening HIV-1 RNA level (<100,000 copies/ml and >100,000 copies/ml). Selected demographic \nand baseline disease characteristics are displayed in Table 1.\n\n\n\n103\n\nTable 1: Demographic and Baseline Disease Characteristics in study 1100.1486\nViramune\n\nimmediate-release\nViramune\n\nprolonged-release\nn=508* n=505\n\nGender \n\n- Male 85 % 85 %\n\n- Female 15 % 15 %\n\nRace \n\n- White 74 % 77 %\n\n- Black 22 % 19 %\n\n- Asian 3 % 3 %\n\n- Other** 1 % 2 %\n\nRegion\n\n- North America 30 % 28 %\n\n- Europe 50 % 51 %\n\n- Latin America 10 % 12 %\n\n- Africa 11 % 10 %\n\nBaseline Plasma HIV-1 RNA (log10 copies/ml)\n\n- Mean (SD) 4.7 (0.6) 4.7 (0.7)\n\n- <100,000 66 % 67 %\n\n- >100,000 34 % 33 %\n\nBaseline CD4 count (cells/mm3)\n\n- Mean (SD) 228 (86) 230 (81)\n\nHIV-1 subtype\n\n- B 71 % 75 %\n- Non-B 29 % 24 %\n\n* Includes 2 patients who were randomised but never received blinded medicinal products. \n** Includes American Indians/Alaska natives and Hawaiian/Pacific islanders.\n\nTable 2 describes week 48 outcomes in the VERxVE study (1100.1486).

In this open-label study, \n443 patients already on an antiviral regimen containing Viramune 200 mg immediate-release twice \ndaily with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to Viramune 400 mg prolonged-\nrelease once daily or Viramune 200 mg immediate-release twice daily. Approximately half of the \npatients had tenofovir + emtricitabine as their background therapy, with the remaining patients \n\n\n\n105\n\nreceiving abacavir sulfate + lamivudine or zidovudine + lamivudine. Approximately half of the \npatients had at least 3 years of prior exposure to Viramune immediate-release prior to entering study\n1100.1526. \n\nAt 24 weeks after randomisation in the TRANxITION study, 92.6 % and 93.6 % of patients receiving \nViramune 200 mg immediate-release twice daily or Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release once daily, \nrespectively, continued to have HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml.\n\nPaediatric population\nResults of a 48-week analysis of the South African study BI 1100.1368 confirmed that the 4/7 mg/kg \nand 150 mg/m2 nevirapine dose groups were well tolerated and effective in treating antiretroviral naive \npaediatric patients. A marked improvement in the CD4+ cell percent was observed through Week 48 \nfor both dose groups. Also, both dosing regimens were effective in reducing the viral load. In this 48-\nweek study no unexpected safety findings were observed in either dosing group.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThere are no data available on interchangeability for 400 mg prolonged-release tablets and 100 mg \nprolonged-release tablets.\n\nAbsorption:\nThe pharmacokinetics of nevirapine has been studied in a single dose study (study 1100.1485) of \nViramune prolonged-release in 17 healthy volunteers. The relative bioavailability of nevirapine when \ndosed as one 400 mg Viramune prolonged-release tablet, relative to two 200 mg Viramune immediate-\nrelease tablets, was approximately 75 %. The mean peak plasma concentration of nevirapine was \n2,060 ng/ml measured at a mean 24.5 hours after administration of 400 mg Viramune prolonged-\nrelease tablets.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Viramune prolonged-release has also been studied in a multiple dose \npharmacokinetics study (study 1100.1489) in 24 HIV-1 infected patients who switched from chronic \nViramune immediate-release therapy to Viramune prolonged-release. The nevirapine AUC0-24,ss and \nCmin,ss measured after 19 days of fasted dosing of Viramune 400 mg prolonged-release tablets once \ndaily were approximately 80 % and 90 %, respectively, of the AUC0-24,ss and Cmin,ss measured when \npatients were dosed with Viramune 200 mg immediate-release tablets twice daily. The geometric \nmean nevirapine Cmin,ss was 2,770 ng/ml.\n\nWhen Viramune prolonged-release was dosed with a high fat meal, the nevirapine AUC0-24,ss and Cmin,ss\nwere approximately 94 % and 98 %, respectively, of the AUC0-24,ss and Cmin,ss measured when patients \nwere dosed with Viramune immediate-release tablets. The difference in nevirapine pharmacokinetics \nobserved when Viramune prolonged-release tablets are dosed under fasted or fed conditions is not \nconsidered clinically relevant. Viramune prolonged-release tablets can be taken with or without food.\n\nSome patients have reported the occurrence of remnants in faeces which may resemble intact tablets. \nBased on the data available so far, this has not been shown to affect the therapeutic response. If \npatients report such an event, reassurance should be obtained on the lack of impact on therapeutic \nresponse.\n\nDistribution: Nevirapine is lipophilic and is essentially nonionized at physiologic pH. Following \nintravenous administration to healthy adults, the volume of distribution (Vdss) of nevirapine was 1.21 \n\uf0b1 0.09 l/kg, suggesting that nevirapine is widely distributed in humans. Nevirapine readily crosses the \nplacenta and is found in breast milk. Nevirapine is about 60 % bound to plasma proteins in the plasma \nconcentration range of 1-10 \u00b5g/ml. Nevirapine concentrations in human cerebrospinal fluid (n = 6) \nwere 45 % (\uf0b1 5 %) of the concentrations in plasma; this ratio is approximately equal to the fraction not \nbound to plasma protein.\n\n\n\n106\n\nBiotransformation and elimination: In vivo studies in humans and in vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes have shown that nevirapine is extensively biotransformed via cytochrome P450 \n(oxidative) metabolism to several hydroxylated metabolites. In vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes suggest that oxidative metabolism of nevirapine is mediated primarily by cytochrome \nP450 isozymes from the CYP3A family, although other isozymes may have a secondary role. In a \nmass balance/excretion study in eight healthy male volunteers dosed to steady state with nevirapine \n200 mg given twice daily followed by a single 50 mg dose of 14C-nevirapine, approximately 91.4 \uf0b1\n10.5 % of the radiolabelled dose was recovered, with urine (81.3 \uf0b1 11.1 %) representing the primary \nroute of excretion compared to faeces (10.1 \uf0b1 1.5 %). Greater than 80 % of the radioactivity in urine \nwas made up of glucuronide conjugates of hydroxylated metabolites. Thus cytochrome P450 \nmetabolism, glucuronide conjugation, and urinary excretion of glucuronidated metabolites represent \nthe primary route of nevirapine biotransformation and elimination in humans. Only a small fraction (< \n5 %) of the radioactivity in urine (representing < 3 % of the total dose) was made up of parent \ncompound; therefore, renal excretion plays a minor role in elimination of the parent compound.\n\nNevirapine has been shown to be an inducer of hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic enzymes. The \npharmacokinetics of autoinduction is characterised by an approximately 1.5 to 2 fold increase in the \napparent oral clearance of nevirapine as treatment continues from a single dose to two-to-four weeks \nof dosing with 200-400 mg/day. Autoinduction also results in a corresponding decrease in the terminal \nphase half-life of nevirapine in plasma from approximately 45 hours (single dose) to approximately \n25-30 hours following multiple dosing with 200-400 mg/day.\n\nRenal impairment: The single-dose pharmacokinetics of nevirapine immediate-release has been \ncompared in 23 patients with either mild (50 \uf0a3 CLcr \uf03c 80 ml/min), moderate (30 \uf0a3 CLcr \uf03c 50 ml/min) \nor severe renal dysfunction (CLcr \uf03c 30 ml/min), renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) \nrequiring dialysis, and 8 patients with normal renal function (CLcr \uf03e 80 ml/min). Renal impairment \n(mild, moderate and severe) resulted in no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine. \nHowever, patients with ESRD requiring dialysis exhibited a 43.5% reduction in nevirapine AUC over \na one-week exposure period. There was also accumulation of nevirapine hydroxy-metabolites in \nplasma. The results suggest that supplementing nevirapine therapy for adults with an additional \n200 mg immediate-release tablet following each dialysis treatment would help offset the effects of \ndialysis on nevirapine clearance. Otherwise patients with CLcr \uf0b3 20 ml/min do not require an \nadjustment in nevirapine dosing. In paediatric patients with renal dysfunction who are undergoing \ndialysis it is recommended following each dialysis treatment patients receive an additional dose of \nViramune oral suspension or immediate-release tablets representing 50% of the recommended daily \ndose of Viramune oral suspension or immediate-release tablets, which would help offset the effects of \ndialysis on nevirapine clearance. Viramune prolonged-release tablets have not been studied in patients \nwith renal dysfunction and Viramune immediate-release should be used.\n\nHepatic impairment:A steady state study comparing 46 patients with \nmild (n=17: Ishak Score 1-2), \nmoderate (n=20; Ishak Score 3-4), \nor severe (n=9; Ishak Score 5-6, Child-Pugh A in 8 pts., for 1 Child-Pugh score not applicable) \nliver fibrosis as a measure of hepatic impairment was conducted. \n\nThe patients studied were receiving antiretroviral therapy containing Viramune 200 mg immediate-\nrelease tablets twice daily for at least 6 weeks prior to pharmacokinetic sampling, with a median \nduration of therapy of 3.4 years. In this study, the multiple dose pharmacokinetic disposition of \nnevirapine and the five oxidative metabolites were not altered.\n\nHowever, approximately 15 % of these patients with hepatic fibrosis had nevirapine trough \nconcentrations above 9,000 ng/ml (2 fold the usual mean trough). Patients with hepatic impairment \nshould be monitored carefully for evidence of medicinal product induced toxicity.\n\nIn a single dose pharmacokinetic study of 200 mg Viramune immediate-release tabletsof in HIV-\nnegative patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, n=6; Child-Pugh B, \n\n\n\n107\n\nn=4), a significant increase in the AUC of nevirapine was observed in one Child-Pugh B patient with \nascites suggesting that patients with worsening hepatic function and ascites may be at risk of \naccumulating nevirapine in the systemic circulation. Because nevirapine induces its own metabolism \nwith multiple dosing, this single dose study may not reflect the impact of hepatic impairment on \nmultiple dose pharmacokinetics (see section 4.4). Viramune prolonged-release tablets have not been \nevaluated in patients with hepatic impairment and Viramune immediate-release should be used.\n\nGender\nIn the multinational 2NN study with Viramune immediate-release, a population pharmacokinetic \nsubstudy of 1077 patients was performed that included 391 females. Female patients showed a 13.8 % \nlower clearance of nevirapine than did male patients. This difference is not considered clinically \nrelevant. Since neither body weight nor Body Mass Index (BMI) had influence on the clearance of \nnevirapine, the effect of gender cannot be explained by body size.\n\nThe effects of gender on the pharmacokinetics of Viramune prolonged-release have been investigated \nin study 1100.1486. Female patients tend to have higher (approximately 20 \u2013 30 %) trough \nconcentrations in both Viramune prolonged-release and Viramune immediate-release treatment \ngroups. \n\nElderly\nNevirapine pharmacokinetics in HIV-1 infected adults does not appear to change with age (range 18 -\n68 years). Nevirapine has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65. Black \npatients (n=80/group) in study 1100.1486 showed approximately 30% higher trough concentrations \nthan Caucasian patients (250-325 patients/group) in both the Viramune immediate-release and \nViramune prolonged-release treatment groups over 48 weeks of treatment at 400 mg/day.\n\nPaediatric population\nData concerning the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine has been derived from two major sources: a 48 \nweek paediatric study in South Africa (BI 1100.1368) involving 123 HIV-1 positive, antiretroviral \nna\u00efve patients aged 3 months to 16 years; and a consolidated analysis of five Paediatric AIDS Clinical \nTrials Group (PACTG) protocols comprising 495 patients aged 14 days to 19 years. \n\nPharmacokinetic data on 33 patients (age range 0.77 \u2013 13.7 years) in the intensive sampling group \ndemonstrated that clearance of nevirapine increased with increasing age in a manner consistent with \nincreasing body surface area. Dosing of nevirapine at 150 mg/m2 BID (after a two-week lead in at \n150 mg/m2 QD) produced geometric mean or mean trough nevirapine concentrations between 4-\n6 \u00b5g/ml (as targeted from adult data). In addition, the observed trough nevirapine concentrations were \ncomparable between the two methods.\n\nThe consolidated analysis of Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocols 245, 356, 366, \n377, and 403 allowed for the evaluation of paediatric patients less than 3 months of age (n=17) \nenrolled in these PACTG studies. The plasma nevirapine concentrations observed were within the \nrange observed in adults and the remainder of the paediatric population, but were more variable \nbetween patients, particularly in the second month of age.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Viramune prolonged-release was assessed in study 1100.1518. Eighty-five \npatients (3 to < 18 years) received weight or body surface area dose-adjusted Viramune immediate-\nrelease for a minimum of 18 weeks and then were switched to Viramune prolonged-release tablets (2 x \n100 mg, 3 x 100 mg or 1 x 400 mg once daily) in combination with other antiretrovirals for 10 days. \nThe observed geometric mean ratios of Viramune prolonged-release to Viramune immediate-release \nwere ~90 % for Cmin,ss and AUCss with 90% confidence intervals within 80 %-125 %; the ratio for \nCmax,ss was lower and consistent with a once-daily prolonged-release dosage form. Geometric mean \nsteady-state plasma Viramune prolonged-release pre-dose trough concentrations were 3,880 ng/ml, \n3,310 ng/ml and 5,350 ng/ml in age groups 3 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years of age, \nrespectively. Overall, the exposure in children was similar to that observed in adults receiving \nViramune prolonged-release in study 1100.1486. \n\n\n\n108\n\nIn single dose, parallel group bioavailability studies (studies 1100.1517 and 1100.1531), the Viramune \n50 and 100 mg prolonged-release tablets exhibited extended release characteristics of prolonged \nabsorption and lower maximal concentrations, similar to the findings when a 400 mg prolonged-\nrelease tablet was compared to the Viramune immediate-release 200 mg tablet. Dividing a 200 mg \ntotal dose into four 50 mg doses rather than two 100 mg doses produced a 7-11 % greater overall \nabsorption, but with comparable medicinal product release rates. The observed pharmacokinetic \ndifference between the 50 mg and 100 mg Viramune prolonged-release tablets is not clinically \nrelevant, and the 50 mg prolonged-release tablet can be used as an alternative to the slightly larger \n100 mg tablet. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans other than those observed in clinical studies \nbased on conventional studies of safety, pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. In \ncarcinogenicity studies, nevirapine induces hepatic tumours in rats and mice. These findings are most \nlikely related to nevirapine being a strong inducer of liver enzymes, and not due to a genotoxic mode \nof action. \n\n6.

What Viramune is and what it is used for \n\nViramune belongs to a group of medicines called antiretrovirals, used in the treatment of Human \nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) infection.\n\nThe active substance of your medicine is called nevirapine. Nevirapine belongs to a class of anti-HIV \nmedicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Reverse transcriptase is an \nenzyme that HIV needs in order to multiply. Nevirapine stops reverse transcriptase from working. By \nstopping reverse transcriptase from working, Viramune helps control HIV-1 infection. \n\nViramune is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults, adolescents, and children of any age. \nYou must take Viramune together with other antiretroviral medicines. Your doctor will recommend \nthe best medicines for you.\n\nIf Viramune has been prescribed for your child, please note that all information in this leaflet is \naddressed to your child (in this case please read \u201cyour child\u201d instead of \u201cyou\u201d).\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Viramune \n\nDo not take Viramune\n- if you are allergic to nevirapine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6 ).\n- if you have taken Viramune before and had to stop the treatment because you suffered from:\n\n- severe skin rash \n- skin rash with other symptoms for example:\n\n- fever\n- blistering\n- mouth sores\n- inflammation of the eye\n- swelling of the face\n\n\n\n136\n\n- general swelling\n- shortness of breath\n- muscle or joint pain\n- general feelings of illness\n- abdominal pain\n\n- hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions \n- inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\n\n- if you have severe liver disease \n- if you have had to stop Viramune treatment in the past because of changes in your liver function\n- if you are taking a medicine containing the herbal substance St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum \n\nperforatum). This herbal substance may stop Viramune from working properly.\n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Viramune.\nDuring the first 18 weeks of treatment with Viramune it is very important that you and your \ndoctor watch out for signs of liver or skin reactions. These can become severe and even life \nthreatening. You are at greatest risk of such a reaction during the first 6 weeks of treatment.\n\nIf you experience severe rash or hypersensitivity (allergic reactions that may appear in the \nform of rash) accompanied by other side effects such as \n\n- fever, \n- blistering, \n- mouth sores, \n- inflammation of the eye, \n- swelling of the face, \n- general swelling,\n- shortness of breath, \n- muscle or joint pain, \n- general feelings of illness, \n- or abdominal pain\n\nYOU SHOULD DISCONTINUE TAKING VIRAMUNE AND YOU MUST CONTACT your \ndoctor IMMEDIATELY as such reactions can be potentially life-threatening or lead to death.\nIf you ever have only mild rash symptoms without any other reaction please inform your \ndoctor immediately, who will advise you whether you should stop taking Viramune.\n\nIf you experience symptoms suggesting damage of the liver, such as \n- loss of appetite, \n- feeling sick (nausea), \n- vomiting, \n- yellow skin (jaundice), \n- abdominal pain\n\nyou should discontinue taking Viramune and must contact your doctor immediately.\n\nIf you develop severe liver, skin or hypersensitivity reactions whilst taking Viramune, NEVER \nTAKE VIRAMUNE again without referring to your doctor.\nYou must take the dose of Viramune as prescribed by your doctor. This is especially important \nwithin the first 14 days of treatment (see more information in \u201cHow to take Viramune\u201d).\n\nThe following patients are at increased risk of developing liver problems:\n- women\n- infected with hepatitis B or C\n- abnormal liver function tests\n- treatment-na\u00efve patients with higher CD4 cell counts at the start of Viramune therapy (women \n\nmore than 250 cells/mm\u00b3, men more than 400 cells/mm\u00b3)\n- pre-treated patients with detectable HIV-1 plasma viral load and higher CD4 cell counts at the \n\nstart of Viramune therapy (women more than 250 cells/mm\u00b3, men more than 400 cells/mm\u00b3)\n\n\n\n137\n\nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection (AIDS \ndefining illness), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after \nanti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the \nbody\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no \nobvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately.\n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.\n\nChanges of body fat may occur in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Contact your \ndoctor if you notice changes in body fat (see section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). \n\nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe weakness of the \nimmune system and higher body mass index may be some of the many risk factors for developing this \ndisease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and \nshoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.\n\nIf you are taking nevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly please inform your doctor since he might \nneed to check your white blood cells.\nDo not take Viramune after an exposure to HIV unless you have been diagnosed with HIV and \ninstructed to do so by your doctor. Viramune is not a cure for HIV infection. Therefore, you may \ncontinue to develop infections and other illnesses associated with HIV infection. You should therefore \nremain in regular contact with your doctor. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nPrednisone should not be used to treat a rash related to Viramune.\n\nIf you are taking oral contraceptives (e.g. \u201epill\u201c) or other hormonal methods of birth control during \ntreatment with Viramune, you should use a barrier contraception (e.g. condoms) in addition to prevent \npregnancy and further HIV transmission. \nIf you are receiving post-menopausal hormone therapy, ask your doctor for advice before taking this \nmedicine.\n\nIf you are taking or are prescribed rifampicin to treat tuberculosis please inform your doctor before \ntaking this medicine with Viramune. \n\nChildren and adolescents\nViramune tablets can be taken by:\n- children 16 years of age or older\n- children under 16 years of age who:\n\n- weigh 50 kg or more \n- or have a body surface area above 1.25 square metres. \n\nFor smaller children an oral suspension liquid form is available.\n\nOther medicines and Viramune\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Inform your doctor about all other medicines you are taking before you start taking \n\n\n\n138\n\nViramune. Your doctor might need to monitor whether your other medicines are still working and \nadjust doses. Carefully read the package leaflet of all other HIV medicinal products you are taking in \ncombination with Viramune.\n\nIt is particularly important that you tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken:\n\n- St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum, medicine to treat depression)\n- rifampicin (medicine to treat tuberculosis)\n- rifabutin (medicine to treat tuberculosis)\n- macrolides e.g. clarithromycin (medicine to treat bacterial infections)\n- fluconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)\n- ketoconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)\n- itraconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)\n- methadone (medicine used for treatment of opiate addicts)\n- warfarin (medicine to reduce blood clotting)\n- hormonal contraceptives (e.g. the \u201cpill\u201d)\n- atazanavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- lopinavir/ritonavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- fosamprenavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- efavirenz (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- etravirine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- rilpivirine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- delavirdine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- zidovudine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- boceprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis C)\n- telaprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis C)\n- elvitegravir/cobicistat (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n\nYour doctor will carefully monitor the effect of Viramune and any of these medicines if you are taking \nthem together. \n\nIf you are undergoing kidney dialysis, your doctor may consider a dose adjustment of Viramune. This \nis because Viramune can be partly washed out of your blood by dialysis. \n\nTaking Viramune with food and drink\nThere are no restrictions on taking Viramune with food and drink.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nYou should stop breast-feeding if you are taking Viramune. It is in general recommended that you do \nnot breast-feed if you have HIV infection because it is possible that your baby can become infected \nwith HIV through your breast milk.\n\nDriving and using machines\nYou may experience fatigue when taking Viramune. Use caution when engaging in activities such as \ndriving, using any tools or machines. If you experience fatigue you should avoid potentially hazardous \ntasks such as driving or using any tools or machines.\n\nViramune contains lactose and sodium\nViramune tablets contain lactose (milk sugar).\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicinal product.\nViramune tablets contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\n\n\n139\n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n3. How to take Viramune \n\nYou should not use Viramune on its own. You must take it with at least two other antiretroviral \nmedicines. Your doctor will recommend the best medicines for you.\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.\n\nDose:\n\nThe dose is one 200 mg tablet per day for the first 14 days of treatment (\u201clead-in\u201d period). After 14 \ndays, the usual dose is one 200 mg tablet twice a day. \n\nIt is very important that you take only one Viramune tablet a day for the first 14 days (\u201clead-in\u201d \nperiod). If you have any rash during this period, do not increase the dose but consult your doctor.\n\nThe 14-day \u201dlead-in\u201d period has been shown to lower the risk of skin rash.\n\nAs Viramune must always be taken together with other HIV antiretroviral medicines, you should \nfollow the instructions for your other medicines carefully. These are supplied in the package leaflets \nfor those medicines.\n\nViramune is also available in liquid form as an oral suspension. This is particularly suitable if:\n- you have problems swallowing tablets\n- or you are a child weighing less than 50 kg\n- or you are a child having a body surface area less than 1.25 square metres (your doctor will \n\nwork out your surface area).\n\nYou should continue to take Viramune for as long as instructed by your doctor.\n\nAs explained in \u2018Warnings and precautions\u2019, above, your doctor will monitor you with liver tests or \nfor undesirable effects such as rash. Depending on the outcome your doctor may decide to interrupt or \nstop your Viramune treatment. Your doctor might then decide to restart you on a lower dose.\n\nOnly take Viramune tablets by mouth. Do not chew your tablets. You may take Viramune with or \nwithout food.\n\nIf you take more Viramune than you should\nDo not take more Viramune than prescribed by your doctor and described in this leaflet. There is at \npresent little information on the effects of Viramune overdose. Consult your doctor if you have taken \nmore Viramune than you should. \n\nIf you forget to take Viramune\nTry not to miss a dose. If you notice that you have missed a dose within 8 hours of when it was due, \ntake the missed dose as soon as possible. If it has been more than 8 hours since the dose was due only\ntake the next dose at the usual time.\n\nIf you stop taking Viramune\nTaking all doses at the appropriate times:\n- greatly increases the effectiveness of your combination antiretroviral medicines \n\n\n\n140\n\n- reduces the chances of your HIV infection becoming resistant to your antiretroviral medicines.\n\nIt is important that you continue taking Viramune correctly, as described above, unless your doctor \ninstructs you to stop.\n\nIf you stop taking Viramune for more than 7 days your doctor will instruct you to start the 14 day \n'lead-in' period (described above) once again, before returning to the twice daily dose.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nAs mentioned in \u2018Warnings and precautions', above, the most important side effects of Viramune\nare severe and life threatening skin reactions and serious liver damage. These reactions occur \nmainly in the first 18 weeks of treatment with Viramune. This is therefore an important period\nwhich requires close monitoring by your doctor.\n\nIf you ever observe any rash symptoms, inform your doctor immediately.\n\nWhen rash occurs it is normally mild to moderate. However, in some patients a rash, which appears as \na blistering skin reaction, can be severe or life-threatening (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis) and deaths have been recorded. Most of the cases of both severe rash and \nmild/moderate rash occur in the first six weeks of treatment. \n\nIf rash occurs and you also feel sick, you must stop treatment and visit your doctor immediately.\n\nHypersensitivity (allergic) reactions can occur. Such reactions may appear in the form of anaphylaxis \n(a severe form of allergic reaction) with symptoms such as:\n- rash\n- swelling of the face\n- difficulty breathing (bronchial spasm)\n- anaphylactic shock\nHypersensitivity reactions can also occur as rash with other side effects such as:\n- fever\n- blistering of your skin \n- mouth sores\n- inflammation of the eye\n- swelling of the face\n- general swelling\n- shortness of breath\n- muscle or joint pain\n- a reduction in the numbers of your white blood cells (granulocytopenia)\n- general feelings of illness\n- severe problems with liver or kidneys (liver or kidney failure). \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you experience rash and any of the other side effects of a \nhypersensitivity (allergic) reaction. Such reactions can be life-threatening.\n\nAbnormal liver functioning has been reported with the use of Viramune. This includes some cases of \n\n\n\n141\n\ninflammation of the liver (hepatitis), which can be sudden and intense (fulminant hepatitis), and liver \nfailure, which can be both fatal.\n\nTell your doctor if you experience any of the following clinical symptoms of liver damage:\n- loss of appetite\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- vomiting\n- yellow skin (jaundice)\n- abdominal pain \n\nThe side effects described below have been experienced by patients given Viramune:\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\n- rash\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n- decreased numbers of white blood cells (granulocytopenia)\n- allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) \n- headache\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- vomiting\n- abdominal pain\n- loose stools (diarrhoea)\n- inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\n- feeling tired (fatigue)\n- fever\n- abnormal liver function tests\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n- allergic reaction characterized by rash, swelling of the face, difficulty breathing (bronchial \n\nspasm) or anaphylactic shock\n- decreased numbers of red blood cells (anaemia)\n- yellow skin (jaundice)\n- severe and life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis)\n- hives (urticaria)\n- fluid under the skin (angioedema)\n- joint pain (arthralgia)\n- muscle pain (myalgia)\n- decreased blood phosphorus\n- increased blood pressure\n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people):\n- sudden and intense inflammation of the liver (fulminant hepatitis)\n- drug reaction with systemic symptoms (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms)\n\nThe following events have also been reported when Viramune has been used in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents: \n- decreased numbers of red blood cells or platelets\n- inflammation of the pancreas\n- decrease in or abnormal skin sensations \nThese events are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents and may be expected to occur \nwhen Viramune is used in combination with other agents; however, it is unlikely that these events are \ndue to treatment with Viramune.\n\nAdditional side effects in children and adolescents\nA reduction in white blood cells (granulocytopenia) can occur, which is more common in children. A \n\n\n\n142\n\nreduction in red blood cells (anaemia), which may be related to nevirapine therapy, is also more \ncommonly observed in children. As with rash symptoms, please inform your doctor of any side \neffects.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine.\n\n5. How to store Viramune \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the blister after \n\u201cEXP\u201d.

What you need to know before you take Viramune \n\nDo not take Viramune\n- if you are allergic to nevirapine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6 ).\n- if you have taken Viramune before and had to stop the treatment because you suffered from:\n\n- severe skin rash \n- skin rash with other symptoms for example:\n\n- fever\n- blistering\n- mouth sores\n- inflammation of the eye\n- swelling of the face\n- general swelling\n- shortness of breath\n\n\n\n147\n\n- muscle or joint pain\n- general feelings of illness\n- abdominal pain\n\n- hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions \n- inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\n\n- if you have severe liver disease \n- if you have had to stop Viramune treatment in the past because of changes in your liver function\n- if you are taking a medicine containing the herbal substance St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum \n\nperforatum). This herbal substance may stop Viramune from working properly.\n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Viramune.\nDuring the first 18 weeks of treatment with Viramune it is very important that you and your \ndoctor watch out for signs of liver or skin reactions. These can become severe and even life \nthreatening. You are at greatest risk of such a reaction during the first 6 weeks of treatment.\n\nIf you experience severe rash or hypersensitivity (allergic reactions that may appear in the \nform of rash) accompanied by other side effects such as \n- fever, \n- blistering, \n- mouth sores, \n- inflammation of the eye, \n- swelling of the face, \n- general swelling,\n- shortness of breath, \n- muscle or joint pain, \n- general feelings of illness, \n- or abdominal pain\nYOU SHOULD DISCONTINUE TAKING VIRAMUNE AND YOU MUST CONTACT your \ndoctor IMMEDIATELY as such reactions can be potentially life-threatening or lead to death.\n\nIf you ever have only mild rash symptoms without any other reaction please inform your \ndoctor immediately, who will advise you whether you should stop taking Viramune.\n\nIf you experience symptoms suggesting damage of the liver, such as \n- loss of appetite, \n- feeling sick (nausea), \n- vomiting, \n- yellow skin (jaundice), \n- abdominal pain\n\nyou should discontinue taking Viramune and must contact your doctor immediately.\n\nIf you develop severe liver, skin or hypersensitivity reactions whilst taking Viramune, NEVER \nTAKE VIRAMUNE again without referring to your doctor.\nYou must take the dose of Viramune as prescribed by your doctor. This is especially important \nwithin the first 14 days of treatment (see more information in \u201cHow to take Viramune\u201d).\n\nThe following patients are at increased risk of developing liver problems:\n- women\n- infected with hepatitis B or C\n- abnormal liver function tests\n- treatment-na\u00efve patients with higher CD4 cell counts at the start of Viramune therapy (women \n\nmore than 250 cells/mm\u00b3, men more than 400 cells/mm\u00b3)\n- pre-treated patients with detectable HIV-1 plasma viral load and higher CD4 cell counts at the \n\nstart of Viramune therapy (women more than 250 cells/mm\u00b3, men more than 400 cells/mm\u00b3)\n\nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection (AIDS-\n\n\n\n148\n\ndefining illness), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after \nanti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the \nbody\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no \nobvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately.\n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.\n\nChanges of body fat may occur in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Contact your \ndoctor if you notice changes in body fat (see section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). \n\nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe weakness of the \nimmune system and higher body mass index may be some of the many risk factors for developing this \ndisease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and \nshoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.\n\nIf you are taking nevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly please inform your doctor since he might \nneed to check your white blood cells.Do not take Viramune after an exposure to HIV unless you have \nbeen diagnosed with HIV and instructed to do so by your doctor. Viramune is not a cure for HIV \ninfection. Therefore, you may continue to develop infections and other illnesses associated with HIV \ninfection. You should, therefore, remain in regular contact with your doctor. You can still pass on HIV \nwhen taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss \nwith your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nPrednisone should not be used to treat a rash related to Viramune.\n\nIf you are taking oral contraceptives (e.g. \u201epill\u201c) or other hormonal methods of birth control during \ntreatment with Viramune, you should use a barrier contraception (e.g. condoms) in addition to prevent \npregnancy and further HIV transmission. \nIf you are receiving post-menopausal hormone therapy, ask your doctor for advice before taking this \nmedicine.\n\nIf you are taking or are prescribed rifampicin to treat tuberculosis please inform your doctor before \ntaking this medicine with Viramune. \n\nChildren and adolescents:\nViramune oral suspension can be taken by children of all age groups. Always follow the exact \ninstructions given by your child\u2019s doctor. \nViramune is also available as tablets. Viramune tablets can be taken by:\n- children 16 years of age or older \n- children under 16 years of age who:\n\n- weigh 50 kg or more \n- or have a body surface area above 1.25 square metres.\n\nOther medicines and Viramune\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Inform your doctor about all other medicines you are taking before you start taking \nViramune. Your doctor might need to monitor whether your other medicines are still working and \nadjust doses. Carefully read the package leaflet of all other HIV medicinal products you are taking in \ncombination with Viramune.\n\n\n\n149\n\nIt is particularly important that you tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken:\n- St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum, medicine to treat depression)\n- rifampicin (medicine to treat tuberculosis)\n- rifabutin (medicine to treat tuberculosis)\n- macrolides e.g. clarithromycin (medicine to treat bacterial infections)\n- fluconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)\n- ketoconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)\n- itraconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)\n- methadone (medicine used for treatment of opiate addicts)\n- warfarin (medicine to reduce blood clotting)\n- hormonal contraceptives (e.g. the \u201cpill\u201d)\n- atazanavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- lopinavir/ritonavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- fosamprenavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- efavirenz (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- etravirine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- rilpivirine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- delavirdine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- zidovudine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- boceprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis C)\n- telaprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis C)\n- elvitegravir/cobicistat (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n\nYour doctor will carefully monitor the effect of Viramune and any of these medicines if you are taking \nthem together. \n\nIf you are undergoing kidney dialysis, your doctor may consider a dose adjustment of Viramune. This \nis because Viramune can be partly washed out of your blood by dialysis.\n\nTaking Viramune with food and drink\nThere are no restrictions on taking Viramune with food and drink.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nYou should stop breast-feeding if you are taking Viramune. It is in general recommended that you do \nnot breast-feed if you have HIV infection because it is possible that your baby can become infected \nwith HIV through your breast milk.\n\nDriving and using machines\nYou may experience fatigue when taking Viramune. Use caution when engaging in activities such as \ndriving, using any tools or machines. If you experience fatigue you should avoid potentially hazardous \ntasks such as driving or using any tools or machines.\n\nViramune contains sucrose, sorbitol, methyl parahydroxybenzoate, propyl \nparahydroxybenzoate and sodium\nViramune oral suspension contains 150 mg sucrose per ml. This should be taken into account in \npatients with diabetes mellitus. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to \nsome sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. May be harmful to the teeth.\nViramune oral suspension contains 162 mg sorbitol per ml. Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If your \ndoctor has told you that you (or your child) have an intolerance to some sugars or you have been \ndiagnosed with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder in which a person cannot\nbreak down fructose, talk to your doctor before you (or your child) take or receive this medicine.\n\n\n\n150\n\nViramune oral suspension contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate. \nThese excipients can cause allergic reactions over time.\n\nViramune oral suspension contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n3. How to take Viramune \n\nYou should not use Viramune on its own. You must take it with at least two other antiretroviral \nmedicines. Your doctor will recommend the best medicines for you.\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.\n\nThe usual dose is the same for all adults (20 ml).\nYour child\u2019s doctor will calculate the dose for your child. The calculation will include your child's age \nand body weight, or body surface area. Make sure that your child's doctor clearly tells you what dose \nyou must give to your child. \n\nFor adults\n\nThe dose for adults is 20 ml (200 mg) once a day for the first 14 days of treatment (\u201dlead in\u201d period). \nAfter 14 days, the usual dose is 20 ml (200 mg) twice a day.\n\nIt is very important that you take only 20 ml of Viramune a day for the first 14 days (\u201clead-in\u201d period). \nIf you have any rash during this period, do not increase the dose but consult your doctor.\n\nViramune is also available as 200 mg tablets for adults (16 years of age and older).\n\nFor children\n\nThe dose for children is 4 mg/kg body weight or 150 mg/m2 body surface area once a day for the first \n14 days of treatment (\u201clead-in period\u201d). Thereafter your child will be switched to a twice daily dosing \nschedule and your child\u2019s doctor will decide the right dose based either on your child\u2019s weight or body \nsurface area. \n\nIt is very important that your child takes Viramune only once a day for the first 14 days (\u201clead-in\u201d \nperiod). If your child develops any rash during this period, do not increase the dose but consult your \nchild\u2019s doctor.\n\nViramune is also available as 200 mg tablets for older children, particularly adolescents, weighing \nmore than 50 kg or having a body surface of more than 1.25 m2. Your child's doctor will inform you \nexactly of the correct dose for your child. Your child\u2019s doctor will continually check your child\u2019s \nweight or body surface area to ensure the correct dose. \nIf you are uncertain please be sure to ask your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist.\n\nMeasure the exact dose using the measuring syringe and adapter supplied as follows:\n\n1. Shake the bottle gently.\n2. Open the bottle.\n3. Fit the plastic adapter onto the open bottle neck by first pressing and then screwing the \n\nadapter. Make sure that the adapter is fitted tightly.\n4. Insert the syringe into the adapter. Make sure that the syringe is tightly inserted.\n5. Turn the bottle upside down and gently draw out the required amount of Viramune oral \n\n\n\n151\n\nsuspension.\n6. The most that you can withdraw is 5 ml at a time. If you need a higher dose, repeat steps 4-5 \n\nabove.\n\nThe bottle can be kept sealed with the lid of the plastic adapter.\n\nIf you are an adult and choose to use another measuring device (e.g. cup or teaspoon) please make sure \nthat you take the whole dose. This is because some Viramune can remain in the cup or spoon.\n\nThe 14-day \u201dlead-in\u201d period has been shown to lower the risk of skin rash.\n\nAs Viramune must always be taken together with other HIV antiretroviral medicines, you should \nfollow the instructions for your other medicines carefully. These are supplied in the package leaflets \nfor those medicines.\n\nYou should continue to take Viramune for as long as instructed by your doctor.\n\nAs explained in 'Warnings and precautions\u2019, above, your doctor will monitor you with liver tests or \nfor undesirable effects such as rash. Depending on the outcome your doctor may decide to interrupt or \nstop Viramune treatment. Your doctor might then decide to restart you on a lower dose.\n\nViramune oral suspension is in a liquid suspension form and should only be taken by mouth. Shake the \nbottle well before you take your medicine. \n\nIf you take more Viramune than you should\nDo not take more Viramune than prescribed by your doctor and described in this leaflet. There is at \npresent little information on the effects of Viramune overdose. Consult your doctor if you have taken \nmore Viramune than you should. \n\nIf you forget to take Viramune\nTry not to miss a dose. If you notice that you have missed a dose within 8 hours of when it was due, \ntake the missed dose as soon as possible. If it has been more than 8 hours since the dose was due only\ntake the next dose at the usual time.\n\nIf you stop taking Viramune\nTaking all doses at the appropriate times:\n- greatly increases the effectiveness of your combination antiretroviral medicines \n- reduces the chances of your HIV infection becoming resistant to your antiretroviral medicines. \n\nIt is important that you continue taking Viramune correctly, as described above, unless your doctor \ninstructs you to stop.\n\nIf you stop taking Viramune for more than 7 days your doctor will instruct you to start the 14-day 'lead \nin' period (described above) once again, before returning to the twice daily dose.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\n\n\n152\n\nAs mentioned in 'Warnings and precautions', above, the most important side effects of Viramune\nare severe and life threatening skin reactions and serious liver damage. These reactions occur \nmainly in the first 18 weeks of treatment with Viramune. This is therefore an important period \nwhich requires close monitoring by your doctor.\n\nIf you ever observe any rash symptoms, inform your doctor immediately. \n\nWhen rash occurs it is normally mild to moderate. However, in some patients a rash, which appears as \na blistering skin reaction, can be severe or life-threatening (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis) and deaths have been recorded. Most of the cases of both severe rash and \nmild/moderate rash occur in the first six weeks of treatment.\n\nIf rash occurs and you also feel sick, you must stop treatment and visit your doctor immediately. Pay \nspecial attention to any rashes that your child develops. Although these may appear normal (for \nexample nappy rash), they might be rashes due to Viramune. If in doubt ask your child's doctor.\n\nHypersensitivity (allergic) reactions can occur. Such reactions may appear in the form of anaphylaxis \n(a severe form of allergic reaction) with symptoms such as: \n- rash\n- swelling of the face\n- difficulty breathing (bronchial spasm), \n- anaphylactic shock\nHypersensitivity reactions can also occur as rash with other side effects such as:\n- fever\n- blistering of your skin\n- mouth sores\n- inflammation of the eye\n- swelling of the face\n- general swelling\n- shortness of breath \n- muscle or joint pain\n- a reduction in the number of your white blood cells (granulocytopaenia)\n- general feelings of illness\n- severe problems with liver or kidneys (liver or kidney failure).\n\nTell your doctor immediately if you experience rash and any of the other side effects of a \nhypersensitivity (allergic) reaction. Such reactions can be life-threatening.\n\nAbnormal liver functioning has been reported with the use of Viramune. This includes some cases of \ninflammation of the liver (hepatitis), which can be sudden and intense (fulminant hepatitis), and liver \nfailure, which can be both fatal.\n\nTell your doctor if you experience any of the following clinical symptoms of liver damage:\n- loss of appetite\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- vomiting\n- yellow skin (jaundice)\n- abdominal pain.\n\nThe side effects described below have been experienced by patients given Viramune:\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\n- rash\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n- decreased number of white blood cells (granulocytopenia)\n\n\n\n153\n\n- allergic reactions (hypersensitivity)\n- headache\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- vomiting\n- abdominal pain\n- loose stools (diarrhoea)\n- inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\n- feeling tired (fatigue)\n- fever\n- abnormal liver function tests \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n- allergic reaction characterized by rash, swelling of the face, difficulty breathing (bronchial \n\nspasm) or anaphylactic shock\n- decreased numbers of red blood cells (anaemia)\n- yellow skin (jaundice)\n- severe and life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis)\n- hives (urticaria)\n- fluid under the skin (angioedema)\n- joint pain (arthralgia)\n- muscle pain (myalgia)\n- decreased blood phosphorus\n- increased blood pressure\n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people):\n- sudden and intense inflammation of the liver (fulminant hepatitis)\n- drug reaction with systemic symptoms (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms)\n\nThe following events have also been reported when Viramune has been used in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents:\n- decreased numbers of red blood cells or platelets\n- inflammation of the pancreas\n- decrease in or abnormal skin sensations.\nThese events are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents and may be expected to occur \nwhen Viramune is used in combination with other agents; however, it is unlikely that these events are \ndue to treatment with Viramune.\n\nAdditional side effects in children and adolescents\nA reduction in white blood cells (granulocytopenia) can occur, which is more common in children. A \nreduction in red blood cells (anaemia), which may be related to nevirapine therapy, is also more \ncommonly observed in children. As with rash symptoms, please inform your doctor of any side \neffects.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine.\n\n5. How to store Viramune \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the bottle after \n\u201cEXP\u201d. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \nViramune should be used within 6 months of opening the bottle.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n154\n\nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions.\n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

What do you need to know before you take Viramune\n3. How to take Viramune\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Viramune\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Viramune is and what it is used for\n\nViramune belongs to a group of medicines called antiretrovirals, used in the treatment of Human \nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) infection.\n\nThe active substance of your medicine is called nevirapine. Nevirapine belongs to a class of anti-HIV \nmedicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Reverse transcriptase is an \nenzyme that HIV needs in order to multiply. Nevirapine stops reverse transcriptase from working. By \nstopping reverse transcriptase from working, Viramune helps control HIV-1 infection. \n\nViramune is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adolescents and children three years and \nabove and able to swallow tablets. You must take Viramune together with other antiretroviral \nmedicines. Your doctor will recommend the best medicines for you.\n\nViramune prolonged-release tablets should only be used after a two-week treatment with another type \nof Viramune (immediate-release tablets or suspension) unless you are currently on Viramune and are \nswitching to the prolonged-release form.\n\nIf Viramune has been prescribed for your child, please note that all information in this leaflet is \naddressed to your child (please read \u201cyour child\u201d instead of \u201cyou\u201d).\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Viramune\n\nDo not take Viramune\n- if you are allergic to nevirapine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6 ).\n- if you have taken Viramune before and had to stop the treatment because you suffered from:\n\n- severe skin rash \n- skin rash with other symptoms for example:\n\n- fever\n\n\n\n158\n\n- blistering\n- mouth sores\n- inflammation of the eye\n- swelling of the face\n- general swelling\n- shortness of breath\n- muscle or joint pain\n- general feelings of illness\n- abdominal pain\n\n- hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions \n- inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\n\n- if you have severe liver disease \n- if you have had to stop Viramune treatment in the past because of changes in your liver function\n- if you are taking a medicine containing the herbal substance St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum \n\nperforatum). This herbal substance may stop Viramune from working properly.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Viramune.\nDuring the first 18 weeks of treatment with Viramune it is very important that you and your \ndoctor watch out for signs of liver or skin reactions. These can become severe and even life \nthreatening. You are at greatest risk of such a reaction during the first 6 weeks of treatment.\n\nIf you experience severe rash or hypersensitivity (allergic reactions that may appear in the \nform of rash) accompanied by other side effects such as \n\n- fever,\n- blistering, \n- mouth sores, \n- inflammation of the eye, \n- swelling of the face, \n- general swelling,\n- shortness of breath, \n- muscle or joint pain, \n- general feelings of illness, \n- or abdominal pain\n\nYOU SHOULD DISCONTINUE TAKING VIRAMUNE AND YOU MUST CONTACT your \ndoctor IMMEDIATELY as such reactions can be potentially life-threatening or lead to death.\nIf you ever have only mild rash symptoms without any other reaction please inform your \ndoctor immediately, who will advise you whether you should stop taking Viramune.\n\nIf you experience symptoms suggesting damage of the liver, such as \n- loss of appetite, \n- feeling sick (nausea), \n- vomiting, \n- yellow skin (jaundice), \n- abdominal pain\n\nyou should discontinue taking Viramune and must contact your doctor immediately.\n\nIf you develop severe liver, skin or hypersensitivity reactions whilst taking Viramune, NEVER \nTAKE VIRAMUNE again without referring to your doctor.\nYou must take the dose of Viramune as prescribed by your doctor. This is especially important \nwithin the first 14 days of treatment (see more information in \u201cHow to take Viramune\u201d).\n\nThe following patients are at increased risk of developing liver problems:\n- women\n- infected with hepatitis B or C\n- abnormal liver function tests\n\n\n\n159\n\n- treatment-na\u00efve patients with higher CD4 cell counts at the start of Viramune therapy (women \nmore than 250 cells/mm\u00b3, men more than 400 cells/mm\u00b3)\n\n- pre-treated patients with detectable HIV-1 plasma viral load and higher CD4 cell counts at the \nstart of Viramune therapy (women more than 250 cells/mm\u00b3, men more than 400 cells/mm\u00b3)\n\nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection (AIDS \ndefining illness), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after \nanti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the \nbody\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no \nobvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately.\n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.\n\nChanges of body fat may occur in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Contact your \ndoctor if you notice changes in body fat (see section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). \n\nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe weakness of the \nimmune system and higher body mass index may be some of the many risk factors for developing this \ndisease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and \nshoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.\n\nIf you are taking nevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly please inform your doctor since he might \nneed to check your white blood cells.\n\nDo not take Viramune after an exposure to HIV unless you have been diagnosed with HIV and \ninstructed to do so by your doctor. Viramune is not a cure for HIV infection. Therefore, you may \ncontinue to develop infections and other illnesses associated with HIV infection. You should therefore \nremain in regular contact with your doctor. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nPrednisone should not be used to treat a rash related to Viramune.\n\nIf you are taking oral contraceptives (e.g. \u201epill\u201c) or other hormonal methods of birth control during \ntreatment with Viramune, you should use a barrier contraception (e.g. condoms) in addition to prevent \npregnancy and further HIV transmission. \nIf you are receiving post-menopausal hormone therapy, ask your doctor for advice before taking this \nmedicine.\n\nIf you are taking or are prescribed rifampicin to treat tuberculosis please inform your doctor before \ntaking this medicine with Viramune. \n\nViramune prolonged-release tablets or parts of tablets may occasionally be passed and seen in the \nstool (faeces). These may look like whole tablets, but have not been found to affect the efficacy of \nnevirapine. Inform your doctor if you find tablet pieces in your faeces.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nViramune 100 mg prolonged-release tablets can be taken by children three years of age and above. \nAlways follow the exact instructions given by your child\u2019s doctor. \n\n\n\n160\n\nFor smaller children starting from birth an oral suspension liquid form is available. \n\nOther medicines and Viramune\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Inform your doctor about all other medicines you are taking before you start taking \nViramune. Your doctor might need to monitor whether your other medicines are still working and \nadjust doses. Carefully read the package leaflet of all other HIV medicines you are taking in \ncombination with Viramune.\n\nIt is particularly important that you tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken:\n\n- St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum, medicine to treat depression)\n- rifampicin (medicine to treat tuberculosis)\n- rifabutin (medicine to treat tuberculosis)\n- macrolides e.g. clarithromycin (medicine to treat bacterial infections)\n- fluconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)\n- ketoconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)\n- itraconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)\n- methadone (medicine used for treatment of opiate addicts)\n- warfarin (medicine to reduce blood clotting)\n- hormonal contraceptives (e.g. the \u201cpill\u201d)\n- atazanavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- lopinavir/ritonavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- fosamprenavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- efavirenz (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- etravirine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- rilpivirine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- delavirdine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- zidovudine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n-     boceprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis C)\n-     telaprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis C)\n- elvitegravir/cobicistat (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n\nYour doctor will carefully monitor the effect of Viramune and any of these medicines if you are taking \nthem together. \n\nTaking Viramune with food and drink\nThere are no restrictions on taking Viramune with food and drink.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nYou should stop breast-feeding if you are taking Viramune. It is in general recommended that you do \nnot breast-feed if you have HIV infection because it is possible that your baby can become infected \nwith HIV through your breast milk.\n\nDriving and using machines\nYou may experience fatigue when taking Viramune. Use caution when engaging in activities such as \ndriving, using any tools or machines. If you experience fatigue you should avoid potentially hazardous \ntasks such as driving or using any tools or machines.\n\nViramune contains lactose\nViramune prolonged-release tablets contain lactose (milk sugar).\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \n\n\n\n161\n\nbefore taking this medicinal product. \n\n3. How to take Viramune\n\nYou should not use Viramune on its own. You must take it with at least two other antiretroviral \nmedicines. Your doctor will recommend the best medicines for you.\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.\n\nDosage:\n\nFor adults\n\nViramune 100 mg prolonged-release tablets should not be used by adults. Instead Viramune 400 mg \nprolonged-release tablets should be used after the lead-in period.\n\nFor children\n\nViramune prolonged-release tablets are only to be used for children three years of age and above. For \nyounger children starting from birth an oral suspension is available.\n\nYour child\u2019s doctor will calculate the dose for your child. The calculation will include your child's age \nand body weight, or body surface area. Make sure that your child's doctor clearly tells you what dose \nyou must give to your child. \n\nThe dose for children is 4 mg/kg body weight or 150 mg/m2 body surface area once a day for the first \n14 days of treatment (\u201clead-in period\u201d) with Viramune oral suspension. Thereafter your child will be \nswitched to Viramune prolonged-release tablets once a day and your child\u2019s doctor will decide the \nright dose and prolonged-release tablet strength based either on your child\u2019s weight or body surface \narea. \n\nIt is very important that your child takes Viramune oral suspension only once a day for the first 14 \ndays (\u201clead-in\u201d period). If your child develops any rash during this period, do not start taking \nViramune prolonged-release tablets but consult your child\u2019s doctor.\n\nYour child\u2019s doctor will continually check your child\u2019s age, weight or body surface area to ensure the\ncorrect dose. If you are uncertain please be sure to ask your child\u2019s doctor.\n\nThe 14-day\u201dlead-in\u201d period has been shown to lower the risk of skin rash.\n\nPatients who are already on immediate-release tablets or oral suspension can switch to prolonged-\nrelease tablets without lead-in period.\n\nAs Viramune must always be taken together with other HIV antiretroviral medicines, you should \nfollow the instructions for your other medicines carefully. These are supplied in the package leaflets \nfor those medicines.\n\nViramune is also available as 400 mg prolonged-release tablets for a once daily usage after the lead-in \nphase for children depending on their age and body weight (body surface area). Your child's doctor \nwill inform you of the correct dose for your child. \n\nYou should continue to take Viramune for as long as instructed by your doctor.\n\n\n\n162\n\nAs explained in \u2018Warnings and precautions\u2019, above, your doctor will monitor you with liver tests or \nfor undesirable effects such as rash. Depending on the outcome your doctor may decide to interrupt or \nstop your Viramune treatment. Your doctor might then decide to restart you on a lower dose.\n\nIf you have a renal or hepatic dysfunction of any degree please use only Viramune 200 mg tablets or \nViramune 50 mg/5 ml oral suspension.\n\nOnly take Viramune prolonged-release tablets by mouth. Do not chew your prolonged-release tablets. \nYou may take Viramune with or without food.\n\nIf you take more Viramune than you should\nDo not take more Viramune than prescribed by your doctor and described in this leaflet. There is at \npresent little information on the effects of Viramune overdose. Consult your doctor if you have taken \nmore Viramune than you should. \n\nIf you forget to take Viramune\nTry not to miss a dose. If you notice you missed a dose within 12 hours of when it was due, take the \nmissed dose as soon as possible. If it has been more than 12 hours since the dose was due only take the \nnext dose at the usual time. \n\nIf you stop taking Viramune\nTaking all doses at the appropriate times:\n- greatly increases the effectiveness of your combination antiretroviral medicines \n- reduces the chances of your HIV infection becoming resistant to your antiretroviral medicines.\n\nIt is important that you continue taking Viramune correctly, as described above, unless your doctor \ninstructs you to stop.\n\nIf you stop taking Viramune for more than 7 days your doctor will instruct you to start the 14 day \n'lead-in' period with Viramune oral suspension (described above) once again, before returning to the \nonce daily dose with Viramune prolonged-release tablets.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nAs mentioned in \u2018Warnings and precautions', above, the most important side effects of Viramune\nare severe and life threatening skin reactions and serious liver damage. These reactions occur \nmainly in the first 18 weeks of treatment with Viramune. This is therefore an important period \nwhich requires close monitoring by your doctor.\n\nIf you ever observe any rash symptoms, inform your doctor immediately.\n\nWhen rash occurs it is normally mild to moderate. However, in some patients a rash, which appears as \na blistering skin reaction, can be severe or life-threatening (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis) and deaths have been recorded. Most of the cases of both severe rash and \nmild/moderate rash occur in the first six weeks of treatment. \n\nIf rash occurs and you also feel sick, you must stop treatment and visit your doctor immediately.\n\n\n\n163\n\nHypersensitivity (allergic) reactions can occur. Such reactions may appear in the form of anaphylaxis \n(a severe form of allergic reaction) with symptoms such as:\n- rash\n- swelling of the face\n- difficulty breathing (bronchial spasm)\n- anaphylactic shock\nHypersensitivity reactions can also occur as rash with other side effects such as:\n- fever\n- blistering of your skin \n- mouth sores\n- inflammation of the eye\n- swelling of the face\n- general swelling\n- shortness of breath\n- muscle or joint pain\n- a reduction in the numbers of your white blood cells (granulocytopenia)\n- general feelings of illness\n- severe problems with liver or kidneys (liver or kidney failure). \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you experience rash and any of the other side effects of a \nhypersensitivity (allergic) reaction. Such reactions can be life-threatening.\n\nAbnormal liver functioning has been reported with the use of Viramune. This includes some cases of \ninflammation of the liver (hepatitis), which can be sudden and intense (fulminant hepatitis), and liver \nfailure, which can be both fatal.\n\nTell your doctor if you experience any of the following clinical symptoms of liver damage:\n- loss of appetite\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- vomiting\n- yellow skin (jaundice)\n- abdominal pain \n\nThe side effects described below have been experienced by patients given Viramune 200 mg tablets \nduring the 14 day lead-in phase:\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n- rash\n- fever\n- headache\n- abdominal pain\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- loose stools (diarrhoea)\n- feeling tired (fatigue)\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n- allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) \n- allergic reaction characterized by rash, swelling of the face, difficulty breathing (bronchial \n\nspasm) or anaphylactic shock \n- drug reaction with systemic symptoms (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms)\n- sudden and intense inflammation of the liver (fulminant hepatitis)\n- severe and life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis)\n- yellow skin (jaundice)\n- hives (urticaria)\n- fluid under the skin (angioneurotic oedema)\n\n\n\n164\n\n- vomiting\n- muscle pain (myalgia)\n- joint pain (arthralgia)\n- decreased numbers of white blood cells (granulocytopenia)\n- abnormal liver function tests\n- decreased blood phosphorus\n- increased blood pressure\n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people):\n- inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\n- decreased numbers of red blood cells (anaemia)\n\nThe side effects described below have been experienced by patients given Viramune prolonged-release \ntablets once daily in the maintenance phase:\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n- rash\n- headache\n- abdominal pain\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\n- feeling tired (fatigue)\n- abnormal liver function tests\n- fever\n- vomiting \n- loose stools (diarrhoea)\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n- allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) \n- allergic reaction characterized by rash, swelling of the face, difficulty breathing (bronchial \n\nspasm) or anaphylactic shock \n- drug reaction with systemic symptoms (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms)\n- sudden and intense inflammation of the liver (fulminant hepatitis)\n- severe and life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis)\n- decreased numbers of red blood cells (anaemia)\n- decreased numbers of white blood cells (granulocytopenia)\n- yellow skin (jaundice)\n- hives (urticaria)\n- fluid under the skin (angioneurotic oedema)\n- muscle pain (myalgia)\n- joint pain (arthralgia)\n- decreased blood phosphorus\n- increased blood pressure\n\nThe following events have also been reported when Viramune has been used in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents: \n- decreased numbers of red blood cells or platelets\n- inflammation of the pancreas\n- decrease in or abnormal skin sensations \nThese events are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents and may be expected to occur \nwhen Viramune is used in combination with other agents; however, it is unlikely that these events are \ndue to treatment with Viramune.\n\nAdditional side effects in children and adolescents\nA reduction in white blood cells (granulocytopenia) can occur, which is more common in children. A \nreduction in red blood cells (anaemia), which may be related to nevirapine therapy, is also more \n\n\n\n165\n\ncommonly observed in children. As with rash symptoms, please inform your doctor of any side \neffects.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine.\n\n5. How to store Viramune\n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on bottle after \u201cEXP\u201d. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month.\nViramune should be used within 2 months of opening the bottle.\n\nThis medicine does not require any special storage conditions.\n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Viramune is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Viramune\n3. How to take Viramune\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Viramune\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Viramune is and what it is used for \n\nViramune belongs to a group of medicines called antiretrovirals, used in the treatment of Human \nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) infection.\n\nThe active substance of your medicine is called nevirapine. Nevirapine belongs to a class of anti-HIV \nmedicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Reverse transcriptase is an \nenzyme that HIV needs in order to multiply. Nevirapine stops reverse transcriptase from working. By \nstopping reverse transcriptase from working, Viramune helps control HIV-1 infection. \n\nViramune is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults, adolescents and children three years \nand above and able to swallow tablets. You must take Viramune together with other antiretroviral \nmedicines. Your doctor will recommend the best medicines for you.\n\nViramune prolonged-release tablets should only be used after a two-week treatment with another type \nof Viramune (immediate-release tablets or suspension) unless you are currently on Viramune and are \nswitching to the prolonged-release form.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Viramune \n\nDo not take Viramune\n- if you are allergic to nevirapine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6 ).\n- if you have taken Viramune before and had to stop the treatment because you suffered from:\n\n- severe skin rash \n- skin rash with other symptoms for example:\n\n- fever\n- blistering\n- mouth sores\n- inflammation of the eye\n- swelling of the face\n\n\n\n169\n\n- general swelling\n- shortness of breath\n- muscle or joint pain\n- general feelings of illness\n- abdominal pain\n\n- hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions \n- inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\n\n- if you have severe liver disease \n- if you have had to stop Viramune treatment in the past because of changes in your liver function\n- if you are taking a medicine containing the herbal substance St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum \n\nperforatum). This herbal substance may stop Viramune from working properly.\n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Viramune.\nDuring the first 18 weeks of treatment with Viramune it is very important that you and your \ndoctor watch out for signs of liver or skin reactions. These can become severe and even life \nthreatening. You are at greatest risk of such a reaction during the first 6 weeks of treatment.\n\nIf you experience severe rash or hypersensitivity (allergic reactions that may appear in the \nform of rash) accompanied by other side effects such as \n\n- fever, \n- blistering, \n- mouth sores, \n- inflammation of the eye, \n- swelling of the face, \n- general swelling,\n- shortness of breath, \n- muscle or joint pain, \n- general feelings of illness, \n- or abdominal pain\n\nYOU SHOULD DISCONTINUE TAKING VIRAMUNE AND YOU MUST CONTACT your \ndoctor IMMEDIATELY as such reactions can be potentially life-threatening or lead to death.\nIf you ever have only mild rash symptoms without any other reaction please inform your \ndoctor immediately, who will advise you whether you should stop taking Viramune.\n\nIf you experience symptoms suggesting damage of the liver, such as \n- loss of appetite, \n- feeling sick (nausea), \n- vomiting, \n- yellow skin (jaundice), \n- abdominal pain\n\nyou should discontinue taking Viramune and must contact your doctor immediately.\n\nIf you develop severe liver, skin or hypersensitivity reactions whilst taking Viramune, NEVER \nTAKE VIRAMUNE again without referring to your doctor.\nYou must take the dose of Viramune as prescribed by your doctor. This is especially important \nwithin the first 14 days of treatment (see more information in \u201cHow to take Viramune\u201d).\n\nThe following patients are at increased risk of developing liver problems:\n- women\n- infected with hepatitis B or C\n- abnormal liver function tests\n- treatment-na\u00efve patients with higher CD4 cell counts at the start of Viramune therapy (women \n\nmore than 250 cells/mm\u00b3, men more than 400 cells/mm\u00b3)\n- pre-treated patients with detectable HIV-1 plasma viral load and higher CD4 cell counts at the \n\nstart of Viramune therapy (women more than 250 cells/mm\u00b3, men more than 400 cells/mm\u00b3)\n\n\n\n170\n\nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection (AIDS \ndefining illness), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after \nanti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the \nbody\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no \nobvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately.\n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.\n\nChanges of body fat may occur in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Contact your \ndoctor if you notice changes in body fat (see section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). \n\nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe weakness of the \nimmune system and higher body mass index may be some of the many risk factors for developing this \ndisease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and \nshoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.\n\nIf you are taking nevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly please inform your doctor since he might \nneed to check your white blood cells.\n\nDo not take Viramune after an exposure to HIV unless you have been diagnosed with HIV and \ninstructed to do so by your doctor. Viramune is not a cure for HIV infection. Therefore, you may \ncontinue to develop infections and other illnesses associated with HIV infection. You should therefore \nremain in regular contact with your doctor. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nPrednisone should not be used to treat a rash related to Viramune.\n\nIf you are taking oral contraceptives (e.g. \u201epill\u201c) or other hormonal methods of birth control during \ntreatment with Viramune, you should use a barrier contraception (e.g. condoms) in addition to prevent \npregnancy and further HIV transmission. \nIf you are receiving post-menopausal hormone therapy, ask your doctor for advice before taking this \nmedicine.\n\nIf you are taking or are prescribed rifampicin to treat tuberculosis please inform your doctor before \ntaking this medicine with Viramune. \n\nViramune prolonged-release tablets or parts of tablets may occasionally be passed and seen in the \nstool (faeces). These may look like whole tablets, but have not been found to affect the efficacy of \nnevirapine. Inform your doctor if you find tablet pieces in your faeces.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nViramune 400 mg prolonged-release tablets can be taken by children if they:\n\n- are \uf0b3 8 years of age and weigh 43.8 kg or more\n- are older than 3 years of age and below 8 years of age and weigh 25 kg or more\n- have a body surface area of 1.17 square metres or above. \n\nFor smaller children smaller prolonged-release tablets or an oral suspension liquid form are available.\n\n\n\n171\n\nOther medicines and Viramune\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Inform your doctor about all other medicines you are taking before you start taking \nViramune. Your doctor might need to monitor whether your other medicines are still working and \nadjust doses. Carefully read the package leaflet of all other HIV medicines you are taking in \ncombination with Viramune.\n\nIt is particularly important that you tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken:\n\n- St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum, medicine to treat depression)\n- rifampicin (medicine to treat tuberculosis)\n- rifabutin (medicine to treat tuberculosis)\n- macrolides e.g. clarithromycin (medicine to treat bacterial infections)\n- fluconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)\n- ketoconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)\n- itraconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)\n- methadone (medicine used for treatment of opiate addicts)\n- warfarin (medicine to reduce blood clotting)\n- hormonal contraceptives (e.g. the \u201cpill\u201d)\n- atazanavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- lopinavir/ritonavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- fosamprenavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- efavirenz (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- etravirine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- rilpivirine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- delavirdine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- zidovudine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n- boceprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis C)\n-     telaprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis C)\n- elvitegravir/cobicistat (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)\n\nYour doctor will carefully monitor the effect of Viramune and any of these medicines if you are taking \nthem together. \n\nTaking Viramune with food and drink\nThere are no restrictions on taking Viramune with food and drink.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nYou should stop breast-feeding if you are taking Viramune. It is in general recommended that you do \nnot breast-feed if you have HIV infection because it is possible that your baby can become infected \nwith HIV through your breast milk.\n\nDriving and using machines\nYou may experience fatigue when taking Viramune. Use caution when engaging in activities such as \ndriving, using any tools or machines. If you experience fatigue you should avoid potentially hazardous \ntasks such as driving or using any tools or machines.\n\nViramune contains lactose\nViramune prolonged-release tablets contain lactose (milk sugar).\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicinal product. \n\n\n\n172\n\n3. How to take Viramune \n\nYou should not use Viramune on its own. You must take it with at least two other antiretroviral \nmedicines. Your doctor will recommend the best medicines for you.\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.\n\nDosage:\n\nAdults:\nThe dose is one 200 mg Viramune tablet per day for the first 14 days of treatment (\u201clead-in\u201d period). \nA separate treatment initiation pack with 200 mg Viramune tablets is available for this lead-in period. \nAfter 14 days, the usual dose is one 400 mg prolonged-release tablet once a day. \n\nIt is very important that you take only one Viramune tablet a day for the first 14 days (\u201clead-in\u201d \nperiod). If you have any rash during this period, do not start taking Viramune prolonged-release tablets \nbut consult your doctor.\n\nThe 14-day \u201dlead-in\u201d period has been shown to lower the risk of skin rash.\n\nPatients who are already on immediate-release tablets or oral suspension can switch to prolonged-\nrelease tablets without lead-in period.\n\nAs Viramune must always be taken together with other HIV antiretroviral medicines, you should \nfollow the instructions for your other medicines carefully. These are supplied in the package leaflets \nfor those medicines.\n\nViramune is also available as smaller prolonged-release tablets (for children 3 years of age and above \nafter the lead-in period) or as an oral suspension (for all age groups).\n\nYou should continue to take Viramune for as long as instructed by your doctor.\n\nAs explained in \u2018Warnings and precautions\u2019, above, your doctor will monitor you with liver tests or \nfor undesirable effects such as rash. Depending on the outcome your doctor may decide to interrupt or \nstop your Viramune treatment. Your doctor might then decide to restart you on a lower dose.\n\nIf you have a renal or hepatic dysfunction of any degree please use only Viramune 200 mg tablets or \nViramune 50 mg/5 ml oral suspension.\n\nOnly take Viramune prolonged-release tablets by mouth. Do not chew your prolonged-release tablets. \nYou may take Viramune with or without food.\n\nIf you take more Viramune than you should\nDo not take more Viramune than prescribed by your doctor and described in this leaflet. There is at \npresent little information on the effects of Viramune overdose. Consult your doctor if you have taken \nmore Viramune than you should. \n\nIf you forget to take Viramune\nTry not to miss a dose. If you notice you missed a dose within 12 hours of when it was due, take the \nmissed dose as soon as possible. If it has been more than 12 hours since the dose was due only take the \nnext dose at the usual time. \n\n\n\n173\n\nIf you stop taking Viramune\nTaking all doses at the appropriate times:\n- greatly increases the effectiveness of your combination antiretroviral medicines \n- reduces the chances of your HIV infection becoming resistant to your antiretroviral medicines.\n\nIt is important that you continue taking Viramune correctly, as described above, unless your doctor \ninstructs you to stop.\n\nIf you stop taking Viramune for more than 7 days your doctor will instruct you to start the 14 day \n'lead-in' period with Viramune tablets (described above) once again, before returning to the once daily \ndose with Viramune prolonged-release tablets.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nAs mentioned in \u2018Warnings and precautions', above, the most important side effects of Viramune\nare severe and life threatening skin reactions and serious liver damage. These reactions occur \nmainly in the first 18 weeks of treatment with Viramune. This is therefore an important period \nwhich requires close monitoring by your doctor.\n\nIf you ever observe any rash symptoms, inform your doctor immediately.\n\nWhen rash occurs it is normally mild to moderate. However, in some patients a rash, which appears as \na blistering skin reaction, can be severe or life-threatening (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis) and deaths have been recorded. Most of the cases of both severe rash and \nmild/moderate rash occur in the first six weeks of treatment. \n\nIf rash occurs and you also feel sick, you must stop treatment and visit your doctor immediately.\n\nHypersensitivity (allergic) reactions can occur. Such reactions may appear in the form of anaphylaxis \n(a severe form of allergic reaction) with symptoms such as:\n- rash\n- swelling of the face\n- difficulty breathing (bronchial spasm)\n- anaphylactic shock\nHypersensitivity reactions can also occur as rash with other side effects such as:\n- fever\n- blistering of your skin \n- mouth sores\n- inflammation of the eye\n- swelling of the face\n- general swelling\n- shortness of breath\n- muscle or joint pain\n- a reduction in the numbers of your white blood cells (granulocytopenia)\n- general feelings of illness\n- severe problems with liver or kidneys (liver or kidney failure). \n\n\n\n174\n\nTell your doctor immediately if you experience rash and any of the other side effects of a \nhypersensitivity (allergic) reaction. Such reactions can be life-threatening.\n\nAbnormal liver functioning has been reported with the use of Viramune. This includes some cases of \ninflammation of the liver (hepatitis), which can be sudden and intense (fulminant hepatitis), and liver \nfailure, which can be both fatal.\n\nTell your doctor if you experience any of the following clinical symptoms of liver damage:\n- loss of appetite\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- vomiting\n- yellow skin (jaundice)\n- abdominal pain \n\nThe side effects described below have been experienced by patients given Viramune 200 mg tablets \nduring the 14 day lead-in phase:\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n- rash\n- fever\n- headache\n- abdominal pain\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- loose stools (diarrhoea)\n- feeling tired (fatigue)\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n- allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) \n- allergic reaction characterized by rash, swelling of the face, difficulty breathing (bronchial \n\nspasm) or anaphylactic shock \n- drug reaction with systemic symptoms (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms)\n- sudden and intense inflammation of the liver (fulminant hepatitis)\n- severe and life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis)\n- yellow skin (jaundice)\n- hives (urticaria)\n- fluid under the skin (angioneurotic oedema)\n- vomiting\n- muscle pain (myalgia)\n- joint pain (arthralgia)\n- decreased numbers of white blood cells (granulocytopenia)\n- abnormal liver function tests\n- decreased blood phosphorus\n- increased blood pressure\n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people):\n- inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\n- decreased numbers of red blood cells (anaemia)\n\nThe side effects described below have been experienced by patients given Viramune prolonged-release \ntablets once daily in the maintenance phase:\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n- rash\n- headache\n- abdominal pain\n\n\n\n175\n\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\n- feeling tired (fatigue)\n- abnormal liver function tests\n- fever\n- vomiting \n- loose stools (diarrhoea)\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n- allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) \n- allergic reaction characterized by rash, swelling of the face, difficulty breathing (bronchial \n\nspasm) or anaphylactic shock \n- drug reaction with systemic symptoms (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms)\n- sudden and intense inflammation of the liver (fulminant hepatitis)\n- severe and life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis)\n- decreased numbers of red blood cells (anaemia)\n- decreased numbers of white blood cells (granulocytopenia)\n- yellow skin (jaundice)\n- hives (urticaria)\n- fluid under the skin (angioneurotic oedema)\n- muscle pain (myalgia)\n- joint pain (arthralgia)\n- decreased blood phosphorus\n- increased blood pressure\n\nThe following events have also been reported when Viramune has been used in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents: \n- decreased numbers of red blood cells or platelets\n- inflammation of the pancreas\n- decrease in or abnormal skin sensations \nThese events are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents and may be expected to occur \nwhen Viramune is used in combination with other agents; however, it is unlikely that these events are \ndue to treatment with Viramune.\n\nAdditional side effects in children and adolescents\nA reduction in white blood cells (granulocytopenia) can occur, which is more common in children. A \nreduction in red blood cells (anaemia), which may be related to nevirapine therapy, is also more \ncommonly observed in children. As with rash symptoms, please inform your doctor of any side \neffects.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine.\n\n5.

human immunodeficiency virus (hiv-1) infection. the active substance of your medicine is called nevirapine. nevirapine belongs to a class of anti-hiv medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nnrtis). reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that hiv needs in order to multiply. nevirapine stops reverse transcriptase from working. by stopping reverse transcriptase from working, viramune helps control hiv-1 infection. viramune is indicated for the treatment of hiv-1 infected adults, adolescents, and children of any age. you must take viramune together with other antiretroviral medicines. your doctor will recommend the best medicines for you. if viramune has been prescribed for your child, please note that all information in this leaflet is addressed to your

nevirapine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 ). - if you have taken viramune before and had to stop the treatment because you suffered from: - severe skin rash - skin rash with other symptoms for example: - fever - blistering - mouth sores - inflammation of the eye - swelling of the face 136 - general swelling - shortness of breath - muscle or joint pain - general feelings of illness - abdominal pain - hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions - inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) - if you have severe liver disease - if you have had to stop viramune treatment in the past because of changes in your liver function - if you are taking a medicine containing the herbal substance st. john's wort (hypericum perforatum). this herbal substance may stop viramune from working properly. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking viramune. during the first 18 weeks of treatment with viramune it is very important that you and your doctor watch out for signs of liver or skin reactions. these can become severe and even life threatening. you are at greatest risk of such a reaction during the first 6 weeks of treatment. if you experience severe rash or hypersensitivity (allergic reactions that may appear in the form of rash) accompanied by other side effects such as - fever, - blistering, - mouth sores, - inflammation of the eye, - swelling of the face, - general swelling, - shortness of breath, - muscle or joint pain, - general feelings of illness, - or abdominal pain you should discontinue taking viramune and you must contact your doctor immediately as such reactions can be potentially life-threatening or lead to death. if you ever have only mild rash symptoms without any other reaction please inform your doctor immediately, who will advise you whether you should stop taking viramune. if you experience symptoms suggesting damage of the liver, such as - loss of appetite, - feeling sick (nausea), - vomiting, - yellow skin (jaundice), - abdominal pain you should discontinue taking viramune and must contact your doctor immediately. if you develop severe liver, skin or hypersensitivity reactions whilst taking viramune, never take viramune again without referring to your doctor. you must take the dose of viramune as prescribed by your doctor. this is especially important within the first 14 days of treatment (see more information in \"how to take viramune\"). the following patients are at increased risk of developing liver problems: - women - infected with hepatitis b or c - abnormal liver function tests - treatment-na\u00efve patients with higher cd4 cell counts at the start of viramune therapy (women more than 250 cells/mm\u00b3, men more than 400 cells/mm\u00b3) - pre-treated patients with detectable hiv-1 plasma viral load and higher cd4 cell counts at the start of viramune therapy (women more than 250 cells/mm\u00b3, men more than 400 cells/mm\u00b3) 137 in some patients with advanced hiv infection (aids) and a history of opportunistic infection (aids defining illness), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-hiv treatment is started. it is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. if you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. in addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. if you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. changes of body fat may occur in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. contact your doctor if you notice changes in body fat (see section 4 \"possible side effects\"). some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). the length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe weakness of the immune system and higher body mass index may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. if you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. if you are taking nevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly please inform your doctor since he might need to check your white blood cells. do not take viramune after an exposure to hiv unless you have been diagnosed with hiv and instructed to do so by your doctor. viramune is not a cure for hiv infection. therefore, you may continue to develop infections and other illnesses associated with hiv infection. you should therefore remain in regular contact with your doctor. you can still pass on hiv when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people. prednisone should not be used to treat a rash related to viramune. if you are taking oral contraceptives (e.g. \u201epill\") or other hormonal methods of birth control during treatment with viramune, you should use a barrier contraception (e.g. condoms) in addition to prevent pregnancy and further hiv transmission. if you are receiving post-menopausal hormone therapy, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. if you are taking or are prescribed rifampicin to treat tuberculosis please inform your doctor before taking this medicine with viramune. children and adolescents viramune tablets can be taken by: - children 16 years of age or older - children under 16 years of age who: - weigh 50 kg or more - or have a body surface area above 1.25 square metres. for smaller children an oral suspension liquid form is available. other medicines and viramune tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. inform your doctor about all other medicines you are taking before you start taking 138 viramune. your doctor might need to monitor whether your other medicines are still working and adjust doses. carefully read the package leaflet of all other hiv medicinal products you are taking in combination with viramune. it is particularly important that you tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken: - st. john's wort (hypericum perforatum, medicine to treat depression) - rifampicin (medicine to treat tuberculosis) - rifabutin (medicine to treat tuberculosis) - macrolides e.g. clarithromycin (medicine to treat bacterial infections) - fluconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections) - ketoconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections) - itraconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections) - methadone (medicine used for treatment of opiate addicts) - warfarin (medicine to reduce blood clotting) - hormonal contraceptives (e.g. the \"pill\") - atazanavir (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - lopinavir/ritonavir (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - fosamprenavir (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - efavirenz (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - etravirine (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - rilpivirine (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - delavirdine (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - zidovudine (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - boceprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis c) - telaprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis c) - elvitegravir/cobicistat (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) your doctor will carefully monitor the effect of viramune and any of these medicines if you are taking them together. if you are undergoing kidney dialysis, your doctor may consider a dose adjustment of viramune. this is because viramune can be partly washed out of your blood by dialysis. taking viramune with food and drink there are no restrictions on taking viramune with food and drink. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. you should stop breast-feeding if you are taking viramune. it is in general recommended that you do not breast-feed if you have hiv infection because it is possible that your baby can become infected with hiv through your breast milk. driving and using machines you may experience fatigue when taking viramune. use caution when engaging in activities such as driving, using any tools or machines. if you experience fatigue you should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or using any tools or machines. viramune contains lactose and sodium viramune tablets contain lactose (milk sugar). if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. viramune tablets contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 139 'sodium-free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "viramune", "Type":

must take it with at least two other antiretroviral medicines. your doctor will recommend the best medicines for you. always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. dose: the dose is one 200 mg tablet per day for the first 14 days of treatment (\"lead-in\" period). after 14 days, the usual dose is one 200 mg tablet twice a day. it is very important that you take only one viramune tablet a day for the first 14 days (\"lead-in\" period). if you have any rash during this period, do not increase the dose but consult your doctor. the 14-day \"lead-in\" period has been shown to lower the risk of skin rash. as viramune must always be taken together with other hiv antiretroviral medicines, you should follow the instructions for your other medicines carefully. these are supplied in the package leaflets for those medicines. viramune is also available in liquid form as an oral suspension. this is particularly suitable if: - you have problems swallowing tablets - or you are a child weighing less than 50 kg - or you are a child having a body surface area less than 1.25 square metres (your doctor will work out your surface area). you should continue to take viramune for as long as instructed by your doctor. as explained in 'warnings and precautions', above, your doctor will monitor you with liver tests or for undesirable effects such as rash. depending on the outcome your doctor may decide to interrupt or stop your viramune treatment. your doctor might then decide to restart you on a lower dose. only take viramune tablets by mouth. do not chew your tablets. you may take viramune with or without food. if you take more viramune than you should do not take more viramune than prescribed by your doctor and described in this leaflet. there is at present little information on the effects of viramune overdose. consult your doctor if you have taken more viramune than you should. if you forget to take viramune try not to miss a dose. if you notice that you have missed a dose within 8 hours of when it was due, take the missed dose as soon as possible. if it has been more than 8 hours since the dose was due only take the next dose at the usual time. if you stop taking viramune taking all doses at the appropriate times: - greatly increases the effectiveness of your combination antiretroviral medicines 140 - reduces the chances of your hiv infection becoming resistant to your antiretroviral medicines. it is important that you continue taking viramune correctly, as described above, unless your doctor instructs you to stop. if you stop taking viramune for more than 7 days your doctor will instruct you to start the 14 day 'lead-in' period (described above) once again, before returning to the twice daily dose. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "viramune", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset":

levels of blood lipids and glucose. this is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves. your doctor will test for these changes. like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. as mentioned in 'warnings and precautions', above, the most important side effects of viramune are severe and life threatening skin reactions and serious liver damage. these reactions occur mainly in the first 18 weeks of treatment with viramune. this is therefore an important period which requires close monitoring by your doctor. if you ever observe any rash symptoms, inform your doctor immediately. when rash occurs it is normally mild to moderate. however, in some patients a rash, which appears as a blistering skin reaction, can be severe or life-threatening (stevens-johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and deaths have been recorded. most of the cases of both severe rash and mild/moderate rash occur in the first six weeks of treatment. if rash occurs and you also feel sick, you must stop treatment and visit your doctor immediately. hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions can occur. such reactions may appear in the form of anaphylaxis (a severe form of allergic reaction) with symptoms such as: - rash - swelling of the face - difficulty breathing (bronchial spasm) - anaphylactic shock hypersensitivity reactions can also occur as rash with other side effects such as: - fever - blistering of your skin - mouth sores - inflammation of the eye - swelling of the face - general swelling - shortness of breath - muscle or joint pain - a reduction in the numbers of your white blood cells (granulocytopenia) - general feelings of illness - severe problems with liver or kidneys (liver or kidney failure). tell your doctor immediately if you experience rash and any of the other side effects of a hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction. such reactions can be life-threatening. abnormal liver functioning has been reported with the use of viramune. this includes some cases of 141 inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), which can be sudden and intense (fulminant hepatitis), and liver failure, which can be both fatal. tell your doctor if you experience any of the following clinical symptoms of liver damage: - loss of appetite - feeling sick (nausea) - vomiting - yellow skin (jaundice) - abdominal pain the side effects described below have been experienced by patients given viramune: very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): - rash common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): - decreased numbers of white blood cells (granulocytopenia) - allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) - headache - feeling sick (nausea) - vomiting - abdominal pain - loose stools (diarrhoea) - inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) - feeling tired (fatigue) - fever - abnormal liver function tests uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): - allergic reaction characterized by rash, swelling of the face, difficulty breathing (bronchial spasm) or anaphylactic shock - decreased numbers of red blood cells (anaemia) - yellow skin (jaundice) - severe and life-threatening skin rashes (stevens-johnson syndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis) - hives (urticaria) - fluid under the skin (angioedema) - joint pain (arthralgia) - muscle pain (myalgia) - decreased blood phosphorus - increased blood pressure rare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people): - sudden and intense inflammation of the liver (fulminant hepatitis) - drug reaction with systemic symptoms (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) the following events have also been reported when viramune has been used in combination with other antiretroviral agents: - decreased numbers of red blood cells or platelets - inflammation of the pancreas - decrease in or abnormal skin sensations these events are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents and may be expected to occur when viramune is used in combination with other agents; however, it is unlikely that these events are due to treatment with viramune. additional side effects in children and adolescents a reduction in white blood cells (granulocytopenia) can occur, which is more common in children. a 142 reduction in red blood cells (anaemia), which may be related to nevirapine therapy, is also more commonly observed in children. as with rash symptoms, please inform your doctor of any side effects. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "viramune", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 61,
