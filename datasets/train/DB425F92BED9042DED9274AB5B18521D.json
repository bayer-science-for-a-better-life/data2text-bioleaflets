CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPioglitazone is indicated as second or third line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as described \nbelow: \n \nas monotherapy \n- in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise \n\nfor whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nas dual oral therapy in combination with \n- metformin, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic \n\ncontrol despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin \n- a sulphonylurea, only in adult patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom \n\nmetformin is contraindicated, with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated \ndose of monotherapy with a sulphonylurea. \n\n \nas triple oral therapy in combination with \n- metformin and a sulphonylurea, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with \n\ninsufficient glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy. \n \nPioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus adult patients \nwith insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of \ncontraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4). \n \nAfter initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess \nadequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an adequate \nresponse, pioglitazone should be discontinued. In light of potential risks with prolonged therapy, \nprescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of pioglitazone is maintained \n(see section 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPioglitazone treatment may be initiated at 15 mg or 30 mg once daily. The dose may be increased in \nincrements up to 45 mg once daily. \n \nIn combination with insulin, the current insulin dose can be continued upon initiation of pioglitazone \ntherapy. If patients report hypoglycaemia, the dose of insulin should be decreased. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2). Physicians should start \ntreatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually, particularly when \npioglitazone is used in combination with insulin (see section 4.4 Fluid retention and cardiac failure). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine \nclearance >4 mL/min) (see section 5.2). No information is available from dialysed patients therefore \npioglitazone should not be used in such patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPioglitazone should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Glustin in children and adolescents under 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nPioglitazone tablets are taken orally once daily with or without food. Tablets should be swallowed \nwith a glass of water. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nPioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with: \n \n- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n- cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (NYHA stages I to IV) \n- hepatic impairment \n- diabetic ketoacidosis \n- current bladder cancer or a history of bladder cancer  \n- uninvestigated macroscopic haematuria \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFluid retention and cardiac failure \n \nPioglitazone can cause fluid retention, which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure. When \ntreating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure \n(e.g. prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease or the elderly), physicians \nshould start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually. Patients should be \nobserved for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema; particularly those with \nreduced cardiac reserve. There have been post-marketing cases of cardiac failure reported when \npioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure. \nPatients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when \npioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Since insulin and pioglitazone are both associated \nwith fluid retention, concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema. Post marketing \ncases of peripheral oedema and cardiac failure have also been reported in patients with concomitant \nuse of pioglitazone and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors. \nPioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs. \n \nA cardiovascular outcome study of pioglitazone has been performed in patients under 75 years with \ntype 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease. Pioglitazone or placebo was \nadded to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for up to 3.5 years. This study showed an \nincrease in reports of heart failure; however this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study.  \n \nElderly \n \nCombination use with insulin should be considered with caution in the elderly because of increased \nrisk of serious heart failure. \n \nIn light of age- related risks (especially bladder cancer, fractures and heart failure), the balance of \nbenefits and risks should be considered carefully both before and during treatment in the elderly. \n \nBladder Cancer \n \nCases of bladder cancer were reported more frequently in a meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials \nwith pioglitazone (19 cases from 12,506 patients, 0.15%) than in control groups (7 cases from \n10,212 patients, 0.07%) HR=2.64 (95% CI 1.11-6.31, p=0.029). After excluding patients in whom \nexposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were \n7 cases (0.06%) on pioglitazone and 2 cases (0.02%) in control groups. Epidemiological studies have \nalso suggested a small increased risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients treated with pioglitazone, \nalthough not all studies identified a statistically significant increased risk. \n \nRisk factors for bladder cancer should be assessed before initiating pioglitazone treatment (risks \ninclude age, smoking history, exposure to some occupational or chemotherapy agents \ne.g. cyclophosphamide or prior radiation treatment in the pelvic region). Any macroscopic haematuria \nshould be investigated before starting pioglitazone therapy.  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nPatients should be advised to promptly seek the attention of their physician if macroscopic haematuria \nor other symptoms such as dysuria or urinary urgency develop during treatment. \n \nMonitoring of liver function \n \nThere have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience (see \nsection 4.8). It is recommended, therefore, that patients treated with pioglitazone undergo periodic \nmonitoring of liver enzymes. Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with \npioglitazone in all patients. Therapy with pioglitazone should not be initiated in patients with \nincreased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT >2.5 x upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence \nof liver disease.  \n \nFollowing initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored \nperiodically based on clinical judgement. If ALT levels are increased to 3 x upper limit of normal \nduring pioglitazone therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible. If ALT \nlevels remain > 3 x the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued. If any patient develops \nsymptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, \nabdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked. The decision \nwhether to continue the patient on therapy with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical judgement \npending laboratory evaluations. If jaundice is observed, the medicinal product should be discontinued. \n \nWeight gain \n \nIn clinical trials with pioglitazone there was evidence of dose related weight gain, which may be due \nto fat accumulation and in some cases associated with fluid retention. In some cases weight increase \nmay be a symptom of cardiac failure; therefore weight should be closely monitored. Part of the \ntreatment of diabetes is dietary control. Patients should be advised to adhere strictly to a \ncalorie-controlled diet. \n \nHaematology \n \nThere was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin (4% relative reduction) and haematocrit (4.1% \nrelative reduction) during therapy with pioglitazone, consistent with haemodilution. Similar changes \nwere seen in metformin (haemoglobin 3-4% and haematocrit 3.6-4.1% relative reductions) and to a \nlesser extent sulphonylurea and insulin (haemoglobin 1-2% and haematocrit 1-3.2% relative \nreductions) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nAs a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity, patients receiving pioglitazone in dual or triple oral \ntherapy with a sulphonylurea or in dual therapy with insulin may be at risk for dose-related \nhypoglycaemia, and a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin may be necessary. \n \nEye disorders \n \nPost-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual \nacuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone. Many of these patients \nreported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association \nbetween pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular \noedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological referral \nshould be considered. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nOthers \n \nAn increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse reactions \nof bone fracture from randomised, controlled, double blind clinical trials in over 8100 pioglitazone \nand 7400 comparator treated patients, on treatment for up to 3.5 years. \n \nFractures were observed in 2.6% of women taking pioglitazone compared to 1.7% of women treated \nwith a comparator. No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.3%) \nversus comparator (1.5%). \n \nThe fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with \npioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator. The \nobserved excess risk of fractures for women in this dataset on pioglitazone is therefore 0.8 fractures \nper 100 patient years of use. \n \nIn the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study, 44/870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) \nof pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures \nper 100 patient years) of female patients treated with comparator. No increase in fracture rates was \nobserved in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus comparator (2.1%). \n \nSome epidemiological studies have suggested a similarly increased risk of fracture in both men and \nwomen. The risk of fractures should be considered in the long term care of patients treated with \npioglitazone (see section 4.8). \n \nAs a consequence of enhancing insulin action, pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic \novarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation. These patients may be at risk of pregnancy. \nPatients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if \npregnancy occurs, the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.6). \n \nPioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 \ninhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Glycaemic control should be monitored \nclosely. Pioglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic \ntreatment should be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nGlustin tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to patients with \nrare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics \nor pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin. Co-administration of \npioglitazone with sulphonylureas does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sulphonylurea. \nStudies in man suggest no induction of the main inducible cytochrome P450, 1A, 2C8/9 and 3A4. \nIn vitro studies have shown no inhibition of any subtype of cytochrome P450. Interactions with \nsubstances metabolised by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel \nblockers, and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected. \n \nCo-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported \nto result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone. Since there is a potential for an increase in \ndose-related adverse events, a decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be needed when gemfibrozil is \nconcomitantly administered. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered (see \nsection 4.4). Co-administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) \nis reported to result in a 54% decrease in AUC of pioglitazone. The pioglitazone dose may need to be \nincreased when rifampicin is concomitantly administered. Close monitoring of glycaemic control \nshould be considered (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate human data to determine the safety of pioglitazone during pregnancy. Foetal \ngrowth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone. This was attributable to the \naction of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance \nthat occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal \ngrowth. The relevance of such a mechanism in humans is unclear and pioglitazone should not be used \nin pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nPioglitazone has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether \npioglitazone is secreted in human milk. Therefore, pioglitazone should not be administered to \nbreast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \n \nIn animal fertility studies there was no effect on copulation, impregnation or fertility index. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGlustin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However patients who \nexperience visual disturbance should be cautious when driving or using machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported in excess (> 0.5%) of placebo and as more than an isolated case in patients \nreceiving pioglitazone in double-blind studies are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system \norgan class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10); common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare \n(< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each system organ \nclass, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing incidence followed by decreasing \nseriousness. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nAdverse \nreaction \n\nFrequency of adverse reactions of pioglitazone by treatment regimen \n \n \n\nMono-\ntherapy \n\nCombination \n \n\nwith \nmetformin \n\n \nwith \n\nsulpho-\nnylurea \n\n \nwith \n\nmetformin \nand sulpho-\n\nnylurea \n\n \nwith insulin \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n \n\nupper respiratory \ntract infection \n\ncommon common common common common \n\nbronchitis     common \nsinusitis uncommon uncommon uncommon uncommon uncommon \nNeoplasms \nbenign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n(including cysts \nand polyps) \n\n \n\nbladder cancer uncommon uncommon uncommon uncommon uncommon \nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n \n\nanaemia  common    \nImmune System \nDisorders \n\n \n\nhypersensitivity \nand allergic \nreactions1 \n\nnot known not known not known not known not known \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n \n\nhypo-glycaemia   uncommon very \ncommon \n\ncommon \n\nappetite \nincreased \n\n  uncommon   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n \n\nhypo-aesthesia common common common common common \nheadache  common uncommon   \ndizziness   common   \ninsomnia uncommon uncommon uncommon uncommon uncommon \nEye disorders  \nvisual \ndisturbance2 \n\ncommon common uncommon   \n\nmacular oedema not known not known not known not known not known \nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n \n\nvertigo   uncommon   \nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n \n\nheart failure3     common \n\n\n\n9 \n\nAdverse \nreaction \n\nFrequency of adverse reactions of pioglitazone by treatment regimen \n \n \n\nMono-\ntherapy \n\nCombination \n \n\nwith \nmetformin \n\n \nwith \n\nsulpho-\nnylurea \n\n \nwith \n\nmetformin \nand sulpho-\n\nnylurea \n\n \nwith insulin \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n \n\ndyspnoea     common \nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n \n\nflatulence  uncommon common   \nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n \n\nsweating   uncommon   \nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n \n\nfracture bone4 common common common common common \narthralgia  common  common common \nback pain     common \nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n \n\nhaematuria  common    \nglycosuria   uncommon   \nproteinuria   uncommon   \nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders \n\n \n\nerectile \ndysfunction \n\n common    \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n \n\noedema5     very \ncommon \n\nfatigue   uncommon   \nInvestigations  \nweight increased6 common common common common common \nblood creatine \nphospho-kinase \nincreased \n\n   common  \n\nincreased lactic \ndehydro-genase \n\n  uncommon   \n\nalanine \naminotransferase \nincreased7 \n\nnot known not known not known not known not known \n\n \n\njavascript:%20OpenTerm%20('PT:10001551')\njavascript:%20OpenTerm%20('PT:10001551')\njavascript:%20OpenTerm%20('PT:10001551')\n\n\n10 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \n1 Postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with pioglitazone have been \nreported. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria.  \n \n2 Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood \nglucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens as seen with other \nhypoglycaemic treatments. \n \n3 In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was \nthe same as in placebo, metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups, but was increased when used \nin combination therapy with insulin. In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major \nmacrovascular disease, the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6% higher with pioglitazone than \nwith placebo, when added to therapy that included insulin. However, this did not lead to an increase \nin mortality in this study. In this study in patients receiving pioglitazone and insulin, a higher \npercentage of patients with heart failure was observed in patients aged \u2265 65 years compared with \nthose less than 65 years (9.7% compared to 4.0%). In patients on insulin with no pioglitazone the \nincidence of heart failure was 8.2% in those \u2265 65 years compared to 4.0% in patients less than \n65 years. Heart failure has been reported with marketing use of pioglitazone, and more frequently \nwhen pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure \n(see section 4.4). \n \n4 A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse reactions of bone fractures from randomised, \ncomparator controlled, double blind clinical trials in over 8,100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated \ngroups and 7,400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration. A higher rate of \nfractures was observed in women taking pioglitazone (2.6%) versus comparator (1.7%). No increase \nin fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.3%) versus comparator (1.5%). \nIn the 3.5 year PROactive study, 44/870 (5.1%) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced \nfractures compared to 23/905 (2.5%) of female patients treated with comparator. No increase in \nfracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus comparator (2.1%). \nPost-marketing, bone fractures have been reported in both male and female patients (see section 4.4). \n \n5 Oedema was reported in 6-9% of patients treated with pioglitazone over one year in controlled \nclinical trials. The oedema rates for comparator groups (sulphonylurea, metformin) were 2-5%. The \nreports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of \ntreatment. \n \n6 In active comparator controlled trials mean weight increase with pioglitazone given as monotherapy \nwas 2-3 kg over one year. This is similar to that seen in a sulphonylurea active comparator group. In \ncombination trials pioglitazone added to metformin resulted in mean weight increase over one year of \n1.5 kg and added to a sulphonylurea of 2.8 kg. In comparator groups addition of sulphonylurea to \nmetformin resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.3 kg and addition of metformin to a sulphonylurea a \nmean weight loss of 1.0 kg.  \n \n7 In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the \nupper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea \ncomparator groups. Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone. Rare \ncases of elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular dysfunction have occurred in post-marketing \nexperience. Although in very rare cases fatal outcome has been reported, causal relationship has not \nbeen established. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical studies, patients have taken pioglitazone at higher than the recommended highest dose of \n45 mg daily. The maximum reported dose of 120 mg/day for four days, then 180 mg/day for seven \ndays was not associated with any symptoms. \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur in combination with sulphonylureas or insulin. Symptomatic and general \nsupportive measures should be taken in case of overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, blood glucose lowering drugs; excl. insulins; \nATC code: A10BG03. \n \nPioglitazone effects may be mediated by a reduction of insulin resistance. Pioglitazone appears to act \nvia activation of specific nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) \nleading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals. Treatment \nwith pioglitazone has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose output and to increase peripheral glucose \ndisposal in the case of insulin resistance. \n \nFasting and postprandial glycaemic control is improved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The \nimproved glycaemic control is associated with a reduction in both fasting and postprandial plasma \ninsulin concentrations. A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to \ntwo years in order to assess time to treatment failure (defined as appearance of HbA1c \u2265 8.0% after the \nfirst six months of therapy). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed shorter time to treatment failure in \npatients treated with gliclazide, compared with pioglitazone. At two years, glycaemic control (defined \nas HbA1c < 8.0%) was sustained in 69% of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared with 50% of \npatients on gliclazide. In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with \ngliclazide when added to metformin, glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in \nHbA1c was similar between treatment groups after one year. The rate of deterioration of HbA1c during \nthe second year was less with pioglitazone than with gliclazide. \n \nIn a placebo controlled trial, patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin \noptimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months. Patients receiving \npioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45% compared with those continuing on insulin \nalone, and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group. \n \nHOMA analysis shows that pioglitazone improves beta cell function as well as increasing insulin \nsensitivity. Two-year clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effect. \n \nIn one year clinical trials, pioglitazone consistently gave a statistically significant reduction in the \nalbumin/creatinine ratio compared to baseline. \n \nThe effect of pioglitazone (45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo) was studied in a small 18-week trial in \ntype 2 diabetics. Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain. Visceral fat was \nsignificantly decreased, while there was an increase in extra-abdominal fat mass. Similar changes in \nbody fat distribution on pioglitazone have been accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity. \nIn most clinical trials, reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased \nHDL-cholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo, with small, but not clinically \nsignificant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nIn clinical trials of up to two years duration, pioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free \nfatty acids, and increased HDL cholesterol levels, compared with placebo, metformin or gliclazide. \nPioglitazone did not cause statistically significant increases in LDL cholesterol levels compared with \nplacebo, whilst reductions were observed with metformin and gliclazide. In a 20-week study, as well \nas reducing fasting triglycerides, pioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an \neffect on both absorbed and hepatically synthesised triglycerides. These effects were independent of \npioglitazone\u2019s effects on glycaemia and were statistically significantly different to glibenclamide. \n \nIn PROactive, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5,238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \npre-existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to \nexisting antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy, for up to 3.5 years. The study population had an \naverage age of 62 years; the average duration of diabetes was 9.5 years. Approximately one third of \npatients were receiving insulin in combination with metformin and/or a sulphonylurea. To be eligible \npatients had to have had one or more of the following: myocardial infarction, stroke, percutaneous \ncardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery \ndisease, or peripheral arterial obstructive disease. Almost half of the patients had a previous \nmyocardial infarction and approximately 20% had had a stroke. Approximately half of the study \npopulation had at least two of the cardiovascular history entry criteria. Almost all subjects (95%) were \nreceiving cardiovascular medicinal products (beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, acetylsalicylic \nacid, statins, fibrates). \n \nAlthough the study failed regarding its primary endpoint, which was a composite of all-cause \nmortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, major leg amputation, \ncoronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation, the results suggest that there are no long-term \ncardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone. However, the incidences of oedema, weight \ngain and heart failure were increased. No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies \nwith Glustin in all subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes mellitus. See section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration, pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations of \nunchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration. Proportional increases of \nthe plasma concentration were observed for doses from 2-60 mg. Steady state is achieved after \n4-7 days of dosing. Repeated dosing does not result in accumulation of the compound or metabolites. \nAbsorption is not influenced by food intake. Absolute bioavailability is greater than 80%. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 L/kg. \n \nPioglitazone and all active metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein (> 99%). \n \nBiotransformation \n \nPioglitazone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene groups. \nThis is predominantly via cytochrome P450 2C8 although other isoforms may be involved to a lesser \ndegree. Three of the six identified metabolites are active (M-II, M-III, and M-IV). When activity, \nconcentrations and protein binding are taken into account, pioglitazone and metabolite M-III \n\n\n\n13 \n\ncontribute equally to efficacy. On this basis M-IV contribution to efficacy is approximately three-fold \nthat of pioglitazone, whilst the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown no evidence that pioglitazone inhibits any subtype of cytochrome P450. \nThere is no induction of the main inducible P450 isoenzymes 1A, 2C8/9, and 3A4 in man. \n \nInteraction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics \nor pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin. Concomitant \nadministration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) or with \nrifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to increase or decrease, respectively, the \nplasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5) \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing oral administration of radiolabelled pioglitazone to man, recovered label was mainly in \nfaeces (55%) and a lesser amount in urine (45%). In animals, only a small amount of unchanged \npioglitazone can be detected in either urine or faeces. The mean plasma elimination half-life of \nunchanged pioglitazone in man is 5 to 6 hours and for its total active metabolites 16 to 23 hours.  \n \nElderly \n \nSteady state pharmacokinetics are similar in patients age 65 and over and young subjects. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment, plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower \nthan those seen in subjects with normal renal function, but oral clearance of parent substance is \nsimilar. Thus free (unbound) pioglitazone concentration is unchanged. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \n \nTotal plasma concentration of pioglitazone is unchanged, but with an increased volume of \ndistribution. Intrinsic clearance is therefore reduced, coupled with a higher unbound fraction of \npioglitazone. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn toxicology studies, plasma volume expansion with haemodilution, anaemia, and reversible eccentric \ncardiac hypertrophy was consistently apparent after repeated dosing of mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. \nIn addition, increased fatty deposition and infiltration were observed. These findings were observed \nacross species at plasma concentrations \u2264 4 times the clinical exposure. Foetal growth restriction was \napparent in animal studies with pioglitazone. This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in \ndiminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during \npregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth.  \n \nPioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro \ngenotoxicity assays. An increased incidence of hyperplasia (males and females) and tumours (males) \nof the urinary bladder epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years.  \n \nThe formation and presence of urinary calculi with subsequent irritation and hyperplasia was \npostulated as the mechanistic basis for the observed tumourigenic response in the male rat. A \n24-month mechanistic study in male rats demonstrated that administration of pioglitazone resulted in \nan increased incidence of hyperplastic changes in the bladder. Dietary acidification significantly \ndecreased but did not abolish the incidence of tumours. The presence of microcrystals exacerbated the \nhyperplastic response but was not considered to be the primary cause of hyperplastic changes. The \nrelevance to humans of the tumourigenic findings in the male rat cannot be excluded. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \nThere was no tumorigenic response in mice of either sex. Hyperplasia of the urinary bladder was not \nseen in dogs or monkeys treated with pioglitazone for up to 12 months. \n \nIn an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other \nthiazolidinediones increased tumour multiplicity in the colon. The relevance of this finding is \nunknown. \n \nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA) \nNo environmental impact is anticipated from the clinical use of pioglitazone \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Glustin is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Glustin \n3. How to take Glustin \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Glustin \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Glustin is and what it is used for \n \nGlustin contains pioglitazone. It is an anti-diabetic medicine used to treat type 2 (non-insulin \ndependent) diabetes mellitus in adults, when metformin is not suitable or has failed to work \nadequately. This is the diabetes that usually develops in adulthood. \n \nGlustin helps control the level of sugar in your blood when you have type 2 diabetes by helping your \nbody make better use of the insulin it produces. Your doctor will check whether Glustin is working \n3 to 6 months after you start taking it. \n \nGlustin may be used on its own in patients who are unable to take metformin, and where treatment \nwith diet and exercise has failed to control blood sugar or may be added to other therapies (such as \nmetformin, sulphonylurea or insulin) which have failed to provide sufficient control of blood sugar. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Glustin \n \nDo not take Glustin: \n- if you are allergic to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have heart failure or have had heart failure in the past. \n- if you have liver disease. \n- if you have had diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes causing rapid weight loss, \n\nnausea or vomiting). \n- if you have or have ever had bladder cancer. \n- if you have blood in your urine that your doctor has not checked. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Glustin (also see section 4) \n- if you retain water (fluid retention) or have heart failure problems in particular if you are over \n\n75 years old. If you take anti-inflammatory medicines which can also cause fluid retention and \nswelling, you must also tell your doctor. \n\n- if you have a special type of diabetic eye disease called macular oedema (swelling of the back \nof the eye). \n\n- if you have cysts on your ovaries (polycystic ovary syndrome). There may be an increased \npossibility of becoming pregnant because you may ovulate again when you take Glustin. If this \napplies to you, use appropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an unplanned \npregnancy. \n\n- if you have a problem with your liver or heart. Before you start taking Glustin you will have a \nblood sample taken to check your liver function. This check may be repeated at intervals. Some \npatients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with Glustin and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of \nbreath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \nIf you take Glustin with other medicines for diabetes, it is more likely that your blood sugar could fall \nbelow the normal level (hypoglycaemia).  \n \nYou may also experience a reduction in blood count (anaemia). \n \nBroken bones \nA higher number of bone fractures was seen in patients, particularly women taking pioglitazone. Your \ndoctor will take this into account when treating your diabetes. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nUse in children and adolescents under 18 years is not recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Glustin \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nYou can usually continue to take other medicines whilst you are being treated with Glustin. However, \ncertain medicines are especially likely to affect the amount of sugar in your blood: \n-  gemfibrozil (used to lower cholesterol) \n-  rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis and other infections) \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your blood sugar will be checked, and \nyour dose of Glustin may need to be changed. \n \nGlustin with food and drink \nYou may take your tablets with or without food. You should swallow the tablets with a glass of water.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nTell your doctor if  \n- you are, you think you might be or are planning to become pregnant.  \n- you are breast-feeding or if you are planning to breast-feed your baby.  \nYour doctor will advise you to discontinue this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine will not affect your ability to drive or use machines but take care if you experience \nabnormal vision. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nGlustin contains lactose monohydrate \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking Glustin. \n \n \n3. How to take Glustin \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe usual starting dose is one tablet of 15 mg or of 30 mg of pioglitazone to be taken once daily. Your \ndoctor may increase the dose to a maximum of 45 mg once a day. Your doctor will tell you the dose to \ntake. \n \nIf you have the impression that the effect of Glustin is too weak, talk to your doctor. \n \nWhen Glustin is taken in combination with other medicines used to treat diabetes (such as insulin, \nchlorpropamide, glibenclamide, gliclazide, tolbutamide) your doctor will tell you whether you need to \ntake a smaller dose of your medicines. \n \nYour doctor will ask you to have blood tests periodically during treatment with Glustin. This is to \ncheck that your liver is working normally. \n \nIf you are following a special diet for diabetes, you should continue with this while you are taking \nGlustin. \n \nYour weight should be checked at regular intervals; if your weight increases, inform your doctor. \n \nIf you take more Glustin than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, or if someone else or a child takes your medicine, talk to a \ndoctor or pharmacist immediately. Your blood sugar could fall below the normal level and can be \nincreased by taking sugar. It is recommended that you carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or \nsugary fruit juice. \n \nIf you forget to take Glustin \nTake Glustin daily as prescribed. However if you miss a dose, just carry on with the next dose as \nnormal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n \nIf you stop taking Glustin \nGlustin should be used every day to work properly. If you stop using Glustin, your blood sugar may \ngo up. Talk to your doctor before stopping this treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIn particular, patients have experienced the following serious side effects: \n \nHeart failure has been experienced commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in patients taking \nGlustin in combination with insulin. Symptoms are unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in \nweight or localised swelling (oedema). If you experience any of these, especially if you are over the \nage of 65, seek medical advice straight away. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nBladder cancer has been experienced uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) in patients \ntaking Glustin.

The data presented during the current \nreporting period did not provide new information that would allow for further reduction, mitigation, \nor characterisation of these risks. Based on the data presented, the risk minimisation measures in the \napproved product information are considered adequate for the listed safety concerns. \nGiven the accumulation of data since the implementation of the additional risk minimisation \nmeasures, the PRAC agreed with the MAH\u2019s proposal to remove the additional risk minimisation \nmeasures. As a consequence, the conditions or restrictions with regards to the safe and effective use \nof the medicinal product should be updated to remove the additional risk minimisation measures. The \nRMP has been updated in accordance. \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)  \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for glimepiride / pioglitazone hydrochloride, metformin / \npioglitazone, pioglitazone the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal \nproduct(s) containing glimepiride / pioglitazone hydrochloride, metformin / pioglitazone, pioglitazone \nis unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information. \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

better use of the insulin it produces. your doctor will check whether glustin is working 3 to 6 months after you start taking it. glustin may be used on its own in patients who are unable to take

have or have ever had bladder cancer. - if you have blood in your urine that your doctor has not checked. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking glustin (also see section 4) - if you retain water (fluid retention) or have heart failure problems in particular if you are over 75 years old. if you take anti-inflammatory medicines which can also cause fluid retention and swelling, you must also tell your doctor. - if you have a special type of diabetic eye disease called macular oedema (swelling of the back of the eye). - if you have cysts on your ovaries (polycystic ovary syndrome). there may be an increased possibility of becoming pregnant because you may ovulate again when you take glustin. if this applies to you, use appropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an unplanned pregnancy. - if you have a problem with your liver or heart. before you start taking glustin you will have a blood sample taken to check your liver function. this check may be repeated at intervals. some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with glustin and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). if you take glustin with other medicines for diabetes, it is more likely that your blood sugar could fall below the normal level (hypoglycaemia). you may also experience a reduction in blood count (anaemia). broken bones a higher number of bone fractures was seen in patients, particularly women taking pioglitazone. your doctor will take this into account when treating your diabetes. children and adolescents use in children and adolescents under 18 years is not recommended. other medicines and glustin tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. you can usually continue to take other medicines whilst you are being treated with glustin. however, certain medicines are especially likely to affect the amount of sugar in your blood: - gemfibrozil (used to lower cholesterol) - rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis and other infections) tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. your blood sugar will be checked, and your dose of glustin may need to be changed. glustin with food and drink you may take your tablets with or without food. you should swallow the tablets with a glass of water. pregnancy and breast-feeding tell your doctor if - you are, you think you might be or are planning to become pregnant. - you are breast-feeding or if you are planning to breast-feed your baby. your doctor will advise you to discontinue this medicine. driving and using machines this medicine will not affect your ability to drive

this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. the usual starting dose is one tablet of 15 mg or of 30 mg of pioglitazone to be taken once daily. your doctor may increase the dose to a maximum of 45 mg once a day. your doctor will tell you the dose to take. if you have the impression that the effect of glustin is too weak, talk to your doctor. when glustin is taken in combination with other medicines used to treat diabetes (such as insulin, chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, gliclazide, tolbutamide) your doctor will tell you whether you need to take a smaller dose of your medicines. your doctor will ask you to have blood tests periodically during treatment with glustin. this is to check that your liver is working normally. if you are following a special diet for diabetes, you should continue with this while you are taking glustin. your weight should be checked at regular intervals; if your weight increases, inform your doctor. if you take more glustin than you should if you accidentally take too many tablets, or if someone else or a child takes your medicine, talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately. your blood sugar could fall below the normal level and can be increased by taking sugar. it is recommended that you carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. if you forget to take glustin take glustin daily as prescribed. however if you miss a dose, just carry on with the next dose as normal. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. if you stop taking glustin glustin should be used every day to work properly. if you stop using glustin, your blood sugar may go up. talk to your doctor before stopping this treatment. if you have any further questions
