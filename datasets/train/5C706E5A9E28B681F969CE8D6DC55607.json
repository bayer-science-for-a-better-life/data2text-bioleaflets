NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nPergoveris 150 IU/75 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nOne vial contains 150 IU (equivalent to 11 micrograms) of follitropin alfa* (r-hFSH) and 75 IU \n(equivalent to 3 micrograms) of lutropin alfa* (r-hLH).\n\nAfter reconstitution, each mL of the solution contains 150 IU r-hFSH and 75 IU r-hLH per milliliter.\n\n* produced in genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder and solvent for solution for injection.\n\nPowder: white to off-white lyophilised pellet.\nSolvent: clear colourless solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPergoveris is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in adult women with severe LH \nand FSH deficiency.\nIn clinical trials, these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Pergoveris should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility problems.\n\nPosology\n\nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of Pergoveris \ntherapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after \nthe administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). Pergoveris should be given as a course \nof daily injections. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen \nsecretion, treatment can commence at any time.\n\nTreatment should be tailored to the individual patient\u2019s response as assessed by measuring follicle \nsize by ultrasound and oestrogen response.\n\nA recommended regimen commences with one vial of Pergoveris daily. If less than one vial daily is \nused, the follicular response may be unsatisfactory because the amount of lutropin alfa may be \ninsufficient (see section 5.1).\n\nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments using a licensed follitropin alfa preparation. It may \nbe acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.\n\n\n\n3\n\nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5,000 IU to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last Pergoveris injection. The patient is \nrecommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. \nAlternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.\n\nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.\n\nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment \nshould recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nThere is no relevant indication for the use of Pergoveris in the elderly population. Safety and \neffectiveness of this medicinal product in elderly patients have not been established.\n\nRenal and hepatic impairment\nSafety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of this medicinal product in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment have not been established. \n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of this medicinal product in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nPergoveris is intended for subcutaneous administration. The first injection should be performed under \ndirect medical supervision. The powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the \nsolvent provided. Self-administration should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, \nadequately trained and with access to expert advice.\n\nFor further instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nPergoveris is contraindicated in patients with:\n\uf0b7 hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n\uf0b7 tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland\n\uf0b7 ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst unrelated to polycystic ovarian disease and of unknown \n\norigin\n\uf0b7 gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown origin\n\uf0b7 ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma\n\nPergoveris must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:\n\uf0b7 primary ovarian failure\n\uf0b7 malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy\n\uf0b7 fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPergoveris contains potent gonadotrophic substances capable of causing mild to severe adverse \nreactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems \nand their management.\n\n\n\n4\n\nGonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \neffective use of Pergoveris calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH/LH administration, with a poor response to \nFSH/LH in some patients. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be \nused in women.\n\nPorphyria\n\nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith Pergoveris. In these patients, Pergoveris may increase the risk of an acute attack. Deterioration or \na first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.\n\nTreatment in women\n\nBefore starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment \nshould be given.\n\nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth are at an increased risk of developing \nhyperstimulation in view of possible excessive oestrogen response and multiple follicular \ndevelopment.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\n\nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment.\n\nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.\n\nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, \nabdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and \ngastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.\n\nClinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, \nhaemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic \nevents.\n\nVery rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as \npulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction.\n\nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian \nsyndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotrophins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol \nlevel (> 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation), previous episodes of OHSS and large number \nof developing ovarian follicles (3 follicles of \u2265 14 mm in diameter in anovulation).\n\nAdherence to recommended Pergoveris and FSH dosage and regimen of administration can minimise \nthe risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as \noestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors.\n\n\n\n5\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of OHSS occur such as \nserum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \u2265 40 follicles in total, it is \nrecommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier \ncontraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over \nseveral days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has \nbeen discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Usually, \nOHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses. Therefore patients should be followed for at \nleast two weeks after hCG administration.\nIf severe OHSS occurs, gonadotropin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing. The patient should \nbe hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started. This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in \npatients with polycystic ovarian disease.\n\nWhen a risk of OHSS is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered.\n\nOvarian torsion\n\nOvarian torsion has been reported after treatment with other gonadotropins. This may be associated\nwith other risk factors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian\ntorsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Damage to the ovary due to \nreduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion.\n\nMultiple pregnancy\n\nIn patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is \nincreased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple \npregnancy, especially high order, carry an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.\nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.\n\nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. When \nrisk of multiple pregnancies is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered.\n\nPregnancy loss\n\nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction than in the normal population.\n\nEctopic pregnancy\n\nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter assisted reproductive technologies (ART) was reported to be higher than in the general \npopulation.\n\nReproductive system neoplasms\n\nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet \nestablished whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women.\n\n\n\n6\n\nCongenital malformation\n\nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.\n\nThromboembolic events\n\nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, thrombophilia or severe obesity \n(body mass index > 30 kg/m2), treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk. In these \nwomen, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should \nbe noted however, that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carries an increased risk of \nthromboembolic events.\n\nSodium\n\nPergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPergoveris should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products, in the same \ninjection, except follitropin alfa for which studies have shown that co-administration does not \nsignificantly alter the activity, stability, pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the \nactive substances.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere is no indication for the use of Pergoveris during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of \nexposed pregnancies indicate no adverse reactions of follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa on pregnancy, \nembryonal or foetal development, parturition or postnatal development following controlled ovarian \nstimulation. No teratogenic effect of such gonadotropins has been reported in animal studies. In case \nof exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of \nPergoveris.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nPergoveris is not indicated during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nPergoveris is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPergoveris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \n\n\n\n7\n\nMild or moderate OHSS has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of \nthe stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4).\n\nThromboembolism may occur very rarely, usually associated with severe OHSS (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. The frequency \ncategories used are: very common (\u22651/10), common (\uf0b31/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to \n<1/100), rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data).\n\nImmune system disorders\nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock\n\nNervous system disorders\nVery common: Headache\n\nVascular disorders\nVery rare: Thromboembolism, usually associated with severe OHSS\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nVery common: Ovarian cysts\nCommon: Breast pain, pelvic pain, mild or moderate OHSS (including associated \n\nsymptomatology)\nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4)\nRare: Complication of severe OHSS\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nVery common: Mild to severe injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, bruising, \n\nswelling and/or irritation at the site of injection)\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe effects of an overdose of Pergoveris are unknown. Nevertheless there is a possibility that OHSS \nmay occur, which is further described in section 4.4.\n\nManagement\n\nTreatment is directed to symptoms.\n\n\n\n8\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins. ATC \ncode: G03GA30.\n\nPergoveris is a preparation of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (follitropin alfa, \nr-hFSH) and recombinant human luteinising hormone (lutropin alfa, r-hLH) produced in Chinese \nhamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nIn clinical trials the efficacy of the combination of follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa has been \ndemonstrated in women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n\nIn the stimulation of follicular development in anovulatory women deficient in LH and FSH, the \nprimary effect resulting from administration of lutropin alfa is an increase in oestradiol secretion by \nthe follicles, the growth of which is stimulated by FSH.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In these trials the \novulation rate per cycle was 70-75%.\n\nClinical efficacy \n\nIn one clinical study of women with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and an endogenous serum LH \nconcentration below 1.2 IU/L the appropriate dose of r-hLH was investigated. A dose of 75 IU r-hLH \ndaily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in adequate follicular development and oestrogen \nproduction. A dose of 25 IU r-hLH daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in insufficient \nfollicular development. \nTherefore, administration of less than one vial of Pergoveris daily may provide too little LH-activity \nto ensure adequate follicular development.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nFollitropin alfa and lutropin alfa have shown the same pharmacokinetic profile as follitropin alfa and \nlutropin alfa separately.\n\nFollitropin alfa\n\nDistribution\nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space \nwith an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of \nabout one day. The steady state volume of distribution is 10 L.\nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been \nshown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH \nlevels.\n\n\n\n9\n\nElimination\nTotal clearance is 0.6 L/h and one-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine.\n\nLutropin alfa\n\nDistribution\nFollowing intravenous administration, lutropin alfa is rapidly distributed with an initial half-life of \napproximately one hour and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about 10-12 hours. \nThe steady state volume of distribution is around 10-14 L. Lutropin alfa shows linear \npharmacokinetics, as assessed by AUC which is directly proportional to the dose administered.\nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is approximately 60%; the \nterminal half-life is slightly prolonged. The lutropin alfa pharmacokinetics following single and \nrepeated administration of lutropin alfa are comparable and the accumulation ratio of lutropin alfa is \nminimal. The mean residence time is approximately 5 hours.\n\nElimination\nTotal clearance is around 2 L/h, and less than 5% of the dose is excreted in the urine. \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships\nThere is no pharmacokinetic interaction with follitropin alfa when administered simultaneously.\n\nClinical studies with Pergoveris were conducted with a freeze-dried formulation. A comparative \nclinical study between the freeze-dried and the liquid formulation showed bioequivalence between the \ntwo formulations.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity.\n\n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach multidose pre-filled pen contains 300 IU (equivalent to 22 micrograms) of follitropin alfa* \n(r-hFSH) and 150 IU (equivalent to 6 micrograms) of lutropin alfa* (r-hLH) in 0.48 mL solution. \n\n*recombinant human follitropin alfa and recombinant human lutropin alfa are produced in Chinese \nhamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection (injection).\nClear, colourless to slightly yellow solution.\n\nThe pH of the solution is 6.5 \u2013 7.5, its osmolality is 250 \u2013 400 mOsm/kg.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPergoveris is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in adult women with severe LH \nand FSH deficiency.\nIn clinical trials, these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Pergoveris should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility problems.\n\nPosology\n\nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of Pergoveris \ntherapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after \nthe administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). Pergoveris should be given as a course \nof daily injections. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen \nsecretion, treatment can commence at any time.\n\nTreatment should be tailored to the individual patient\u2019s response as assessed by measuring follicle \nsize by ultrasound and oestrogen response. \n\nA treatment regimen commences with the recommended dose of Pergoveris containing 150 IU \nr-hFSH/75 IU r-hLH daily. If less than the recommended dose daily is used, the follicular response \nmay be unsatisfactory because the amount of lutropin alfa may be insufficient (see section 5.1).\n\nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments using a licensed follitropin alfa preparation. It may \nbe acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.\n\n\n\n13\n\nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5,000 IU to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last Pergoveris injection. The patient is \nrecommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. \nAlternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.\n\nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.\n\nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment \nshould recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nThere is no relevant indication for the use of Pergoveris in the elderly population. Safety and \neffectiveness of this medicinal product in elderly patients have not been established.\n\nRenal and hepatic impairment\nSafety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of this medicinal product in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment have not been established. \n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of this medicinal product in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nPergoveris is intended for subcutaneous administration. The first injection should be performed under \ndirect medical supervision. Self-administration should only be performed by patients who are well \nmotivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.\n\nFor instructions on the use of this medicinal product, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nPergoveris is contraindicated in patients with:\n\uf0b7 hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n\uf0b7 tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland\n\uf0b7 ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst unrelated to polycystic ovarian disease and of unknown \n\norigin\n\uf0b7 gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown origin\n\uf0b7 ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma\n\nPergoveris must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:\n\uf0b7 primary ovarian failure\n\uf0b7 malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy\n\uf0b7 fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPergoveris contains potent gonadotrophic substances capable of causing mild to severe adverse \nreactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems \nand their management.\n\nGonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \n\n\n\n14\n\neffective use of Pergoveris calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH/LH administration, with a poor response to \nFSH/LH in some patients. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be \nused in women.\n\nPorphyria\n\nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith Pergoveris. In these patients, Pergoveris may increase the risk of an acute attack. Deterioration or \na first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.\n\nTreatment in women\n\nBefore starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment \nshould be given.\n\nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth are at an increased risk of developing \nhyperstimulation in view of possible excessive oestrogen response and multiple follicular \ndevelopment.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\n\nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment.\n\nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.\n\nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, \nabdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and \ngastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.\n\nClinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, \nhaemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic \nevents.\n\nVery rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as \npulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction.\nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian \nsyndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotrophins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol \nlevel (> 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation), previous episodes of OHSS and large number \nof developing ovarian follicles (3 follicles of \u2265 14 mm in diameter in anovulation).\n\nAdherence to recommended Pergoveris and FSH dosage and regimen of administration can minimise \nthe risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as \noestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of OHSS occur such as \nserum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \u2265 40 follicles in total, it is \n\n\n\n15\n\nrecommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier \ncontraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over \nseveral days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has \nbeen discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Usually, \nOHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses. Therefore patients should be followed for at \nleast two weeks after hCG administration.\nIf severe OHSS occurs, gonadotropin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing. The patient should \nbe hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started. This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in \npatients with polycystic ovarian disease.\n\nWhen a risk of OHSS is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered.\n\nOvarian torsion\n\nOvarian torsion has been reported after treatment with other gonadotropins. This may be associated \nwith other risk factors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian \ntorsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Damage to the ovary due to \nreduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion.\n\nMultiple pregnancy\n\nIn patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is \nincreased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple \npregnancy, especially high order, carry an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. \nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.\n\nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. When \nrisk of multiple pregnancies is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered.\n\nPregnancy loss\n\nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction than in the normal population.\n\nEctopic pregnancy\n\nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter assisted reproductive technologies (ART) was reported to be higher than in the general \npopulation.\n\nReproductive system neoplasms\n\nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet \nestablished whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women.\n\nCongenital malformation\n\nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.\n\n\n\n16\n\nThromboembolic events\n\nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, thrombophilia or severe obesity \n(body mass index > 30 kg/m2), treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk. In these \nwomen, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should \nbe noted however, that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carries an increased risk of \nthromboembolic events.\n\nSodium\n\nPergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPergoveris solution for injection in pre-filled pen must not be administered as a mixture with other \nmedicinal products in the same injection.\n\nPergoveris solution for injection in pre-filled pen may be administered concomitantly with a licensed \nfollitropin alfa preparation as separate injections.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere is no indication for the use of Pergoveris during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of \nexposed pregnancies indicate no adverse reactions of follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa on pregnancy, \nembryonal or foetal development, parturition or postnatal development following controlled ovarian \nstimulation. No teratogenic effect of such gonadotropins has been reported in animal studies. In case \nof exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of \nPergoveris.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nPergoveris is not indicated during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nPergoveris is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPergoveris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \nMild or moderate OHSS has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of \nthe stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4).\n\nThromboembolism may occur very rarely, usually associated with severe OHSS (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n17\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. The frequency \ncategories used are: very common (\u22651/10), common (\uf0b31/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to \n<1/100), rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data).\n\nImmune system disorders\nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock\n\nNervous system disorders\nVery common: Headache\n\nVascular disorders\nVery rare: Thromboembolism, usually associated with severe OHSS\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nVery common: Ovarian cysts\nCommon: Breast pain, pelvic pain, mild or moderate OHSS (including associated \n\nsymptomatology)\nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4)\nRare: Complication of severe OHSS\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nVery common: Mild to severe injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, bruising, \n\nswelling and/or irritation at the site of injection)\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe effects of an overdose of Pergoveris are unknown. Nevertheless there is a possibility that OHSS \nmay occur, which is further described in section 4.4.\n\nManagement\n\nTreatment is directed to symptoms.\n\n\n\n18\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins. ATC \ncode: G03GA30.\n\nPergoveris is a preparation of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (follitropin alfa, \nr-hFSH) and recombinant human luteinising hormone (lutropin alfa, r-hLH) produced in Chinese \nhamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nIn clinical trials the efficacy of the combination of follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa has been \ndemonstrated in women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n\nIn the stimulation of follicular development in anovulatory women deficient in LH and FSH, the \nprimary effect resulting from administration of lutropin alfa is an increase in oestradiol secretion by \nthe follicles, the growth of which is stimulated by FSH.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In these trials the \novulation rate per cycle was 70-75%.\n\nClinical efficacy \n\nIn one clinical study of women with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and an endogenous serum LH \nconcentration below 1.2 IU/L the appropriate dose of r-hLH was investigated. A dose of 75 IU r-hLH \ndaily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in adequate follicular development and oestrogen \nproduction. A dose of 25 IU r-hLH daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in insufficient \nfollicular development. \nTherefore, administration of Pergoveris containing less than 75 IU r-hLH daily may provide too little \nLH-activity to ensure adequate follicular development.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nFollitropin alfa and lutropin alfa have shown the same pharmacokinetic profile as follitropin alfa and \nlutropin alfa separately.\n\nFollitropin alfa\n\nDistribution\nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space \nwith an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of \nabout one day. The steady state volume of distribution is 10 L.\nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been \nshown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH \nlevels.\n\nElimination\nTotal clearance is 0.6 L/h and one-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine.\n\n\n\n19\n\nLutropin alfa\n\nDistribution\nFollowing intravenous administration, lutropin alfa is rapidly distributed with an initial half-life of \napproximately one hour and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about 10-12 hours. \nThe steady state volume of distribution is around 10-14 L. Lutropin alfa shows linear \npharmacokinetics, as assessed by AUC which is directly proportional to the dose administered.\nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is approximately 60%; the \nterminal half-life is slightly prolonged. The lutropin alfa pharmacokinetics following single and \nrepeated administration of lutropin alfa are comparable and the accumulation ratio of lutropin alfa is \nminimal. The mean residence time is approximately 5 hours.\n\nElimination\nTotal clearance is around 2 L/h, and less than 5% of the dose is excreted in the urine. \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships\nThere is no pharmacokinetic interaction with follitropin alfa when administered simultaneously.\n\nClinical studies with Pergoveris were conducted with a freeze-dried formulation. A comparative \nclinical study between the freeze-dried and the liquid formulation showed bioequivalence between the \ntwo formulations.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity.\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nPergoveris (450 IU + 225 IU)/0.72 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach multidose pre-filled pen contains 450 IU (equivalent to 33 micrograms) of follitropin alfa* \n(r-hFSH) and 225 IU (equivalent to 9 micrograms) of lutropin alfa* (r-hLH) in 0.72 mL solution.\n\n*recombinant human follitropin alfa and recombinant human lutropin alfa are produced in Chinese \nhamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection (injection).\nClear, colourless to slightly yellow solution.\n\nThe pH of the solution is 6.5 \u2013 7.5, its osmolality is 250 \u2013 400 mOsm/kg.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPergoveris is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in adult women with severe LH \nand FSH deficiency.\nIn clinical trials, these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Pergoveris should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility problems.\n\nPosology\n\nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of Pergoveris \ntherapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after \nthe administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). Pergoveris should be given as a course \nof daily injections. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen \nsecretion, treatment can commence at any time.\n\nTreatment should be tailored to the individual patient\u2019s response as assessed by measuring follicle \nsize by ultrasound and oestrogen response. \n\nA treatment regimen commences with the recommended dose of Pergoveris containing 150 IU \nr-hFSH/75 IU r-hLH daily. If less than the recommended dose daily is used, the follicular response \nmay be unsatisfactory because the amount of lutropin alfa may be insufficient (see section 5.1).\n\nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments using a licensed follitropin alfa preparation. It may \nbe acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.\n\n\n\n23\n\nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5,000 IU to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last Pergoveris injection. The patient is \nrecommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. \nAlternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.\n\nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.\n\nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment \nshould recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nThere is no relevant indication for the use of Pergoveris in the elderly population. Safety and \neffectiveness of this medicinal product in elderly patients have not been established.\n\nRenal and hepatic impairment\nSafety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of this medicinal product in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment have not been established. \n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of this medicinal product in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nPergoveris is intended for subcutaneous administration. The first injection should be performed under \ndirect medical supervision. Self-administration should only be performed by patients who are well \nmotivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.\n\nFor instructions on the use of this medicinal product, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nPergoveris is contraindicated in patients with:\n\uf0b7 hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n\uf0b7 tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland\n\uf0b7 ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst unrelated to polycystic ovarian disease and of unknown \n\norigin\n\uf0b7 gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown origin\n\uf0b7 ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma\n\nPergoveris must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:\n\uf0b7 primary ovarian failure\n\uf0b7 malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy\n\uf0b7 fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPergoveris contains potent gonadotrophic substances capable of causing mild to severe adverse \nreactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems \nand their management.\n\nGonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \n\n\n\n24\n\neffective use of Pergoveris calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH/LH administration, with a poor response to \nFSH/LH in some patients. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be \nused in women.\n\nPorphyria\n\nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith Pergoveris. In these patients, Pergoveris may increase the risk of an acute attack. Deterioration or \na first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.\n\nTreatment in women\n\nBefore starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment \nshould be given.\n\nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth are at an increased risk of developing \nhyperstimulation in view of possible excessive oestrogen response and multiple follicular \ndevelopment.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\n\nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment.\n\nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.\n\nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, \nabdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and \ngastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.\n\nClinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, \nhaemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic \nevents.\n\nVery rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as \npulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction.\nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian \nsyndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotrophins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol \nlevel (> 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation), previous episodes of OHSS and large number \nof developing ovarian follicles (3 follicles of \u2265 14 mm in diameter in anovulation).\n\nAdherence to recommended Pergoveris and FSH dosage and regimen of administration can minimise \nthe risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as \noestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of OHSS occur such as \nserum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \u2265 40 follicles in total, it is \n\n\n\n25\n\nrecommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier \ncontraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over \nseveral days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has \nbeen discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Usually, \nOHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses. Therefore patients should be followed for at \nleast two weeks after hCG administration.\nIf severe OHSS occurs, gonadotropin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing. The patient should \nbe hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started. This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in \npatients with polycystic ovarian disease.\n\nWhen a risk of OHSS is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered.\n\nOvarian torsion\n\nOvarian torsion has been reported after treatment with other gonadotropins. This may be associated \nwith other risk factors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian \ntorsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Damage to the ovary due to \nreduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion.\n\nMultiple pregnancy\n\nIn patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is \nincreased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple \npregnancy, especially high order, carry an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. \nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.\n\nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. When \nrisk of multiple pregnancies is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered.\n\nPregnancy loss\n\nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction than in the normal population.\n\nEctopic pregnancy\n\nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter assisted reproductive technologies (ART) was reported to be higher than in the general \npopulation.\n\nReproductive system neoplasms\n\nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet \nestablished whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women.\n\nCongenital malformation\n\nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.\n\n\n\n26\n\nThromboembolic events\n\nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, thrombophilia or severe obesity \n(body mass index > 30 kg/m2), treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk. In these \nwomen, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should \nbe noted however, that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carries an increased risk of \nthromboembolic events.\n\nSodium\n\nPergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPergoveris solution for injection in pre-filled pen must not be administered as a mixture with other \nmedicinal products in the same injection.\n\nPergoveris solution for injection in pre-filled pen may be administered concomitantly with a licensed \nfollitropin alfa preparation as separate injections.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere is no indication for the use of Pergoveris during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of \nexposed pregnancies indicate no adverse reactions of follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa on pregnancy, \nembryonal or foetal development, parturition or postnatal development following controlled ovarian \nstimulation. No teratogenic effect of such gonadotropins has been reported in animal studies. In case \nof exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of \nPergoveris.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nPergoveris is not indicated during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nPergoveris is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPergoveris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \nMild or moderate OHSS has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of \nthe stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4).\n\nThromboembolism may occur very rarely, usually associated with severe OHSS (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n27\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. The frequency \ncategories used are: very common (\u22651/10), common (\uf0b31/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to \n<1/100), rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data).\n\nImmune system disorders\nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock\n\nNervous system disorders\nVery common: Headache\n\nVascular disorders\nVery rare: Thromboembolism, usually associated with severe OHSS\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nVery common: Ovarian cysts\nCommon: Breast pain, pelvic pain, mild or moderate OHSS (including associated \n\nsymptomatology)\nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4)\nRare: Complication of severe OHSS\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nVery common: Mild to severe injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, bruising, \n\nswelling and/or irritation at the site of injection)\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe effects of an overdose of Pergoveris are unknown.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins. ATC \ncode: G03GA30.\n\nPergoveris is a preparation of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (follitropin alfa, \nr-hFSH) and recombinant human luteinising hormone (lutropin alfa, r-hLH) produced in Chinese \nhamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nIn clinical trials the efficacy of the combination of follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa has been \ndemonstrated in women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n\nIn the stimulation of follicular development in anovulatory women deficient in LH and FSH, the \nprimary effect resulting from administration of lutropin alfa is an increase in oestradiol secretion by \nthe follicles, the growth of which is stimulated by FSH.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In these trials the \novulation rate per cycle was 70-75%.\n\nClinical efficacy \n\nIn one clinical study of women with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and an endogenous serum LH \nconcentration below 1.2 IU/L the appropriate dose of r-hLH was investigated. A dose of 75 IU r-hLH \ndaily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in adequate follicular development and oestrogen \nproduction. A dose of 25 IU r-hLH daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in insufficient \nfollicular development. \nTherefore, administration of Pergoveris containing less than 75 IU r-hLH daily may provide too little \nLH-activity to ensure adequate follicular development.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nFollitropin alfa and lutropin alfa have shown the same pharmacokinetic profile as follitropin alfa and \nlutropin alfa separately.\n\nFollitropin alfa\n\nDistribution\nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space \nwith an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of \nabout one day. The steady state volume of distribution is 10 L.\nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been \nshown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH \nlevels.\n\nElimination\nTotal clearance is 0.6 L/h and one-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine.\n\n\n\n29\n\nLutropin alfa\n\nDistribution\nFollowing intravenous administration, lutropin alfa is rapidly distributed with an initial half-life of \napproximately one hour and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about 10-12 hours. \nThe steady state volume of distribution is around 10-14 L. Lutropin alfa shows linear \npharmacokinetics, as assessed by AUC which is directly proportional to the dose administered.\nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is approximately 60%; the \nterminal half-life is slightly prolonged. The lutropin alfa pharmacokinetics following single and \nrepeated administration of lutropin alfa are comparable and the accumulation ratio of lutropin alfa is \nminimal. The mean residence time is approximately 5 hours.\n\nElimination\nTotal clearance is around 2 L/h, and less than 5% of the dose is excreted in the urine. \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships\nThere is no pharmacokinetic interaction with follitropin alfa when administered simultaneously.\n\nClinical studies with Pergoveris were conducted with a freeze-dried formulation.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nPergoveris (900 IU + 450 IU)/1.44 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach multidose pre-filled pen contains 900 IU (equivalent to 66 micrograms) of follitropin alfa* \n(r-hFSH) and 450 IU (equivalent to 18 micrograms) of lutropin alfa* (r-hLH) in 1.44 mL solution.\n\n*recombinant human follitropin alfa and recombinant human lutropin alfa are produced in Chinese \nhamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection (injection).\nClear, colourless to slightly yellow solution.\n\nThe pH of the solution is 6.5 \u2013 7.5, its osmolality is 250 \u2013 400 mOsm/kg.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPergoveris is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in adult women with severe LH \nand FSH deficiency.\nIn clinical trials, these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Pergoveris should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility problems.\n\nPosology\n\nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of Pergoveris \ntherapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after \nthe administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). Pergoveris should be given as a course \nof daily injections. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen \nsecretion, treatment can commence at any time.\n\nTreatment should be tailored to the individual patient\u2019s response as assessed by measuring follicle \nsize by ultrasound and oestrogen response. \n\nA treatment regimen commences with the recommended dose of Pergoveris containing 150 IU \nr-hFSH/75 IU r-hLH daily. If less than the recommended dose daily is used, the follicular response \nmay be unsatisfactory because the amount of lutropin alfa may be insufficient (see section 5.1).\n\nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments using a licensed follitropin alfa preparation. It may \nbe acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.\n\n\n\n33\n\nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5,000 IU to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last Pergoveris injection. The patient is \nrecommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. \nAlternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.\n\nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.\n\nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment \nshould recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nThere is no relevant indication for the use of Pergoveris in the elderly population. Safety and \neffectiveness of this medicinal product in elderly patients have not been established.\n\nRenal and hepatic impairment\nSafety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of this medicinal product in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment have not been established. \n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of this medicinal product in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nPergoveris is intended for subcutaneous administration. The first injection should be performed under \ndirect medical supervision. Self-administration should only be performed by patients who are well \nmotivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.\n\nFor instructions on the use of this medicinal product, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nPergoveris is contraindicated in patients with:\n\uf0b7 hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n\uf0b7 tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland\n\uf0b7 ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst unrelated to polycystic ovarian disease and of unknown \n\norigin\n\uf0b7 gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown origin\n\uf0b7 ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma\n\nPergoveris must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:\n\uf0b7 primary ovarian failure\n\uf0b7 malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy\n\uf0b7 fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPergoveris contains potent gonadotrophic substances capable of causing mild to severe adverse \nreactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems \nand their management.\n\nGonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \n\n\n\n34\n\neffective use of Pergoveris calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH/LH administration, with a poor response to \nFSH/LH in some patients. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be\nused in women.\n\nPorphyria\n\nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith Pergoveris. In these patients, Pergoveris may increase the risk of an acute attack. Deterioration or \na first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.\n\nTreatment in women\n\nBefore starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment \nshould be given.\n\nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth are at an increased risk of developing \nhyperstimulation in view of possible excessive oestrogen response and multiple follicular \ndevelopment.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\n\nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment.\n\nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.\n\nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, \nabdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and \ngastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.\n\nClinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, \nhaemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic \nevents.\n\nVery rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as \npulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction.\nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian \nsyndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotrophins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol \nlevel (> 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation), previous episodes of OHSS and large number \nof developing ovarian follicles (3 follicles of \u2265 14 mm in diameter in anovulation).\n\nAdherence to recommended Pergoveris and FSH dosage and regimen of administration can minimise \nthe risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as \noestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of OHSS occur such as \nserum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \u2265 40 follicles in total, it is \n\n\n\n35\n\nrecommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier \ncontraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over \nseveral days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has \nbeen discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Usually, \nOHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses. Therefore patients should be followed for at \nleast two weeks after hCG administration.\nIf severe OHSS occurs, gonadotropin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing. The patient should \nbe hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started. This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in \npatients with polycystic ovarian disease.\n\nWhen a risk of OHSS is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered.\n\nOvarian torsion\n\nOvarian torsion has been reported after treatment with other gonadotropins. This may be associated \nwith other risk factors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian \ntorsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Damage to the ovary due to \nreduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion.\n\nMultiple pregnancy\n\nIn patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is \nincreased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple \npregnancy, especially high order, carry an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. \nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.\n\nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. When \nrisk of multiple pregnancies is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered.\n\nPregnancy loss\n\nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction than in the normal population.\n\nEctopic pregnancy\n\nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter assisted reproductive technologies (ART) was reported to be higher than in the general \npopulation.\n\nReproductive system neoplasms\n\nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet \nestablished whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women.\n\nCongenital malformation\n\nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.\n\n\n\n36\n\nThromboembolic events\n\nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, thrombophilia or severe obesity \n(body mass index > 30 kg/m2), treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk. In these \nwomen, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should \nbe noted however, that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carries an increased risk of \nthromboembolic events.\n\nSodium\n\nPergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPergoveris solution for injection in pre-filled pen must not be administered as a mixture with other \nmedicinal products in the same injection.\n\nPergoveris solution for injection in pre-filled pen may be administered concomitantly with a licensed \nfollitropin alfa preparation as separate injections.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere is no indication for the use of Pergoveris during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of \nexposed pregnancies indicate no adverse reactions of follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa on pregnancy, \nembryonal or foetal development, parturition or postnatal development following controlled ovarian \nstimulation. No teratogenic effect of such gonadotropins has been reported in animal studies. In case \nof exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of \nPergoveris.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nPergoveris is not indicated during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nPergoveris is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPergoveris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \nMild or moderate OHSS has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of \nthe stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4).\n\nThromboembolism may occur very rarely, usually associated with severe OHSS (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n37\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. The frequency \ncategories used are: very common (\u22651/10), common (\uf0b31/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to \n<1/100), rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data).\n\nImmune system disorders\nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and \n\nshock\n\nNervous system disorders\nVery common: Headache\n\nVascular disorders\nVery rare: Thromboembolism, usually associated with severe OHSS\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nVery rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nVery common: Ovarian cysts\nCommon: Breast pain, pelvic pain, mild or moderate OHSS (including associated \n\nsymptomatology)\nUncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4)\nRare: Complication of severe OHSS\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nVery common: Mild to severe injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, bruising, \n\nswelling and/or irritation at the site of injection)\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe effects of an overdose of Pergoveris are unknown. Nevertheless there is a possibility that OHSS \nmay occur, which is further described in section 4.4.\n\nManagement\n\nTreatment is directed to symptoms.\n\n\n\n38\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins. ATC \ncode: G03GA30.\n\nPergoveris is a preparation of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (follitropin alfa, \nr-hFSH) and recombinant human luteinising hormone (lutropin alfa, r-hLH) produced in Chinese \nhamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nIn clinical trials the efficacy of the combination of follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa has been \ndemonstrated in women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n\nIn the stimulation of follicular development in anovulatory women deficient in LH and FSH, the \nprimary effect resulting from administration of lutropin alfa is an increase in oestradiol secretion by \nthe follicles, the growth of which is stimulated by FSH.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In these trials the \novulation rate per cycle was 70-75%.\n\nClinical efficacy \n\nIn one clinical study of women with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and an endogenous serum LH \nconcentration below 1.2 IU/L the appropriate dose of r-hLH was investigated. A dose of 75 IU r-hLH \ndaily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in adequate follicular development and oestrogen \nproduction. A dose of 25 IU r-hLH daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in insufficient \nfollicular development. \nTherefore, administration of Pergoveris containing less than 75 IU r-hLH daily may provide too little \nLH-activity to ensure adequate follicular development.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nFollitropin alfa and lutropin alfa have shown the same pharmacokinetic profile as follitropin alfa and \nlutropin alfa separately.\n\nFollitropin alfa\n\nDistribution\nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space \nwith an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of \nabout one day. The steady state volume of distribution is 10 L.\nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been \nshown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH \nlevels.\n\nElimination\nTotal clearance is 0.6 L/h and one-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine.\n\n\n\n39\n\nLutropin alfa\n\nDistribution\nFollowing intravenous administration, lutropin alfa is rapidly distributed with an initial half-life of \napproximately one hour and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about 10-12 hours. \nThe steady state volume of distribution is around 10-14 L. Lutropin alfa shows linear \npharmacokinetics, as assessed by AUC which is directly proportional to the dose administered.\nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is approximately 60%; the \nterminal half-life is slightly prolonged. The lutropin alfa pharmacokinetics following single and \nrepeated administration of lutropin alfa are comparable and the accumulation ratio of lutropin alfa is \nminimal. The mean residence time is approximately 5 hours.\n\nElimination\nTotal clearance is around 2 L/h, and less than 5% of the dose is excreted in the urine. \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships\nThere is no pharmacokinetic interaction with follitropin alfa when administered simultaneously.\n\nClinical studies with Pergoveris were conducted with a freeze-dried formulation. A comparative \nclinical study between the freeze-dried and the liquid formulation showed bioequivalence between the \ntwo formulations.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity.\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n61\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nPergoveris 150 IU/75 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection\nFollitropin alfa/Lutropin alfa\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Pergoveris is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Pergoveris\n3. How to use Pergoveris\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Pergoveris\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Pergoveris is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Pergoveris is\nPergoveris contains two different active substances called \u201cfollitropin alfa\u201d and \u201clutropin alfa\u201d. Both \nbelong to the family of hormones called \u201cgonadotropins\u201d, which are involved in reproduction and \nfertility.\n\nWhat Pergoveris is used for\nThis medicine is used to stimulate the development of follicles (each containing an egg) in your \novaries. This is to help you get pregnant. It is for use in adult women (18 years old or above) who \nhave low levels (severe deficiency) of \u201cfollicle stimulating hormone\u201d (FSH) and \u201cluteinising \nhormone\u201d (LH). These women are usually infertile.\n\nHow Pergoveris works\nThe active substances in Pergoveris are copies of the natural hormones FSH and LH. In your body:\n\uf0b7 FSH stimulates the production of eggs\n\uf0b7 LH stimulates the release of the eggs.\n\nBy replacing the missing hormones, Pergoveris allows women with low levels of FSH and LH to \ndevelop a follicle. This will then release an egg, after an injection of the hormone \u201chuman chorionic \ngonadotropin (hCG)\u201d. This helps the women to become pregnant.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Pergoveris\n\nYou and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor \nexperienced in treating fertility problems.\n\nDo not use Pergoveris\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) or any of \n\nthe other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)\n\n\n\n62\n\n\uf0b7 if you have a brain tumour (in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland)\n\uf0b7 if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within your ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin\n\uf0b7 if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding\n\uf0b7 if you have cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts\n\uf0b7 if you have a condition that would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as an early \n\nmenopause, malformed sex organs or benign tumours of the womb.\n\nDo not use this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before using this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Pergoveris.\n\nPorphyria\nTalk to your doctor before you start your treatment.If you or any member of your family have \nporphyria (an inability to breakdown porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children).\nTell your doctor straight away if:\n\uf0b7 your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently exposed \n\nto sunlight\n\uf0b7 you have stomach, arm or leg pain.\n\nIn case of above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\nThis medicine stimulates your ovaries. This increases your risk of developing ovarian \nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). This is when your follicles develop too much and become large \ncysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you \nhave difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away. They might ask you to stop using this \nmedicine (see in section 4. under \u201cMost serious side effects\u201d).\n\nIn case you are not ovulating and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered \nto, the occurrence of severe OHSS is less likely. Pergoveris treatment seldom causes severe OHSS. \nThis becomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing \nhuman chorionic gonadotrophin, hCG) is administered (see in section 3. under \u201cHow much to use\u201d for \ndetails). If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle \nand you may be told not to have sex or that you should use a barrier contraceptive method for at least \nfour days.\nYour doctor will ensure, careful monitoring of the ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood \ntests (oestradiol measurements) before and during the course of treatment.\n\nMultiple pregnancy\nWhen using Pergoveris, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (\u201cmultiple pregnancy\u201d, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy \nby using the right dose of Pergoveris at the right times.\n\nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as blood tests are recommended.\n\nMiscarriage\nWhen undergoing stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a \nmiscarriage than the average woman.\n\n\n\n63\n\nEctopic pregnancy\nWomen who have ever had blocked or damaged fallopian tubes (tubal disease) are at risk of \npregnancy where the embryo is implanted outside the womb (ectopic pregnancy). This is whether the \npregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.\n\nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)\nTalk to your doctor before using Pergoveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood \nclots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood \nclots or existing clots might become worse with Pergoveris treatment.\n\nTumours of sex organs\nThere have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in \nwomen who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment.\n\nAllergic reactions\nThere have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to Pergoveris. If you have ever had \nthis type of reaction to a similar medicine, talk to your doctor before using Pergoveris.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nPergoveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old.\n\nOther medicines and Pergoveris\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.\n\nDo not use Pergoveris with other medicines in the same injection, except for follitropin alfa, if \nprescribed by your doctor.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nDo not use Pergoveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nIt is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive or use machines.\n\nPergoveris contains sodium\nPergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n3. How to use Pergoveris\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nUsing this medicine\n\uf0b7 Pergoveris is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). To \n\nminimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day. \n\uf0b7 It comes as a powder and liquid, which you need to mix together and then use straight away.\n\uf0b7 Your doctor or nurse will show you how to prepare and inject this medicine. They will \n\nsupervise your first injection.\n\uf0b7 If they are satisfied that you can administer Pergoveris safely, you can then prepare and inject \n\nthe medicine yourself at home. When you do this, please carefully read and follow the \ninstructions hereafter called \u201cHow to prepare and use the Pergoveris powder and solvent\u201d.\n\n\n\n64\n\nHow much to use\nThe usual starting dose is one vial of Pergoveris every day.\n\uf0b7 According to your response, your doctor may decide to add every day a dose of a licensed \n\nfollitropin alfa preparation to your Pergoveris injection. In this case, the follitropin alfa dose is \nusually increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU.\n\n\uf0b7 Treatment is continued until you get the desired response. This is when you have developed a \nsuitable follicle, as assessed using ultrasound scans and blood tests. \n\n\uf0b7 This may take up to 5 weeks. \n\nWhen you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of human chorionic \ngonadotropin (hCG) 24 to 48 hours after your last Pergoveris injection. The best time to have sex is \non the day of the hCG injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may \nbe performed.\n\nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG \n(see in section 2. under \u201dOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u201d). In this case, your doctor will \ngive you a lower follitropin alfa dose in the following cycle.\n\nHow to prepare and use the Pergoveris powder and solvent\nBefore starting the preparation, please read these instructions the whole way through first:\nGive yourself the injection at the same time each day.\n\n1. Wash your hands and find a clean area\n\n\uf0b7 It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible\n\uf0b7 A good place is a clean table or kitchen surface\n\n2. Get together everything you need and lay them out\n\n\uf0b7 1 vial containing Pergoveris powder\n\uf0b7 1 vial containing water for injections (solvent)\n\nNot provided in the pack:\n\uf0b7 2 alcohol swabs\n\uf0b7 1 empty syringe for injection\n\uf0b7 1 needle for preparation\n\uf0b7 1 fine bore needle for injection under the skin\n\uf0b7 one sharps container for safe disposal of glass and needles\n\n3. Preparing the solution\n\n\uf0b7 Remove the protective cap from the vial filled with water (solvent vial).\n\uf0b7 Attach the needle for preparation to the empty syringe for injection.\n\uf0b7 Draw up some air into the syringe by pulling the plunger to \n\napproximately the 1 mL mark.\n\uf0b7 Insert the needle into the vial, push the plunger to expel the air.\n\uf0b7 Turn the vial upside down and gently draw up all the water (solvent).\n\uf0b7 Remove the syringe from the vial and set it down carefully. Do not \n\ntouch the needle and do not allow the needle to touch any surface.\n\n\n\n65\n\n\uf0b7 Remove the protective cap from the vial filled with Pergoveris powder.\n\uf0b7 Pick up your syringe and slowly inject the contents of the syringe into \n\nthe vial of powder. \n\uf0b7 Swirl gently without removing the syringe. Do not shake.\n\uf0b7 After the powder has dissolved (which usually occurs immediately), \n\ncheck that the resulting solution is clear and does not contain any \nparticles.\n\n\uf0b7 Turn the vial upside down, gently draw the solution back into the \nsyringe. Check for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is \nnot clear.\n\n4. Getting the syringe ready for injection\n\n\uf0b7 Change the needle for the fine bore needle.\n\uf0b7 Remove any air bubbles: If you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the \n\nsyringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe \nuntil all the air collects at the top. Push the plunger until the air bubbles \nare gone.\n\n5. Injecting the dose\n\n\uf0b7 Immediately inject the solution. Your doctor or nurse will have already \nadvised you where to inject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh). To minimise \nskin irritation, select a different injection site each day.\n\n\uf0b7 Clean the chosen skin area with an alcohol swab using a circular \nmotion.\n\n\uf0b7 Firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45\u00b0 to 90 angle \nusing a dart-like motion. \n\n\uf0b7 Inject under the skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a \nvein. \n\n\uf0b7 Inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger. Take as much time \nas you need to inject all the solution. \n\n\uf0b7 Then withdraw the needle and clean the skin with a new alcohol swab \nusing a circular motion.\n\n6. After the injection\n\nDispose of all used items. Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and \nempty vials in your sharps container. Any unused solution must be discarded.\n\nIf you use more Pergoveris than you should\nThe effects of an overdose of Pergoveris are unknown, nevertheless one could expect OHSS to occur. \nHowever this will only occur if hCG is administered (see in section 2. under \u201cOvarian \nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u201d).\n\nIf you forget to use Pergoveris\nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor.\n\nIf you have any further question on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n\n\n66\n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nMost serious side effects\nContact your doctor straight away if you notice any of the below listed side effects. The doctor \nmight ask you to stop using Pergoveris.\n\nAllergic reactions\nAllergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can \nsometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\n\uf0b7 Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting. These may be the symptoms of \n\novarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Your ovaries may have over-reacted to the \ntreatment and formed large sacs of fluid or cysts (see in section 2. under \u201cOvarian \nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u201d). This side effect is common. If this happens, your doctor \nwill need to examine you as soon as possible.\n\n\uf0b7 The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, \nweight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. \nThis side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).\n\n\uf0b7 Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting occur rarely (may affect \nup to 1 in 1,000 people).\n\n\uf0b7 Serious blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) usually with severe OHSS are found \nvery rarely.

What you need to know before you use Pergoveris\n3. How to use Pergoveris\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Pergoveris\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Pergoveris is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Pergoveris is\nPergoveris contains two different active substances called \u201cfollitropin alfa\u201d and \u201clutropin alfa\u201d. Both \nbelong to the family of hormones called \u201cgonadotropins\u201d, which are involved in reproduction and \nfertility.\n\nWhat Pergoveris is used for\nThis medicine is used to stimulate the development of follicles (each containing an egg) in your \novaries. This is to help you get pregnant. It is for use in adult women (18 years old or above) who \nhave low levels (severe deficiency) of \u201cfollicle stimulating hormone\u201d (FSH) and \u201cluteinising \nhormone\u201d (LH). These women are usually infertile.\n\nHow Pergoveris works\nThe active substances in Pergoveris are copies of the natural hormones FSH and LH. In your body:\n\uf0b7 FSH stimulates the production of eggs\n\uf0b7 LH stimulates the release of the eggs.\n\nBy replacing the missing hormones, Pergoveris allows women with low levels of FSH and LH to \ndevelop a follicle. This will then release an egg, after an injection of the hormone \u201chuman chorionic \ngonadotropin (hCG)\u201d. This helps the women to become pregnant.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Pergoveris\n\nYou and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor \nexperienced in treating fertility problems.\n\nDo not use Pergoveris\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) or any of \n\nthe other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)\n\n\n\n71\n\n\uf0b7 if you have a brain tumour (in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland)\n\uf0b7 if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within your ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin\n\uf0b7 if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding\n\uf0b7 if you have cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts\n\uf0b7 if you have a condition that would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as an early \n\nmenopause, malformed sex organs or benign tumours of the womb.\n\nDo not use this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before using this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Pergoveris.\n\nPorphyria\nTalk to your doctor before you start your treatment.If you or any member of your family have \nporphyria (an inability to breakdown porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children).\nTell your doctor straight away if:\n\uf0b7 your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently exposed \n\nto sunlight\n\uf0b7 you have stomach, arm or leg pain.\n\nIn case of above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\nThis medicine stimulates your ovaries. This increases your risk of developing ovarian \nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). This is when your follicles develop too much and become large \ncysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you \nhave difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away. They might ask you to stop using this \nmedicine (see in section 4. under \u201cMost serious side effects\u201d).\n\nIn case you are not ovulating and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered \nto, the occurrence of severe OHSS is less likely. Pergoveris treatment seldom causes severe OHSS. \nThis becomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing \nhuman chorionic gonadotrophin, hCG) is administered (see in section 3. under \u201cHow much to use\u201d for \ndetails). If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle \nand you may be told not to have sex or that you should use a barrier contraceptive method for at least \nfour days.\nYour doctor will ensure, careful monitoring of the ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood \ntests (oestradiol measurements) before and during the course of treatment.\n\nMultiple pregnancy\nWhen using Pergoveris, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (\u201cmultiple pregnancy\u201d, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy \nby using the right dose of Pergoveris at the right times.\n\nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as blood tests are recommended.\n\nMiscarriage\nWhen undergoing stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a \nmiscarriage than the average woman.\n\n\n\n72\n\nEctopic pregnancy\nWomen who have ever had blocked or damaged fallopian tubes (tubal disease) are at risk of \npregnancy where the embryo is implanted outside the womb (ectopic pregnancy). This is whether the \npregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.\n\nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)\nTalk to your doctor before using Pergoveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood \nclots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood \nclots or existing clots might become worse with Pergoveris treatment.\n\nTumours of sex organs\nThere have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in \nwomen who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment.\n\nAllergic reactions\nThere have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to Pergoveris. If you have ever had \nthis type of reaction to a similar medicine, talk to your doctor before using Pergoveris.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nPergoveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old.\n\nOther medicines and Pergoveris\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.\n\nDo not use Pergoveris with other medicines in the same injection. You can use Pergoveris with a \nlicensed follitropin alfa preparation as separate injections, if prescribed by your doctor.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nDo not use Pergoveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nIt is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive or use machines.\n\nPergoveris contains sodium\nPergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n3. How to use Pergoveris\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nUsing this medicine\n\uf0b7 Pergoveris is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). To \n\nminimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day. \n\n\uf0b7 Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the Pergoveris pre-filled pen to inject the \nmedicine.\n\n\uf0b7 If they are satisfied that you can administer Pergoveris safely, you can then prepare and inject \nthe medicine yourself at home.\n\n\uf0b7 If you administer Pergoveris to yourself, please carefully read and follow section \u201cInstructions \nfor Use\u201d.\n\nHow much to use\nA treatment regimen commences with the recommended dose of Pergoveris containing \n150 International Units (IU) of follitropin alfa and 75 IU of lutropin alfa every day.\n\n\n\n73\n\n\uf0b7 According to your response, your doctor may decide to add every day a dose of a licensed \nfollitropin alfa preparation to your Pergoveris injection. In this case, the follitropin alfa dose is \nusually increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU.\n\n\uf0b7 Treatment is continued until you get the desired response. This is when you have developed a \nsuitable follicle, as assessed using ultrasound scans and blood tests. \n\n\uf0b7 This may take up to 5 weeks. \n\nWhen you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of human chorionic \ngonadotropin (hCG) 24 to 48 hours after your last Pergoveris injection. The best time to have sex is \non the day of the hCG injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may \nbe performed.\n\nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG \n(see in section 2. under \u201dOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u201d). In this case, your doctor will \ngive you a lower follitropin alfa dose in the following cycle.\n\nIf you use more Pergoveris than you should\nThe effects of an overdose of Pergoveris are unknown, nevertheless one could expect OHSS to occur. \nHowever this will only occur if hCG is administered (see in section 2. under \u201cOvarian \nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u201d).\n\nIf you forget to use Pergoveris\nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor.\n\nIf you have any further question on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nMost serious side effects\nContact your doctor straight away if you notice any of the below listed side effects. The doctor \nmight ask you to stop using Pergoveris.\n\nAllergic reactions\nAllergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can \nsometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\n\uf0b7 Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting. These may be the symptoms of \n\novarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Your ovaries may have over-reacted to the \ntreatment and formed large sacs of fluid or cysts (see in section 2. under \u201cOvarian \nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u201d). This side effect is common. If this happens, your doctor \nwill need to examine you as soon as possible.\n\n\uf0b7 The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, \nweight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. \nThis side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).\n\n\uf0b7 Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting occur rarely (may affect \nup to 1 in 1,000 people).\n\n\uf0b7 Serious blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) usually with severe OHSS are found \nvery rarely. This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack. In rare cases this \ncan also happen independently of OHSS (see in section 2. under \u201cBlood clotting problems \n(thromboembolic events)\u201d).\n\n\n\n74\n\nOther side effects\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\n\uf0b7 sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts)\n\uf0b7 headache\n\uf0b7 local reactions at the injection site such as pain, itching, bruising, swelling or irritation.\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n\uf0b7 diarrhoea\n\uf0b7 breast pain\n\uf0b7 feeling sick or vomiting\n\uf0b7 abdominal or pelvic pain\n\uf0b7 abdominal cramp or bloating.\n\nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people):\n\uf0b7 Your asthma may get worse.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.\n\n5. How to store Pergoveris\n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month.\n\nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C).

What you need to know before you use Pergoveris\n3. How to use Pergoveris\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Pergoveris\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Pergoveris is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Pergoveris is\nPergoveris contains two different active substances called \u201cfollitropin alfa\u201d and \u201clutropin alfa\u201d. Both \nbelong to the family of hormones called \u201cgonadotropins\u201d, which are involved in reproduction and \nfertility.\n\nWhat Pergoveris is used for\nThis medicine is used to stimulate the development of follicles (each containing an egg) in your \novaries. This is to help you get pregnant. It is for use in adult women (18 years old or above) who\nhave low levels (severe deficiency) of \u201cfollicle stimulating hormone\u201d (FSH) and \u201cluteinising \nhormone\u201d (LH). These women are usually infertile.\n\nHow Pergoveris works\nThe active substances in Pergoveris are copies of the natural hormones FSH and LH. In your body:\n\uf0b7 FSH stimulates the production of eggs\n\uf0b7 LH stimulates the release of the eggs.\n\nBy replacing the missing hormones, Pergoveris allows women with low levels of FSH and LH to \ndevelop a follicle. This will then release an egg, after an injection of the hormone \u201chuman chorionic \ngonadotropin (hCG)\u201d. This helps the women to become pregnant.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Pergoveris\n\nYou and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor \nexperienced in treating fertility problems.\n\nDo not use Pergoveris\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) or any of \n\nthe other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)\n\n\n\n86\n\n\uf0b7 if you have a brain tumour (in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland)\n\uf0b7 if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within your ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin\n\uf0b7 if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding\n\uf0b7 if you have cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts\n\uf0b7 if you have a condition that would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as an early \n\nmenopause, malformed sex organs or benign tumours of the womb.\n\nDo not use this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before using this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Pergoveris.\n\nPorphyria\nTalk to your doctor before you start your treatment.If you or any member of your family have \nporphyria (an inability to breakdown porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children).\nTell your doctor straight away if:\n\uf0b7 your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently exposed \n\nto sunlight\n\uf0b7 you have stomach, arm or leg pain.\n\nIn case of above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\nThis medicine stimulates your ovaries. This increases your risk of developing ovarian \nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). This is when your follicles develop too much and become large \ncysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you \nhave difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away. They might ask you to stop using this \nmedicine (see in section 4. under \u201cMost serious side effects\u201d).\n\nIn case you are not ovulating and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered \nto, the occurrence of severe OHSS is less likely. Pergoveris treatment seldom causes severe OHSS. \nThis becomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing \nhuman chorionic gonadotrophin, hCG) is administered (see in section 3. under \u201cHow much to use\u201d for \ndetails). If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle \nand you may be told not to have sex or that you should use a barrier contraceptive method for at least \nfour days.\nYour doctor will ensure, careful monitoring of the ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood \ntests (oestradiol measurements) before and during the course of treatment.\n\nMultiple pregnancy\nWhen using Pergoveris, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (\u201cmultiple pregnancy\u201d, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy \nby using the right dose of Pergoveris at the right times.\n\nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as blood tests are recommended.\n\nMiscarriage\nWhen undergoing stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a \nmiscarriage than the average woman.\n\n\n\n87\n\nEctopic pregnancy\nWomen who have ever had blocked or damaged fallopian tubes (tubal disease) are at risk of \npregnancy where the embryo is implanted outside the womb (ectopic pregnancy). This is whether the \npregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.\n\nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)\nTalk to your doctor before using Pergoveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood \nclots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood \nclots or existing clots might become worse with Pergoveris treatment.\n\nTumours of sex organs\nThere have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in \nwomen who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment.\n\nAllergic reactions\nThere have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to Pergoveris. If you have ever had \nthis type of reaction to a similar medicine, talk to your doctor before using Pergoveris.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nPergoveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old.\n\nOther medicines and Pergoveris\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.\n\nDo not use Pergoveris with other medicines in the same injection. You can use Pergoveris with a \nlicensed follitropin alfa preparation as separate injections, if prescribed by your doctor.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nDo not use Pergoveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nIt is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive or use machines.\n\nPergoveris contains sodium\nPergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n3. How to use Pergoveris\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nUsing this medicine\n\uf0b7 Pergoveris is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). To \n\nminimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day. \n\n\uf0b7 Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the Pergoveris pre-filled pen to inject the \nmedicine.\n\n\uf0b7 If they are satisfied that you can administer Pergoveris safely, you can then prepare and inject \nthe medicine yourself at home.\n\n\uf0b7 If you administer Pergoveris to yourself, please carefully read and follow section \u201cInstructions \nfor Use\u201d.\n\nHow much to use\nA treatment regimen commences with the recommended dose of Pergoveris containing \n150 International Units (IU) of follitropin alfa and 75 IU of lutropin alfa every day.\n\n\n\n88\n\n\uf0b7 According to your response, your doctor may decide to add every day a dose of a licensed \nfollitropin alfa preparation to your Pergoveris injection. In this case, the follitropin alfa dose is \nusually increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU.\n\n\uf0b7 Treatment is continued until you get the desired response. This is when you have developed a \nsuitable follicle, as assessed using ultrasound scans and blood tests. \n\n\uf0b7 This may take up to 5 weeks. \n\nWhen you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of human chorionic \ngonadotropin (hCG) 24 to 48 hours after your last Pergoveris injection. The best time to have sex is \non the day of the hCG injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may \nbe performed.\n\nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG \n(see in section 2. under \u201dOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u201d). In this case, your doctor will \ngive you a lower follitropin alfa dose in the following cycle.\n\nIf you use more Pergoveris than you should\nThe effects of an overdose of Pergoveris are unknown, nevertheless one could expect OHSS to occur. \nHowever this will only occur if hCG is administered (see in section 2. under \u201cOvarian \nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u201d).\n\nIf you forget to use Pergoveris\nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor.\n\nIf you have any further question on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nMost serious side effects\nContact your doctor straight away if you notice any of the below listed side effects. The doctor \nmight ask you to stop using Pergoveris.\n\nAllergic reactions\nAllergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can \nsometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\n\uf0b7 Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting. These may be the symptoms of \n\novarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Your ovaries may have over-reacted to the \ntreatment and formed large sacs of fluid or cysts (see in section 2. under \u201cOvarian \nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u201d). This side effect is common. If this happens, your doctor\nwill need to examine you as soon as possible.\n\n\uf0b7 The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, \nweight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. \nThis side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).\n\n\uf0b7 Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting occur rarely (may affect \nup to 1 in 1,000 people).\n\n\uf0b7 Serious blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) usually with severe OHSS are found \nvery rarely. This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack. In rare cases this \ncan also happen independently of OHSS (see in section 2. under \u201cBlood clotting problems \n(thromboembolic events)\u201d).\n\n\n\n89\n\nOther side effects\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\n\uf0b7 sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts)\n\uf0b7 headache\n\uf0b7 local reactions at the injection site such as pain, itching, bruising, swelling or irritation.\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n\uf0b7 diarrhoea\n\uf0b7 breast pain\n\uf0b7 feeling sick or vomiting\n\uf0b7 abdominal or pelvic pain\n\uf0b7 abdominal cramp or bloating.\n\nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people):\n\uf0b7 Your asthma may get worse.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.\n\n5. How to store Pergoveris\n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month.\n\nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C).

Both \nbelong to the family of hormones called \u201cgonadotropins\u201d, which are involved in reproduction and \nfertility.\n\nWhat Pergoveris is used for\nThis medicine is used to stimulate the development of follicles (each containing an egg) in your \novaries. This is to help you get pregnant. It is for use in adult women (18 years old or above) who \nhave low levels (severe deficiency) of \u201cfollicle stimulating hormone\u201d (FSH) and \u201cluteinising \nhormone\u201d (LH). These women are usually infertile.\n\nHow Pergoveris works\nThe active substances in Pergoveris are copies of the natural hormones FSH and LH. In your body:\n\uf0b7 FSH stimulates the production of eggs\n\uf0b7 LH stimulates the release of the eggs.\n\nBy replacing the missing hormones, Pergoveris allows women with low levels of FSH and LH to \ndevelop a follicle. This will then release an egg, after an injection of the hormone \u201chuman chorionic \ngonadotropin (hCG)\u201d. This helps the women to become pregnant.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Pergoveris\n\nYou and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor \nexperienced in treating fertility problems.\n\nDo not use Pergoveris\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) or any of \n\nthe other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)\n\n\n\n101\n\n\uf0b7 if you have a brain tumour (in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland)\n\uf0b7 if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within your ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin\n\uf0b7 if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding\n\uf0b7 if you have cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts\n\uf0b7 if you have a condition that would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as an early \n\nmenopause, malformed sex organs or benign tumours of the womb.\n\nDo not use this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before using this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Pergoveris.\n\nPorphyria\nTalk to your doctor before you start your treatment.If you or any member of your family have \nporphyria (an inability to breakdown porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children).\nTell your doctor straight away if:\n\uf0b7 your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently exposed \n\nto sunlight\n\uf0b7 you have stomach, arm or leg pain.\n\nIn case of above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\nThis medicine stimulates your ovaries. This increases your risk of developing ovarian \nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). This is when your follicles develop too much and become large \ncysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you \nhave difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away. They might ask you to stop using this \nmedicine (see in section 4. under \u201cMost serious side effects\u201d).\n\nIn case you are not ovulating and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered \nto, the occurrence of severe OHSS is less likely. Pergoveris treatment seldom causes severe OHSS. \nThis becomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing \nhuman chorionic gonadotrophin, hCG) is administered (see in section 3. under \u201cHow much to use\u201d for \ndetails). If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle \nand you may be told not to have sex or that you should use a barrier contraceptive method for at least \nfour days.\nYour doctor will ensure, careful monitoring of the ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood \ntests (oestradiol measurements) before and during the course of treatment.\n\nMultiple pregnancy\nWhen using Pergoveris, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (\u201cmultiple pregnancy\u201d, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy \nby using the right dose of Pergoveris at the right times.\n\nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as blood tests are recommended.\n\nMiscarriage\nWhen undergoing stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a \nmiscarriage than the average woman.\n\n\n\n102\n\nEctopic pregnancy\nWomen who have ever had blocked or damaged fallopian tubes (tubal disease) are at risk of \npregnancy where the embryo is implanted outside the womb (ectopic pregnancy). This is whether the \npregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.\n\nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)\nTalk to your doctor before using Pergoveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood \nclots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood \nclots or existing clots might become worse with Pergoveris treatment.\n\nTumours of sex organs\nThere have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in \nwomen who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment.\n\nAllergic reactions\nThere have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to Pergoveris. If you have ever had \nthis type of reaction to a similar medicine, talk to your doctor before using Pergoveris.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nPergoveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old.\n\nOther medicines and Pergoveris\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.\n\nDo not use Pergoveris with other medicines in the same injection. You can use Pergoveris with a \nlicensed follitropin alfa preparation as separate injections, if prescribed by your doctor.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nDo not use Pergoveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nIt is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive or use machines.\n\nPergoveris contains sodium\nPergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n3. How to use Pergoveris\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nUsing this medicine\n\uf0b7 Pergoveris is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). To \n\nminimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day. \n\n\uf0b7 Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the Pergoveris pre-filled pen to inject the \nmedicine.\n\n\uf0b7 If they are satisfied that you can administer Pergoveris safely, you can then prepare and inject \nthe medicine yourself at home.\n\n\uf0b7 If you administer Pergoveris to yourself, please carefully read and follow section \u201cInstructions \nfor Use\u201d.\n\nHow much to use\nA treatment regimen commences with the recommended dose of Pergoveris containing \n150 International Units (IU) of follitropin alfa and 75 IU of lutropin alfa every day.\n\n\n\n103\n\n\uf0b7 According to your response, your doctor may decide to add every day a dose of a licensed \nfollitropin alfa preparation to your Pergoveris injection. In this case, the follitropin alfa dose is \nusually increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU.\n\n\uf0b7 Treatment is continued until you get the desired response. This is when you have developed a \nsuitable follicle, as assessed using ultrasound scans and blood tests. \n\n\uf0b7 This may take up to 5 weeks. \n\nWhen you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of human chorionic \ngonadotropin (hCG) 24 to 48 hours after your last Pergoveris injection. The best time to have sex is \non the day of the hCG injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may \nbe performed.\n\nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG \n(see in section 2. under \u201dOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u201d). In this case, your doctor will \ngive you a lower follitropin alfa dose in the following cycle.\n\nIf you use more Pergoveris than you should\nThe effects of an overdose of Pergoveris are unknown, nevertheless one could expect OHSS to occur. \nHowever this will only occur if hCG is administered (see in section 2. under \u201cOvarian \nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u201d).\n\nIf you forget to use Pergoveris\nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor.\n\nIf you have any further question on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nMost serious side effects\nContact your doctor straight away if you notice any of the below listed side effects. The doctor \nmight ask you to stop using Pergoveris.\n\nAllergic reactions\nAllergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can \nsometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\n\uf0b7 Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting. These may be the symptoms of \n\novarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Your ovaries may have over-reacted to the \ntreatment and formed large sacs of fluid or cysts (see in section 2. under \u201cOvarian \nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u201d). This side effect is common. If this happens, your doctor \nwill need to examine you as soon as possible.\n\n\uf0b7 The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, \nweight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. \nThis side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).\n\n\uf0b7 Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting occur rarely (may affect \nup to 1 in 1,000 people).\n\n\uf0b7 Serious blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) usually with severe OHSS are found \nvery rarely. This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack. In rare cases this \ncan also happen independently of OHSS (see in section 2. under \u201cBlood clotting problems \n(thromboembolic events)\u201d).\n\n\n\n104\n\nOther side effects\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\n\uf0b7 sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts)\n\uf0b7 headache\n\uf0b7 local reactions at the injection site such as pain, itching, bruising, swelling or irritation.\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n\uf0b7 diarrhoea\n\uf0b7 breast pain\n\uf0b7 feeling sick or vomiting\n\uf0b7 abdominal or pelvic pain\n\uf0b7 abdominal cramp or bloating.\n\nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people):\n\uf0b7 Your asthma may get worse.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.\n\n5. How to store Pergoveris\n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month.\n\nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light.\n\nOnce opened, the pre-filled pen may be stored for a maximum of 28 days outside of the refrigerator \n(at 25\u00b0C).\n\nDo not use Pergoveris if you notice any visible signs of deterioration, if the liquid contains particles \nor is not clear.\n\nAfter the injection, dispose of the used needle safely.\n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

\"follitropin alfa\" and \"lutropin alfa\". both belong to the family of hormones called \"gonadotropins\", which are involved in reproduction and fertility. what pergoveris is used for this medicine is used to stimulate the development of follicles (each containing an egg) in your ovaries. this is to help you get pregnant. it is for use in adult women (18 years old or above) who have low levels (severe deficiency) of \"follicle stimulating hormone\" (fsh) and \"luteinising hormone\" (lh). these women are usually infertile. how pergoveris works the active substances in pergoveris are copies of the natural hormones fsh and lh. in your body: fsh stimulates the production of eggs lh stimulates the release of the eggs. by replacing the missing hormones, pergoveris allows women with low levels of fsh and lh to develop a follicle. this will then release an egg, after an injection of the hormone \"human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg)\". this helps the women to become pregnant.",

fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor experienced in treating fertility problems. do not use pergoveris if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone (fsh), luteinising hormone (lh) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 62 if you have a brain tumour (in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland) if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within your ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding if you have cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts if you have a condition that would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as an early menopause, malformed sex organs or benign tumours of the womb. do not use this medicine if any of the above apply to you. if you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using this medicine. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using pergoveris. porphyria talk to your doctor before you start your treatment.if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an inability to breakdown porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). tell your doctor straight away if: your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently exposed to sunlight you have stomach, arm or leg pain. in case of above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss) this medicine stimulates your ovaries. this increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss). this is when your follicles develop too much and become large cysts. if you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away. they might ask you to stop using this medicine (see in section 4. under \"most serious side effects\"). in case you are not ovulating and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of severe ohss is less likely. pergoveris treatment seldom causes severe ohss. this becomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotrophin, hcg) is administered (see in section 3. under \"how much to use\" for details). if you are developing ohss your doctor may not give you any hcg in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or that you should use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four days. your doctor will ensure, careful monitoring of the ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood tests (oestradiol measurements) before and during the course of treatment. multiple pregnancy when using pergoveris, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same time (\"multiple pregnancy\", mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you and your babies. you can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy by using the right dose of pergoveris at the right times. to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as blood tests are recommended. miscarriage when undergoing stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. ectopic pregnancy women who have ever had blocked or damaged fallopian tubes (tubal disease) are at risk of pregnancy where the embryo is implanted outside the womb (ectopic pregnancy). this is whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) talk to your doctor before using pergoveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. you may be at a higher risk of serious blood clots or existing clots might become worse with pergoveris treatment. tumours of sex organs there have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. allergic reactions there have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to pergoveris. if you have ever had this type of reaction to a similar medicine, talk to your doctor before using pergoveris. children and adolescents pergoveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. other medicines and pergoveris tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. do not use pergoveris with other medicines in the same injection, except for follitropin alfa, if prescribed by your doctor. pregnancy and breast-feeding do not use pergoveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. driving and using machines it is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive or use machines. pergoveris contains sodium pergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \"sodium-free\".", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "pergoveris", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "the treatment", "Type":

"Section_3": {"Title": "3. how to use pergoveris", "Section_Content": "always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. using this medicine pergoveris is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). to minimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day. it comes as a powder and liquid, which you need to mix together and then use straight away. your doctor or nurse will show you how to prepare and inject this medicine. they will supervise your first injection. if they are satisfied that you can administer pergoveris safely, you can then prepare and inject the medicine yourself at home. when you do this, please carefully read and follow the instructions hereafter called \"how to prepare and use the pergoveris powder and solvent\". how much to use the usual starting dose is one vial of pergoveris every day. according to your response, your doctor may decide to add every day a dose of a licensed follitropin alfa preparation to your pergoveris injection. in this case, the follitropin alfa dose is usually increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 iu. treatment is continued until you get the desired response. this is when you have developed a suitable follicle, as assessed using ultrasound scans and blood tests. this may take up to 5 weeks. when you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) 24 to 48 hours after your last pergoveris injection. the best time to have sex is on the day of the hcg injection and the day after. alternatively, intrauterine insemination (iui) may be performed. if your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hcg (see in section 2. under \"ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss)\"). in this case, your doctor will give you a lower follitropin alfa dose in the following cycle. how to prepare and use the pergoveris powder and solvent before starting the preparation, please read these instructions the whole way through first: give yourself the injection at the same time each day. 1. wash your hands and find a clean area it is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible a good place is a clean table or kitchen surface 2. get together everything you need and lay them out 1 vial containing pergoveris powder 1 vial containing water for injections (solvent) not provided in the pack: 2 alcohol swabs 1 empty syringe for injection 1 needle for preparation 1 fine bore needle for injection under the skin one sharps container for safe disposal of glass and needles 3. preparing the solution remove the protective cap from the vial filled with water (solvent vial). attach the needle for preparation to the empty syringe for injection. draw up some air into the syringe by pulling the plunger to approximately the 1 ml mark. insert the needle into the vial, push the plunger to expel the air. turn the vial upside down and gently draw up all the water (solvent). remove the syringe from the vial and set it down carefully. do not touch the needle and do not allow the needle to touch any surface. remove the protective cap from the vial filled with pergoveris powder. pick up your syringe and slowly inject the contents of the syringe into the vial of powder. swirl gently without removing the syringe. do not shake. after the powder has dissolved (which usually occurs immediately), check that the resulting solution is clear and does not contain any particles. turn the vial upside down, gently draw the solution back into the syringe. check for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is not clear. 4. getting the syringe ready for injection change the needle for the fine bore needle. remove any air bubbles: if you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top. push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone. 5. injecting the dose immediately inject the solution. your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh). to minimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day. clean the chosen skin area with an alcohol swab using a circular motion. firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45\u00b0 to 90 angle using a dart-like motion. inject under the skin, as you were taught. do not inject directly into a vein. inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger. take as much time as you need to inject all the solution. then withdraw the needle and clean the skin with a new alcohol swab using a circular motion. 6. after the injection dispose of all used items. once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and empty vials in your sharps container. any unused solution must be discarded. if you use more pergoveris than you should the effects of an overdose of pergoveris are unknown, nevertheless one could expect ohss to occur. however this will only occur if hcg is administered (see in section 2. under \"ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss)\"). if you forget to use pergoveris do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. please contact your doctor. if you have any further question on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "pergoveris", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "this medicine", "Type":

of the below listed side effects. the doctor might ask you to stop using pergoveris. allergic reactions allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can sometimes be serious. this side effect is very rare. ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss) lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting. these may be the symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss). your ovaries may have over-reacted to the treatment and formed large sacs of fluid or cysts (see in section 2. under \"ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (ohss)\"). this side effect is common. if this happens, your doctor will need to examine you as soon as possible. the ohss may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. this side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). complications of ohss such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting occur rarely (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). serious blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) usually with severe ohss are found very rarely. this could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack. in rare cases this can also happen independently of ohss (see in section 2. under \"blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)\"). other side effects very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) headache local reactions at the injection site such as pain, itching, bruising, swelling or irritation. common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): diarrhoea breast pain feeling sick or vomiting abdominal or pelvic pain abdominal cramp or bloating. very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): your asthma may get worse. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet.
