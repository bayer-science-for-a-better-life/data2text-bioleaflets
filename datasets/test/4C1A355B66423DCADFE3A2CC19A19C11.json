NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMirvaso 3 mg/g gel \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne gram of gel contains 3.3 mg of brimonidine, equivalent to 5 mg of brimonidine tartrate. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect: \nOne gram of gel contains 1 mg methylparahydroxybenzoate (E218) and 55 mg propylene glycol \n(E1520). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGel. \n \nWhite to light yellow opaque aqueous gel. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMirvaso is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of facial erythema of rosacea in adult patients. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nOne application per 24 hours, at any time suitable for the patient, for as long as facial erythema is \npresent. \n \nThe maximum daily recommended dose is 1 g of gel in total weight, which corresponds to \napproximately five pea sized amounts. \n \nTreatment should be initiated with a smaller amount of gel (less than the maximum) for at least one \nweek. The amount of gel can then be increased gradually based on tolerability and patient response.  \n \nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nThe experience of use of Mirvaso in patients aged above 65 years is limited (see also section 4.8). No \ndose adjustment is necessary. \n \nHepatic and renal impairment \n\nMirvaso has not been studied in patients with hepatic and renal impairment. \n \n \nPaediatric population \n\n \nThe safety and efficacy of Mirvaso in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMirvaso is contraindicated in children aged less than 2 years because of serious systemic safety risk \n(see section 4.3). Safety concerns related to the systemic absorption of brimonidine have also been \nidentified for the age group 2 to 12 years (see section 4.9). Mirvaso should not be used in children or \nadolescents aged 2 to 18 years. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nCutaneous use only. \n \nMirvaso should be applied smoothly and evenly as a thin layer across the entire face (forehead, chin, \nnose and both cheeks) avoiding the eyes, eyelids, lips, mouth and membrane of the inner nose. \nMirvaso should be applied only to the face. \n \nHands should be washed immediately after applying the medicinal product. \n \nMirvaso can be used in conjunction with other cutaneous medicinal products for the treatment \nof inflammatory lesions of rosacea and with cosmetics. These products should not be applied \nimmediately before the daily application of Mirvaso; they may be used only after the applied \nMirvaso has dried. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nChildren aged less than 2 years. \n \nPatients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy (for example selegiline or \nmoclobemide) and patients on tricyclic (such as imipramine) or tetracyclic (such as maprotiline, \nmianserin or mirtazapin) antidepressants which affect noradrenergic transmission. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMirvaso should not be applied on irritated skin (including following laser therapy) or open wounds.  \nIn case of severe irritation or contact allergy, the treatment with the medicinal product should be \ndiscontinued. \n \nExacerbation of rosacea symptoms is very common in patients treated with Mirvaso. Across all \nclinical studies, 16% of patients receiving Mirvaso experienced an event of symptom exacerbation. \nTreatment should be initiated with a small amount of gel and the dose increased gradually, based on \ntolerability and response to treatment (see section 4.2). \n \nErythema and flushing \nThe effect of Mirvaso topical gel begins to diminish hours after application. In some patients, \nerythema and flushing were reported to return with greater severity than was present at baseline. Most \nof the cases were observed within the first 2 weeks of starting the treatment (see section 4.8). \n \nThe onset of flushing relative to application of Mirvaso topical gel varied, ranging from \napproximately 30 minutes to several hours (see section 4.8). \n \nIn the majority of these cases, erythema and flushing resolved after discontinuation of \nMirvaso topical gel. \n \nIn case worsening of erythema occurs, Mirvaso topical gel should be discontinued. Symptomatic \nmeasures, such as cooling, NSAID and antihistamines, may help in alleviating symptoms. \n \nRecurrences of aggravated erythema and flushing have been reported after re-administration of \nMirvaso topical gel. Prior to resuming treatment after temporary discontinuation due to aggravated \n\n\n\n4 \n\nerythema or flushing, perform a test application on a small area of the face for at least one day before \nfull facial application is resumed. \n \nIt is important to inform the patient not to exceed the recommended maximum dose (5 pea size \namounts) and frequency of application (once daily). \n \nMirvaso should not be applied close to the eyes. \n \nConcomitant use of other systemic alpha adrenergic receptor agonists \nThe concomitant use of other systemic alpha adrenergic receptor agonists may potentiate the \nundesirable effects of this class of medicinal products in patients: \n- with severe or unstable or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease; \n- with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, orthostatic \n\nhypotension, thrombangiitis obliterans, scleroderma, or Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. \n \nOther \nAny increase in the daily amount applied above 5 pea sized amounts and/or increase in frequency of \ndaily application of the medicinal product should be avoided, since the safety of higher daily doses or \nrepeated daily application has not been assessed. \n \nThe medicinal product contains methylparahydroxybenzoate (E218) which may cause allergic \nreactions (possibly delayed), and propylene glycol (E1520) which may cause skin irritation. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nMirvaso is contraindicated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy \nand patients on tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants which affect noradrenergic transmission \n(see section 4.3). \n \nThe possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with central nervous system depressants \n(alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anaesthetics) should be considered. \n \nNo data on the level of circulating catecholamines after Mirvaso administration are available. Caution, \nhowever, is advised in patients taking substances which can affect the metabolism and uptake of \ncirculating amines e.g. chlorpromazine, methylphenidate, reserpine. \n \nCaution is advised when initiating (or changing the dose of) a concomitant systemic substance \n(irrespective of pharmaceutical form) which may interact with alpha adrenergic receptor agonists or \ninterfere with their activity i.e. agonists or antagonists of the adrenergic receptor e.g. (isoprenaline, \nprazosin). \n \nBrimonidine may cause clinically insignificant decreases in blood pressure in some patients. Caution \nis therefore advised when using medicinal products such as anti-hypertensives and/or cardiac \nglycosides concomitantly with brimonidine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of brimonidine in pregnant women. Animal \nstudies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Mirvaso during \npregnancy. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether brimonidine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. Mirvaso should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nBrimonidine did not present any special reproductive or developmental hazard in animal species. \n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMirvaso has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are erythema, pruritus, flushing and skin burning \nsensation, all occurring in 1.2 to 3.3% of patients in clinical studies. They are typically mild to \nmoderate in severity, and usually do not require discontinuation of treatment. Aggravated erythema, \nflushing and skin burning sensation have been reported during the post-marketing period (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reactions are classified by System Organ Class and frequency, using the following \nconvention: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), \nrare (\u2265 1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data) and were reported with Mirvaso either in clinical studies, or during the post-marketing \nexperience (identified by an asterix (*) in Table 1). \n \nTable 1 \u2013 Adverse reactions \n \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions \nCardiac disorders Rare Bradycardia* \nNervous system disorders Uncommon Headache, paraesthesia \nEye disorders Uncommon Eyelid oedema \nVascular disorders Common Flushing, pallor at the application site* \n\nUncommon Dizziness* \nRare Hypotension* \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Nasal congestion \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon Dry mouth \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon Erythema, pruritus, rosacea, skin burning \nsensation \n\nUncommon Acne, allergic contact dermatitis, contact \ndermatitis, dermatitis, dry skin, pain of skin, skin \ndiscomfort, rash papular, skin irritation, skin \nwarm, swelling face*, urticaria* \n\nRare Angioedema* \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nUncommon Feeling hot, peripheral coldness \n\n* Adverse reactions reported from post-marketing data. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nBradycardia and hypotension \nPost-marketing cases of bradycardia, hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension) and dizziness \nhave been reported, some of which required hospitalisation. Some cases involved application of \nMirvaso following laser procedures (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nOther special populations \nElderly patients \n\nNo meaningful differences in the safety profiles were observed between the elderly subject population \nand subjects 18 to 65 years of age. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdoses after oral use of other alpha2-agonists have been reported to cause symptoms such as \nhypotension, asthenia, vomiting, lethargy, sedation, bradycardia, arrhythmias, miosis, apnoea, \nhypotonia, hypothermia, respiratory depression and seizure. \n \nTreatment of an oral overdose includes supportive and symptomatic therapy; a patent airway should \nbe maintained. \n \nPaediatric population \nSerious adverse reactions following inadvertent ingestion of Mirvaso by two young children of one \nclinical study subject have been reported. The children experienced symptoms consistent with \npreviously reported oral overdoses of alpha2-agonist in young children. Both children were reported \nto have made a full recovery within 24 hours. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other dermatological preparations, Other dermatologicals,  \nATC code: D11AX21. \n \n\nMechanism of action \nBrimonidine is a highly selective alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist that is 1000-fold more selective \nfor the alpha2-adrenergic receptor than the alpha1-adrenergic receptor. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nCutaneous facial application of a highly selective alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist reduces erythema \nthrough direct cutaneous vasoconstriction. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe efficacy of Mirvaso in the treatment of moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea has been \ndemonstrated in two randomised, vehicle controlled blinded clinical trials, which were identical in \ndesign. Moderate to severe erythema was defined as a grade 3 or greater on both the Clinician \nErythema Assessment (CEA) scale and Patient Self-Assessment (PSA) scale. The studies were \nconducted in 553 randomised subjects aged 18 years and older who were treated once daily \nfor 4 weeks with either Mirvaso or vehicle. Of these, 539 completed 29 days of treatment and had data \navailable to be included in the efficacy analysis at Day 29, with the majority being Caucasians \nbetween 18 and 65 years of age. \n \nThe primary endpoint was expressed in terms of composite success i.e. subjects responding with \na 2-grade reduction on both baseline CEA score and baseline PSA score on Day 29. The results from \nboth clinical studies demonstrated that Mirvaso was significantly more effective (p<0.001) in the \nreduction of facial erythema of rosacea than vehicle gel when applied once daily for 29 days (primary \nendpoint, see Table 2). For the population subset of patients with severe erythema at baseline \n\n\n\n7 \n\nDay 1 (i.e. subjects with CEA or PSA grade of 4) which represented 26% of the randomised subjects, \nthe results on the primary endpoint on Day 29 were similar to those results observed in the overall \npopulation (see Table 3) and were statistically significant for both studies combined (p=0.003). In \naddition, for the overall population, Mirvaso demonstrated statistical superiority (p<0.001) over \nvehicle gel with respect to rapid initial onset of a clinically meaningful effect (1-Grade Composite \nSuccess for CEA and PSA) after the first application at 30 minutes on Day 1(secondary \nendpoint 27.9% vs. 6.9% for Study 1, 28.4% vs. 4.8% for Study 2), and to achievement of a clinically \nmeaningful effect (1-Grade Composite Success for CEA and PSA) on Day 29 (tertiary endpoint, see \nTable 4). \n \nCEA and PSA were defined as follows: \nCEA: Clinician Erythema Assessment: 0=Clear skin with no signs of erythema, 1=Almost clear; slight \nredness, 2=Mild erythema; definite redness, 3=Moderate erythema+ marked redness and 4=Severe \nerythema+ fiery redness \n \nPSA: Patient Self-Assessment: 0=No redness, 1=Very mild redness, 2=Mild redness, 3=Moderate \nredness and 4=Severe redness \n \nTable 2: Percentage of subjects with a 2-grade improvement in both CEA and PSA \n \nSuccess day 29 Study 1 Study 2 \n\nMirvaso \nGel n=127 \n\nVehicle \nGel n=128 \n\nMirvaso \nGel n=142 \n\nVehicle \nGel n=142 \n\n3 hours after application 31.5% 10.9% 25.4% 9.2% \n6 hours after application 30.7% 9.4% 25.4% 9.2% \n9 hours after application 26.0% 10.2% 17.6% 10.6% \n12 hours after application 22.8% 8.6% 21.1% 9.9% \nDay 29 p-value <0.001 - <0.001 -  \n \nTable 3: Percentage of subjects with severe erythema at baseline Day 1 (CEA or PSA grade 4) \nwith 2-grade improvement in both CEA and PSA \n \nSuccess day 29 Study 1 + Study 2 \n\nMirvaso Gel n=79 Vehicle Gel n=63 \n3 hours after application 22.8% 9.5% \n6 hours after application 26.6% 7.9% \n9 hours after application 20.3% 11.1% \n12 hours after application 21.5% 4.8% \nDay 29 p-value 0.003 - \n \nTable 4: Percentage of subjects with a 1-grade improvement in both CEA and PSA \n \nSuccess Day 29 Study 1 Study 2 \n\nMirvaso \nGel n=127 \n\nVehicle \nGel n=128 \n\nMirvaso \nGel n=142 \n\nVehicle \nGel n=142 \n\n3 hours after application 70.9% 32.8% 71.1% 40.1% \n6 hours after application 69.3% 32.0% 64.8% 43.0% \n9 hours after application 63.8% 29.7% 66.9% 39.4% \n12 hours after application 56.7% 30.5% 53.5% 40.1% \nDay 29 p-value <0.001 - <0.001 - \n \nNo clinically meaningful trends with respect to tachyphylaxis or rebound effects (worsening of \nbaseline erythema after cessation of treatment) were observed with use of Mirvaso for 29 days. \n \nThe results from a long term open label study in 449 patients, with continuous treatment for up to one \nyear, confirmed that chronic use of Mirvaso is safe and effective. Daily reductions in erythema for the \n\n\n\n8 \n\nfirst month of use (as measured with the CEA and PSA scales) were similar to those observed in the \ncontrolled trials, and those reductions were achievable for up to 12 months with no apparent loss \nof effect over time. The overall frequencies of adverse reactions in this study are reflected in \nTable 1 above, with the highest rates occurring in the first 29 days of use. No adverse reactions \nhad an increase in frequency over time, and there was no evidence that long-term use of \nMirvaso conveyed an increased risk of occurrence of any specific type of adverse reaction. \n \nConcomitant use of Mirvaso with other medicinal products for the treatment of inflammatory lesions \nof rosacea has not been systematically investigated. However, in the long term open label study, the \nefficacy and safety of Mirvaso, as described above, was not affected by the concomitant use of \ncosmetics or other medicinal products (e.g. topical metronidazole, topical azelaic acid, and oral \ntetracyclines including low dose doxycycline) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea \nin the concerned subpopulation (131/449 patients in the study used concomitant rosacea medicinal \nproduct). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nMirvaso in all subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of rosacea (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThe absorption of brimonidine from Mirvaso was evaluated in a clinical study in 24 adult subjects \nwith facial erythema of rosacea. All enrolled subjects received a single-day ocular administration of \na 0.2% eye drops solution of brimonidine followed by a once daily cutaneous application of Mirvaso \nfor 29 days (intra-individual comparison of systemic exposure). On Day 1 of the study, all subjects \nreceived 1 drop of the 0.2% eye drops solution in each eye, every 8 hours over a 24-hour period \n(3 doses in total). \n \nAfter repeated cutaneous application of Mirvaso on facial skin, no drug accumulation in plasma was \nobserved throughout the treatment duration: the highest mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) plasma maximum \nconcentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24hr) \nwere 46 \u00b1 62 pg/mL and 417 \u00b1 264 pg.hr/mL respectively. These levels are significantly lower \n(2-fold) than those observed following single-day ocular administration of a 0.2% eye drops solution \nof brimonidine. \n \nDistribution \nThe protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied. \n \nBiotransformation \nBrimonidine is extensively metabolised by the liver. \n \nElimination \nUrinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development. \n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nMirvaso 3 mg/g gel \nbrimonidine \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Mirvaso is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Mirvaso \n3. How to use Mirvaso \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Mirvaso \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Mirvaso is and what it is used for \n \nMirvaso contains the active substance brimonidine which belongs to a group of medicines commonly \nreferred to as \u201calpha agonists\u201d. \n \nIt is applied to the skin of the face to treat redness due to rosacea in adult patients. \n \nRedness of the face due to rosacea is caused by high levels of blood flow in the facial skin, which is \nthe result of enlargement (dilation) of the small blood vessels of the skin. \n \nWhen applied, Mirvaso acts to narrow these blood vessels again which reduces the excess blood flow \nand redness. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Mirvaso \n \n\nDo not use Mirvaso: \n- if you are allergic to brimonidine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- in children below 2 years of age, as they may be at greater risk of side effects from any of the \n\nmedicine absorbed through the skin. \n- if you are taking certain medicines used for depression or Parkinson\u2019s disease including \n\nso-called monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (for example selegiline or moclobemide) \nor tricyclic antidepressants (such as imipramine) or tetracyclic antidepressants (such as \nmaprotiline, mianserin or mirtazapin). Use of Mirvaso when taking these medicines may result \nin a fall in blood pressure. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist, before using Mirvaso especially if: \n- the skin of your face is irritated or has open wounds. \n- you have problems with your heart or your blood circulation. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n- you have depression, decreased blood flow to the brain or the heart, fall in blood pressure on \nstanding up, decreased blood flow to the hands, feet or skin, or Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome (a chronic \ndisease in which the body\u2019s natural defence - the immune system - attacks the \nmoisture-producing glands). \n\n- you have kidney or liver problems or have had them in the past. \n- you have had, or plan to have any laser procedure on the skin of your face. \n \nIt is important to start treatment with a small amount of gel, increase the dose gradually but do not \nexceed the maximum dose of 1 gram (approximately 5 pea sized amounts). See also instructions \u2018How \nto use Mirvaso\u2019. \n \nDo not apply Mirvaso more than once a day and do not exceed the maximum daily dose of 1gram \n(approximately 5 pea sized amounts). See also instructions \u2018How to use Mirvaso\u2019. \n \nWorsening of skin redness, flushing or burning feeling of the skin \nUp to 1 in 6 patients experience the return of their redness worse than it was initially. Such worsening \nof redness usually develops within the first 2 weeks of treatment with Mirvaso. Generally, it resolves \nspontaneously after treatment is stopped. The effect should gradually disappear within a few days in \nmost cases. Before you restart the treatment with Mirvaso, test it on a small area of the face on a day \nwhen you can stay at home. If you do not experience worsening of redness or burning, continue with \nthe usual treatment (see section 3). \nIn case of worsening or unexpected redness, discontinue the treatment and contact your doctor. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor since this medicine may not be suitable for you. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the safety and \nefficacy has not been established for this age group. This is particularly important in children under \nthe age of 2 years (see \u2018Do not use Mirvaso\u2019). \n \nOther medicines and Mirvaso \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, because these medicines could affect your treatment with Mirvaso or Mirvaso could affect \nyour treatment with these medicines. \n \nDo not take Mirvaso with selegiline, moclobemide, imipramine, mianserin, or maprotiline, which are \nmedicines that can be used for depression or Parkinson\u2019s disease, as this could lead to a change in the \neffectiveness of Mirvaso or could increase the chances for side effects such as a fall in blood pressure \n(see under \u2018Do not use Mirvaso\u2019). \n \nAlso, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n- medicines used for the treatment of pain, sleep disorders, or anxiety disorders \n- medicines used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders (chlorpromazine) or used for \n\nhyperactivity (methylphenidate) or used for high blood pressure (reserpine). \n- medicines which act on the same body mechanism as Mirvaso (other alpha agonists, e.g. \n\nclonidine; so-called alpha blockers or alpha antagonists, e.g. prazosin, isoprenaline which are \nmost often used for treatment of high blood pressure, slow heart rate or asthma). \n\n- cardiac glycosides (e.g. digoxin), used to treat heart problems. \n- blood pressure lowering medicine such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers (e.g. \n\npropranolol, amlodipine). \n \nIf any of the above applies to you, or if you are unsure, talk to your doctor. \n \n\nMirvaso with alcohol \nTell your doctor if you consume alcohol regularly as this could affect your treatment with this \nmedicine. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nThe use of Mirvaso is not recommended during pregnancy. This is because its effects on your unborn \nbaby are unknown. You should not use this medicine during breast-feeding, as it is unknown whether \nthis medicine passes into the breast milk. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nMirvaso has no significant influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nMirvaso contains: \n- Methylparahydroxybenzoate (E218) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). \n- Propylene glycol (E1520) which may cause skin irritation. \n \n \n3. How to use Mirvaso \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \nImportant: Mirvaso is intended for adults and only for use on the skin of the face. Do not use this \nmedicine on other parts of your body, especially moist body surfaces, e.g. your eyes, mouth, nose or \nvagina. \nDo not swallow. \nKeep Mirvaso gel away from children. \n \nHow to use Mirvaso \nMirvaso is recommended to be applied to the face once a day only. \n \nDuring the first week, start the treatment with a small amount of gel (a pea-sized amount) as explained \nby your doctor or nurse.  \n \nIf your symptoms remain the same or improve only slightly, you may then gradually increase the \namount of gel. Spread it smoothly and evenly as a very thin layer as directed by your doctor or nurse. \nIt is important not to exceed the maximum daily dose of 1gram (5 pea sized amounts applied to the \nwhole face). \n \nYou should wash your hands immediately after applying this medicine. \n \nIf your symptoms worsen during treatment with Mirvaso (increased redness, or burning), stop \ntreatment and make an appointment to see your doctor \u2013 see also section 2 under `Warnings and \nprecautions\u2019. \n \nYou must avoid the eyes, eyelids, lips, mouth, and the inside of the nose. Should any gel get onto these \nareas, wash them immediately with plenty of water. If you experience worsening of redness or burning \nyou should stop using Mirvaso and contact your doctor if needed. \n \nDo not apply any other skin medicines or cosmetics immediately before the daily application of \nMirvaso. You should use these products only after the applied Mirvaso has dried. \n \nPay attention when opening the tube / pump for the first time, not to spill a larger quantity of gel than \nwhat is needed. If this occurs, you should discard the excess gel so as not to apply more than the \nrecommended dose. See paragraph \u201cHow to use Mirvaso\u201d above. \n \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\n[EU/1/13/904/004-006] \nHow to open the tube with a child-resistant cap \nTo avoid spilling, do not squeeze the tube while opening or closing. \nPush down on the cap and turn counterclockwise (turn to the left). Then pull the cap off. \n \n\n \n \nHow to close the tube with a child-resistant cap \nPush down and turn clockwise (turn to the right). \n \n\n \n \n[EU/1/13/904/007] \nHow to open the pump with a child-resistant cap \nPush down on the cap and turn counterclockwise (turn to the left) until the cap can be removed. \nNote: when the cap is removed, the pump is not child-resistant. \n\n \n \nBefore the first use, prime the pump by pressing down several times until the medicine is idispensed \nonto your fingertip. \nTo apply Mirvaso gel to your face, dispense a pea-sized amount of Mirvaso from the pump onto your \nfingertip. Continue to press down the pump to get the number of pea sizes you need according to your \ndoctor\u2019s prescription (but no more than 5 pea sizes in total). \n \n\n  \nTo close the pump, place the cap back on the pump. Push down and turn the cap to the right \n(clockwise) until it stops. The pump is child-resistant again. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nIf you use more Mirvaso than you should \nIf you use more than the maximum daily dose of 1 gram within a 24 hour period, it could lead to skin \nirritation or other side effects at the application site. Repeated doses within the same 24 hour period \ncould result in side effects, such as low blood pressure, drowsiness or sleepiness. \nPlease contact your doctor, who will advise you on what action to take. \n \nIf anyone, especially a child, accidentally swallows Mirvaso, they may have serious side effects \nand need to be treated in a hospital. \nContact your doctor immediately or go to a hospital emergency department right away if you, a child, \nor anyone else swallows this medicine and has any of these symptoms: feeling dizzy from low blood \npressure, vomiting, tiredness or drowsiness, decreased or irregular heartbeats, small pupils (constricted \npupils), difficult or slow breathing, floppiness, low body temperature and convulsions (fits). Take the \nmedicine pack with you, so the doctor knows what was swallowed. \n \nIf you forget to use Mirvaso \nMirvaso works on a daily basis, starting with the first day of treatment. If you miss a daily dose, your \nredness will not be reduced for that day. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose and \ncontinue your treatment as prescribed. \n \nIf you stop using Mirvaso \nA potential consequence of stopping the treatment before finishing the course of treatment is the \ndisease to come back to its initial state. Please contact your doctor before stopping your treatment, so \nthat he could advice a replacement treatment as appropriate. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf you develop uncommon side effects of severe skin irritation or inflammation, skin rash, skin pain or \ndiscomfort, dry skin, warm skin sensation, tingling or sensation of pins and needles or swelling of the \nface or common side effects like worsening of rosacea, discontinue  the treatment and talk to your \ndoctor since this medicine may not be suitable for you. In some cases, symptoms may extend beyond \nthe treatment area. See also section 2 under \u2018Warnings and precautions\u2019. \n \nIf you develop contact allergy (e.g. allergic reaction, rash) or rare angioedema (a serious allergic \nreaction see rarely usually with swelling of the face, mouth or tongue), stop using Mirvaso and seek \nprompt medical advice. \nMirvaso may also cause the following other side effects: \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- flushing \n- excessive whitening (pallor) where the gel is applied \n- skin redness, burning feeling of the skin or itching \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n- acne \n- dry mouth \n- feeling cold in hands and feet \n- feeling hot \n- headache \n- nasal congestion \n- swelling of the eyelid \n- urticaria \n- dizziness \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people): \n- hypotension (blood pressure decreased) \n- heart rate decrease (slow heart rate, known as bradycardia). \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet.

tricyclic antidepressants (such as imipramine) or tetracyclic antidepressants (such as maprotiline, mianserin or mirtazapin). use of mirvaso when taking these medicines may result in a fall in blood pressure. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist, before using mirvaso especially if: - the skin of your face is irritated or has open wounds. - you have problems with your heart or your blood circulation. - you have depression, decreased blood flow to the brain or the heart, fall in blood pressure on standing up, decreased blood flow to the hands, feet or skin, or sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (a chronic disease in which the body's natural defence - the immune system - attacks the moisture-producing glands). - you have kidney or liver problems or have had them in the past. - you have had, or plan to have any laser procedure on the skin of your face. it is important to start treatment with a small amount of gel, increase the dose gradually but do not exceed the maximum dose of 1 gram (approximately 5 pea sized amounts). see also instructions 'how to use mirvaso'. do not apply mirvaso more than once a day and do not exceed the maximum daily dose of 1gram (approximately 5 pea sized amounts). see also instructions 'how to use mirvaso'. worsening of skin redness, flushing or burning feeling of the skin up to 1 in 6 patients experience the return of their redness worse than it was initially. such worsening of redness usually develops within the first 2 weeks of treatment with mirvaso. generally, it resolves spontaneously after treatment is stopped. the effect should gradually disappear within a few days in most cases. before you restart the treatment with mirvaso, test it on a small area of the face on a day when you can stay at home. if you do not experience worsening of redness or burning, continue with the usual treatment (see section 3). in case of worsening or unexpected redness, discontinue the treatment and contact your doctor. if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor since this medicine may not be suitable for you. children and adolescents do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the safety and efficacy has not been established for this age group. this is particularly important in children under the age of 2 years (see 'do not use mirvaso'). other medicines and mirvaso tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, because these medicines could affect your treatment with mirvaso or mirvaso could affect your treatment with these medicines. do not take mirvaso with selegiline, moclobemide, imipramine, mianserin, or maprotiline, which are medicines that can be used for depression or parkinson's disease, as this could lead to a change in the effectiveness of mirvaso or could increase the chances for side effects such as a fall in blood pressure (see under 'do not use mirvaso'). also, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - medicines used for the treatment of pain, sleep disorders, or anxiety disorders - medicines used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders (chlorpromazine) or used for hyperactivity (methylphenidate) or used for high blood pressure (reserpine). - medicines which act on the same body mechanism as mirvaso (other alpha agonists, e.g. clonidine; so-called alpha blockers or alpha antagonists, e.g. prazosin, isoprenaline which are most often used for treatment of high blood pressure, slow heart rate or asthma). - cardiac glycosides (e.g. digoxin), used to treat heart problems. - blood pressure lowering medicine such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers (e.g. propranolol, amlodipine). if any of the above applies to you, or if you are unsure, talk to your doctor. mirvaso with alcohol tell your doctor if you consume alcohol regularly as this could affect your treatment with this medicine. pregnancy and breast-feeding the use of mirvaso is not recommended during pregnancy. this is because its effects on your unborn baby are unknown. you should not use this medicine during breast-feeding, as it is unknown whether this medicine passes into the breast milk. if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. driving and using machines mirvaso has no significant influence on the ability to drive and use machines. mirvaso contains: - methylparahydroxybenzoate (e218) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). - propylene glycol (e1520) which may cause skin irritation.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "mirvaso", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 17,

check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. important: mirvaso is intended for adults and only for use on the skin of the face. do not use this medicine on other parts of your body, especially moist body surfaces, e.g. your eyes, mouth, nose or vagina. do not swallow. keep mirvaso gel away from children. how to use mirvaso mirvaso is recommended to be applied to the face once a day only. during the first week, start the treatment with a small amount of gel (a pea-sized amount) as explained by your doctor or nurse. if your symptoms remain the same or improve only slightly, you may then gradually increase the amount of gel. spread it smoothly and evenly as a very thin layer as directed by your doctor or nurse. it is important not to exceed the maximum daily dose of 1gram (5 pea sized amounts applied to the whole face). you should wash your hands immediately after applying this medicine. if your symptoms worsen during treatment with mirvaso (increased redness, or burning), stop treatment and make an appointment to see your doctor see also section 2 under `warnings and precautions'. you must avoid the eyes, eyelids, lips, mouth, and the inside of the nose. should any gel get onto these areas, wash them immediately with plenty of water. if you experience worsening of redness or burning you should stop using mirvaso and contact your doctor if needed. do not apply any other skin medicines or cosmetics immediately before the daily application of mirvaso. you should use these products only after the applied mirvaso has dried. pay attention when opening the tube / pump for the first time, not to spill a larger quantity of gel than what is needed. if this occurs, you should discard the excess gel so as not to apply more than the recommended dose. see paragraph \"how to use mirvaso\" above. [eu/1/13/904/004-006] how to open the tube with a child-resistant cap to avoid spilling, do not squeeze the tube while opening or closing. push down on the cap and turn counterclockwise (turn to the left). then pull the cap off. how to close the tube with a child-resistant cap push down and turn clockwise (turn to the right). [eu/1/13/904/007] how to open the pump with a child-resistant cap push down on the cap and turn counterclockwise (turn to the left) until the cap can be removed. note: when the cap is removed, the pump is not child-resistant. before the first use, prime the pump by pressing down several times until the medicine is idispensed onto your fingertip. to apply mirvaso gel to your face, dispense a pea-sized amount of mirvaso from the pump onto your fingertip. continue to press down the pump to get the number of pea sizes you need according to your doctor's prescription (but no more than 5 pea sizes in total). to close the pump, place the cap back on the pump. push down and turn the cap to the right (clockwise) until it stops. the pump is child-resistant again. if you use more mirvaso than you should if you use more than the maximum daily dose of 1 gram within a 24 hour period, it could lead to skin irritation or other side effects at the application site. repeated doses within the same 24 hour period could result in side effects, such as low blood pressure, drowsiness or sleepiness. please contact your doctor, who will advise you on what action to take. if anyone, especially a child, accidentally swallows mirvaso, they may have serious side effects and need to be treated in a hospital. contact your doctor immediately or go to a hospital emergency department right away if you, a child, or anyone else swallows this medicine and has any of these symptoms: feeling dizzy from low blood pressure, vomiting, tiredness or drowsiness, decreased or irregular heartbeats, small pupils (constricted pupils), difficult or slow breathing, floppiness, low body temperature and convulsions (fits). take the medicine pack with you, so the doctor knows what was swallowed. if you forget to use mirvaso mirvaso works on a daily basis, starting with the first day of treatment. if you miss a daily dose, your redness will not be reduced for that day. do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose and continue your treatment as prescribed. if you stop using mirvaso a potential consequence of stopping the treatment before finishing the course of treatment is the disease to come back to its initial state. please contact your doctor before stopping your treatment, so that he could advice a replacement treatment as appropriate. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "mirvaso", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "this medicine", "Type":
