CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nActive immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media caused \nby Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children and adolescents from 6 weeks to 17 years of age.\n\nActive immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus \npneumoniae in adults \u226518 years of age and the elderly.\n\nSee sections 4.4 and 5.1 for information on protection against specific pneumococcal serotypes.\n\nThe use of Prevenar 13 should be determined on the basis of official recommendations taking into \nconsideration the risk of invasive disease and pneumonia in different age groups, underlying \ncomorbidities as well as the variability of serotype epidemiology in different geographical areas.\n\n\n\n3\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nThe immunisation schedules for Prevenar 13 should be based on official recommendations.\n\nPosology\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\n\nIt is recommended that infants who receive a first dose of Prevenar 13 complete the vaccination \ncourse with Prevenar 13.\n\nInfants aged 6 weeks-6 months\n\nThree-dose primary series\nThe recommended immunisation series consists of four doses, each of 0.5 ml. The primary infant \nseries consists of three doses, with the first dose usually given at 2 months of age and with an interval \nof at least 1 month between doses. The first dose may be given as early as six weeks of age. The \nfourth (booster) dose is recommended between 11 and 15 months of age.\n\nTwo-dose primary series\nAlternatively, when Prevenar 13 is given as part of a routine infant immunisation programme, a series \nconsisting of three doses, each of 0.5 ml, may be given. The first dose may be administered from the \nage of 2 months, with a second dose 2 months later. The third (booster) dose is recommended between \n11 and 15 months of age (see section 5.1).\n\nPreterm infants (<37 weeks gestation)\n\nIn preterm infants, the recommended immunisation series consists of four doses, each of 0.5 ml. The \nprimary infant series consists of three doses, with the first dose given at 2 months of age and with an \ninterval of at least 1 month between doses. The first dose may be given as early as six weeks of age. \nThe fourth (booster) dose is recommended between 11 and 15 months of age (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1).\n\nUnvaccinated infants and children \u2265 7 months of age\n\nInfants aged 7-11 months\nTwo doses, each of 0.5 ml, with an interval of at least 1 month between doses. A third dose is \nrecommended in the second year of life.\n\nChildren aged 12-23 months\nTwo doses, each of 0.5 ml, with an interval of at least 2 months between doses (see section 5.1).\n\nChildren and adolescents aged 2-17 years \nOne single dose of 0.5 ml.\n\nPrevenar 13 vaccine schedule for infants and children previously vaccinated with Prevenar (7-valent)\n(Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F)\nPrevenar 13 contains the same 7 serotypes included in Prevenar, using the same carrier protein \nCRM197.\n\nInfants and children who have begun immunisation with Prevenar may switch to Prevenar 13 at any \npoint in the schedule.\n\n\n\n4\n\nYoung children (12-59 months) completely immunised with Prevenar (7-valent)\nYoung children who are considered completely immunised with Prevenar (7-valent) should receive \none dose of 0.5 ml of Prevenar 13 to elicit immune responses to the 6 additional serotypes. This dose \nof Prevenar 13 should be administered at least 8 weeks after the final dose of Prevenar (7-valent) (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nChildren and adolescents 5\u201317 years \nChildren 5 to 17 years of age may receive a single dose of Prevenar 13 if they have been previously \nvaccinated with one or more doses of Prevenar. This dose of Prevenar 13 should be administered at \nleast 8 weeks after the final dose of Prevenar (7-valent) (see section 5.1).\n\nAdults \u226518 years of age, and the elderly\n\nOne single dose.\nThe need for revaccination with a subsequent dose of Prevenar 13 has not been established.\n\nRegardless of prior pneumococcal vaccination status, if the use of 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine is considered appropriate, Prevenar 13 should be given first (see sections 4.5 \nand 5.1).\n\nSpecial Populations\n\nIndividuals who have underlying conditions predisposing them to invasive pneumococcal disease \n(such as sickle cell disease or HIV infection) including those previously vaccinated with one or more \ndoses of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine may receive at least one dose of Prevenar 13 \n(see section 5.1).\n\nIn individuals with an haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), the recommended immunisation \nseries consists of four doses of Prevenar 13, each of 0.5 ml. The primary series consists of three doses, \nwith the first dose given at 3 to 6 months after HSCT and with an interval of at least 1 month between \ndoses. A fourth (booster) dose is recommended 6 months after the third dose (see section 5.1).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe vaccine should be given by intramuscular injection. The preferred sites are the anterolateral \naspect of the thigh (vastus lateralis muscle) in infants or the deltoid muscle of the upper arm in \nchildren and adults. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to diphtheria \ntoxoid.\n\nAs with other vaccines, the administration of Prevenar 13 should be postponed in subjects suffering \nfrom acute, severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should \nnot result in the deferral of vaccination.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPrevenar 13 must not be administered intravascularly.\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.\n\n\n\n5\n\nThis vaccine should not be given as an intramuscular injection to individuals with thrombocytopaenia \nor any coagulation disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection, but may be given \nsubcutaneously if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risks (see section 5.1).\n\nPrevenar 13 will only protect against Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes included in the vaccine, \nand will not protect against other microorganisms that cause invasive disease, pneumonia, or otitis \nmedia. As with any vaccine, Prevenar 13 may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine from \npneumococcal disease. For the most recent epidemiological information in your country you should \nconsult with the relevant national organisation.\n\nIndividuals with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due to the use of immuno-suppressive \ntherapy, a genetic defect, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or other causes, may have \nreduced antibody response to active immunisation.\n\nSafety and immunogenicity data are available for a limited number of individuals with sickle cell \ndisease, HIV infection, or with an haematopoietic stem cell transplant (see section 5.1). Safety and \nimmunogenicity data for Prevenar 13 are not available for individuals in other specific \nimmuno-compromised groups (e.g., malignancy or nephrotic syndrome) and vaccination should be \nconsidered on an individual basis.\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\n\nIn clinical studies, Prevenar 13 elicited an immune response to all thirteen serotypes included in the \nvaccine. The immune response for serotype 3 following the booster dose was not increased above the \nlevels seen after the infant vaccination series; the clinical relevance of this observation regarding the \ninduction of serotype 3 immune memory is unknown (see section 5.1).\n\nThe proportions of functional antibody responders (OPA titres \u2265 1:8) to serotypes 1, 3 and 5 were \nhigh. However, the OPA geometric mean titres were lower than those against each of the remaining \nadditional vaccine serotypes; the clinical relevance of this observation for protective efficacy is \nunknown (see section 5.1). \n\nLimited data have demonstrated that Prevenar 7-valent (three-dose primary series) induces an \nacceptable immune response in infants with sickle cell disease with a safety profile similar to that \nobserved in non-high-risk groups (see section 5.1). \n\nChildren younger than 2 years old should receive the appropriate-for-age Prevenar 13 vaccination \nseries (see section 4.2). The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine does not replace the use of \n23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines in children \u2265 2 years of age with conditions (such as \nsickle cell disease, asplenia, HIV infection, chronic illness, or those who are immuno-compromised) \nplacing them at higher risk for invasive disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Whenever\nrecommended, children at risk who are \u2265 24 months of age and already primed with Prevenar 13 \nshould receive 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The interval between the 13-valent \npneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar 13) and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide \nvaccine should not be less than 8 weeks. There are no data available to indicate whether the \nadministration of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to unprimed children or to children \nprimed with Prevenar 13 might result in hyporesponsiveness to further doses of Prevenar 13.\n\nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72 h should be considered \nwhen administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born \uf0a3 28 weeks of \ngestation), and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit \nof vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.\n\n\n\n6\n\nFor vaccine serotypes, protection against otitis media is expected to be lower than protection against \ninvasive disease. As otitis media is caused by many organisms other than pneumococcal serotypes \nrepresented in the vaccine, protection against all otitis media is expected to be low (see section 5.1).\n\nWhen Prevenar 13 is administered concomitantly with Infanrix hexa (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib), the rates \nof febrile reactions are similar to those seen with concomitant administration of Prevenar \n(7-valent) and Infanrix hexa (see section 4.8). Increased reporting rates of convulsions (with or \nwithout fever) and hypotonic hyporesponsive episode (HHE) were observed with concomitant \nadministration of Prevenar 13 and Infanrix hexa (see section 4.8).\n\nAntipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local treatment guidelines for children with \nseizure disorders or with a prior history of febrile seizures and for all children receiving Prevenar 13 \nsimultaneously with vaccines containing whole cell pertussis.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\n\nPrevenar 13 can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccine antigens, either as \nmonovalent or combination vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, acellular or whole cell pertussis, \nHaemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated poliomyelitis, hepatitis B (see section 4.4 for guidance on \nInfanrix hexa), meningococcal serogroup C, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and rotavirus vaccine. \n\nPrevenar 13 can also be given concomitantly between 12-23 months with the tetanus toxoid \nconjugated meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups A, C, W and Y vaccine to children who have \nbeen adequately primed with Prevenar 13 (as per local recommendations).\n\nData from a postmarketing clinical study evaluating the impact of prophylactic use of antipyretics \n(ibuprofen and paracetamol) on the immune response to Prevenar 13 suggest that administration of \nparacetamol concomitantly or within the same day of vaccination may reduce the immune response to \nPrevenar 13 after the infant series. Responses to the booster dose administered at 12 months were \nunaffected. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown.\n\nChildren and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age\n\nNo data are currently available regarding concomitant use with other vaccines. \n\nAdults 18 to 49 years of age\n\nNo data are available regarding concomitant use with other vaccines. \n\nAdults aged 50 years and older\n\nPrevenar 13 may be administered concomitantly with the seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza \nvaccine (TIV).\n\nIn two studies conducted in adults aged 50-59 and 65 years and older, it was demonstrated that \nPrevenar 13 may be given concomitantly with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). The \nresponses to all three TIV antigens were comparable when TIV was given alone or concomitantly \nwith Prevenar 13.\n\nWhen Prevenar 13 was given concomitantly with TIV, the immune responses to Prevenar 13 were \nlower compared to when Prevenar 13 was given alone, however, there was no long-term impact on \ncirculating antibody levels.\n\n\n\n7\n\nIn a third study in adults aged 50-93 years, it was demonstrated that Prevenar 13 may be given \nconcomitantly with the seasonal quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV). The immune \nresponses to all four QIV strains were noninferior when Prevenar 13 was given concomitantly with \nQIV compared to when QIV was given alone.\n\nThe immune responses to Prevenar 13 were noninferior when Prevenar 13 was given concomitantly \nwith QIV compared to when Prevenar 13 was given alone. As with concomitant administration with \ntrivalent vaccines, immune responses to some pneumococcal serotypes were lower when both \nvaccines were given concomitantly.\n\nConcomitant use with other vaccines has not been investigated.\n\nDifferent injectable vaccines should always be given at different vaccination sites.\n\nConcomitant administration of Prevenar 13 and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine has \nnot been studied. In clinical studies when Prevenar 13 was given 1 year after 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine the immune responses were lower for all serotypes compared to when \nPrevenar 13 was given to subjects not previously immunised with 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine. The clinical significance of this is unknown. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data from the use of pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine in pregnant women.\nTherefore the use of Prevenar 13 should be avoided during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine is excreted in human milk.\n\nFertility\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPrevenar 13 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of \nthe effects mentioned under section 4.8 \u201cUndesirable effects\u201d may temporarily affect the ability to \ndrive or use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nAnalysis of postmarketing reporting rates suggests a potential increased risk of convulsions, with or \nwithout fever, and HHE when comparing groups which reported use of Prevenar 13 with \nInfanrix hexa to those which reported use of Prevenar 13 alone.\n\nAdverse reactions reported in clinical studies or from the postmarketing experience for all age groups \nare listed in this section per system organ class, in decreasing order of frequency and seriousness. The \nfrequency is defined as follows: very common (\uf0b3 1/10), common (\uf0b3 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(\uf0b3 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be \nestimated from available data).\n\n\n\n8\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\nThe safety of the vaccine was assessed in controlled clinical studies where 14,267 doses were given to \n4,429 healthy infants from 6 weeks of age at first vaccination and 11-16 months of age at booster \ndose. In all infant studies, Prevenar 13 was co-administered with routine paediatric vaccines (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nSafety in 354 previously unvaccinated children (7 months to 5 years of age) was also assessed.\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in children 6 weeks to 5 years of age were \nvaccination-site reactions, fever, irritability, decreased appetite, and increased and/or decreased sleep.\n\nIn a clinical study in infants vaccinated at 2, 3, and 4 months of age, fever \u2265 38\u00b0C was reported at \nhigher rates among infants who received Prevenar (7-valent) concomitantly with Infanrix hexa (28.3% \nto 42.3%) than in infants receiving Infanrix hexa alone (15.6% to 23.1%). After a booster dose at 12 \nto 15 months of age, fever \u2265 38\u00b0C was reported in 50.0% of infants who received Prevenar (7-valent) \nand Infanrix hexa at the same time as compared to 33.6% of infants receiving Infanrix hexa alone. \nThese reactions were mostly moderate (less than or equal to 39\u00b0C) and transient.\n\nAn increase in vaccination-site reactions was reported in children older than 12 months compared to \nrates observed in infants during the primary series with Prevenar 13.\n\nAdverse reactions from clinical studies\nIn clinical studies, the safety profile of Prevenar 13 was similar to Prevenar. The following \nfrequencies are based on adverse reactions assessed in Prevenar 13 clinical studies:\n\nImmune system disorders:\nRare: Hypersensitivity reaction including face oedema, dyspnoea, bronchospasm\n\nNervous system disorders:\nUncommon: Convulsions (including febrile convulsions)\nRare: Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode\n\nGastrointestinal disorders:\nVery common: Decreased appetite\nCommon: Vomiting; diarrhoea\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nCommon: Rash\nUncommon: Urticaria or urticaria-like rash\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVery common: Pyrexia; irritability; any vaccination-site erythema, induration/swelling or \n\npain/tenderness; somnolence; poor quality sleep\nVaccination-site erythema or induration/swelling 2.5 cm\u20137.0 cm (after the \nbooster dose and in older children [age 2 to 5 years])\n\nCommon: Pyrexia > 39\u00b0C; vaccination-site movement impairment (due to pain); \nvaccination-site erythema or induration/swelling 2.5 cm\u20137.0 cm (after infant \nseries)\n\nUncommon: Vaccination-site erythema, induration/swelling > 7.0 cm; crying\n\nAdditional information in special populations:\nApnoea in very premature infants (\uf0a3 28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n9\n\nChildren and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years of age \nSafety was evaluated in 592 children (294 children aged 5 to 10 years previously immunised with at \nleast one dose of Prevenar and 298 children aged 10 to 17 years who had not received a pneumococcal \nvaccine).\n\nThe most common adverse events in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age were:\n\nNervous system disorders:\nCommon: Headaches\n\nGastrointestinal disorders:\nVery common: Decreased appetite\nCommon: Vomiting; diarrhoea\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nCommon: Rash; urticaria or urticaria-like rash\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVery common: Irritability; any vaccination-site erythema; induration/swelling or \n\npain/tenderness; somnolence; poor quality sleep; \nvaccination-site tenderness (including impaired movement)\n\nCommon: Pyrexia\n\nOther adverse events previously observed in infants and children 6 weeks to 5 years of age may also \nbe applicable to this age group but were not seen in this study possibly due to the small sample size.\n\nAdditional information in special populations\nChildren and adolescents with sickle cell disease, HIV infection, or an haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant have similar frequencies of adverse reactions, except that headaches, vomiting, diarrhoea, \npyrexia, fatigue, arthralgia, and myalgia were very common.\n\nAdults \u2265 18 years and the elderly\nSafety was assessed in 7 clinical studies including 91,593 adults ranging in age from 18 to 101 years. \nPrevenar 13 was administered to 48,806 adults; 2,616 (5.4%) aged 50 to 64 years, and 45,291 (92.8%) \naged 65 years and older. One of the 7 studies included a group of adults (n=899) ranging from 18 to \n49 years who received Prevenar 13 and who were not previously vaccinated with 23-valent \npneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Of the Prevenar 13 recipients 1,916 adults were previously \nvaccinated with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at least 3 years prior to study \nvaccination, and 46,890 were 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine unvaccinated.\n\nA trend to lower frequency of adverse reactions was associated with greater age; adults > 65 years of \nage (regardless of prior pneumococcal vaccination status) reported fewer adverse reactions than \nyounger adults, with adverse reactions generally most common in the youngest adults, 18 to 29 years \nof age.\n\nOverall, the frequency categories were similar for all age groups, with the exception of vomiting \nwhich was very common (\uf0b3 1/10) in adults aged 18 to 49 years and common (\uf0b3 1/100 to < 1/10) in all \nother age groups, and pyrexia was very common in adults aged 18 to 29 years and common in all other \nage groups. Severe vaccination-site pain/tenderness and severe limitation of arm movement was very \ncommon in adults 18 to 39 years and common in all other age groups.\n\nAdverse reactions from clinical studies\nLocal reactions and systemic events were solicited daily after each vaccination for 14 days in 6 studies\nand 7 days in the remaining study. The following frequencies are based on adverse reactions assessed \nin Prevenar 13 clinical studies in adults:\n\n\n\n10\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders:\nVery common: Decreased appetite\n\nNervous system disorders:\nVery common: Headaches\n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common: Diarrhoea; vomiting (in adults aged 18 to 49 years)\n\nCommon: Vomiting (in adults aged 50 years and over)\n\nUncommon: Nausea\n\nImmune system disorders:\nUncommon: Hypersensitivity reaction including face oedema, dyspnoea, bronchospasm\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nVery common: Rash\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVery common: Chills; fatigue; vaccination-site erythema; vaccination-site \n\ninduration/swelling; vaccination-site pain/tenderness (severe vaccination-site \npain/tenderness very common in adults aged 18 to 39 years); limitation of arm \nmovement (severe limitation of arm movements very common in adults aged \n18 to 39 years)\n\nCommon: Pyrexia (very common in adults aged 18 to 29 years)\n\nUncommon: Lymphadenopathy localized to the region of the vaccination-site\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:\nVery common: Arthralgia; myalgia\n\nOverall, no significant differences in frequencies of adverse reactions were seen when Prevenar 13 \nwas given to adults previously vaccinated with the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.\n\nAdditional information in special populations\nAdults with HIV infection have similar frequencies of adverse reactions, except that pyrexia and \nvomiting were very common and nausea common.\n\nAdults with an haematopoietic stem cell transplant have similar frequencies of adverse reactions, \nexcept that pyrexia and vomiting were very common.\n\nHigher frequency in some solicited systemic reactions was observed when Prevenar 13 was \nadministered concomitantly with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) compared to TIV given \nalone (headache, chills, rash, decreased appetite, arthralgia, and myalgia) or Prevenar 13 given alone \n(headache, fatigue, chills, decreased appetite, and arthralgia). \n\nAdverse reactions from Prevenar 13 postmarketing experience\nThe following are considered adverse drug reactions for Prevenar 13; because these reactions were \nderived from spontaneous reports, the frequencies could not be determined and are thus considered as \nnot known.\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders:\nLymphadenopathy (localised to the region of the vaccination-site)\n\n\n\n11\n\nImmune system disorders:\nAnaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction including shock; angioedema\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nErythema multiforme\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVaccination-site urticaria; vaccination-site dermatitis; vaccination-site \npruritus; flushing\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nOverdose with Prevenar 13 is unlikely due to its presentation as a pre-filled syringe. However, in \ninfants and children there have been reports of overdose with Prevenar 13 defined as subsequent doses \nadministered closer than recommended to the previous dose. In general, adverse events reported with \noverdose are consistent with those that have been reported with doses given in the recommended \npaediatric schedules of Prevenar 13.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines; ATC code: J07AL02\n\nPrevenar 13 contains the 7 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides that are in Prevenar (4, 6B, 9V, \n14, 18C, 19F, 23F) plus 6 additional polysaccharides (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, 19A) all conjugated to CRM197\n\ncarrier protein. \n\nBurden of disease\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\n\nBased on serotype surveillance in Europe performed before the introduction of Prevenar, Prevenar 13 \nis estimated to cover 73-100% (depending on the country) of serotypes causing invasive \npneumococcal disease (IPD) in children less than 5 years of age. In this age group, serotypes 1, 3, 5, \n6A, 7F, and 19A account for 15.6% to 59.7% of invasive disease, depending on the country, the time \nperiod studied, and the use of Prevenar.\n\nAcute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood disease with different aetiologies. Bacteria can be \nresponsible for 60-70% of clinical episodes of AOM. S. pneumoniae is one of the most common \ncauses of bacterial AOM worldwide.\n\nPrevenar 13 is estimated to cover over 90% of serotypes causing antimicrobial-resistant IPD.\n\nChildren and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years\n\nIn children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years, the incidence of pneumococcal disease is low, \nhowever, there is an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in those with underlying comorbidities.\n\n\n\n12\n\nAdults \u226518 years and the elderly\n\nPneumonia is the most common clinical presentation of pneumococcal disease in adults.\n\nThe reported incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and IPD in Europe varies by \ncountry, increases with age from 50 years and is highest in individuals aged \u2265 65 years. S. pneumoniae\nis the most frequent cause of CAP, and is estimated to be responsible for approximately 30% of all \nCAP cases requiring hospitalisation in adults in developed countries.\n\nBacteraemic pneumonia (approximately 80% of IPD in adults), bacteraemia without a focus, and \nmeningitis are the most common manifestations of IPD in adults. Based on surveillance data following\nthe introduction of Prevenar but before the introduction of Prevenar 13 in childhood vaccination \nprogrammes, the pneumococcal serotypes in Prevenar 13 may be responsible for at least 50 \u2013 76% \n(depending on country) of IPD in adults.\n\nThe risk for CAP and IPD in adults also increases with chronic underlying medical conditions, \nspecifically, anatomical or functional asplenia, diabetes mellitus, asthma, chronic cardiovascular, \npulmonary, kidney or liver disease, and it is highest in those who are immune-suppressed such as \nthose with malignant haematological diseases or HIV infection. \n\nPrevenar 13 immunogenicity clinical studies in infants, children and adolescents\n\nThe protective efficacy of Prevenar 13 against IPD has not been studied. As recommended by the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) the assessment of potential efficacy against IPD in infants and \nyoung children has been based on a comparison of immune responses to the seven common serotypes \nshared between Prevenar 13 and Prevenar, for which protective efficacy has been proven (for \nPrevenar (7-valent) efficacy in infants and children, see below). Immune responses to the additional \n6 serotypes were also measured.\n\nImmune responses following a three-dose primary infant series\n\nClinical studies have been conducted in a number of European countries and the US using a range of \nvaccination schedules, including two randomised non-inferiority studies (Germany using a 2, 3, \n4 month primary series [006] and US using a 2, 4, 6 month primary series [004]). In these two studies \npneumococcal immune responses were compared using a set of non-inferiority criteria including the\npercentage of subjects with serum anti-polysaccharide serotype-specific IgG \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml one month \nafter the primary series and the comparison of IgG geometric mean concentrations (ELISA GMCs); in \naddition, functional antibody titres (OPA) between subjects receiving Prevenar 13 and Prevenar were \ncompared. For the six additional serotypes, these values were compared with the lowest response \namong all of the seven common serotypes in the Prevenar recipients.\n\nThe non-inferiority immune response comparisons for study 006, based on the proportion of infants \nachieving anti-polysaccharide IgG concentrations \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml, are shown in Table 1. Results for \nstudy 004 were similar. Prevenar 13 non-inferiority (lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference in \npercentage of responders at 0.35 \u00b5g/ml between groups was >-10%) was demonstrated for all \n7 common serotypes, except for serotype 6B in study 006 and serotypes 6B and 9V in study 004, \nwhich missed by a small margin. All seven common serotypes met pre-defined non-inferiority criteria \nfor IgG ELISA GMCs. Prevenar 13 elicited comparable, although slightly lower, antibody levels than \nPrevenar for the 7 common serotypes. The clinical relevance of these differences is not known.\n\nNon-inferiority was met for the 6 additional serotypes based on the proportion of infants achieving \nantibody concentrations \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml and comparison of IgG ELISA GMCs in study 006 and was met \nfor 5 out of the 6 serotypes, with the exception of serotype 3 for study 004. For serotype 3, the \npercentages of Prevenar 13 recipients with serum IgG \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml were 98.2% (study 006) and \n63.5% (study 004).\n\n\n\n13\n\nTable 1: Comparison of the proportion of subjects achieving a pneumococcal anti-polysaccharide IgG \nantibody concentration \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml after dose 3 of the infant series \u2013 study 006\n\nSerotypes\n\nPrevenar 13\n%\n\n(N=282-285)\n\n7-valent Prevenar\n%\n\n(N=277-279)\nDifference\n(95 % CI)\n\n7-valent Prevenar serotypes\n4 98.2 98.2 0.0 (-2.5, 2.6)\n\n6B 77.5 87.1 -9.6 (-16.0, -3.3)\n9V 98.6 96.4 2.2 (-0.4, 5.2)\n14 98.9 97.5 1.5 (-0.9, 4.1)\n\n18C 97.2 98.6 -1.4 (-4.2, 1.2)\n19F 95.8 96.0 -0.3 (-3.8, 3.3)\n23F 88.7 89.5 -0.8 (-6.0, 4.5)\n\nAdditional serotypes in Prevenar 13\n1 96.1 87.1* 9.1 (4.5, 13.9)\n3 98.2 87.1 11.2 (7.0, 15.8)\n5 93.0 87.1 5.9 (0.8, 11.1)\n\n6A 91.9 87.1 4.8 (-0.3, 10.1)\n7F 98.6 87.1 11.5 (7.4, 16.1)\n\n19A 99.3 87.1 12.2 (8.3, 16.8)\n* The serotype in Prevenar with the lowest percent response rate was 6B in study 006 (87.1 %).\n\nPrevenar 13 elicited functional antibodies to all 13 vaccine serotypes in studies 004 and 006. For the \n7 common serotypes there were no differences between groups in the proportion of subjects with OPA \ntitres \u2265 1:8. For each of the seven common serotypes, > 96% and >90 % of the Prevenar 13 recipients \nreached an OPA titre \u2265 1:8 one month after the primary series in studies 006 and 004, respectively.\n\nFor each of the 6 additional serotypes, Prevenar 13 elicited OPA titres \u2265 1:8 in 91.4% to 100% of \nvaccinees one month after the primary series in studies 004/006. The functional antibody (OPA) \ngeometric mean titres for serotypes 1, 3 and 5 were lower than the titres for each of the other \nadditional serotypes; the clinical relevance of this observation for protective efficacy is unknown. \n\nImmune responses following a two-dose primary infant series\n\nThe immunogenicity after two doses in infants has been documented in four studies. The proportion \nof infants achieving a pneumococcal anti-capsular polysaccharide IgG concentration \u2265 0.35 \uf06dg/ml one \nmonth after the second dose ranged from 79.6% to 98.5% across 11 of the 13 vaccine serotypes. \nSmaller proportions of infants achieved this antibody concentration threshold for serotype 6B (27.9% \nto 57.3%) and 23F (55.8% to 68.1%) for all studies using a 2, 4 month regimen, compared to 58.4% \nfor serotype 6B and 68.6% for 23F for a study using a 3, 5 month regimen. After the booster dose, all \nvaccine serotypes including 6B and 23F had immune responses consistent with adequate priming with \na two-dose primary series. In a UK study, the functional antibody (OPA) responses were comparable \nfor all serotypes including 6B and 23F in the Prevenar and Prevenar 13 arms after the primary series \nat two and four months of age and after the booster dose at 12 months of age. For Prevenar 13 \nrecipients, the proportion of responders with an OPA titre \uf0b3 1:8 was at least 87 % following the infant \nseries, and at least 93% following the booster dose. The OPA geometric mean titres for serotypes 1, 3 \nand 5 were lower than the titres for each of the other additional serotypes; the clinical relevance of \nthis observation is unknown.\n\nBooster responses following two-dose and three-dose primary infant series\n\nFollowing the booster dose, antibody concentrations increased from the pre-booster level for all 13 \nserotypes. Post-booster antibody concentrations were higher for 12 serotypes than those achieved after \nthe infant primary series. These observations are consistent with adequate priming (the induction of \nimmunologic memory). The immune response for serotype 3 following the booster dose was not \n\n\n\n14\n\nincreased above the levels seen after the infant vaccination series; the clinical relevance of this \nobservation regarding the induction of serotype 3 immune memory is unknown.\n\nAntibody responses to booster doses following two-dose or three-dose infant primary series were \ncomparable for all 13 vaccine serotypes.\n\nFor children aged from 7 months to 5 years, age appropriate catch-up immunisation schedules (as \ndescribed in section 4.2) result in levels of anti-capsular polysaccharide IgG antibody responses to \neach of the 13 serotypes that are at least comparable to those of a three-dose primary series in infants.\n\nAntibody persistence and immunological memory were evaluated in a study in healthy children who \nreceived a single dose of Prevenar 13 at least 2 years after they had been previously immunised with \neither 4 doses of Prevenar, a 3-dose infant series of Prevenar followed by Prevenar 13 at 12 months of \nage, or 4 doses of Prevenar 13. \n\nThe single dose of Prevenar 13, in children approximately 3.4 years of age regardless of previous \nvaccination history with Prevenar or Prevenar 13, induced a robust antibody response for both the \n7 common serotypes and the 6 additional serotypes in Prevenar 13.\n\nSince the introduction of 7-valent Prevenar in 2000, pneumococcal disease surveillance data have not \nshown that the immunity elicited by Prevenar in infancy has waned over time. \n\nPreterm Infants\n\nSafety and immunogenicity of Prevenar 13 given at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months was assessed in \napproximately 100 prematurely born infants (mean Estimated Gestational Age [EGA], 31 weeks; \nrange, 26 to 36 weeks) and compared with approximately 100 infants born at term (mean EGA, \n39 weeks; range, 37 to 42 weeks). \n\nImmune responses in preterm and term infants were compared using the proportion of subjects \nachieving a pneumococcal polysaccharide IgG binding antibody concentration \u22650.35 \u03bcg/mL 1 month \nafter the infant series, the approach used for immunogenicity comparisons of Prevenar 13 to Prevenar \nbased on WHO guidelines.\n\nMore than 85% achieved a pneumococcal polysaccharide IgG binding antibody concentration \n\u22650.35 \u00b5g/mL 1 month after the infant series, except for serotypes 5 (71.7%), 6A (82.7%), and 6B \n(72.7%) in the preterm group. For these 3 serotypes, the proportion of responders among preterm \ninfants was significantly lower than among term infants. Approximately one month after the toddler \ndose, the proportion of subjects in each group achieving this same antibody concentration threshold \nwas >97%, except for serotype 3 (71% in preterm infants and 79% in term infants). It is unknown \nwhether immunological memory to all serotypes is induced in pre-term infants. In general, \nserotype-specific IgG GMCs were lower for preterm infants than term infants.\n\nAfter the infant series, OPA GMTs were similar in preterm infants compared to term infants except \nfor serotype 5, which was lower in preterm infants. OPA GMTs after the toddler dose relative to those \nafter the infant series were similar or lower for 4 serotypes (4, 14, 18C, and 19F) and were statistically \nsignificantly higher for 6 of 13 serotypes (1, 3, 5, 7F, 9V, and 19A) in preterm infants compared to 10 \nof 13 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, 18C, 19A, and 23F) in term infants.\n\nChildren (12-59 months) completely immunised with Prevenar (7-valent)\n\nFollowing administration of a single dose of Prevenar 13 to children (12-59 months) who are \nconsidered completely immunised with Prevenar (7-valent) (either 2 or 3 dose primary series plus \nbooster), the proportion achieving serum IgG levels \u22650.35 \u00b5g/ml and OPA titres \u22651:8 was at least \n90%. However, 3 (serotypes 1, 5 and 6A) of the 6 additional serotypes showed lower IgG GMC and \n\n\n\n15\n\nOPA GMT when compared with children who had received at least one previous vaccination with \n\nPrevenar 13. The clinical relevance of the lower GMCs and GMTs is currently unknown.\n\nUnvaccinated Children (12-23 months)\n\nStudies in unvaccinated children (12-23 months) with Prevenar (7-valent) demonstrated that 2 doses \nwere required to achieve serum IgG concentrations for 6B and 23F similar to those induced by a \n3-dose infant series.\n\nChildren and Adolescents 5 to 17 years of age\n\nIn an open-label study in 592 healthy children and adolescents including those with asthma (17.4%) \nwho may be predisposed to pneumococcal infection, Prevenar 13 elicited immune responses to all \n13 serotypes. A single dose of Prevenar 13 was given to children 5 to 10 years of age previously \nvaccinated with at least 1 dose of Prevenar, and children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age who \nhad never received a pneumococcal vaccine.\n\nIn both the children 5 to 10 years of age and children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years, the immune\nresponse to Prevenar 13 was non inferior to Prevenar for the 7 common serotypes and to Prevenar 13 \nfor the 6 additional serotypes compared to the immune response after the fourth dose in infants \nvaccinated at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age as measured by serum IgG.\n\nIn children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years of age OPA GMTs 1 month after vaccination were \nnoninferior to OPA GMTs in the 5 to 10 year old age group for 12 of the 13 serotypes (except \nserotype 3). \n\nImmune responses after subcutaneous administration\n\nSubcutaneous administration of Prevenar 13 was evaluated in a non-comparative study in 185 healthy \nJapanese infants and children who received 4 doses at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age. The study \ndemonstrated that safety and immunogenicity were generally comparable with observations made in \nstudies of intramuscular administration.\n\nPrevenar 13 Effectiveness\n\nInvasive Pneumococcal Disease\nData published by Public Health England showed that, four years after the introduction of Prevenar as \na two dose primary infant series with booster dose in the second year of life and with a 94% vaccine \nuptake, there was a 98% (95% CI 95; 99) reduction in disease caused by the 7 vaccine serotypes in \nEngland and Wales. Subsequently, four years following the switch to Prevenar 13, the additional\nreduction in incidence of IPD due to the 7 serotypes in Prevenar ranged from 76% in children less \nthan 2 years of age to 91% in children 5-14 years of age. The serotype specific reductions for each of \nthe 5 additional serotypes in Prevenar 13 (no cases of serotype 5 IPD were observed) by age group are \nshown in Table 2 and ranged from 68% (serotype 3) to 100% (serotype 6A) for children less than \n5 years of age. Significant incidence reductions were also observed in older age groups who had not \nbeen vaccinated with Prevenar 13 (indirect effect).\n\n\n\n16\n\nOtitis media (OM)\nIn a published study performed in Israel, using a 2-dose primary series plus booster dose in the second \nyear of life, the impact of Prevenar 13 on OM was documented in a population-based \nactive-surveillance system with tympanocentesis culturing of middle ear fluid in Israeli children less \nthan 2 years of age with OM. \n\nFollowing the introduction of Prevenar and subsequently Prevenar 13 there was a decline in incidence \nfrom 2.1 to 0.1 cases per 1000 children (95%) for the Prevenar serotypes plus serotype 6A and a \ndecline in incidence from 0.9 to 0.1 cases per 1000 children (89%) for the additional serotypes 1, 3, 5, \n7F, and 19A in Prevenar 13. The annual overall pneumococcal incidence of OM declined from 9.6 to \n2.1 cases per 1000 children (78%) between July 2004 (prior to the introduction of Prevenar) and June \n2013 (post Prevenar 13 introduction).\n\nTable 2: Serotype specific number of cases and incidence reductions of IPD in 2013/14 compared to \n2008/09-2009/10 (2008/10) by age in England and Wales\n\n<5 years of age 5 to 64 years of age \u226565 years of age\n\n2008-\n10\u00a7\n\n2013/\n14\u00a7\n\n% Incidence \nreduction \n(95% CI*)\n\n2008-\n10\u00a7\n\n2013/\n14\u00a7\n\n% \nIncidence \nreduction \n(95% CI*)\n\n2008-\n10\u00a7\n\n2013/\n14\u00a7\n\n% Incidence \nreduction \n(95% CI*)\n\nAdditional serotypes covered by Prevenar 13\n\n1 59 (54) 5 (5) 91%\n\n(98%; \n68%)**\n\n458 \n(382)\n\n77 \n(71)\n\n83%\n\n(88%; \n74%)**\n\n102 \n(89)\n\n13 \n(13)\n\n87%\n\n(94%; \n72%)**\n\n3 26 (24) 8 (8) 68%\n\n(89%; 6%)\n\n178 \n(148)\n\n73 \n(68)\n\n59%\n\n(72%; \n38%)**\n\n256 \n(224)\n\n143 \n(146)\n\n44%\n\n(57%; \n27%)**\n\n6A 10 (9) 0 (0) 100%\n\n(100%; \n62%)**\n\n53 (44) 5 (5) 90%\n\n(97%; \n56%)**\n\n94 (82) 5 (5) 95%\n\n(99%; \n81%)**\n\n7F 90 (82) 8 (8) 91%\n\n(97%; \n74%)**\n\n430 \n(361)\n\n160\n(148)\n\n63%\n\n(71%; \n50%)**\n\n173 \n(152)\n\n75 \n(77)\n\n56%\n\n(70%; \n37%)**\n\n19A 85 (77) 7 (7) 91%\n\n(97%; \n75%)**\n\n225 \n(191)\n\n104 \n(97)\n\n54%\n\n(65%; \n32%)**\n\n279 \n(246)\n\n97 \n(99)\n\n65%\n\n(75%; \n53%)**\n\n\u00a7 Corrected for proportion of samples serotyped, missing age, denominator compared with 2009/10, and \nfor the trend in total invasive pneumococcal disease up to 2009/10 (after which no trend correction was \napplied).\n\n* 95% CI inflated from a Poisson interval based on over-dispersion of 2.1 seen from modelling of \n2000-06 pre-Prevenar all IPD data.\n\n** p<0.005 to cover 6A where p=0.002\n\n\n\n17\n\nPneumonia\nIn a multicenter observational study in France comparing the periods before and after the switch from \nPrevenar to Prevenar 13, there was 16% (2060 to 1725 cases) reduction in all community acquired \npneumonia (CAP) cases in emergency departments in children 1 month to 15 years of age. Reductions \nwere 53% (167 to 79 cases) (p<0.001) for CAP cases with pleural effusion and 63% (64 to 24 cases)\n(p<0.001) for microbiologically confirmed pneumococcal CAP cases. In the second year after the \nintroduction of Prevenar 13 the total number of CAP cases due to the 6 additional vaccine serotypes in \nPrevenar 13 was reduced from 27 to 7 isolates (74%).\n\nThe decrease in all cause pneumonia cases was most pronounced in the younger vaccinated age \ngroups with a decrease of 31.8% (757 to 516 cases) and 16.6% (833 to 695 cases) in the age groups \n<2 years and 2 to 5 years, respectively. The incidence in older, predominantly non-vaccinated children \n(>5 years) did not change over the duration of the study.\n\nIn an ongoing surveillance system (2004 to 2013) to document the impact of Prevenar and \nsubsequently Prevenar 13 on CAP in children less than 5 years in Southern Israel using a 2 dose \nprimary series with a booster dose in the second year of life, there was a reduction of 68% \n(95% CI 73; 61) in outpatient visits and 32% (95% CI 39; 22) in hospitalizations for alveolar CAP \nfollowing the introduction of Prevenar 13 when compared to the period before the introduction of \nPrevenar.\n\nEffect on nasopharyngeal carriage \n\nIn a surveillance study in France in children presenting with acute otitis media, changes in \nnasopharyngeal (NP) carriage of pneumococcal serotypes were evaluated following the introduction \nof Prevenar (7-valent) and subsequently Prevenar 13. Prevenar 13 significantly reduced NP carriage of \nthe 6 additional serotypes (and serotype 6C) combined and individual serotypes 6C, 7F, 19A when \ncompared with Prevenar. A reduction in carriage was also seen for serotype 3 (2.5% vs 1.1%; p=0.1). \nThere was no carriage of serotypes 1 and 5 observed.\n\nThe effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination on nasopharyngeal carriage was studied in a \nrandomised double-blind study in which infants received either Prevenar 13 or Prevenar (7-valent) at \n2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age in Israel. Prevenar 13 significantly reduced newly identified NP \nacquisition of the 6 additional serotypes (and serotype 6C) combined and of individual serotypes 1, \n6A, 6C, 7F, 19A when compared with Prevenar. There was no reduction seen in serotype 3 and for \nserotype 5 the colonization was too infrequent to assess impact. For 6 of the remaining 7 common \nserotypes, similar rates of NP acquisition were observed in both vaccine groups; for serotype 19F a \nsignificant reduction was observed.\n\nIn this study, reductions of S. pneumoniae serotypes 19A, 19F, and 6A not susceptible to a number of \nantibiotics were documented. The reductions ranged between 34% and 62% depending on serotype \nand antibiotic.\n\nPrevenar (7-valent vaccine) protective efficacy in infants and children\n\nThe efficacy of 7-valent Prevenar was evaluated in two major studies \u2013 the Northern California Kaiser \nPermanente (NCKP) study and the Finnish Otitis Media (FinOM) study. Both studies were \nrandomised, double-blind, active-control studies in which infants were randomised to receive either \nPrevenar or control vaccine (NCKP, meningococcal serogroup C CRM-conjugate [MnCC] vaccine; \nFinOM, hepatitis B vaccine) in a four-dose series at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age. The efficacy \nresults from these studies (for invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media) are \npresented below (Table 3).\n\n\n\n18\n\nTable 3: Summary of efficacy of 7-valent Prevenar1\n\nTest N VE2 95% CI\n\nNCKP: Vaccine-serotype IPD3 30,258 97% 85, 100\n\nNCKP: Clinical pneumonia with abnormal chest X-ray 23,746 35% 4, 56\n\nNCKP: Acute Otitis Media (AOM)4 23,746\n\nTotal episodes 7% 4, 10\n\nRecurrent AOM (3 episodes in 6 months, or 4 episodes in 1 year) 9% 3, 15\nRecurrent AOM (5 episodes in 6 months, or 6 episodes in 1 year) 23% 7, 36\nTympanostomy tube placement 20% 2, 35\n\nFinOM: AOM 1,662\n\nTotal episodes 6% -4, 16\n\nAll pneumococcal AOM 34% 21, 45\nVaccine-serotype AOM 57% 44, 67\n\n1Per protocol\n2Vaccine efficacy\n3October 1995 to April 20, 1999\n4October 1995 to April 30, 1998\n\nPrevenar (7-valent) effectiveness\n\nThe effectiveness (both direct and indirect effect) of 7-valent Prevenar against pneumococcal disease \nhas been evaluated in both three-dose and two-dose primary infant series immunisation programmes,\neach with booster doses (Table 4). Following the widespread use of Prevenar, the incidence of IPD \nhas been consistently and substantially reduced.\n\nUsing the screening method, serotype-specific effectiveness estimates for 2 doses under the age of \n1 year in the UK were 66 % (-29, 91 %) and 100 % (25, 100 %) for serotype 6B and 23F, respectively.\n\nTable 4: Summary of effectiveness of 7-valent Prevenar for invasive pneumococcal disease\nCountry\n\n(year of introduction)\nRecommended schedule Disease reduction, % 95% CI\n\nUK (England & Wales)1 (2006) 2, 4, + 13 months Vaccine serotypes:\nTwo doses under age 1: 85%\n\n49, 95%\n\nUSA (2000)\n\nChildren < 52\n\nPersons \u2265 653\n\n2, 4, 6, + 12-15 months\n\nVaccine serotypes: 98%\nAll serotypes: 77%\n\nVaccine serotypes: 76%\nAll serotypes: 38%\n\n97, 99%\n73, 79%\n\nNA\nNA\n\nCanada (Quebec)4\n\n(2004)\n2, 4, + 12 months All serotypes: 73%\n\nVaccine serotypes:\n2-dose infant series: 99%\nCompleted schedule:100%\n\nNA\n\n92, 100%\n82, 100%\n\n1Children < 2 years of age.

In a retrospective evaluation \nof a large US insurance database, AOM visits were reduced by 42.7 % (95 % CI, 42.4-43.1 %), and \nprescriptions for AOM by 41.9 % in children younger than 2 years of age, compared with a \npre-licensure baseline (2004 vs. 1997-99). In a similar analysis, hospitalisations and ambulatory visits \nfor all-cause pneumonia were reduced by 52.4 % and 41.1 %, respectively. For those events \n\n\n\n19\n\nspecifically identified as pneumococcal pneumonia, the observed reductions in hospitalisations and \nambulatory visits were 57.6 % and 46.9 %, respectively, in children younger than 2 years of age, \ncompared with a pre-licensure baseline (2004 vs. 1997-99). While direct cause-and-effect cannot be \ninferred from observational analyses of this type, these findings suggest that Prevenar plays an \nimportant role in reducing the burden of mucosal disease (AOM and pneumonia) in the target \npopulation.\n\nEfficacy study in adults 65 years and older\n\nEfficacy against vaccine-type (VT) pneumococcal CAP and IPD was assessed in a large-scale \nrandomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization \nTrial in Adults\u2013CAPiTA) in the Netherlands. 84,496 subjects, 65 years and older received a single \nvaccination of either Prevenar 13 or placebo in a 1:1 randomisation.\n\nThe CAPiTA study enrolled volunteers \u2265 65 years of age whose demographic and health \ncharacteristics may differ from those seeking vaccination.\n\nA first episode of hospitalised, chest X-ray confirmed pneumonia was identified in about 2% of this \npopulation (n=1,814 subjects) of which 329 cases were confirmed pneumococcal CAP and 182 cases \nwere VT pneumococcal CAP in the per protocol and modified intent to treat (mITT) populations.\n\nEfficacy was demonstrated for the primary and secondary endpoints in the per protocol population\n(Table 5).\n\nTable 5: Vaccine efficacy (VE) for the primary and secondary endpoints of the CAPiTA study (per \nprotocol population)\n\nEfficacy endpoint\n\nCases\n\nVE (%)\n(95.2% CI)\n\np-value\nTotal\n\nPrevenar 13\ngroup\n\nPlacebo\ngroup\n\nPrimary endpoint\n\nFirst episode of confirmed VT \npneumococcal CAP\n\n139 49 90\n45.56\n\n(21.82, 62.49)\n0.0006\n\nSecondary endpoints\n\nFirst episode of confirmed NB/NI1\n\nvaccine type pneumococcal CAP\n93 33 60\n\n45.00\n(14.21, 65.31)\n\n0.0067\n\nFirst episode of VT-IPD2 35 7 28\n75.00\n\n(41.06, 90.87)\n0.0005\n\n1NB/NI \u2013 non-bacteraemic/non-invasive\n2VT-IPD \u2013 vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease\n\nThe duration of protective efficacy against a first episode of VT pneumococcal CAP, \nNB/NI VT pneumococcal CAP, and VT-IPD extended throughout the 4-year study.\n\nThe study was not designed to demonstrate efficacy in subgroups, and the number of subjects \n\u2265 85 years of age was not sufficient to demonstrate efficacy in this age group.\n\nA post-hoc analysis was used to estimate the following public health outcomes against clinical CAP \n(as defined in the CAPiTA study, and based on clinical findings regardless of radiologic infiltrate or \netiologic confirmation): vaccine efficacy (VE), incidence rate reduction (IRR), and number needed to \nvaccinate (NNV) (Table 6).\n\nIRR, also referred to as vaccine preventable disease incidence, is the number of cases of vaccine \npreventable disease per 100,000 person-years of observation.\n\n\n\n20\n\nIn Table 6, NNV is a measure that quantifies the number of people that need to be vaccinated in order \nto prevent one clinical CAP case.\n\nTable 6: Vaccine efficacy (VE) against clinical CAP*\n\nEpisodes Vaccine efficacy1 % \n(95% CI)\n\n(1-sided p-value)\n\nIncidence per \n100,000 person-\n\nyears of observation \n(PYO)\n\nIncidence \nrate \n\nreduction2\n\n(95% CI)\n\nNumber \nneeded to \nvaccinate3\n\nPrevenar\n13\n\nPlacebo Prevenar \n13\n\nPlacebo\n\nAll \nepisodes \nanalysis\n\n1375 1495 8.1\n\n(-0.6, 16.1) \n\n(0.034)\n\n819.1 891.2 72.2 \n(-5.3, 149.6)\n\n277\n\nFirst \nepisode \nanalysis\n\n1126 1214 7.3\n\n(-0.4, 14.4)\n\n(0.031)\n\n670.7 723.7 53.0\n(-2.7, 108.7)\n\n378\n\n* Patients with at least 2 of the following: Cough; purulent sputum, temperature >38\u00b0C or <36.1\u00b0C; pneumonia \n(auscultatory findings); leukocytosis; C-reactive protein value >3 times the upper limit of normal; hypoxemia with \na partial oxygen pressure <60 mm Hg while breathing room air.\n1 A Poisson regression model with random effects was used to calculate VE.\n2 Per 100,000 person-years of observation. IRR is calculated as the incidence in the placebo group minus the \nincidence in the vaccine group, and was mathematically equivalent to VE \u00d7 the incidence in the placebo group.\n3 Based on a 5-year duration of protection. NNV is not a rate but instead indicates the number of cases prevented \nfor a given number of persons vaccinated. NNV also incorporates the length of the trial or duration of protection\nand is calculated as 1 divided by the product of the IRR and duration of protection (or length of trial) (=1/(IRR \u00d7\nduration).\n\nImmunogenicity studies in adults \u226518 years and the elderly\n\nIn adults, an antibody threshold of serotype-specific pneumococcal polysaccharide IgG binding \nantibody concentration associated with protection has not been defined. For all pivotal clinical trials, a \nserotype-specific opsonophagocytosis assay (OPA) was used as a surrogate to assess potential \nefficacy against invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia. OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs) \nmeasured 1-month after each vaccination were calculated. OPA titres are expressed as the reciprocal \nof the highest serum dilution that reduces survival of the pneumococci by at least 50 %.\n\nPivotal trials for Prevenar 13 were designed to show that functional OPA antibody responses for the \n13 serotypes are non-inferior, and for some serotypes superior, to the 12 serotypes in common with \n\nthe licensed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, \n19F, 23F] one month after vaccine administration. The response to serotype 6A, which is unique to \nPrevenar 13, was assessed by demonstration of a 4-fold increase in the specific OPA titer above \npre-immunised levels.\n\nFive clinical studies were conducted in Europe and the USA evaluating the immunogenicity of \nPrevenar 13 in different age groups ranging from 18-95 years of age. Clinical studies with Prevenar 13 \ncurrently provide immunogenicity data in adults aged 18 years and older, including adults aged 65 and \nolder previously vaccinated with one or more doses of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide \nvaccine, 5 years prior to enrollment. Each study included healthy adults and immuno-competent adults \nwith stable underlying conditions known to predispose individuals to pneumococcal infection (i.e.,\nchronic cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease including asthma, renal disorders and \ndiabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease including alcoholic liver disease), and adults with risk factors \nsuch as smoking and alcohol abuse.\n\nImmunogenicity and safety of Prevenar 13 has been demonstrated in adults aged 18 years and older \nincluding those previously vaccinated with a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.\n\n\n\n21\n\nAdults not previously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine\nIn a head-to-head, comparative trial conducted in adults aged 60-64 years, subjects received a single \ndose of either Prevenar 13 or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. In the same study \nanother group of adults aged 50-59 years and another group of adults aged 18-49 years received a \nsingle dose of Prevenar 13.\n\nTable 7 compares the OPA GMTs, 1-month post-dose, in 60-64 year olds given either a single dose of \nPrevenar 13 or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, and in 50-59 year olds given a single \ndose of Prevenar 13.\n\nTable 7: OPA GMTs in adults aged 60-64 years given Prevenar 13 or 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) and in adults aged 50-59 years given Prevenar 13a,b,c\n\nPrevenar 13 Prevenar 13 PPSV23 Prevenar 13\n50-59 Relative to\n\n60-64 Years\n\nPrevenar 13 Relative\nto PPSV23,\n60-64 Years\n\n50-59 Years \nN=350-384\n\n60-64 Years \nN=359-404\n\n60-64 Years \nN=367-402\n\nSerotype GMT GMT GMT GMR (95% CI) GMR (95% CI)\n1 200 146 104 1.4 (1.08, 1.73) 1.4 (1.10, 1.78)\n3 91 93 85 1.0 (0.81, 1.19) 1.1 (0.90, 1.32)\n4 2833 2062 1295 1.4 (1.07, 1.77) 1.6 (1.19, 2.13)\n5 269 199 162 1.4 (1.01, 1.80) 1.2 (0.93, 1.62)\n\n6A\u2020 4328 2593 213 1.7 (1.30, 2.15) 12.1 (8.63, 17.08)\n6B 3212 1984 788 1.6 (1.24, 2.12) 2.5 (1.82, 3.48)\n7F 1520 1120 405 1.4 (1.03, 1.79) 2.8 (1.98, 3.87)\n9V 1726 1164 407 1.5 (1.11, 1.98) 2.9 (2.00, 4.08)\n14 957 612 692 1.6 (1.16, 2.12) 0.9 (0.64, 1.21)\n\n18C 1939 1726 925 1.1 (0.86, 1.47) 1.9 (1.39, 2.51)\n19A 956 682 352 1.4 (1.16, 1.69) 1.9 (1.56, 2.41)\n19F 599 517 539 1.2 (0.87, 1.54) 1.0 (0.72, 1.28)\n23F 494 375 72 1.3 (0.94, 1.84) 5.2 (3.67, 7.33)\n\na Non-inferiority was defined as the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was greater than 0.5. \nb Statistically significantly greater response was defined as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR \nwas greater than 1. \nc For serotype 6A\u2020, which is unique to Prevenar 13, a statistically significantly greater response was defined as \nthe lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR being greater than 2.\n\nIn adults aged 60-64 years, OPA GMTs to Prevenar 13 were non-inferior to the OPA GMTs elicited to \nthe 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for the twelve serotypes common to both \nvaccines.

One year after the second dose, \nantibody levels measured by both IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs were higher than levels prior to the first \ndose of Prevenar 13, except for the IgG GMCs for serotypes 3 and 5 that were numerically similar.\n\nAdditional Prevenar (7-valent) immunogenicity data: children with sickle cell disease\nThe immunogenicity of Prevenar has been investigated in an open-label, multicentre study in \n49 infants with sickle cell disease. Children were vaccinated with Prevenar (3 doses one month apart \nfrom the age of 2 months), 46 of these children also received a 23-valent pneumococcal\npolysaccharide vaccine at the age of 15-18 months. After primary immunisation, 95.6 % of the \nsubjects had antibody levels of at least 0.35 \u03bcg/ml for all seven serotypes found in Prevenar. \nA significant increase was seen in the concentrations of antibodies against the seven serotypes after \nthe polysaccharide vaccination, suggesting that immunological memory was well established.\n\nHIV infection\n\nChildren and adults not previously vaccinated with a pneumococcal vaccine\nHIV-infected children and adults with CD4 \u2265 200 cells/\u00b5L (mean 717.0 cells/\u03bcL), viral load \n< 50,000 copies/ml (mean 2090.0 copies/ml), free of active AIDS-related illness and not previously \nvaccinated with a pneumococcal vaccine received 3 doses of Prevenar 13. As per general \nrecommendations, a single dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was subsequently \nadministered. Vaccines were administered at 1 month intervals. Immune responses were assessed in \n259-270 evaluable subjects approximately 1 month after each dose of vaccine. After the first dose, \nPrevenar 13 elicited antibody levels, measured by both IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs that were \nstatistically significantly higher when compared to levels prior to vaccination. After the second and \nthird dose of Prevenar 13, immune responses were similar or higher than those after the first dose.\n\nAdults previously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine\nHIV-infected adults \u2265 18 years of age with CD4 \u2265 200 cells/\u00b5L (mean 609.1 cells/\u00b5L) and viral load \n< 50,000 copies/ml (mean 330.6 copies/ml), who were free of active AIDS-related illness and were \npreviously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine administered at least \n6 months prior to enrollment, received 3 doses of Prevenar 13, at enrollment, 6 months, and\n12 months after the first dose of Prevenar 13. Immune responses were assessed in 231-255 evaluable \nsubjects approximately 1 month after each dose of Prevenar 13. After the first dose, Prevenar 13 \nelicited antibody levels measured by both IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs that were statistically \nsignificantly higher when compared to levels prior to vaccination. After the second and third dose of \nPrevenar 13, immune responses were comparable or higher than those after the first dose. In the study \n162 subjects had received one prior dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, \n143 subjects 2 prior doses and 26 subjects more than 2 prior doses of 23-valent polysaccharide \nvaccine. Subjects who received two or more previous doses of 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine showed a similar immune response compared with subjects who received a \nsingle previous dose.\n\nHaematopoietic stem cell transplant\nChildren and adults with an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at \u2265 2 years of age \nwith complete haematologic remission of underlying disease or with very good partial remission in the \ncase of lymphoma and myeloma received three doses of Prevenar 13 with an interval of at least \n1 month between doses. The first dose was administered at 3 to 6 months after HSCT. A fourth \n(booster) dose of Prevenar 13 was administered 6 months after the third dose. As per general \nrecommendations, a single dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was administered \n1 month after the fourth dose of Prevenar 13. Immune responses as measured by IgG GMCs were \nassessed in 168-211 evaluable subjects approximately 1 month after vaccination. Prevenar 13 elicited \nincreased antibody levels after each dose of Prevenar 13. Immune responses after the fourth dose of \n\n\n\n25\n\nPrevenar 13 were significantly increased for all serotypes compared with after the third dose.\nFunctional antibody titers (OPA titers) were not measured in this study.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, and reproduction and developmental \ntoxicity.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nActive immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media caused \nby Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children and adolescents from 6 weeks to 17 years of age.\n\nActive immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus \npneumoniae in adults \u2265 18 years of age and the elderly.\n\nSee sections 4.4 and 5.1 for information on protection against specific pneumococcal serotypes.\n\nThe use of Prevenar 13 should be determined on the basis of official recommendations taking into \nconsideration the risk of invasive disease and pneumonia in different age groups, underlying \ncomorbidities as well as the variability of serotype epidemiology in different geographical areas.\n\n\n\n28\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nThe immunisation schedules for Prevenar 13 should be based on official recommendations.\n\nPosology\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\n\nIt is recommended that infants who receive a first dose of Prevenar 13 complete the vaccination \ncourse with Prevenar 13.\n\nInfants aged 6 weeks-6 months\n\nThree-dose primary series\nThe recommended immunisation series consists of four doses, each of 0.5 ml. The primary infant \nseries consists of three doses, with the first dose usually given at 2 months of age and with an interval \nof at least 1 month between doses. The first dose may be given as early as six weeks of age. The \nfourth (booster) dose is recommended between 11 and 15 months of age.\n\nTwo-dose primary series\nAlternatively, when Prevenar 13 is given as part of a routine infant immunisation programme, a series \nconsisting of three doses, each of 0.5 ml, may be given. The first dose may be administered from the \nage of 2 months, with a second dose 2 months later. The third (booster) dose is recommended between \n\n11 and 15 months of age (see section 5.1).\n\nPreterm infants (<37 weeks gestation)\n\nIn preterm infants, the recommended immunisation series consists of four doses, each of 0.5 ml. The \nprimary infant series consists of three doses, with the first dose given at 2 months of age and with an \ninterval of at least 1 month between doses. The first dose may be given as early as six weeks of age. \nThe fourth (booster) dose is recommended between 11 and 15 months of age (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1).\n\nUnvaccinated infants and children \u2265 7 months of age\n\nInfants aged 7-11 months\nTwo doses, each of 0.5 ml, with an interval of at least 1 month between doses. A third dose is \nrecommended in the second year of life.\n\nChildren aged 12-23 months\nTwo doses, each of 0.5 ml, with an interval of at least 2 months between doses (see section 5.1).\n\nChildren and adolescents aged 2-17 years \nOne single dose of 0.5 ml.\n\nPrevenar 13 vaccine schedule for infants and children previously vaccinated with Prevenar (7-valent) \n(Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F)\nPrevenar 13 contains the same 7 serotypes included in Prevenar, using the same carrier protein \nCRM197. \n\nInfants and children who have begun immunisation with Prevenar may switch to Prevenar 13 at any \npoint in the schedule.\n\n\n\n29\n\nYoung children (12-59 months) completely immunised with Prevenar (7-valent)\nYoung children who are considered completely immunised with Prevenar (7-valent) should receive \none dose of 0.5 ml of Prevenar 13 to elicit immune responses to the 6 additional serotypes. This dose \nof Prevenar 13 should be administered at least 8 weeks after the final dose of Prevenar (7-valent) (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nChildren and adolescents 5\u201317 years \nChildren 5 to 17 years of age may receive a single dose of Prevenar 13 if they have been previously \nvaccinated with one or more doses of Prevenar. This dose of Prevenar 13 should be administered at \nleast 8 weeks after the final dose of Prevenar (7-valent) (see section 5.1).\n\nAdults \u2265 18 years of age, and the elderly\n\nOne single dose.\nThe need for revaccination with a subsequent dose of Prevenar 13 has not been established.\n\nRegardless of prior pneumococcal vaccination status, if the use of 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine is considered appropriate, Prevenar 13 should be given first (see sections 4.5 \nand 5.1).\n\nSpecial Populations\n\nIndividuals who have underlying conditions predisposing them to invasive pneumococcal disease \n(such as sickle cell disease or HIV infection) including those previously vaccinated with one or more \ndoses of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine may receive at least one dose of Prevenar 13 \n(see section 5.1).\n\nIn individuals with an haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), the recommended immunisation \nseries consists of four doses of Prevenar 13, each of 0.5 ml. The primary series consists of three doses, \nwith the first dose given at 3 to 6 months after HSCT and with an interval of at least 1 month between \ndoses. A fourth (booster) dose is recommended 6 months after the third dose (see section 5.1).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe vaccine should be given by intramuscular injection. The preferred sites are the anterolateral \naspect of the thigh (vastus lateralis muscle) in infants or the deltoid muscle of the upper arm in \nchildren and adults. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to diphtheria \ntoxoid.\n\nAs with other vaccines, the administration of Prevenar 13 should be postponed in subjects suffering \nfrom acute, severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should \nnot result in the deferral of vaccination.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPrevenar 13 must not be administered intravascularly.\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.\n\n\n\n30\n\nThis vaccine should not be given as an intramuscular injection to individuals with thrombocytopaenia \nor any coagulation disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection, but may be given \nsubcutaneously if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risks (see section 5.1).\n\nPrevenar 13 will only protect against Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes included in the vaccine, \nand will not protect against other microorganisms that cause invasive disease, pneumonia, or otitis \nmedia. As with any vaccine, Prevenar 13 may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine from \npneumococcal disease. For the most recent epidemiological information in your country you should \nconsult with the relevant national organisation.\n\nIndividuals with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due to the use of immuno-suppressive \ntherapy, a genetic defect, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or other causes, may have \nreduced antibody response to active immunisation.\n\nSafety and immunogenicity data are available for a limited number of individuals with sickle cell \ndisease, HIV infection, or with an haematopoietic stem cell transplant (see section 5.1). Safety and \nimmunogenicity data for Prevenar 13 are not available for individuals in other specific \nimmuno-compromised groups (e.g., malignancy or nephrotic syndrome) and vaccination should be \nconsidered on an individual basis.\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\n\nIn clinical studies, Prevenar 13 elicited an immune response to all thirteen serotypes included in the \nvaccine. The immune response for serotype 3 following the booster dose was not increased above the \nlevels seen after the infant vaccination series; the clinical relevance of this observation regarding the \ninduction of serotype 3 immune memory is unknown (see section 5.1).\n\nThe proportions of functional antibody responders (OPA titres \u2265 1:8) to serotypes 1, 3 and 5 were \nhigh. However, the OPA geometric mean titres were lower than those against each of the remaining \nadditional vaccine serotypes; the clinical relevance of this observation for protective efficacy is \nunknown (see section 5.1). \n\nLimited data have demonstrated that Prevenar 7-valent (three-dose primary series) induces an \nacceptable immune response in infants with sickle cell disease with a safety profile similar to that \nobserved in non-high-risk groups (see section 5.1). \n\nChildren younger than 2 years old should receive the appropriate-for-age Prevenar 13 vaccination \nseries (see section 4.2). The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine does not replace the use of \n23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines in children \u2265 2 years of age with conditions (such as \nsickle cell disease, asplenia, HIV infection, chronic illness, or those who are immuno-compromised) \nplacing them at higher risk for invasive disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Whenever \nrecommended, children at risk who are \u2265 24 months of age and already primed with Prevenar 13 \nshould receive 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The interval between the 13-valent \npneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar 13) and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide \nvaccine should not be less than 8 weeks. There are no data available to indicate whether the \nadministration of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to unprimed children or to children \nprimed with Prevenar 13 might result in hyporesponsiveness to further doses of Prevenar 13.\n\nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72 h should be considered \nwhen administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born \uf0a3 28 weeks of \ngestation), and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit \nof vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.\n\n\n\n31\n\nFor vaccine serotypes, protection against otitis media is expected to be lower than protection against \ninvasive disease. As otitis media is caused by many organisms other than pneumococcal serotypes \nrepresented in the vaccine, protection against all otitis media is expected to be low (see section 5.1).\n\nWhen Prevenar 13 is administered concomitantly with Infanrix hexa (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib), the rates \nof febrile reactions are similar to those seen with concomitant administration of Prevenar (7-valent) \nand Infanrix hexa (see section 4.8). Increased reporting rates of convulsions (with or without fever) \nand hypotonic hyporesponsive episode (HHE) were observed with concomitant administration of \nPrevenar 13 and Infanrix hexa (see section 4.8).\n\nAntipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local treatment guidelines for children with \nseizure disorders or with a prior history of febrile seizures and for all children receiving Prevenar 13 \nsimultaneously with vaccines containing whole cell pertussis.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\n\nPrevenar 13 can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccine antigens, either as \nmonovalent or combination vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, acellular or whole cell pertussis, \nHaemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated poliomyelitis, hepatitis B (see section 4.4 for guidance on \nInfanrix hexa), meningococcal serogroup C, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and rotavirus vaccine. \n\nPrevenar 13 can also be given concomitantly between 12-23 months with the tetanus toxoid \nconjugated meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups A, C, W and Y vaccine to children who have \nbeen adequately primed with Prevenar 13 (as per local recommendations).\n\nData from a postmarketing clinical study evaluating the impact of prophylactic use of antipyretics \n(ibuprofen and paracetamol) on the immune response to Prevenar 13 suggest that administration of \nparacetamol concomitantly or within the same day of vaccination may reduce the immune response to \nPrevenar 13 after the infant series. Responses to the booster dose administered at 12 months were \nunaffected. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown.\n\nChildren and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age\n\nNo data are currently available regarding concomitant use with other vaccines. \n\nAdults 18 to 49 years of age\n\nNo data are available regarding concomitant use with other vaccines. \n\nAdults aged 50 years and older\n\nPrevenar 13 may be administered concomitantly with the seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza \nvaccine (TIV).\n\nIn two studies conducted in adults aged 50-59 and 65 years and older, it was demonstrated that \nPrevenar 13 may be given concomitantly with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). The \nresponses to all three TIV antigens were comparable when TIV was given alone or concomitantly \nwith Prevenar 13.\n\nWhen Prevenar 13 was given concomitantly with TIV, the immune responses to Prevenar 13 were \nlower compared to when Prevenar 13 was given alone, however, there was no long-term impact on \ncirculating antibody levels.\n\n\n\n32\n\nIn a third study in adults aged 50-93 years, it was demonstrated that Prevenar 13 may be given \nconcomitantly with the seasonal quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV). The immune \nresponses to all four QIV strains were noninferior when Prevenar 13 was given concomitantly with \nQIV compared to when QIV was given alone.\n\nThe immune responses to Prevenar 13 were noninferior when Prevenar 13 was given concomitantly \nwith QIV compared to when Prevenar 13 was given alone. As with concomitant administration with \ntrivalent vaccines, immune responses to some pneumococcal serotypes were lower when both \nvaccines were given concomitantly.\n\nConcomitant use with other vaccines has not been investigated.\n\nDifferent injectable vaccines should always be given at different vaccination sites.\n\nConcomitant administration of Prevenar 13 and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine has \nnot been studied. In clinical studies when Prevenar 13 was given 1 year after 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine the immune responses were lower for all serotypes compared to when \nPrevenar 13 was given to subjects not previously immunised with 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine. The clinical significance of this is unknown. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data from the use of pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine in pregnant women.\nTherefore the use of Prevenar 13 should be avoided during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine is excreted in human milk.\n\nFertility\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPrevenar 13 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of \nthe effects mentioned under section 4.8 \u201cUndesirable effects\u201d may temporarily affect the ability to \ndrive or use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nAnalysis of postmarketing reporting rates suggests a potential increased risk of convulsions, with or \nwithout fever, and HHE when comparing groups which reported use of Prevenar 13 with \nInfanrix hexa to those which reported use of Prevenar 13 alone.\n\nAdverse reactions reported in clinical studies or from the postmarketing experience for all age groups \nare listed in this section per system organ class, in decreasing order of frequency and seriousness. The \nfrequency is defined as follows: very common (\uf0b3 1/10), common (\uf0b3 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(\uf0b3 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be \nestimated from available data).\n\n\n\n33\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\nThe safety of the vaccine was assessed in controlled clinical studies where 14,267 doses were given to \n4,429 healthy infants from 6 weeks of age at first vaccination and 11-16 months of age at booster \ndose. In all infant studies, Prevenar 13 was co-administered with routine paediatric vaccines (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nSafety in 354 previously unvaccinated children (7 months to 5 years of age) was also assessed.\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in children 6 weeks to 5 years of age were \nvaccination-site reactions, fever, irritability, decreased appetite, and increased and/or decreased sleep.\n\nIn a clinical study in infants vaccinated at 2, 3, and 4 months of age, fever \u2265 38\u00b0C was reported at \nhigher rates among infants who received Prevenar (7-valent) concomitantly with Infanrix hexa (28.3% \nto 42.3%) than in infants receiving Infanrix hexa alone (15.6% to 23.1%). After a booster dose at 12 \nto 15 months of age, fever \u2265 38\u00b0C was reported in 50.0% of infants who received Prevenar (7-valent) \nand Infanrix hexa at the same time as compared to 33.6% of infants receiving Infanrix hexa alone. \nThese reactions were mostly moderate (less than or equal to 39\u00b0C) and transient.\n\nAn increase in vaccination-site reactions was reported in children older than 12 months compared to \nrates observed in infants during the primary series with Prevenar 13.\n\nAdverse reactions from clinical studies\nIn clinical studies, the safety profile of Prevenar 13 was similar to Prevenar. The following \nfrequencies are based on adverse reactions assessed in Prevenar 13 clinical studies:\n\nImmune system disorders:\nRare: Hypersensitivity reaction including face oedema, dyspnoea, bronchospasm\n\nNervous system disorders:\nUncommon: Convulsions (including febrile convulsions)\nRare: Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode\n\nGastrointestinal disorders:\nVery common: Decreased appetite\nCommon: Vomiting; diarrhoea\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nCommon: Rash\nUncommon: Urticaria or urticaria-like rash\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVery common: Pyrexia; irritability; any vaccination-site erythema, induration/swelling or \n\npain/tenderness; somnolence; poor quality sleep\nVaccination-site erythema or induration/swelling 2.5 cm\u20137.0 cm (after the \nbooster dose and in older children [age 2 to 5 years])\n\nCommon: Pyrexia > 39\u00b0C; vaccination-site movement impairment (due to pain); \nvaccination-site erythema or induration/swelling 2.5 cm\u20137.0 cm (after infant \nseries)\n\nUncommon: Vaccination-site erythema, induration/swelling > 7.0 cm; crying\n\nAdditional information in special populations:\nApnoea in very premature infants (\uf0a3 28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n34\n\nChildren and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years of age \nSafety was evaluated in 592 children (294 children aged 5 to 10 years previously immunised with at \nleast one dose of Prevenar and 298 children aged 10 to 17 years who had not received a pneumococcal \nvaccine).\n\nThe most common adverse events in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age were:\n\nNervous system disorders:\nCommon: Headaches\n\nGastrointestinal disorders:\nVery common: Decreased appetite\nCommon: Vomiting; diarrhoea\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nCommon: Rash; urticaria or urticaria-like rash\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVery common: Irritability; any vaccination-site erythema; induration/swelling or \n\npain/tenderness; somnolence; poor quality sleep; \nvaccination-site tenderness (including impaired movement)\n\nCommon: Pyrexia\n\nOther adverse events previously observed in infants and children 6 weeks to 5 years of age may also \nbe applicable to this age group but were not seen in this study possibly due to the small sample size.\n\nAdditional information in special populations\nChildren and adolescents with sickle cell disease, HIV infection, or an haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant have similar frequencies of adverse reactions, except that headaches, vomiting, diarrhoea, \npyrexia, fatigue, arthralgia, and myalgia were very common.\n\nAdults \u2265 18 years and elderly\nSafety was assessed in 7 clinical studies including 91,593 adults ranging in age from 18 to 101 years. \nPrevenar 13 was administered to 48,806 adults; 2,616 (5.4%) aged 50 to 64 years, and 45,291 (92.8%) \naged 65 years and older. One of the 7 studies included a group of adults (n=899) ranging from 18 to \n49 years who received Prevenar 13 and who were not previously vaccinated with 23-valent \npneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Of the Prevenar 13 recipients 1,916 adults were previously \nvaccinated with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at least 3 years prior to study \nvaccination, and 46,890 were 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine unvaccinated.\n\nA trend to lower frequency of adverse reactions was associated with greater age; adults > 65 years of \nage (regardless of prior pneumococcal vaccination status) reported fewer adverse reactions than \nyounger adults, with adverse reactions generally most common in the youngest adults, 18 to 29 years \nof age.\n\nOverall, the frequency categories were similar for all age groups, with the exception of vomiting \nwhich was very common (\uf0b3 1/10) in adults aged 18 to 49 years and common (\uf0b3 1/100 to < 1/10) in all \nother age groups, and pyrexia was very common in adults aged 18 to 29 years and common in all other \nage groups. Severe vaccination-site pain/tenderness and severe limitation of arm movement was very \ncommon in adults 18 to 39 years and common in all other age groups.\n\nAdverse reactions from clinical studies\nLocal reactions and systemic events were solicited daily after each vaccination for 14 days in 6 studies\nand 7 days in the remaining study. The following frequencies are based on adverse reactions assessed \nin Prevenar 13 clinical studies in adults:\n\n\n\n35\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders:\nVery common: Decreased appetite\n\nNervous system disorders:\nVery common: Headaches\n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common: Diarrhoea; vomiting (in adults aged 18 to 49 years)\n\nCommon: Vomiting (in adults aged 50 years and over)\n\nUncommon: Nausea\n\nImmune system disorders:\nUncommon: Hypersensitivity reaction including face oedema, dyspnoea, bronchospasm\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nVery common: Rash\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVery common: Chills; fatigue; vaccination-site erythema; vaccination-site \n\ninduration/swelling; vaccination-site pain/tenderness (severe vaccination-site \npain/tenderness very common in adults aged 18 to 39 years); limitation of arm \nmovement (severe limitation of arm movements very common in adults aged \n18 to 39 years)\n\nCommon: Pyrexia (very common in adults aged 18 to 29 years)\n\nUncommon: Lymphadenopathy localized to the region of the vaccination-site\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:\nVery common: Arthralgia; myalgia\n\nOverall, no significant differences in frequencies of adverse reactions were seen when Prevenar 13 \nwas given to adults previously vaccinated with the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.\n\nAdditional information in special populations\nAdults with HIV infection have similar frequencies of adverse reactions, except that pyrexia and \nvomiting were very common and nausea common. \n\nAdults with an haematopoietic stem cell transplant have similar frequencies of adverse reactions, \nexcept that pyrexia and vomiting were very common.\n\nHigher frequency in some solicited systemic reactions was observed when Prevenar 13 was \nadministered concomitantly with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) compared to TIV given \nalone (headache, chills, rash, decreased appetite, arthralgia, and myalgia) or Prevenar 13 given alone \n(headache, fatigue, chills, decreased appetite, and arthralgia). \n\nAdverse reactions from Prevenar 13 postmarketing experience\nThe following are considered adverse drug reactions for Prevenar 13; because these reactions were \nderived from spontaneous reports, the frequencies could not be determined and are thus considered as \nnot known.\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders:\nLymphadenopathy (localised to the region of the vaccination-site)\n\n\n\n36\n\nImmune system disorders:\nAnaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction including shock; angioedema\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nErythema multiforme\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVaccination-site urticaria; vaccination-site dermatitis; vaccination-site \npruritus; flushing\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nOverdose with Prevenar 13 is unlikely due to its presentation as a single dose vial. However, in infants \nand children there have been reports of overdose with Prevenar 13 defined as subsequent doses \nadministered closer than recommended to the previous dose. In general, adverse events reported with \noverdose are consistent with those that have been reported with doses given in the recommended \npaediatric schedules of Prevenar 13.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines; ATC code: J07AL02\n\nPrevenar 13 contains the 7 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides that are in Prevenar (4, 6B, 9V, \n14, 18C, 19F, 23F) plus 6 additional polysaccharides (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, 19A) all conjugated to CRM197\n\ncarrier protein. \n\nBurden of disease\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\n\nBased on serotype surveillance in Europe performed before the introduction of Prevenar, Prevenar 13 \nis estimated to cover 73-100% (depending on the country) of serotypes causing invasive \npneumococcal disease (IPD) in children less than 5 years of age. In this age group, serotypes 1, 3, 5, \n6A, 7F, and 19A account for 15.6% to 59.7% of invasive disease, depending on the country, the time \nperiod studied, and the use of Prevenar.\n\nAcute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood disease with different aetiologies. Bacteria can be \nresponsible for 60-70% of clinical episodes of AOM. S. pneumoniae is one of the most common \ncauses of bacterial AOM worldwide.\n\nPrevenar 13 is estimated to cover over 90% of serotypes causing antimicrobial-resistant IPD. \n\nChildren and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years\n\nIn children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years, the incidence of pneumococcal disease is low, \nhowever, there is an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in those with underlying comorbidities.\n\n\n\n37\n\nAdults \u2265 18 years and the elderly\n\nPneumonia is the most common clinical presentation of pneumococcal disease in adults.\n\nThe reported incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and IPD in Europe varies by \ncountry, increases with age from 50 years and is highest in individuals aged \u2265 65 years. S. pneumoniae\nis the most frequent cause of CAP, and is estimated to be responsible for approximately 30% of all \nCAP cases requiring hospitalisation in adults in developed countries.\n\nBacteraemic pneumonia (approximately 80% of IPD in adults), bacteraemia without a focus, and \nmeningitis are the most common manifestations of IPD in adults. Based on surveillance data following\nthe introduction of Prevenar but before the introduction of Prevenar 13 in childhood vaccination \nprogrammes, the pneumococcal serotypes in Prevenar 13 may be responsible for at least 50 \u2013 76% \n(depending on country) of IPD in adults.\n\nThe risk for CAP and IPD in adults also increases with chronic underlying medical conditions, \nspecifically, anatomical or functional asplenia, diabetes mellitus, asthma, chronic cardiovascular, \npulmonary, kidney or liver disease, and it is highest in those who are immune-suppressed such as \nthose with malignant haematological diseases or HIV infection. \n\nPrevenar 13 immunogenicity clinical studies in infants, children and adolescents\n\nThe protective efficacy of Prevenar 13 against IPD has not been studied. As recommended by the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) the assessment of potential efficacy against IPD in infants and \nyoung children has been based on a comparison of immune responses to the seven common serotypes \nshared between Prevenar 13 and Prevenar, for which protective efficacy has been proven (for \nPrevenar (7-valent) efficacy in infants and children, see below). Immune responses to the additional \n6 serotypes were also measured.\n\nImmune responses following a three-dose primary infant series\n\nClinical studies have been conducted in a number of European countries and the US using a range of \nvaccination schedules, including two randomised non-inferiority studies (Germany using a 2, 3, \n4 month primary series [006] and US using a 2, 4, 6 month primary series [004]). In these two studies \npneumococcal immune responses were compared using a set of non-inferiority criteria including the \npercentage of subjects with serum anti-polysaccharide serotype-specific IgG \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml one month \nafter the primary series and the comparison of IgG geometric mean concentrations (ELISA GMCs); in \naddition, functional antibody titres (OPA) between subjects receiving Prevenar 13 and Prevenar were \ncompared. For the six additional serotypes, these values were compared with the lowest response \namong all of the seven common serotypes in the Prevenar recipients.\n\nThe non-inferiority immune response comparisons for study 006, based on the proportion of infants \nachieving anti-polysaccharide IgG concentrations \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml, are shown in Table 1. Results for \nstudy 004 were similar. Prevenar 13 non-inferiority (lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference in \npercentage of responders at 0.35 \u00b5g/ml between groups was >-10%) was demonstrated for all \n7 common serotypes, except for serotype 6B in study 006 and serotypes 6B and 9V in study 004, \nwhich missed by a small margin. All seven common serotypes met pre-defined non-inferiority criteria \nfor IgG ELISA GMCs. Prevenar 13 elicited comparable, although slightly lower, antibody levels than \nPrevenar for the 7 common serotypes. The clinical relevance of these differences is not known.\n\nNon-inferiority was met for the 6 additional serotypes based on the proportion of infants achieving \nantibody concentrations \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml and comparison of IgG ELISA GMCs in study 006 and was met \nfor 5 out of the 6 serotypes, with the exception of serotype 3 for study 004. For serotype 3, the \npercentages of Prevenar 13 recipients with serum IgG \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml were 98.2% (study 006) and \n63.5% (study 004).\n\n\n\n38\n\nTable 1: Comparison of the proportion of subjects achieving a pneumococcal anti-polysaccharide IgG \nantibody concentration \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml after dose 3 of the infant series \u2013 study 006\n\nSerotypes\n\nPrevenar 13 \n%\n\n(N=282-285)\n\n7-valent Prevenar\n%\n\n(N=277-279)\nDifference\n(95 % CI)\n\n7-valent Prevenar serotypes\n4 98.2 98.2 0.0 (-2.5, 2.6)\n\n6B 77.5 87.1 -9.6 (-16.0, -3.3)\n9V 98.6 96.4 2.2 (-0.4, 5.2)\n14 98.9 97.5 1.5 (-0.9, 4.1)\n\n18C 97.2 98.6 -1.4 (-4.2, 1.2)\n19F 95.8 96.0 -0.3 (-3.8, 3.3)\n23F 88.7 89.5 -0.8 (-6.0, 4.5)\n\nAdditional serotypes in Prevenar 13\n1 96.1 87.1* 9.1 (4.5, 13.9)\n3 98.2 87.1 11.2 (7.0, 15.8)\n5 93.0 87.1 5.9 (0.8, 11.1)\n\n6A 91.9 87.1 4.8 (-0.3, 10.1)\n7F 98.6 87.1 11.5 (7.4, 16.1)\n\n19A 99.3 87.1 12.2 (8.3, 16.8)\n* The serotype in Prevenar with the lowest percent response rate was 6B in study 006 (87.1 %).\n\nPrevenar 13 elicited functional antibodies to all 13 vaccine serotypes in studies 004 and 006. For the \n7 common serotypes there were no differences between groups in the proportion of subjects with OPA \ntitres \u2265 1:8. For each of the seven common serotypes, > 96% and > 90% of the Prevenar 13 recipients \nreached an OPA titre \u2265 1:8 one month after the primary series in studies 006 and 004, respectively.\n\nFor each of the 6 additional serotypes, Prevenar 13 elicited OPA titres \u2265 1:8 in 91.4% to 100% of \nvaccinees one month after the primary series in studies 004/006. The functional antibody (OPA) \ngeometric mean titres for serotypes 1, 3 and 5 were lower than the titres for each of the other \nadditional serotypes; the clinical relevance of this observation for protective efficacy is unknown. \n\nImmune responses following a two-dose primary infant series\n\nThe immunogenicity after two doses in infants has been documented in four studies. The proportion \nof infants achieving a pneumococcal anti-capsular polysaccharide IgG concentration \u2265 0.35 \uf06dg/ml one \nmonth after the second dose ranged from 79.6% to 98.5% across 11 of the 13 vaccine serotypes. \nSmaller proportions of infants achieved this antibody concentration threshold for serotype 6B (27.9% \nto 57.3%) and 23F (55.8% to 68.1%) for all studies using a 2, 4 month regimen, compared to 58.4% \nfor serotype 6B and 68.6% for 23F for a study using a 3, 5 month regimen. After the booster dose, all \nvaccine serotypes including 6B and 23F had immune responses consistent with adequate priming with \na two-dose primary series. In a UK study, the functional antibody (OPA) responses were comparable \nfor all serotypes including 6B and 23F in the Prevenar and Prevenar 13 arms after the primary series \nat two and four months of age and after the booster dose at 12 months of age. For Prevenar 13 \nrecipients, the proportion of responders with an OPA titre \uf0b3 1:8 was at least 87% following the infant \nseries, and at least 93% following the booster dose. The OPA geometric mean titres for serotypes 1, 3 \nand 5 were lower than the titres for each of the other additional serotypes; the clinical relevance of \nthis observation is unknown.\n\nBooster responses following two-dose and three-dose primary infant series\n\nFollowing the booster dose, antibody concentrations increased from the pre-booster level for all \n13 serotypes. Post-booster antibody concentrations were higher for 12 serotypes than those achieved \nafter the infant primary series. These observations are consistent with adequate priming (the induction \nof immunologic memory). The immune response for serotype 3 following the booster dose was not \n\n\n\n39\n\nincreased above the levels seen after the infant vaccination series; the clinical relevance of this \nobservation regarding the induction of serotype 3 immune memory is unknown.\n\nAntibody responses to booster doses following two-dose or three-dose infant primary series were \ncomparable for all 13 vaccine serotypes.\n\nFor children aged from 7 months to 5 years, age appropriate catch-up immunisation schedules (as \ndescribed in section 4.2) result in levels of anti-capsular polysaccharide IgG antibody responses to \neach of the 13 serotypes that are at least comparable to those of a three-dose primary series in infants.\n\nAntibody persistence and immunological memory were evaluated in a study in healthy children who \nreceived a single dose of Prevenar 13 at least 2 years after they had been previously immunised with \neither 4 doses of Prevenar, a 3-dose infant series of Prevenar followed by Prevenar 13 at 12 months of \nage, or 4 doses of Prevenar 13. \n\nThe single dose of Prevenar 13, in children approximately 3.4 years of age regardless of previous \nvaccination history with Prevenar or Prevenar 13, induced a robust antibody response for both the \n7 common serotypes and the 6 additional serotypes in Prevenar 13.\n\nSince the introduction of 7-valent Prevenar in 2000, pneumococcal disease surveillance data have not \nshown that the immunity elicited by Prevenar in infancy has waned over time. \n\nPreterm Infants\n\nSafety and immunogenicity of Prevenar 13 given at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months was assessed in \napproximately 100 prematurely born infants (mean Estimated Gestational Age [EGA], 31 weeks; \nrange, 26 to 36 weeks) and compared with approximately 100 infants born at term (mean EGA, \n39 weeks; range, 37 to 42 weeks).\n\nImmune responses in preterm and term infants were compared using the proportion of subjects \nachieving a pneumococcal polysaccharide IgG binding antibody concentration \u22650.35 \u03bcg/ml 1 month \nafter the infant series, the approach used for immunogenicity comparisons of Prevenar 13 to Prevenar \nbased on WHO guidelines.\n\nMore than 85% achieved a pneumococcal polysaccharide IgG binding antibody concentration \n\u22650.35 \u00b5g/ml 1 month after the infant series, except for serotypes 5 (71.7%), 6A (82.7%), and 6B \n(72.7%) in the preterm group. For these 3 serotypes, the proportion of responders among preterm \ninfants was significantly lower than among term infants. Approximately one month after the toddler \ndose, the proportion of subjects in each group achieving this same antibody concentration threshold \nwas >97%, except for serotype 3 (71% in preterm infants and 79% in term infants). It is unknown \nwhether immunological memory to all serotypes is induced in pre-term infants. In general, \nserotype-specific IgG GMCs were lower for preterm infants than term infants.\n\nAfter the infant series, OPA GMTs were similar in preterm infants compared to term infants except \nfor serotype 5, which was lower in preterm infants. OPA GMTs after the toddler dose relative to those \nafter the infant series were similar or lower for 4 serotypes (4, 14, 18C, and 19F) and were statistically \nsignificantly higher for 6 of 13 serotypes (1, 3, 5, 7F, 9V, and 19A) in preterm infants compared to 10 \nof 13 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, 18C, 19A, and 23F) in term infants.\n\nChildren (12-59 months) completely immunised with Prevenar (7-valent)\n\nFollowing administration of a single dose of Prevenar 13 to children (12-59 months) who are \nconsidered completely immunised with Prevenar (7-valent) (either 2 or 3 dose primary series plus \nbooster), the proportion achieving serum IgG levels \u22650.35 \u00b5g/ml and OPA titres \u22651:8 was at least \n90%. However, 3 (serotypes 1, 5 and 6A) of the 6 additional serotypes showed lower IgG GMC and \nOPA GMT when compared with children who had received at least one previous vaccination with \n\n\n\n40\n\nPrevenar 13. The clinical relevance of the lower GMCs and GMTs is currently unknown.\n\nUnvaccinated Children (12-23 months)\n\nStudies in unvaccinated children (12 -23 months) with Prevenar (7-valent) demonstrated that 2 doses \nwere required to achieve serum IgG concentrations for 6B and 23F similar to those induced by a \n3-dose infant series.\n\nChildren and Adolescents 5 to 17 years of age\n\nIn an open-label study in 592 healthy children and adolescents including those with asthma (17.4%) \nwho may be predisposed to pneumococcal infection, Prevenar 13 elicited immune responses to all \n13 serotypes. A single dose of Prevenar 13 was given to children 5 to 10 years of age previously \nvaccinated with at least 1 dose of Prevenar, and children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age who \nhad never received a pneumococcal vaccine.\n\nIn both the children 5 to 10 years of age and children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years, the immune\nresponse to Prevenar 13 was non inferior to Prevenar for the 7 common serotypes and to Prevenar 13 \nfor the 6 additional serotypes compared to the immune response after the fourth dose in infants \nvaccinated at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age as measured by serum IgG.\n\nIn children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years of age OPA GMTs 1 month after vaccination were \nnoninferior to OPA GMTs in the 5 to 10 year old age group for 12 of the 13 serotypes (except \nserotype 3). \n\nImmune responses after subcutaneous administration\n\nSubcutaneous administration of Prevenar 13 was evaluated in a non-comparative study in 185 healthy \nJapanese infants and children who received 4 doses at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age. The study \ndemonstrated that safety and immunogenicity were generally comparable with observations made in \nstudies of intramuscular administration.\n\nPrevenar 13 Effectiveness\n\nInvasive Pneumococcal Disease\nData published by Public Health England showed that, four years after the introduction of Prevenar as \na two dose primary infant series with booster dose in the second year of life and with a 94% vaccine \nuptake, there was a 98% (95% CI 95; 99) reduction in disease caused by the 7 vaccine serotypes in \nEngland and Wales. Subsequently, four years following the switch to Prevenar 13, the additional\nreduction in incidence of IPD due to the 7 serotypes in Prevenar ranged from 76% in children less \nthan 2 years of age to 91% in children 5-14 years of age. The serotype specific reductions for each of \nthe 5 additional serotypes in Prevenar 13 (no cases of serotype 5 IPD were observed) by age group are \nshown in Table 2 and ranged from 68% (serotype 3) to 100% (serotype 6A) for children less than \n5 years of age. Significant incidence reductions were also observed in older age groups who had not \nbeen vaccinated with Prevenar 13 (indirect effect).\n\n\n\n41\n\nOtitis media (OM)\nIn a published study performed in Israel, using a 2-dose primary series plus booster dose in the second \nyear of life, the impact of Prevenar 13 on OM was documented in a population-based \nactive-surveillance system with tympanocentesis culturing of middle ear fluid in Israeli children less \nthan 2 years of age with OM. \n\nFollowing the introduction of Prevenar and subsequently Prevenar 13 there was a decline in incidence \nfrom 2.1 to 0.1 cases per 1000 children (95%) for the Prevenar serotypes plus serotype 6A and a \ndecline in incidence from 0.9 to 0.1 cases per 1000 children (89%) for the additional serotypes 1, 3, 5, \n7F, and 19A in Prevenar 13. The annual overall pneumococcal incidence of OM declined from 9.6 to \n2.1 cases per 1000 children (78%) between July 2004 (prior to the introduction of Prevenar) and June \n2013 (post Prevenar 13 introduction).\n\nTable 2: Serotype specific number of cases and incidence reductions of IPD in 2013/14 compared to \n2008/09-2009/10 (2008/10) by age in England and Wales\n\n<5 years of age 5 to 64 years of age \u226565 years of age\n\n2008-\n10\u00a7\n\n2013/\n14\u00a7\n\n% Incidence \nreduction \n(95% CI*)\n\n2008-\n10\u00a7\n\n2013/\n14\u00a7\n\n% \nIncidence \nreduction \n(95% CI*)\n\n2008-\n10\u00a7\n\n2013/\n14\u00a7\n\n% Incidence \nreduction \n(95% CI*)\n\nAdditional serotypes covered by Prevenar 13\n\n1 59 (54) 5 (5) 91%\n\n(98%; \n68%)**\n\n458 \n(382)\n\n77 \n(71)\n\n83%\n\n(88%; \n74%)**\n\n102 \n(89)\n\n13 \n(13)\n\n87%\n\n(94%; \n72%)**\n\n3 26 (24) 8 (8) 68%\n\n(89%; 6%)\n\n178 \n(148)\n\n73 \n(68)\n\n59%\n\n(72%; \n38%)**\n\n256 \n(224)\n\n143 \n(146)\n\n44%\n\n(57%; \n27%)**\n\n6A 10 (9) 0 (0) 100%\n\n(100%; \n62%)**\n\n53 (44) 5 (5) 90%\n\n(97%; \n56%)**\n\n94 (82) 5 (5) 95%\n\n(99%; \n81%)**\n\n7F 90 (82) 8 (8) 91%\n\n(97%; \n74%)**\n\n430 \n(361)\n\n160\n(148)\n\n63%\n\n(71%; \n50%)**\n\n173 \n(152)\n\n75 \n(77)\n\n56%\n\n(70%; \n37%)**\n\n19A 85 (77) 7 (7) 91%\n\n(97%; \n75%)**\n\n225 \n(191)\n\n104 \n(97)\n\n54%\n\n(65%; \n32%)**\n\n279 \n(246)\n\n97 \n(99)\n\n65%\n\n(75%; \n53%)**\n\n\u00a7 Corrected for proportion of samples serotyped, missing age, denominator compared with 2009/10, and \nfor the trend in total invasive pneumococcal disease up to 2009/10 (after which no trend correction was \napplied).\n\n* 95% CI inflated from a Poisson interval based on over-dispersion of 2.1 seen from modelling of \n2000-06 pre-Prevenar all IPD data.\n\n** p<0.005 to cover 6A where p=0.002\n\n\n\n42\n\nPneumonia\nIn a multicenter observational study in France comparing the periods before and after the switch from \nPrevenar to Prevenar 13, there was 16% (2060 to 1725 cases) reduction in all community acquired \npneumonia (CAP) cases in emergency departments in children 1 month to 15 years of age. Reductions \nwere 53% (167 to 79 cases) (p<0.001) for CAP cases with pleural effusion and 63% (64 to 24 cases) \n(p<0.001) for microbiologically confirmed pneumococcal CAP cases. In the second year after the \nintroduction of Prevenar 13 the total number of CAP cases due to the 6 additional vaccine serotypes in \nPrevenar 13 was reduced from 27 to 7 isolates (74%).\n\nThe decrease in all cause pneumonia cases was most pronounced in the younger vaccinated age \ngroups with a decrease of 31.8% (757 to 516 cases) and 16.6% (833 to 695 cases) in the age groups \n<2 years and 2 to 5 years, respectively. The incidence in older, predominantly non-vaccinated children \n(>5 years) did not change over the duration of the study.\n\nIn an ongoing surveillance system (2004 to 2013) to document the impact of Prevenar and \nsubsequently Prevenar 13 on CAP in children less than 5 years in Southern Israel using a 2 dose \nprimary series with a booster dose in the second year of life, there was a reduction of 68% \n(95% CI 73; 61) in outpatient visits and 32% (95% CI 39; 22) in hospitalizations for alveolar CAP \nfollowing the introduction of Prevenar 13 when compared to the period before the introduction of \nPrevenar.\n\nEffect on nasopharyngeal carriage \n\nIn a surveillance study in France in children presenting with acute otitis media, changes in \nnasopharyngeal (NP) carriage of pneumococcal serotypes were evaluated following the introduction \nof Prevenar (7-valent) and subsequently Prevenar 13. Prevenar 13 significantly reduced NP carriage of \nthe 6 additional serotypes (and serotype 6C) combined and individual serotypes 6C, 7F, 19A when \ncompared with Prevenar. A reduction in carriage was also seen for serotype 3 (2.5% vs 1.1%; p=0.1). \nThere was no carriage of serotypes 1 and 5 observed.\n\nThe effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination on nasopharyngeal carriage was studied in a \nrandomised double-blind study in which infants received either Prevenar 13 or Prevenar (7-valent) at \n2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age in Israel. Prevenar 13 significantly reduced newly identified NP \nacquisition of the 6 additional serotypes (and serotype 6C) combined and of individual serotypes 1, \n6A, 6C, 7F, 19A when compared with Prevenar. There was no reduction seen in serotype 3 and for \nserotype 5 the colonization was too infrequent to assess impact. For 6 of the remaining 7 common \nserotypes, similar rates of NP acquisition were observed in both vaccine groups; for serotype 19F a \nsignificant reduction was observed.\n\nIn this study, reductions of S. pneumoniae serotypes 19A, 19F, and 6A not susceptible to a number of \nantibiotics were documented. The reductions ranged between 34% and 62% depending on serotype \nand antibiotic.\n\nPrevenar (7-valent vaccine) protective efficacy in infants and children\n\nThe efficacy of 7-valent Prevenar was evaluated in two major studies \u2013 the Northern California Kaiser \nPermanente (NCKP) study and the Finnish Otitis Media (FinOM) study. Both studies were \nrandomised, double-blind, active-control studies in which infants were randomised to receive either \nPrevenar or control vaccine (NCKP, meningococcal serogroup C CRM-conjugate [MnCC] vaccine; \nFinOM, hepatitis B vaccine) in a four-dose series at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age. The efficacy \nresults from these studies (for invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media) are \npresented below (Table 3).\n\n\n\n43\n\nTable 3: Summary of efficacy of 7-valent Prevenar1\n\nTest N VE2 95% CI\n\nNCKP: Vaccine-serotype IPD3 30,258 97% 85, 100\n\nNCKP: Clinical pneumonia with abnormal chest X-ray 23,746 35% 4, 56\n\nNCKP: Acute Otitis Media (AOM)4 23,746\n\nTotal episodes 7% 4, 10\n\nRecurrent AOM (3 episodes in 6 months, or 4 episodes in 1 year) 9% 3, 15\nRecurrent AOM (5 episodes in 6 months, or 6 episodes in 1 year) 23% 7, 36\nTympanostomy tube placement 20% 2, 35\n\nFinOM: AOM 1,662\n\nTotal episodes 6% -4, 16\n\nAll pneumococcal AOM 34% 21, 45\nVaccine-serotype AOM 57% 44, 67\n\n1Per protocol\n2Vaccine efficacy\n3October 1995 to April 20, 1999\n4October 1995 to April 30, 1998\n\nPrevenar (7-valent) effectiveness\n\nThe effectiveness (both direct and indirect effect) of 7-valent Prevenar against pneumococcal disease \nhas been evaluated in both three-dose and two-dose primary infant series immunisation programmes, \neach with booster doses (Table 4). Following the widespread use of Prevenar, the incidence of IPD \nhas been consistently and substantially reduced.\n\nUsing the screening method, serotype-specific effectiveness estimates for 2 doses under the age of \n1 year in the UK were 66 % (-29, 91 %) and 100 % (25, 100 %) for serotype 6B and 23F, respectively.\n\nTable 4: Summary of effectiveness of 7-valent Prevenar for invasive pneumococcal disease\nCountry\n\n(year of introduction)\nRecommended schedule Disease reduction, % 95% CI\n\nUK (England & Wales)1 (2006) 2, 4, + 13 months Vaccine serotypes:\nTwo doses under age 1: 85%\n\n49, 95%\n\nUSA (2000)\n\nChildren < 52\n\nPersons \u2265 653\n\n2, 4, 6, + 12-15 months\n\nVaccine serotypes: 98%\nAll serotypes: 77%\n\nVaccine serotypes: 76%\nAll serotypes: 38%\n\n97, 99%\n73, 79%\n\nNA\nNA\n\nCanada (Quebec)4\n\n(2004)\n2, 4, + 12 months All serotypes: 73%\n\nVaccine serotypes:\n2-dose infant series: 99%\nCompleted schedule:100%\n\nNA\n\n92, 100%\n82, 100%\n\n1Children < 2 years of age.

In a retrospective evaluation \nof a large US insurance database, AOM visits were reduced by 42.7 % (95 % CI, 42.4-43.1 %), and \nprescriptions for AOM by 41.9 % in children younger than 2 years of age, compared with a \npre-licensure baseline (2004 vs. 1997-99). In a similar analysis, hospitalisations and ambulatory visits \nfor all-cause pneumonia were reduced by 52.4 % and 41.1 %, respectively. For those events \n\n\n\n44\n\nspecifically identified as pneumococcal pneumonia, the observed reductions in hospitalisations and \nambulatory visits were 57.6 % and 46.9 %, respectively, in children younger than 2 years of age, \ncompared with a pre-licensure baseline (2004 vs. 1997-99). While direct cause-and-effect cannot be \ninferred from observational analyses of this type, these findings suggest that Prevenar plays an \nimportant role in reducing the burden of mucosal disease (AOM and pneumonia) in the target \npopulation.\n\nEfficacy study in adults 65 years and older\n\nEfficacy against vaccine-type (VT) pneumococcal CAP and IPD was assessed in a large-scale \nrandomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization \nTrial in Adults\u2013CAPiTA) in the Netherlands. 84,496 subjects, 65 years and older received a single \nvaccination of either Prevenar 13 or placebo in a 1:1 randomisation.\n\nThe CAPiTA study enrolled volunteers \u2265 65 years of age whose demographic and health \ncharacteristics may differ from those seeking vaccination.\n\nA first episode of hospitalised, chest X-ray confirmed pneumonia was identified in about 2% of this \npopulation (n=1,814 subjects) of which 329 cases were confirmed pneumococcal CAP and 182 cases \nwere VT pneumococcal CAP in the per protocol and modified intent to treat (mITT) populations.\n\nEfficacy was demonstrated for the primary and secondary endpoints in the per protocol population\n(Table 5).\n\nTable 5: Vaccine efficacy (VE) for the primary and secondary endpoints of the CAPiTA study (per \nprotocol population)\n\nEfficacy endpoint\n\nCases\n\nVE (%)\n(95.2% CI)\n\np-value\nTotal\n\nPrevenar 13\ngroup\n\nPlacebo\ngroup\n\nPrimary endpoint\n\nFirst episode of confirmed VT \npneumococcal CAP\n\n139 49 90\n45.56\n\n(21.82, 62.49)\n0.0006\n\nSecondary endpoints\n\nFirst episode of confirmed NB/NI1\n\nvaccine type pneumococcal CAP\n93 33 60\n\n45.00\n(14.21, 65.31)\n\n0.0067\n\nFirst episode of VT-IPD2 35 7 28\n75.00\n\n(41.06, 90.87)\n0.0005\n\n1NB/NI \u2013 non-bacteraemic/non-invasive\n2VT-IPD \u2013 vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease\n\nThe duration of protective efficacy against a first episode of VT pneumococcal CAP, \nNB/NI VT pneumococcal CAP, and VT-IPD extended throughout the 4-year study.\n\nThe study was not designed to demonstrate efficacy in subgroups, and the number of subjects \n\u2265 85 years of age was not sufficient to demonstrate efficacy in this age group.\n\nA post-hoc analysis was used to estimate the following public health outcomes against clinical CAP \n(as defined in the CAPiTA study, and based on clinical findings regardless of radiologic infiltrate or \netiologic confirmation): vaccine efficacy (VE), incidence rate reduction (IRR), and number needed to \nvaccinate (NNV) (Table 6).\n\nIRR, also referred to as vaccine preventable disease incidence, is the number of cases of vaccine \npreventable disease per 100,000 person-years of observation.\n\n\n\n45\n\nIn Table 6, NNV is a measure that quantifies the number of people that need to be vaccinated in order \nto prevent one clinical CAP case.\n\nTable 6: Vaccine efficacy (VE) against clinical CAP*\n\nEpisodes Vaccine efficacy1 % \n(95% CI)\n\n(1-sided p-value)\n\nIncidence per \n100,000 person-\n\nyears of observation \n(PYO)\n\nIncidence \nrate \n\nreduction2\n\n(95% CI)\n\nNumber \nneeded to \nvaccinate3\n\nPrevenar\n13\n\nPlacebo Prevenar \n13\n\nPlacebo\n\nAll \nepisodes \nanalysis\n\n1375 1495 8.1 \n\n(-0.6, 16.1) \n\n(0.034)\n\n819.1 891.2 72.2 \n(-5.3, 149.6)\n\n277\n\nFirst \nepisode\nanalysis\n\n1126 1214 7.3\n\n(-0.4, 14.4)\n\n(0.031)\n\n670.7 723.7 53.0\n(-2.7, 108.7)\n\n378\n\n* Patients with at least 2 of the following: Cough; purulent sputum, temperature >38\u00b0C or <36.1\u00b0C; pneumonia \n(auscultatory findings); leukocytosis; C-reactive protein value >3 times the upper limit of normal; hypoxemia with \na partial oxygen pressure <60 mm Hg while breathing room air.\n1 A Poisson regression model with random effects was used to calculate VE.\n2 Per 100,000 person-years of observation. IRR is calculated as the incidence in the placebo group minus the \nincidence in the vaccine group, and was mathematically equivalent to VE \u00d7 the incidence in the placebo group.\n3 Based on a 5-year duration of protection. NNV is not a rate but instead indicates the number of cases prevented \nfor a given number of persons vaccinated. NNV also incorporates the length of the trial or duration of protection\nand is calculated as 1 divided by the product of the IRR and duration of protection (or length of trial) (=1/(IRR \u00d7\nduration).\n\nImmunogenicity studies in adults \u226518 years and the elderly\n\nIn adults, an antibody threshold of serotype-specific pneumococcal polysaccharide IgG binding \nantibody concentration associated with protection has not been defined. For all pivotal clinical trials, a \nserotype-specific opsonophagocytosis assay (OPA) was used as a surrogate to assess potential\nefficacy against invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia. OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs) \nmeasured 1-month after each vaccination were calculated. OPA titres are expressed as the reciprocal \nof the highest serum dilution that reduces survival of the pneumococci by at least 50 %.\n\nPivotal trials for Prevenar 13 were designed to show that functional OPA antibody responses for the \n13 serotypes are non-inferior, and for some serotypes superior, to the 12 serotypes in common with \n\nthe licensed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, \n19F, 23F] one month after vaccine administration. The response to serotype 6A, which is unique to \nPrevenar 13, was assessed by demonstration of a 4-fold increase in the specific OPA titer above pre-\nimmunised levels.\n\nFive clinical studies were conducted in Europe and the USA evaluating the immunogenicity of \nPrevenar 13 in different age groups ranging from 18-95 years of age. Clinical studies with Prevenar 13 \ncurrently provide immunogenicity data in adults aged 18 years and older, including adults aged 65 and \nolder previously vaccinated with one or more doses of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide \nvaccine, 5 years prior to enrollment. Each study included healthy adults and immuno-competent adults \nwith stable underlying conditions known to predispose individuals to pneumococcal infection (i.e., \nchronic cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease including asthma, renal disorders and \ndiabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease including alcoholic liver disease), and adults with risk factors \nsuch as smoking and alcohol abuse.\n\nImmunogenicity and safety of Prevenar 13 has been demonstrated in adults aged 18 years and older \nincluding those previously vaccinated with a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.\n\n\n\n46\n\nAdults not previously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine\nIn a head-to-head, comparative trial conducted in adults aged 60-64 years, subjects received a single \ndose of either Prevenar 13 or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.

Children were vaccinated with Prevenar (3 doses one month apart \nfrom the age of 2 months), 46 of these children also received a 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine at the age of 15-18 months. After primary immunisation, 95.6 % of the \nsubjects had antibody levels of at least 0.35 \u03bcg/ml for all seven serotypes found in Prevenar. \nA significant increase was seen in the concentrations of antibodies against the seven serotypes after \nthe polysaccharide vaccination, suggesting that immunological memory was well established.\n\nHIV infection\n\nChildren and adults not previously vaccinated with a pneumococcal vaccine\nHIV-infected children and adults with CD4 \u2265 200 cells/\u00b5L (mean 717.0 cells/\u03bcL), viral load \n< 50,000 copies/ml (mean 2090.0 copies/ml), free of active AIDS-related illness and not previously \nvaccinated with a pneumococcal vaccine received 3 doses of Prevenar 13. As per general \nrecommendations, a single dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was subsequently \nadministered. Vaccines were administered at 1 month intervals. Immune responses were assessed in \n259-270 evaluable subjects approximately 1 month after each dose of vaccine. After the first dose, \nPrevenar 13 elicited antibody levels, measured by both IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs that were \nstatistically significantly higher when compared to levels prior to vaccination. After the second and \nthird dose of Prevenar 13, immune responses were similar or higher than those after the first dose.\n\nAdults previously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine\nHIV-infected adults \u2265 18 years of age with CD4 \u2265 200 cells/\u00b5L (mean 609.1 cells/\u00b5L) and viral load \n< 50,000 copies/ml (mean 330.6 copies/ml), who were free of active AIDS-related illness and were \npreviously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine administered at least \n6 months prior to enrollment, received 3 doses of Prevenar 13, at enrollment, 6 months, and \n12 months after the first dose of Prevenar 13. Immune responses were assessed in 231-255 evaluable \nsubjects approximately 1 month after each dose of Prevenar 13. After the first dose, Prevenar 13 \nelicited antibody levels measured by both IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs that were statistically \nsignificantly higher when compared to levels prior to vaccination. After the second and third dose of \nPrevenar 13, immune responses were comparable or higher than those after the first dose. In the study \n162 subjects had received one prior dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, \n143 subjects 2 prior doses and 26 subjects more than 2 prior doses of 23-valent polysaccharide \nvaccine. Subjects who received two or more previous doses of 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine showed a similar immune response compared with subjects who received a \nsingle previous dose.\n\nHaematopoietic stem cell transplant\nChildren and adults with an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at \u2265 2 years of age \nwith complete haematologic remission of underlying disease or with very good partial remission in the \ncase of lymphoma and myeloma received three doses of Prevenar 13 with an interval of at least \n1 month between doses. The first dose was administered at 3 to 6 months after HSCT. A fourth \n(booster) dose of Prevenar 13 was administered 6 months after the third dose. As per general \nrecommendations, a single dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was administered \n1 month after the fourth dose of Prevenar 13. Immune responses as measured by IgG GMCs were \nassessed in 168-211 evaluable subjects approximately 1 month after vaccination. Prevenar 13 elicited \nincreased antibody levels after each dose of Prevenar 13. Immune responses after the fourth dose of \nPrevenar 13 were significantly increased for all serotypes compared with after the third dose.\nFunctional antibody titers (OPA titers) were not measured in this study.\n\n\n\n50\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, and reproduction and developmental \ntoxicity.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nActive immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media caused \nby Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children and adolescents from 6 weeks to 17 years of age.\n\nActive immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus \npneumoniae in adults \u2265 18 years of age and the elderly.\n\nSee sections 4.4 and 5.1 for information on protection against specific pneumococcal serotypes.\n\nThe use of Prevenar 13 should be determined on the basis of official recommendations taking into \nconsideration the risk of invasive disease and pneumonia in different age groups, underlying \ncomorbidities as well as the variability of serotype epidemiology in different geographical areas.\n\n\n\n53\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nThe immunisation schedules for Prevenar 13 should be based on official recommendations.\n\nPosology\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\n\nIt is recommended that infants who receive a first dose of Prevenar 13 complete the vaccination \ncourse with Prevenar 13.\n\nInfants aged 6 weeks-6 months\n\nThree-dose primary series\nThe recommended immunisation series consists of four doses, each of 0.5 ml. The primary infant \nseries consists of three doses, with the first dose usually given at 2 months of age and with an interval \nof at least 1 month between doses. The first dose may be given as early as six weeks of age. The \nfourth (booster) dose is recommended between 11 and 15 months of age.\n\nTwo-dose primary series\nAlternatively, when Prevenar 13 is given as part of a routine infant immunisation programme, a series \nconsisting of three doses, each of 0.5 ml, may be given. The first dose may be administered from the \nage of 2 months, with a second dose 2 months later. The third (booster) dose is recommended between \n\n11 and 15 months of age (see section 5.1).\n\nPreterm infants (<37 weeks gestation)\n\nIn preterm infants, the recommended immunisation series consists of four doses, each of 0.5 ml. The \nprimary infant series consists of three doses, with the first dose given at 2 months of age and with an \ninterval of at least 1 month between doses. The first dose may be given as early as six weeks of age.\nThe fourth (booster) dose is recommended between 11 and 15 months of age (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1).\n\nUnvaccinated infants and children \u2265 7 months of age\n\nInfants aged 7-11 months\nTwo doses, each of 0.5 ml, with an interval of at least 1 month between doses. A third dose is \nrecommended in the second year of life.\n\nChildren aged 12-23 months\nTwo doses, each of 0.5 ml, with an interval of at least 2 months between doses (see section 5.1).\n\nChildren and adolescents aged 2-17 years \nOne single dose of 0.5 ml.\n\nPrevenar 13 vaccine schedule for infants and children previously vaccinated with Prevenar (7-valent) \n(Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F)\nPrevenar 13 contains the same 7 serotypes included in Prevenar, using the same carrier protein \nCRM197. \n\nInfants and children who have begun immunisation with Prevenar may switch to Prevenar 13 at any \npoint in the schedule.\n\n\n\n54\n\nYoung children (12-59 months) completely immunised with Prevenar (7-valent)\nYoung children who are considered completely immunised with Prevenar (7-valent) should receive \none dose of 0.5 ml of Prevenar 13 to elicit immune responses to the 6 additional serotypes. This dose \nof Prevenar 13 should be administered at least 8 weeks after the final dose of Prevenar (7-valent) (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nChildren and adolescents 5\u201317 years \nChildren 5 to 17 years of age may receive a single dose of Prevenar 13 if they have been previously \nvaccinated with one or more doses of Prevenar. This dose of Prevenar 13 should be administered at \nleast 8 weeks after the final dose of Prevenar (7-valent) (see section 5.1).\n\nAdults \u2265 18 years of age, and the elderly\n\nOne single dose.\nThe need for revaccination with a subsequent dose of Prevenar 13 has not been established.\n\nRegardless of prior pneumococcal vaccination status, if the use of 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine is considered appropriate, Prevenar 13 should be given first (see sections 4.5 \nand 5.1).\n\nSpecial Populations\n\nIndividuals who have underlying conditions predisposing them to invasive pneumococcal disease \n(such as sickle cell disease or HIV infection) including those previously vaccinated with one or more \ndoses of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine may receive at least one dose of Prevenar 13 \n(see section 5.1).\n\nIn individuals with an haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), the recommended immunisation \nseries consists of four doses of Prevenar 13, each of 0.5 ml. The primary series consists of three doses, \nwith the first dose given at 3 to 6 months after HSCT and with an interval of at least 1 month between \ndoses. A fourth (booster) dose is recommended 6 months after the third dose (see section 5.1).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe vaccine should be given by intramuscular injection. The preferred sites are the anterolateral \naspect of the thigh (vastus lateralis muscle) in infants or the deltoid muscle of the upper arm in \nchildren and adults. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to diphtheria \ntoxoid.\n\nAs with other vaccines, the administration of Prevenar 13 should be postponed in subjects suffering \nfrom acute, severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should \nnot result in the deferral of vaccination.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPrevenar 13 must not be administered intravascularly.\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.\n\n\n\n55\n\nThis vaccine should not be given as an intramuscular injection to individuals with thrombocytopaenia \nor any coagulation disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection, but may be given \nsubcutaneously if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risks (see section 5.1).\n\nPrevenar 13 will only protect against Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes included in the vaccine, \nand will not protect against other microorganisms that cause invasive disease, pneumonia, or otitis \nmedia. As with any vaccine, Prevenar 13 may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine from \npneumococcal disease. For the most recent epidemiological information in your country you should \nconsult with the relevant national organisation.\n\nIndividuals with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due to the use of immuno-suppressive \ntherapy, a genetic defect, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or other causes, may have \nreduced antibody response to active immunisation.\n\nSafety and immunogenicity data are available for a limited number of individuals with sickle cell \ndisease, HIV infection, or with an haematopoietic stem cell transplant (see section 5.1). Safety and \nimmunogenicity data for Prevenar 13 are not available for individuals in other specific \nimmuno-compromised groups (e.g., malignancy or nephrotic syndrome) and vaccination should be \nconsidered on an individual basis.\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\n\nIn clinical studies, Prevenar 13 elicited an immune response to all thirteen serotypes included in the \nvaccine. The immune response for serotype 3 following the booster dose was not increased above the \nlevels seen after the infant vaccination series; the clinical relevance of this observation regarding the \ninduction of serotype 3 immune memory is unknown (see section 5.1).\n\nThe proportions of functional antibody responders (OPA titres \u2265 1:8) to serotypes 1, 3 and 5 were \nhigh. However, the OPA geometric mean titres were lower than those against each of the remaining \nadditional vaccine serotypes; the clinical relevance of this observation for protective efficacy is \nunknown (see section 5.1). \n\nLimited data have demonstrated that Prevenar 7-valent (three-dose primary series) induces an \nacceptable immune response in infants with sickle cell disease with a safety profile similar to that \nobserved in non-high-risk groups (see section 5.1). \n\nChildren younger than 2 years old should receive the appropriate-for-age Prevenar 13 vaccination \nseries (see section 4.2). The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine does not replace the use of \n23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines in children \u2265 2 years of age with conditions (such as \nsickle cell disease, asplenia, HIV infection, chronic illness, or those who are immuno-compromised) \nplacing them at higher risk for invasive disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Whenever \nrecommended, children at risk who are \u2265 24 months of age and already primed with Prevenar 13 \nshould receive 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The interval between the 13-valent \npneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar 13) and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide \nvaccine should not be less than 8 weeks. There are no data available to indicate whether the \nadministration of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to unprimed children or to children \nprimed with Prevenar 13 might result in hyporesponsiveness to further doses of Prevenar 13.\n\nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72 h should be considered \nwhen administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born \uf0a3 28 weeks of \ngestation), and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit \nof vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.\n\n\n\n56\n\nFor vaccine serotypes, protection against otitis media is expected to be lower than protection against \ninvasive disease. As otitis media is caused by many organisms other than pneumococcal serotypes \nrepresented in the vaccine, protection against all otitis media is expected to be low (see section 5.1).\n\nWhen Prevenar 13 is administered concomitantly with Infanrix hexa (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib), the rates \nof febrile reactions are similar to those seen with concomitant administration of Prevenar (7-valent) \nand Infanrix hexa (see section 4.8). Increased reporting rates of convulsions (with or without fever) \nand hypotonic hyporesponsive episode (HHE) were observed with concomitant administration of \nPrevenar 13 and Infanrix hexa (see section 4.8).\n\nAntipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local treatment guidelines for children with \nseizure disorders or with a prior history of febrile seizures and for all children receiving Prevenar 13 \nsimultaneously with vaccines containing whole cell pertussis.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\n\nPrevenar 13 can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccine antigens, either as \nmonovalent or combination vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, acellular or whole cell pertussis, \nHaemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated poliomyelitis, hepatitis B (see section 4.4 for guidance on \nInfanrix hexa), meningococcal serogroup C, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and rotavirus vaccine. \n\nPrevenar 13 can also be given concomitantly between 12-23 months with the tetanus toxoid \nconjugated meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups A, C, W and Y vaccine to children who have \nbeen adequately primed with Prevenar 13 (as per local recommendations).\n\nData from a postmarketing clinical study evaluating the impact of prophylactic use of antipyretics \n(ibuprofen and paracetamol) on the immune response to Prevenar 13 suggest that administration of \nparacetamol concomitantly or within the same day of vaccination may reduce the immune response to \nPrevenar 13 after the infant series. Responses to the booster dose administered at 12 months were \nunaffected. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown.\n\nChildren and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age\n\nNo data are currently available regarding concomitant use with other vaccines. \n\nAdults 18 to 49 years of age\n\nNo data are available regarding concomitant use with other vaccines. \n\nAdults aged 50 years and older\n\nPrevenar 13 may be administered concomitantly with the seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza \nvaccine (TIV).\n\nIn two studies conducted in adults aged 50-59 and 65 years and older, it was demonstrated that \nPrevenar 13 may be given concomitantly with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). The \nresponses to all three TIV antigens were comparable when TIV was given alone or concomitantly \nwith Prevenar 13.\n\nWhen Prevenar 13 was given concomitantly with TIV, the immune responses to Prevenar 13 were \nlower compared to when Prevenar 13 was given alone, however, there was no long-term impact on \ncirculating antibody levels.\n\n\n\n57\n\nIn a third study in adults aged 50-93 years, it was demonstrated that Prevenar 13 may be given \nconcomitantly with the seasonal quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV). The immune \nresponses to all four QIV strains were noninferior when Prevenar 13 was given concomitantly with \nQIV compared to when QIV was given alone.\n\nThe immune responses to Prevenar 13 were noninferior when Prevenar 13 was given concomitantly \nwith QIV compared to when Prevenar 13 was given alone. As with concomitant administration with \ntrivalent vaccines, immune responses to some pneumococcal serotypes were lower when both \nvaccines were given concomitantly.\n\nConcomitant use with other vaccines has not been investigated.\n\nDifferent injectable vaccines should always be given at different vaccination sites.\n\nConcomitant administration of Prevenar 13 and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine has \nnot been studied. In clinical studies when Prevenar 13 was given 1 year after 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine the immune responses were lower for all serotypes compared to when \nPrevenar 13 was given to subjects not previously immunised with 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine. The clinical significance of this is unknown. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data from the use of pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine in pregnant women. \nTherefore the use of Prevenar 13 should be avoided during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine is excreted in human milk.\n\nFertility\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPrevenar 13 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of \nthe effects mentioned under section 4.8 \u201cUndesirable effects\u201d may temporarily affect the ability to \ndrive or use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nAnalysis of postmarketing reporting rates suggests a potential increased risk of convulsions, with or \nwithout fever, and HHE when comparing groups which reported use of Prevenar 13 with \nInfanrix hexa to those which reported use of Prevenar 13 alone.\n\nAdverse reactions reported in clinical studies or from the postmarketing experience for all age groups \nare listed in this section per system organ class, in decreasing order of frequency and seriousness. The \nfrequency is defined as follows: very common (\uf0b3 1/10), common (\uf0b3 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(\uf0b3 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be \nestimated from available data).\n\n\n\n58\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\nThe safety of the vaccine was assessed in controlled clinical studies where 14,267 doses were given to \n4,429 healthy infants from 6 weeks of age at first vaccination and 11-16 months of age at booster \ndose. In all infant studies, Prevenar 13 was co-administered with routine paediatric vaccines (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nSafety in 354 previously unvaccinated children (7 months to 5 years of age) was also assessed.\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in children 6 weeks to 5 years of age were \nvaccination-site reactions, fever, irritability, decreased appetite, and increased and/or decreased sleep.\n\nIn a clinical study in infants vaccinated at 2, 3, and 4 months of age, fever \u2265 38\u00b0C was reported at \nhigher rates among infants who received Prevenar (7-valent) concomitantly with Infanrix hexa (28.3% \nto 42.3%) than in infants receiving Infanrix hexa alone (15.6% to 23.1%). After a booster dose at 12 \nto 15 months of age, fever \u2265 38\u00b0C was reported in 50.0% of infants who received Prevenar (7-valent) \nand Infanrix hexa at the same time as compared to 33.6% of infants receiving Infanrix hexa alone. \nThese reactions were mostly moderate (less than or equal to 39\u00b0C) and transient.\n\nAn increase in vaccination-site reactions was reported in children older than 12 months compared to \nrates observed in infants during the primary series with Prevenar 13.\n\nAdverse reactions from clinical studies\nIn clinical studies, the safety profile of Prevenar 13 was similar to Prevenar. The following \nfrequencies are based on adverse reactions assessed in Prevenar 13 clinical studies:\n\nImmune system disorders:\nRare: Hypersensitivity reaction including face oedema, dyspnoea, bronchospasm\n\nNervous system disorders:\nUncommon: Convulsions (including febrile convulsions)\nRare: Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode\n\nGastrointestinal disorders:\nVery common: Decreased appetite\nCommon: Vomiting; diarrhoea\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nCommon: Rash\nUncommon: Urticaria or urticaria-like rash\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVery common: Pyrexia; irritability; any vaccination-site erythema, induration/swelling or \n\npain/tenderness; somnolence; poor quality sleep\nVaccination-site erythema or induration/swelling 2.5 cm\u20137.0 cm (after the \nbooster dose and in older children [age 2 to 5 years])\n\nCommon: Pyrexia > 39\u00b0C; vaccination-site movement impairment (due to pain); \nvaccination-site erythema or induration/swelling 2.5 cm\u20137.0 cm (after infant \nseries)\n\nUncommon: Vaccination-site erythema, induration/swelling > 7.0 cm; crying\n\nAdditional information in special populations:\nApnoea in very premature infants (\uf0a3 28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n59\n\nChildren and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years of age \nSafety was evaluated in 592 children (294 children aged 5 to 10 years previously immunised with at \nleast one dose of Prevenar and 298 children aged 10 to 17 years who had not received a pneumococcal \nvaccine).\n\nThe most common adverse events in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age were:\n\nNervous system disorders:\nCommon: Headaches\n\nGastrointestinal disorders:\nVery common: Decreased appetite\nCommon: Vomiting; diarrhoea\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nCommon: Rash; urticaria or urticaria-like rash\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVery common: Irritability; any vaccination-site erythema; induration/swelling or \n\npain/tenderness; somnolence; poor quality sleep; \nvaccination-site tenderness (including impaired movement)\n\nCommon: Pyrexia\n\nOther adverse events previously observed in infants and children 6 weeks to 5 years of age may also \nbe applicable to this age group but were not seen in this study possibly due to the small sample size.\n\nAdditional information in special populations\nChildren and adolescents with sickle cell disease, HIV infection, or an haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant have similar frequencies of adverse reactions, except that headaches, vomiting, diarrhoea, \npyrexia, fatigue, arthralgia, and myalgia were very common.\n\nAdults \u2265 18 years and elderly\nSafety was assessed in 7 clinical studies including 91,593 adults ranging in age from 18 to 101 years. \nPrevenar 13 was administered to 48,806 adults; 2,616 (5.4%) aged 50 to 64 years, and 45,291 (92.8%) \naged 65 years and older. One of the 7 studies included a group of adults (n=899) ranging from 18 to \n49 years who received Prevenar 13 and who were not previously vaccinated with 23-valent \npneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Of the Prevenar 13 recipients 1,916 adults were previously \nvaccinated with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at least 3 years prior to study \nvaccination, and 46,890 were 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine unvaccinated.\n\nA trend to lower frequency of adverse reactions was associated with greater age; adults > 65 years of \nage (regardless of prior pneumococcal vaccination status) reported fewer adverse reactions than \nyounger adults, with adverse reactions generally most common in the youngest adults, 18 to 29 years \nof age.\n\nOverall, the frequency categories were similar for all age groups, with the exception of vomiting \nwhich was very common (\uf0b3 1/10) in adults aged 18 to 49 years and common (\uf0b3 1/100 to < 1/10) in all \nother age groups, and pyrexia was very common in adults aged 18 to 29 years and common in all other \nage groups. Severe vaccination-site pain/tenderness and severe limitation of arm movement was very \ncommon in adults 18 to 39 years and common in all other age groups.\n\nAdverse reactions from clinical studies\nLocal reactions and systemic events were solicited daily after each vaccination for 14 days in 6 studies\nand 7 days in the remaining study. The following frequencies are based on adverse reactions assessed \nin Prevenar 13 clinical studies in adults:\n\n\n\n60\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders:\nVery common: Decreased appetite\n\nNervous system disorders:\nVery common: Headaches\n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common: Diarrhoea; vomiting (in adults aged 18 to 49 years)\n\nCommon: Vomiting (in adults aged 50 years and over)\n\nUncommon: Nausea\n\nImmune system disorders:\nUncommon: Hypersensitivity reaction including face oedema, dyspnoea, bronchospasm\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nVery common: Rash\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVery common: Chills; fatigue; vaccination-site erythema; vaccination-site \n\ninduration/swelling; vaccination-site pain/tenderness (severe vaccination-site \npain/tenderness very common in adults aged 18 to 39 years); limitation of arm \nmovement (severe limitation of arm movements very common in adults aged \n18 to 39 years)\n\nCommon: Pyrexia (very common in adults aged 18 to 29 years)\n\nUncommon: Lymphadenopathy localized to the region of the vaccination-site\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:\nVery common: Arthralgia; myalgia\n\nOverall, no significant differences in frequencies of adverse reactions were seen when Prevenar 13 \nwas given to adults previously vaccinated with the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.\n\nAdditional information in special populations\nAdults with HIV infection have similar frequencies of adverse reactions, except that pyrexia and \nvomiting were very common and nausea common. \n\nAdults with an haematopoietic stem cell transplant have similar frequencies of adverse reactions, \nexcept that pyrexia and vomiting were very common.\n\nHigher frequency in some solicited systemic reactions was observed when Prevenar 13 was \nadministered concomitantly with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) compared to TIV given \nalone (headache, chills, rash, decreased appetite, arthralgia, and myalgia) or Prevenar 13 given alone \n(headache, fatigue, chills, decreased appetite, and arthralgia). \n\nAdverse reactions from Prevenar 13 postmarketing experience\nThe following are considered adverse drug reactions for Prevenar 13; because these reactions were \nderived from spontaneous reports, the frequencies could not be determined and are thus considered as \nnot known.\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders:\nLymphadenopathy (localised to the region of the vaccination-site)\n\n\n\n61\n\nImmune system disorders:\nAnaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction including shock; angioedema\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nErythema multiforme\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVaccination-site urticaria; vaccination-site dermatitis; vaccination-site \npruritus; flushing\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn infants and children there have been reports of overdose with Prevenar 13 defined as subsequent \ndoses administered closer than recommended to the previous dose. In general, adverse events reported \nwith overdose are consistent with those that have been reported with doses given in the recommended \npaediatric schedules of Prevenar 13.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines; ATC code: J07AL02\n\nPrevenar 13 contains the 7 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides that are in Prevenar (4, 6B, 9V, \n14, 18C, 19F, 23F) plus 6 additional polysaccharides (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, 19A) all conjugated to CRM197\n\ncarrier protein. \n\nBurden of disease\n\nInfants and children aged 6 weeks to 5 years\n\nBased on serotype surveillance in Europe performed before the introduction of Prevenar, Prevenar 13 \nis estimated to cover 73-100% (depending on the country) of serotypes causing invasive \npneumococcal disease (IPD) in children less than 5 years of age. In this age group, serotypes 1, 3, 5, \n6A, 7F, and 19A account for 15.6% to 59.7% of invasive disease, depending on the country, the time\nperiod studied, and the use of Prevenar.\n\nAcute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood disease with different aetiologies. Bacteria can be \nresponsible for 60-70% of clinical episodes of AOM. S. pneumoniae is one of the most common \ncauses of bacterial AOM worldwide.\n\nPrevenar 13 is estimated to cover over 90% of serotypes causing antimicrobial-resistant IPD. \n\nChildren and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years\n\nIn children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years, the incidence of pneumococcal disease is low, \nhowever, there is an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in those with underlying comorbidities.\n\n\n\n62\n\nAdults \u2265 18 years and the elderly\n\nPneumonia is the most common clinical presentation of pneumococcal disease in adults.\n\nThe reported incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and IPD in Europe varies by \ncountry, increases with age from 50 years and is highest in individuals aged \u2265 65 years. S. pneumoniae\nis the most frequent cause of CAP, and is estimated to be responsible for approximately 30% of all \nCAP cases requiring hospitalisation in adults in developed countries.\n\nBacteraemic pneumonia (approximately 80% of IPD in adults), bacteraemia without a focus, and \nmeningitis are the most common manifestations of IPD in adults. Based on surveillance data following \nthe introduction of Prevenar but before the introduction of Prevenar 13 in childhood vaccination \nprogrammes, the pneumococcal serotypes in Prevenar 13 may be responsible for at least 50 \u2013 76% \n(depending on country) of IPD in adults.\n\nThe risk for CAP and IPD in adults also increases with chronic underlying medical conditions, \nspecifically, anatomical or functional asplenia, diabetes mellitus, asthma, chronic cardiovascular, \npulmonary, kidney or liver disease, and it is highest in those who are immune-suppressed such as \nthose with malignant haematological diseases or HIV infection. \n\nPrevenar 13 immunogenicity clinical studies in infants, children and adolescents\n\nThe protective efficacy of Prevenar 13 against IPD has not been studied. As recommended by the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) the assessment of potential efficacy against IPD in infants and \nyoung children has been based on a comparison of immune responses to the seven common serotypes \nshared between Prevenar 13 and Prevenar, for which protective efficacy has been proven (for \nPrevenar (7-valent) efficacy in infants and children, see below). Immune responses to the additional \n6 serotypes were also measured.\n\nStudy of Prevenar 13 containing the preservative 2-phenoxyethanol (2-PE):\n\nSafety and immunogenicity of Prevenar 13 containing the preservative 2-PE (presented in a multidose \ncontainer) given to healthy infants at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age were compared to those of \nPrevenar 13 without added preservative (250 infants per group).\n\nPneumococcal immune responses were compared using non-inferiority criteria, including the \npercentage of subjects with serum anti-polysaccharide serotype-specific IgG concentration \n\u22650.35 \u03bcg/ml and the comparison of IgG GMCs one month after the infant series. In addition, OPA \nGMTs between subjects receiving Prevenar 13 with or without 2-PE were compared.\n\nNon-inferiority for the proportion of subjects achieving an IgG concentration \uf0b30.35 \u03bcg/ml was \ndemonstrated for all 13 serotypes (lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval (CI) for the \ndifference in percentage of responders at 0.35 \u00b5g/ml between groups was >-10%). Additionally, all \n13 serotypes met the pre-defined non-inferiority criterion for IgG GMCs (lower bound of the 97.5% \nCI of GMC ratio [GMR] was greater than 0.5).\n\nCorrespondingly, OPA GMTs were similar in both groups, except for serotype 3, which was lower, \nand serotype 18C, which was higher, in the group that received Prevenar 13 with 2-PE. \n\nStudies of Prevenar 13 not containing the preservative 2-PE\n\nImmune responses following a three-dose primary infant series\n\nClinical studies have been conducted in a number of European countries and the US using a range of \nvaccination schedules, including two randomised non-inferiority studies (Germany using a 2, 3, \n4 month primary series [006] and US using a 2, 4, 6 month primary series [004]). In these two studies \n\n\n\n63\n\npneumococcal immune responses were compared using a set of non-inferiority criteria including the \npercentage of subjects with serum anti-polysaccharide serotype-specific IgG \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml one month \nafter the primary series and the comparison of IgG geometric mean concentrations (ELISA GMCs); in \naddition, functional antibody titres (OPA) between subjects receiving Prevenar 13 and Prevenar were \ncompared. For the six additional serotypes, these values were compared with the lowest response \namong all of the seven common serotypes in the Prevenar recipients.\n\nThe non-inferiority immune response comparisons for study 006, based on the proportion of infants \nachieving anti-polysaccharide IgG concentrations \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml, are shown in Table 1. Results for \nstudy 004 were similar. Prevenar 13 non-inferiority (lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference in \npercentage of responders at 0.35 \u00b5g/ml between groups was >-10%) was demonstrated for all \n7 common serotypes, except for serotype 6B in study 006 and serotypes 6B and 9V in study 004, \nwhich missed by a small margin. All seven common serotypes met pre-defined non-inferiority criteria \nfor IgG ELISA GMCs. Prevenar 13 elicited comparable, although slightly lower, antibody levels than \nPrevenar for the 7 common serotypes. The clinical relevance of these differences is not known.\n\nNon-inferiority was met for the 6 additional serotypes based on the proportion of infants achieving \nantibody concentrations \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml and comparison of IgG ELISA GMCs in study 006 and was met \nfor 5 out of the 6 serotypes, with the exception of serotype 3 for study 004. For serotype 3, the \npercentages of Prevenar 13 recipients with serum IgG \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml were 98.2% (study 006) and \n63.5% (study 004).\n\nTable 1: Comparison of the proportion of subjects achieving a pneumococcal anti-polysaccharide IgG \nantibody concentration \u2265 0.35 \u03bcg/ml after dose 3 of the infant series \u2013 study 006\n\nSerotypes\n\nPrevenar 13 \n%\n\n(N=282-285)\n\n7-valent Prevenar\n%\n\n(N=277-279)\nDifference\n(95 % CI)\n\n7-valent Prevenar serotypes\n4 98.2 98.2 0.0 (-2.5, 2.6)\n\n6B 77.5 87.1 -9.6 (-16.0, -3.3)\n9V 98.6 96.4 2.2 (-0.4, 5.2)\n14 98.9 97.5 1.5 (-0.9, 4.1)\n\n18C 97.2 98.6 -1.4 (-4.2, 1.2)\n19F 95.8 96.0 -0.3 (-3.8, 3.3)\n23F 88.7 89.5 -0.8 (-6.0, 4.5)\n\nAdditional serotypes in Prevenar 13\n1 96.1 87.1* 9.1 (4.5, 13.9)\n3 98.2 87.1 11.2 (7.0, 15.8)\n5 93.0 87.1 5.9 (0.8, 11.1)\n\n6A 91.9 87.1 4.8 (-0.3, 10.1)\n7F 98.6 87.1 11.5 (7.4, 16.1)\n\n19A 99.3 87.1 12.2 (8.3, 16.8)\n* The serotype in Prevenar with the lowest percent response rate was 6B in study 006 (87.1 %).\n\nPrevenar 13 elicited functional antibodies to all 13 vaccine serotypes in studies 004 and 006. For the \n7 common serotypes there were no differences between groups in the proportion of subjects with OPA \ntitres \u2265 1:8. For each of the seven common serotypes, > 96% and > 90% of the Prevenar 13 recipients \nreached an OPA titre \u2265 1:8 one month after the primary series in studies 006 and 004, respectively.\n\nFor each of the 6 additional serotypes, Prevenar 13 elicited OPA titres \u2265 1:8 in 91.4% to 100% of \nvaccinees one month after the primary series in studies 004/006. The functional antibody (OPA) \ngeometric mean titres for serotypes 1, 3 and 5 were lower than the titres for each of the other \nadditional serotypes; the clinical relevance of this observation for protective efficacy is unknown. \n\nImmune responses following a two-dose primary infant series\n\n\n\n64\n\nThe immunogenicity after two doses in infants has been documented in four studies. The proportion \nof infants achieving a pneumococcal anti-capsular polysaccharide IgG concentration \u2265 0.35 \uf06dg/ml one \nmonth after the second dose ranged from 79.6% to 98.5% across 11 of the 13 vaccine serotypes. \nSmaller proportions of infants achieved this antibody concentration threshold for serotype 6B (27.9% \nto 57.3%) and 23F (55.8% to 68.1%) for all studies using a 2, 4 month regimen, compared to 58.4% \nfor serotype 6B and 68.6% for 23F for a study using a 3, 5 month regimen. After the booster dose, all \nvaccine serotypes including 6B and 23F had immune responses consistent with adequate priming with \na two-dose primary series. In a UK study, the functional antibody (OPA) responses were comparable \nfor all serotypes including 6B and 23F in the Prevenar and Prevenar 13 arms after the primary series \nat two and four months of age and after the booster dose at 12 months of age. For Prevenar 13 \nrecipients, the proportion of responders with an OPA titre \uf0b3 1:8 was at least 87% following the infant \nseries, and at least 93% following the booster dose. The OPA geometric mean titres for serotypes 1, 3 \nand 5 were lower than the titres for each of the other additional serotypes; the clinical relevance of \nthis observation is unknown.\n\nBooster responses following two-dose and three-dose primary infant series\n\nFollowing the booster dose, antibody concentrations increased from the pre-booster level for all \n13 serotypes. Post-booster antibody concentrations were higher for 12 serotypes than those achieved \nafter the infant primary series. These observations are consistent with adequate priming (the induction \nof immunologic memory). The immune response for serotype 3 following the booster dose was not \nincreased above the levels seen after the infant vaccination series; the clinical relevance of this \nobservation regarding the induction of serotype 3 immune memory is unknown.\n\nAntibody responses to booster doses following two-dose or three-dose infant primary series were \ncomparable for all 13 vaccine serotypes.\n\nFor children aged from 7 months to 5 years, age appropriate catch-up immunisation schedules (as \ndescribed in section 4.2) result in levels of anti-capsular polysaccharide IgG antibody responses to \neach of the 13 serotypes that are at least comparable to those of a three-dose primary series in infants.\n\nAntibody persistence and immunological memory were evaluated in a study in healthy children who \nreceived a single dose of Prevenar 13 at least 2 years after they had been previously immunised with \neither 4 doses of Prevenar, a 3-dose infant series of Prevenar followed by Prevenar 13 at 12 months of \nage, or 4 doses of Prevenar 13. \n\nThe single dose of Prevenar 13, in children approximately 3.4 years of age regardless of previous \nvaccination history with Prevenar or Prevenar 13, induced a robust antibody response for both the \n7 common serotypes and the 6 additional serotypes in Prevenar 13.\n\nSince the introduction of 7-valent Prevenar in 2000, pneumococcal disease surveillance data have not \nshown that the immunity elicited by Prevenar in infancy has waned over time. \n\nPreterm Infants\n\nSafety and immunogenicity of Prevenar 13 given at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months was assessed in \napproximately 100 prematurely born infants (mean Estimated Gestational Age [EGA], 31 weeks; \nrange, 26 to 36 weeks) and compared with approximately 100 infants born at term (mean EGA, \n39 weeks; range, 37 to 42 weeks).\n\nImmune responses in preterm and term infants were compared using the proportion of subjects \nachieving a pneumococcal polysaccharide IgG binding antibody concentration \u22650.35 \u03bcg/ml 1 month \nafter the infant series, the approach used for immunogenicity comparisons of Prevenar 13 to Prevenar \nbased on WHO guidelines.\n\n\n\n65\n\nMore than 85% achieved a pneumococcal polysaccharide IgG binding antibody concentration \n\u22650.35 \u00b5g/ml 1 month after the infant series, except for serotypes 5 (71.7%), 6A (82.7%), and 6B \n(72.7%) in the preterm group. For these 3 serotypes, the proportion of responders among preterm \ninfants was significantly lower than among term infants. Approximately one month after the toddler \ndose, the proportion of subjects in each group achieving this same antibody concentration threshold \nwas >97%, except for serotype 3 (71% in preterm infants and 79% in term infants). It is unknown \nwhether immunological memory to all serotypes is induced in pre-term infants. In general, \nserotype-specific IgG GMCs were lower for preterm infants than term infants.\n\nAfter the infant series, OPA GMTs were similar in preterm infants compared to term infants except \nfor serotype 5, which was lower in preterm infants. OPA GMTs after the toddler dose relative to those \nafter the infant series were similar or lower for 4 serotypes (4, 14, 18C, and 19F) and were statistically \nsignificantly higher for 6 of 13 serotypes (1, 3, 5, 7F, 9V, and 19A) in preterm infants compared to 10 \nof 13 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, 18C, 19A, and 23F) in term infants.\n\nChildren (12-59 months) completely immunised with Prevenar (7-valent)\n\nFollowing administration of a single dose of Prevenar 13 to children (12-59 months) who are \nconsidered completely immunised with Prevenar (7-valent) (either 2 or 3 dose primary series plus \nbooster), the proportion achieving serum IgG levels \u22650.35 \u00b5g/ml and OPA titres \u22651:8 was at least \n90%. However, 3 (serotypes 1, 5 and 6A) of the 6 additional serotypes showed lower IgG GMC and \nOPA GMT when compared with children who had received at least one previous vaccination with \n\nPrevenar 13. The clinical relevance of the lower GMCs and GMTs is currently unknown.\n\nUnvaccinated Children (12-23 months)\n\nStudies in unvaccinated children (12 -23 months) with Prevenar (7-valent) demonstrated that 2 doses \nwere required to achieve serum IgG concentrations for 6B and 23F similar to those induced by a \n3-dose infant series.\n\nChildren and Adolescents 5 to 17 years of age\n\nIn an open-label study in 592 healthy children and adolescents including those with asthma (17.4%) \nwho may be predisposed to pneumococcal infection, Prevenar 13 elicited immune responses to all \n13 serotypes. A single dose of Prevenar 13 was given to children 5 to 10 years of age previously \nvaccinated with at least 1 dose of Prevenar, and children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age who \nhad never received a pneumococcal vaccine.\n\nIn both the children 5 to 10 years of age and children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years, the immune\nresponse to Prevenar 13 was non inferior to Prevenar for the 7 common serotypes and to Prevenar 13 \nfor the 6 additional serotypes compared to the immune response after the fourth dose in infants \nvaccinated at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age as measured by serum IgG.\n\nIn children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years of age OPA GMTs 1 month after vaccination were \nnoninferior to OPA GMTs in the 5 to 10 year old age group for 12 of the 13 serotypes (except \nserotype 3). \n\nImmune responses after subcutaneous administration\n\nSubcutaneous administration of Prevenar 13 was evaluated in a non-comparative study in 185 healthy \nJapanese infants and children who received 4 doses at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age. The study \ndemonstrated that safety and immunogenicity were generally comparable with observations made in \nstudies of intramuscular administration.\n\n\n\n66\n\nPrevenar 13 Effectiveness\n\nInvasive Pneumococcal Disease\nData published by Public Health England showed that, four years after the introduction of Prevenar as \na two dose primary infant series with booster dose in the second year of life and with a 94% vaccine \nuptake, there was a 98% (95% CI 95; 99) reduction in disease caused by the 7 vaccine serotypes in \nEngland and Wales. Subsequently, four years following the switch to Prevenar 13, the additional\nreduction in incidence of IPD due to the 7 serotypes in Prevenar ranged from 76% in children less \nthan 2 years of age to 91% in children 5-14 years of age. The serotype specific reductions for each of \nthe 5 additional serotypes in Prevenar 13 (no cases of serotype 5 IPD were observed) by age group are \nshown in Table 2 and ranged from 68% (serotype 3) to 100% (serotype 6A) for children less than \n5 years of age. Significant incidence reductions were also observed in older age groups who had not \nbeen vaccinated with Prevenar 13 (indirect effect).\n\nTable 2: Serotype specific number of cases and incidence reductions of IPD in 2013/14 compared to \n2008/09-2009/10 (2008/10) by age in England and Wales\n\n<5 years of age 5 to 64 years of age \u226565 years of age\n\n2008-\n10\u00a7\n\n2013/\n14\u00a7\n\n% Incidence \nreduction \n(95% CI*)\n\n2008-\n10\u00a7\n\n2013/\n14\u00a7\n\n% \nIncidence \nreduction \n(95% CI*)\n\n2008-\n10\u00a7\n\n2013/\n14\u00a7\n\n% Incidence \nreduction \n(95% CI*)\n\nAdditional serotypes covered by Prevenar 13\n\n1 59 (54) 5 (5) 91%\n\n(98%; \n68%)**\n\n458 \n(382)\n\n77 \n(71)\n\n83%\n\n(88%; \n74%)**\n\n102 \n(89)\n\n13 \n(13)\n\n87%\n\n(94%; \n72%)**\n\n3 26 (24) 8 (8) 68%\n\n(89%; 6%)\n\n178 \n(148)\n\n73 \n(68)\n\n59%\n\n(72%; \n38%)**\n\n256 \n(224)\n\n143 \n(146)\n\n44%\n\n(57%; \n27%)**\n\n6A 10 (9) 0 (0) 100%\n\n(100%; \n62%)**\n\n53 (44) 5 (5) 90%\n\n(97%; \n56%)**\n\n94 (82) 5 (5) 95%\n\n(99%; \n81%)**\n\n7F 90 (82) 8 (8) 91%\n\n(97%; \n74%)**\n\n430 \n(361)\n\n160\n(148)\n\n63%\n\n(71%; \n50%)**\n\n173 \n(152)\n\n75 \n(77)\n\n56%\n\n(70%; \n37%)**\n\n19A 85 (77) 7 (7) 91%\n\n(97%; \n75%)**\n\n225 \n(191)\n\n104 \n(97)\n\n54%\n\n(65%; \n32%)**\n\n279 \n(246)\n\n97 \n(99)\n\n65%\n\n(75%; \n53%)**\n\n\u00a7 Corrected for proportion of samples serotyped, missing age, denominator compared with 2009/10, and \nfor the trend in total invasive pneumococcal disease up to 2009/10 (after which no trend correction was \napplied).\n\n* 95% CI inflated from a Poisson interval based on over-dispersion of 2.1 seen from modelling of \n2000-06 pre-Prevenar all IPD data.\n\n** p<0.005 to cover 6A where p=0.002\n\n\n\n67\n\nOtitis media (OM)\nIn a published study performed in Israel, using a 2-dose primary series plus booster dose in the second \nyear of life, the impact of Prevenar 13 on OM was documented in a population-based \nactive-surveillance system with tympanocentesis culturing of middle ear fluid in Israeli children less \nthan 2 years of age with OM. \n\nFollowing the introduction of Prevenar and subsequently Prevenar 13 there was a decline in incidence \nfrom 2.1 to 0.1 cases per 1000 children (95%) for the Prevenar serotypes plus serotype 6A and a \ndecline in incidence from 0.9 to 0.1 cases per 1000 children (89%) for the additional serotypes 1, 3, 5, \n7F, and 19A in Prevenar 13. The annual overall pneumococcal incidence of OM declined from 9.6 to \n2.1 cases per 1000 children (78%) between July 2004 (prior to the introduction of Prevenar) and June \n2013 (post Prevenar 13 introduction).\n\nPneumonia\nIn a multicenter observational study in France comparing the periods before and after the switch from \nPrevenar to Prevenar 13, there was 16% (2060 to 1725 cases) reduction in all community acquired \npneumonia (CAP) cases in emergency departments in children 1 month to 15 years of age. Reductions \nwere 53% (167 to 79 cases) (p<0.001) for CAP cases with pleural effusion and 63% (64 to 24 cases) \n(p<0.001) for microbiologically confirmed pneumococcal CAP cases. In the second year after the \nintroduction of Prevenar 13 the total number of CAP cases due to the 6 additional vaccine serotypes in \nPrevenar 13 was reduced from 27 to 7 isolates (74%).\n\nThe decrease in all cause pneumonia cases was most pronounced in the younger vaccinated age \ngroups with a decrease of 31.8% (757 to 516 cases) and 16.6% (833 to 695 cases) in the age groups \n<2 years and 2 to 5 years, respectively. The incidence in older, predominantly non-vaccinated children \n(>5 years) did not change over the duration of the study.\n\nIn an ongoing surveillance system (2004 to 2013) to document the impact of Prevenar and \nsubsequently Prevenar 13 on CAP in children less than 5 years in Southern Israel using a 2 dose \nprimary series with a booster dose in the second year of life, there was a reduction of 68% \n(95% CI 73; 61) in outpatient visits and 32% (95% CI 39; 22) in hospitalizations for alveolar CAP \nfollowing the introduction of Prevenar 13 when compared to the period before the introduction of \nPrevenar.\n\nEffect on nasopharyngeal carriage \n\nIn a surveillance study in France in children presenting with acute otitis media, changes in \nnasopharyngeal (NP) carriage of pneumococcal serotypes were evaluated following the introduction \nof Prevenar (7-valent) and subsequently Prevenar 13. Prevenar 13 significantly reduced NP carriage of \nthe 6 additional serotypes (and serotype 6C) combined and individual serotypes 6C, 7F, 19A when \ncompared with Prevenar. A reduction in carriage was also seen for serotype 3 (2.5% vs 1.1%; p=0.1). \nThere was no carriage of serotypes 1 and 5 observed.\n\nThe effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination on nasopharyngeal carriage was studied in a \nrandomised double-blind study in which infants received either Prevenar 13 or Prevenar (7-valent) at \n2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age in Israel. Prevenar 13 significantly reduced newly identified NP \nacquisition of the 6 additional serotypes (and serotype 6C) combined and of individual serotypes 1, \n6A, 6C, 7F, 19A when compared with Prevenar. There was no reduction seen in serotype 3 and for \nserotype 5 the colonization was too infrequent to assess impact. For 6 of the remaining 7 common \nserotypes, similar rates of NP acquisition were observed in both vaccine groups; for serotype 19F a \nsignificant reduction was observed.\n\nIn this study, reductions of S. pneumoniae serotypes 19A, 19F, and 6A not susceptible to a number of \nantibiotics were documented. The reductions ranged between 34% and 62% depending on serotype \nand antibiotic.\n\n\n\n68\n\nPrevenar (7-valent vaccine) protective efficacy in infants and children\n\nThe efficacy of 7-valent Prevenar was evaluated in two major studies \u2013 the Northern California Kaiser \nPermanente (NCKP) study and the Finnish Otitis Media (FinOM) study. Both studies were \nrandomised, double-blind, active-control studies in which infants were randomised to receive either \nPrevenar or control vaccine (NCKP, meningococcal serogroup C CRM-conjugate [MnCC] vaccine; \nFinOM, hepatitis B vaccine) in a four-dose series at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age. The efficacy \nresults from these studies (for invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media) are \npresented below (Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Summary of efficacy of 7-valent Prevenar1\n\nTest N VE2 95% CI\n\nNCKP: Vaccine-serotype IPD3 30,258 97% 85, 100\n\nNCKP: Clinical pneumonia with abnormal chest X-ray 23,746 35% 4, 56\n\nNCKP: Acute Otitis Media (AOM)4 23,746\n\nTotal episodes 7% 4, 10\n\nRecurrent AOM (3 episodes in 6 months, or 4 episodes in 1 year) 9% 3, 15\nRecurrent AOM (5 episodes in 6 months, or 6 episodes in 1 year) 23% 7, 36\nTympanostomy tube placement 20% 2, 35\n\nFinOM: AOM 1,662\n\nTotal episodes 6% -4, 16\n\nAll pneumococcal AOM 34% 21, 45\nVaccine-serotype AOM 57% 44, 67\n\n1Per protocol\n2Vaccine efficacy\n3October 1995 to April 20, 1999\n4October 1995 to April 30, 1998\n\nPrevenar (7-valent) effectiveness\n\nThe effectiveness (both direct and indirect effect) of 7-valent Prevenar against pneumococcal disease \nhas been evaluated in both three-dose and two-dose primary infant series immunisation programmes, \neach with booster doses (Table 4). Following the widespread use of Prevenar, the incidence of IPD \nhas been consistently and substantially reduced.\n\nUsing the screening method, serotype-specific effectiveness estimates for 2 doses under the age of \n1 year in the UK were 66 % (-29, 91 %) and 100 % (25, 100 %) for serotype 6B and 23F, respectively.\n\n\n\n69\n\nTable 4: Summary of effectiveness of 7-valent Prevenar for invasive pneumococcal disease\nCountry\n\n(year of introduction)\nRecommended schedule Disease reduction, % 95% CI\n\nUK (England & Wales)1 (2006) 2, 4, + 13 months Vaccine serotypes:\nTwo doses under age 1: 85%\n\n49, 95%\n\nUSA (2000)\n\nChildren < 52\n\nPersons \u2265 653\n\n2, 4, 6, + 12-15 months\n\nVaccine serotypes: 98%\nAll serotypes: 77%\n\nVaccine serotypes: 76%\nAll serotypes: 38%\n\n97, 99%\n73, 79%\n\nNA\nNA\n\nCanada (Quebec)4\n\n(2004)\n2, 4, + 12 months All serotypes: 73%\n\nVaccine serotypes:\n2-dose infant series: 99%\nCompleted schedule:100%\n\nNA\n\n92, 100%\n82, 100%\n\n1Children < 2 years of age.

In a retrospective evaluation \nof a large US insurance database, AOM visits were reduced by 42.7 % (95 % CI, 42.4-43.1 %), and \nprescriptions for AOM by 41.9 % in children younger than 2 years of age, compared with a \npre-licensure baseline (2004 vs. 1997-99). In a similar analysis, hospitalisations and ambulatory visits \nfor all-cause pneumonia were reduced by 52.4 % and 41.1 %, respectively. For those events \nspecifically identified as pneumococcal pneumonia, the observed reductions in hospitalisations and \nambulatory visits were 57.6 % and 46.9 %, respectively, in children younger than 2 years of age, \ncompared with a pre-licensure baseline (2004 vs. 1997-99). While direct cause-and-effect cannot be \ninferred from observational analyses of this type, these findings suggest that Prevenar plays an \nimportant role in reducing the burden of mucosal disease (AOM and pneumonia) in the target \npopulation.\n\nEfficacy study in adults 65 years and older\n\nEfficacy against vaccine-type (VT) pneumococcal CAP and IPD was assessed in a large-scale \nrandomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization \nTrial in Adults\u2013CAPiTA) in the Netherlands. 84,496 subjects, 65 years and older received a single \nvaccination of either Prevenar 13 or placebo in a 1:1 randomisation.\n\nThe CAPiTA study enrolled volunteers \u2265 65 years of age whose demographic and health \ncharacteristics may differ from those seeking vaccination.\n\nA first episode of hospitalised, chest X-ray confirmed pneumonia was identified in about 2% of this \npopulation (n=1,814 subjects) of which 329 cases were confirmed pneumococcal CAP and 182 cases \nwere VT pneumococcal CAP in the per protocol and modified intent to treat (mITT) populations.\n\nEfficacy was demonstrated for the primary and secondary endpoints in the per protocol population\n(Table 5).\n\n\n\n70\n\nTable 5: Vaccine efficacy (VE) for the primary and secondary endpoints of the CAPiTA study (per \nprotocol population)\n\nEfficacy endpoint\n\nCases\n\nVE (%)\n(95.2% CI)\n\np-value\nTotal\n\nPrevenar 13\ngroup\n\nPlacebo\ngroup\n\nPrimary endpoint\n\nFirst episode of confirmed VT\npneumococcal CAP\n\n139 49 90\n45.56\n\n(21.82, 62.49)\n0.0006\n\nSecondary endpoints\n\nFirst episode of confirmed NB/NI1\n\nvaccine type pneumococcal CAP\n93 33 60\n\n45.00\n(14.21, 65.31)\n\n0.0067\n\nFirst episode of VT-IPD2 35 7 28\n75.00\n\n(41.06, 90.87)\n0.0005\n\n1NB/NI \u2013 non-bacteraemic/non-invasive\n2VT-IPD \u2013 vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease\n\nThe duration of protective efficacy against a first episode of VT pneumococcal CAP, \nNB/NI VT pneumococcal CAP, and VT-IPD extended throughout the 4-year study.\n\nThe study was not designed to demonstrate efficacy in subgroups, and the number of subjects \n\u2265 85 years of age was not sufficient to demonstrate efficacy in this age group.\n\nA post-hoc analysis was used to estimate the following public health outcomes against clinical CAP \n(as defined in the CAPiTA study, and based on clinical findings regardless of radiologic infiltrate or \netiologic confirmation): vaccine efficacy (VE), incidence rate reduction (IRR), and number needed to \nvaccinate (NNV) (Table 6).\n\nIRR, also referred to as vaccine preventable disease incidence, is the number of cases of vaccine \npreventable disease per 100,000 person-years of observation.\n\nIn Table 6, NNV is a measure that quantifies the number of people that need to be vaccinated in order \nto prevent one clinical CAP case.\n\nTable 6: Vaccine efficacy (VE) against clinical CAP*\n\nEpisodes Vaccine efficacy1 % \n(95% CI)\n\n(1-sided p-value)\n\nIncidence per \n100,000 person-\n\nyears of observation \n(PYO)\n\nIncidence \nrate \n\nreduction2\n\n(95% CI)\n\nNumber \nneeded to \nvaccinate3\n\nPrevenar\n13\n\nPlacebo Prevenar \n13\n\nPlacebo\n\nAll \nepisodes \nanalysis\n\n1375 1495 8.1 \n\n(-0.6, 16.1) \n\n(0.034)\n\n819.1 891.2 72.2 \n(-5.3, 149.6)\n\n277\n\nFirst \nepisode \nanalysis\n\n1126 1214 7.3\n\n(-0.4, 14.4)\n\n(0.031)\n\n670.7 723.7 53.0\n(-2.7, 108.7)\n\n378\n\n* Patients with at least 2 of the following: Cough; purulent sputum, temperature >38\u00b0C or <36.1\u00b0C; pneumonia \n(auscultatory findings); leukocytosis; C-reactive protein value >3 times the upper limit of normal; hypoxemia with \na partial oxygen pressure <60 mm Hg while breathing room air.\n1 A Poisson regression model with random effects was used to calculate VE.\n2 Per 100,000 person-years of observation. IRR is calculated as the incidence in the placebo group minus the \nincidence in the vaccine group, and was mathematically equivalent to VE \u00d7 the incidence in the placebo group.\n3 Based on a 5-year duration of protection. NNV is not a rate but instead indicates the number of cases prevented \nfor a given number of persons vaccinated. NNV also incorporates the length of the trial or duration of protection\n\n\n\n71\n\nand is calculated as 1 divided by the product of the IRR and duration of protection (or length of trial) (=1/(IRR \u00d7\nduration).\n\nImmunogenicity studies in adults \u226518 years and the elderly\n\nIn adults, an antibody threshold of serotype-specific pneumococcal polysaccharide IgG binding \nantibody concentration associated with protection has not been defined. For all pivotal clinical trials, a \nserotype-specific opsonophagocytosis assay (OPA) was used as a surrogate to assess potential\nefficacy against invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia. OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs) \nmeasured 1-month after each vaccination were calculated. OPA titres are expressed as the reciprocal \nof the highest serum dilution that reduces survival of the pneumococci by at least 50 %.\n\nPivotal trials for Prevenar 13 were designed to show that functional OPA antibody responses for the \n13 serotypes are non-inferior, and for some serotypes superior, to the 12 serotypes in common with \n\nthe licensed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, \n19F, 23F] one month after vaccine administration. The response to serotype 6A, which is unique to \nPrevenar 13, was assessed by demonstration of a 4-fold increase in the specific OPA titer above \npre-immunised levels.\n\nFive clinical studies were conducted in Europe and the USA evaluating the immunogenicity of \nPrevenar 13 in different age groups ranging from 18-95 years of age. Clinical studies with Prevenar 13 \ncurrently provide immunogenicity data in adults aged 18 years and older, including adults aged 65 and \nolder previously vaccinated with one or more doses of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide \nvaccine, 5 years prior to enrollment. Each study included healthy adults and immuno-competent adults \nwith stable underlying conditions known to predispose individuals to pneumococcal infection (i.e., \nchronic cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease including asthma, renal disorders and \ndiabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease including alcoholic liver disease), and adults with risk factors \nsuch as smoking and alcohol abuse.\n\nImmunogenicity and safety of Prevenar 13 has been demonstrated in adults aged 18 years and older \nincluding those previously vaccinated with a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.\n\nAdults not previously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine\nIn a head-to-head, comparative trial conducted in adults aged 60-64 years, subjects received a single \ndose of either Prevenar 13 or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. In the same study \nanother group of adults aged 50-59 years and another group of adults aged 18-49 years received a \nsingle dose of Prevenar 13.\n\nTable 7 compares the OPA GMTs, 1-month post-dose, in 60-64 year olds given either a single dose of \nPrevenar 13 or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, and in 50-59 year olds given a single \ndose of Prevenar 13.\n\n\n\n72\n\nTable 7: OPA GMTs in adults aged 60-64 years given Prevenar 13 or 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) and in adults aged 50-59 years given Prevenar 13a,b,c\n\nPrevenar 13 Prevenar 13 PPSV23 Prevenar 13\n50-59 Relative to\n\n60-64 Years\n\nPrevenar 13 Relative\nto PPSV23,\n60-64 Years\n\n50-59 Years \nN=350-384\n\n60-64 Years \nN=359-404\n\n60-64 Years \nN=367-402\n\nSerotype GMT GMT GMT GMR (95% CI) GMR (95% CI)\n1 200 146 104 1.4 (1.08, 1.73) 1.4 (1.10, 1.78)\n3 91 93 85 1.0 (0.81, 1.19) 1.1 (0.90, 1.32)\n4 2833 2062 1295 1.4 (1.07, 1.77) 1.6 (1.19, 2.13)\n5 269 199 162 1.4 (1.01, 1.80) 1.2 (0.93, 1.62)\n\n6A\u2020 4328 2593 213 1.7 (1.30, 2.15) 12.1 (8.63, 17.08)\n6B 3212 1984 788 1.6 (1.24, 2.12) 2.5 (1.82, 3.48)\n7F 1520 1120 405 1.4 (1.03, 1.79) 2.8 (1.98, 3.87)\n9V 1726 1164 407 1.5 (1.11, 1.98) 2.9 (2.00, 4.08)\n14 957 612 692 1.6 (1.16, 2.12) 0.9 (0.64, 1.21)\n\n18C 1939 1726 925 1.1 (0.86, 1.47) 1.9 (1.39, 2.51)\n19A 956 682 352 1.4 (1.16, 1.69) 1.9 (1.56, 2.41)\n19F 599 517 539 1.2 (0.87, 1.54) 1.0 (0.72, 1.28)\n23F 494 375 72 1.3 (0.94, 1.84) 5.2 (3.67, 7.33)\n\na Non-inferiority was defined as the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was greater than 0.5. \nb Statistically significantly greater response was defined as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR \nwas greater than 1. \nc For serotype 6A\u2020, which is unique to Prevenar 13, a statistically significantly greater response was defined as \nthe lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR being greater than 2.\n\nIn adults aged 60-64 years, OPA GMTs to Prevenar 13 were non-inferior to the OPA GMTs elicited to \nthe 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for the twelve serotypes common to both \nvaccines.

The \nclinical relevance of the antibody levels elicited by Prevenar 13 in these special populations is \nunknown.\n\nSickle cell disease\nAn open label single arm study in France, Italy, UK, US, Lebanon, Egypt and Saudi Arabia with \n2 doses of Prevenar 13 given 6 months apart was conducted in 158 children and adolescents \u2265 6 to \n< 18 years of age with sickle cell disease who were previously vaccinated with one or more doses of \n23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at least 6 months prior to enrollment. After the first \nvaccination, Prevenar 13 elicited antibody levels measured by both IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs that \nwere statistically significantly higher when compared to levels prior to vaccination.

One year after the second dose, \nantibody levels measured by both IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs were higher than levels prior to the first \ndose of Prevenar 13, except for the IgG GMCs for serotypes 3 and 5 that were numerically similar.\n\nAdditional Prevenar (7-valent) immunogenicity data: children with sickle cell disease\nThe immunogenicity of Prevenar has been investigated in an open-label, multicentre study in \n49 infants with sickle cell disease. Children were vaccinated with Prevenar (3 doses one month apart \nfrom the age of 2 months), 46 of these children also received a 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine at the age of 15-18 months. After primary immunisation, 95.6 % of the \nsubjects had antibody levels of at least 0.35 \u03bcg/ml for all seven serotypes found in Prevenar. \nA significant increase was seen in the concentrations of antibodies against the seven serotypes after \nthe polysaccharide vaccination, suggesting that immunological memory was well established.\n\nHIV infection\n\nChildren and adults not previously vaccinated with a pneumococcal vaccine\nHIV-infected children and adults with CD4 \u2265 200 cells/\u00b5L (mean 717.0 cells/\u03bcL), viral load \n< 50,000 copies/ml (mean 2090.0 copies/ml), free of active AIDS-related illness and not previously \nvaccinated with a pneumococcal vaccine received 3 doses of Prevenar 13. As per general \nrecommendations, a single dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was subsequently \nadministered. Vaccines were administered at 1 month intervals. Immune responses were assessed in \n259-270 evaluable subjects approximately 1 month after each dose of vaccine. After the first dose, \nPrevenar 13 elicited antibody levels, measured by both IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs that were \nstatistically significantly higher when compared to levels prior to vaccination. After the second and \nthird dose of Prevenar 13, immune responses were similar or higher than those after the first dose.\n\nAdults previously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine\nHIV-infected adults \u2265 18 years of age with CD4 \u2265 200 cells/\u00b5L (mean 609.1 cells/\u00b5L) and viral load \n< 50,000 copies/ml (mean 330.6 copies/ml), who were free of active AIDS-related illness and were \npreviously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine administered at least \n6 months prior to enrollment, received 3 doses of Prevenar 13, at enrollment, 6 months, and \n12 months after the first dose of Prevenar 13. Immune responses were assessed in 231-255 evaluable \nsubjects approximately 1 month after each dose of Prevenar 13. After the first dose, Prevenar 13 \nelicited antibody levels measured by both IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs that were statistically \nsignificantly higher when compared to levels prior to vaccination. After the second and third dose of \nPrevenar 13, immune responses were comparable or higher than those after the first dose. In the study \n162 subjects had received one prior dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, \n143 subjects 2 prior doses and 26 subjects more than 2 prior doses of 23-valent polysaccharide \nvaccine. Subjects who received two or more previous doses of 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine showed a similar immune response compared with subjects who received a \nsingle previous dose.\n\nHaematopoietic stem cell transplant\nChildren and adults with an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at \u2265 2 years of age \nwith complete haematologic remission of underlying disease or with very good partial remission in the \ncase of lymphoma and myeloma received three doses of Prevenar 13 with an interval of at least \n1 month between doses. The first dose was administered at 3 to 6 months after HSCT. A fourth \n(booster) dose of Prevenar 13 was administered 6 months after the third dose. As per general \nrecommendations, a single dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was administered \n1 month after the fourth dose of Prevenar 13. Immune responses as measured by IgG GMCs were \nassessed in 168-211 evaluable subjects approximately 1 month after vaccination. Prevenar 13 elicited \nincreased antibody levels after each dose of Prevenar 13. Immune responses after the fourth dose of \nPrevenar 13 were significantly increased for all serotypes compared with after the third dose.\nFunctional antibody titers (OPA titers) were not measured in this study.\n\n\n\n76\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, and reproduction and developmental \ntoxicity.\n\n6.

Possible side effects\n5. How to store Prevenar 13\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Prevenar 13 is and what it is used for\n\nPrevenar 13 is a pneumococcal vaccine given to:\n\n\uf0b7 children from 6 weeks to 17 years to help protect against diseases such as: meningitis \n(inflammation around the brain), sepsis or bacteraemia (bacteria in the blood stream), pneumonia \n(lung infection) and ear infections\n\n\uf0b7 adults aged 18 years and older to help prevent disease such as: pneumonia (lung infection), \nsepsis or bacteraemia (bacteria in the blood stream) and meningitis (inflammation around the \nbrain),\n\ncaused by 13 types of the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nPrevenar 13, provides protection against 13 types of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, and replaces \nPrevenar, which provided protection against 7 types.\n\nThe vaccine works by helping the body to make its own antibodies, which protect you or your child \nagainst these diseases.\n\n2. What you need to know before you or your child receives Prevenar 13\n\nPrevenar 13 should not be given\n\n\u2022 if you or your child is allergic (hypersensitive) to the active substances or to any of the other \ningredients in this medicine (listed in section 6) or to any other vaccine that contains diphtheria \ntoxoid.\n\n\uf0b7 if you or your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38\u00b0C). If this applies to \nyou or your child, then the vaccination will be postponed until you or your child is feeling better. \nA minor infection, such as a cold, should not be a problem. However, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist, or nurse first.\n\n\n\n97\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before the vaccination if you or your child:\n\uf0b7 has any present or past medical problems after any dose of Prevenar or Prevenar 13 such as an \n\nallergic reaction or problems with breathing.\n\uf0b7 has any bleeding problems or bruises easily.\n\uf0b7 has a weakened immune system (such as due to HIV infection), you/she/he may not get the full\n\nbenefit from Prevenar 13.\n\uf0b7 has experienced seizures as medicines to lower fever may need to be taken before Prevenar 13 is \n\ngiven. If your child should become unresponsive or experience seizures (fits) after the \nvaccination, please contact your doctor immediately. See also section 4.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before the vaccination if your child was born very \nprematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation), as longer gaps than normal between breaths may \noccur for 2-3 days after vaccination. See also section 4.\n\nAs with any vaccine, Prevenar 13 will not protect all persons who are vaccinated.\n\nPrevenar 13 will only protect against ear infections in children caused by the types of Streptococcus \npneumoniae for which the vaccine has been developed. It will not protect against other infectious \nagents that can cause ear infections.\n\nOther medicines/vaccines and Prevenar 13\n\nYour doctor may ask you to give your child paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever before\nPrevenar 13 is given. This will help to lower some of the side effects of Prevenar 13.\n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you or your child is taking, has recently taken or might take \nany other medicines, or has recently received any other vaccine.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before receiving this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nPrevenar 13 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

What Prevenar 13 is and what it is used for\n\nPrevenar 13 is a pneumococcal vaccine given to:\n\n\uf0b7 children from 6 weeks to 17 years to help protect against diseases such as: meningitis \n(inflammation around the brain), sepsis or bacteraemia (bacteria in the blood stream), pneumonia \n(lung infection) and ear infections\n\n\uf0b7 adults aged 18 years and older to help prevent disease such as: pneumonia (lung infection),\nsepsis or bacteraemia (bacteria in the blood stream) and meningitis (inflammation around the \nbrain),\n\ncaused by 13 types of the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nPrevenar 13, provides protection against 13 types of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, and replaces \nPrevenar, which provided protection against 7 types.\n\nThe vaccine works by helping the body to make its own antibodies, which protect you or your child \nagainst these diseases.\n\n2. What you need to know before you or your child receives Prevenar 13\n\nPrevenar 13 should not be given\n\n\u2022 if you or your child is allergic (hypersensitive) to the active substances or to any of the other \ningredients in this medicine (listed in section 6) or to any other vaccine that contains diphtheria \ntoxoid.\n\n\uf0b7 if you or your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38\u00b0C). If this applies to \nyou or your child, then the vaccination will be postponed until you or your child is feeling better. \nA minor infection, such as a cold, should not be a problem. However, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist, or nurse first.\n\n\n\n105\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before the vaccination if you or your child:\n\uf0b7 has any present or past medical problems after any dose of Prevenar or Prevenar 13 such as an \n\nallergic reaction or problems with breathing.\n\uf0b7 has any bleeding problems or bruises easily.\n\uf0b7 has a weakened immune system (such as due to HIV infection), you/she/he may not get the full \n\nbenefit from Prevenar 13.\n\uf0b7 has experienced seizures as medicines to lower fever may need to be taken before Prevenar 13 is \n\ngiven. If your child should become unresponsive or experience seizures (fits) after the \nvaccination, please contact your doctor immediately. See also section 4.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before the vaccination if your child was born very \nprematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation), as longer gaps than normal between breaths may \noccur for 2-3 days after vaccination. See also section 4.\n\nAs with any vaccine, Prevenar 13 will not protect all persons who are vaccinated.\n\nPrevenar 13 will only protect against ear infections in children caused by the types of Streptococcus \npneumoniae for which the vaccine has been developed. It will not protect against other infectious \nagents that can cause ear infections.\n\nOther medicines/vaccines and Prevenar 13\n\nYour doctor may ask you to give your child paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever before\nPrevenar 13 is given. This will help to lower some of the side effects of Prevenar 13.\n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you or your child is taking, has recently taken or might take \nany other medicines, or has recently received any other vaccine.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before receiving this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nPrevenar 13 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

What Prevenar 13 is and what it is used for\n\nPrevenar 13 is a pneumococcal vaccine given to:\n\n\uf0b7 children from 6 weeks to 17 years to help protect against diseases such as: meningitis \n(inflammation around the brain), sepsis or bacteraemia (bacteria in the blood stream), pneumonia \n(lung infection) and ear infections\n\n\uf0b7 adults aged 18 years and older to help prevent disease such as: pneumonia (lung infection),\nsepsis or bacteraemia (bacteria in the blood stream) and meningitis (inflammation around the \nbrain),\n\ncaused by 13 types of the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nPrevenar 13, provides protection against 13 types of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, and replaces \nPrevenar, which provided protection against 7 types.\n\nThe vaccine works by helping the body to make its own antibodies, which protect you or your child \nagainst these diseases.\n\n2. What you need to know before you or your child receives Prevenar 13\n\nPrevenar 13 should not be given\n\n\u2022 if you or your child is allergic (hypersensitive) to the active substances or to any of the other \ningredients in this medicine (listed in section 6) or to any other vaccine that contains diphtheria \ntoxoid.\n\n\uf0b7 if you or your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38\u00b0C). If this applies to \nyou or your child, then the vaccination will be postponed until you or your child is feeling better. \nA minor infection, such as a cold, should not be a problem. However, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist, or nurse first.\n\n\n\n113\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before the vaccination if you or your child:\n\uf0b7 has any present or past medical problems after any dose of Prevenar or Prevenar 13 such as an \n\nallergic reaction or problems with breathing.\n\uf0b7 has any bleeding problems or bruises easily.\n\uf0b7 has a weakened immune system (such as due to HIV infection), you/she/he may not get the full \n\nbenefit from Prevenar 13.\n\uf0b7 has experienced seizures as medicines to lower fever may need to be taken before Prevenar 13 is \n\ngiven. If your child should become unresponsive or experience seizures (fits) after the \nvaccination, please contact your doctor immediately. See also section 4.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before the vaccination if your child was born very \nprematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation), as longer gaps than normal between breaths may \noccur for 2-3 days after vaccination. See also section 4.\n\nAs with any vaccine, Prevenar 13 will not protect all persons who are vaccinated.\n\nPrevenar 13 will only protect against ear infections in children caused by the types of Streptococcus \npneumoniae for which the vaccine has been developed. It will not protect against other infectious \nagents that can cause ear infections.\n\nOther medicines/vaccines and Prevenar 13\n\nYour doctor may ask you to give your child paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever before\nPrevenar 13 is given. This will help to lower some of the side effects of Prevenar 13.\n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you or your child is taking, has recently taken or might take \nany other medicines, or has recently received any other vaccine.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before receiving this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nPrevenar 13 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Consequently the \n\nPRAC has updated section 4.8 of the SmPC to add the adverse reaction anaphylaxis with a \n\nfrequency not known to the group of children above 5 years of age and adults.\n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.\n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)\n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine \n\n(adsorbed) - 13 valent the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal \n\nproduct(s) containing pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) - 13 valent is \n\nunchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.\n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
