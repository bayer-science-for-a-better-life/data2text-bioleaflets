This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.  \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nComirnaty concentrate for dispersion for injection \nCOVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nThis is a multidose vial and must be diluted before use.  \n \nOne vial (0.45 mL) contains 6 doses of 0.3 mL after dilution, see sections 4.2 and 6.6. \n \n1 dose (0.3 mL) contains 30 micrograms of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (embedded in lipid \nnanoparticles).  \n \nSingle-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell-free in vitro transcription \nfrom the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for dispersion for injection (sterile concentrate). \nThe vaccine is a white to off-white frozen dispersion (pH: 6.9 - 7.9). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nComirnaty is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, \nin individuals 16 years of age and older.  \n \nThe use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nIndividuals 16 years of age and older \nComirnaty is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a course of 2 doses (0.3 mL each) at least \n21 days apart (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nThere are no data available on the interchangeability of Comirnaty with other COVID-19 vaccines to \ncomplete the vaccination course. Individuals who have received 1 dose of Comirnaty should receive a \nsecond dose of Comirnaty to complete the vaccination course.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Comirnaty in children and adolescents aged less than 16 years of age have \nnot yet been established. Limited data are available. \n\n2 \n\n\n\n \nElderly population \nNo dosage adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nComirnaty should be administered intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6).  \n \nAfter dilution, vials of Comirnaty contain six doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to extract six doses \nfrom a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead-volume \nsyringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard \nsyringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single \nvial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: \n \n• Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine.   \n• If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the \n\nvial and any excess volume.  \n• Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. \n\n \nThe preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. \n \nDo not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.  \n \nThe vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. \n \nFor precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. \n \nFor instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability  \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGeneral recommendations \n \nHypersensitivity and anaphylaxis \nEvents of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should \nalways be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the \nvaccine.  \n \nClose observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. A second dose of the \nvaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose of Comirnaty. \n \nAnxiety-related reactions \nAnxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related \nreactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. \nIt is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. \n \n\n3 \n\n\n\nConcurrent illness \nVaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute \ninfection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. \n \nThrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders \nAs with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals \nreceiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as \nhaemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in \nthese individuals. \n \nImmunocompromised individuals \nThe efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised \nindividuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be \nlower in immunosuppressed individuals. \n \nDuration of protection \nThe duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by \nongoing clinical trials. \n \nLimitations of vaccine effectiveness \nAs with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals \nmay not be fully protected until 7 days after their second dose of vaccine. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘potassium-free’.  \n \nThis vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nConcomitant administration of Comirnaty with other vaccines has not been studied. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is limited experience with use of Comirnaty in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or \npost-natal development (see section 5.3). Administration of Comirnaty in pregnancy should only be \nconsidered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether Comirnaty is excreted in human milk.  \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). \n \n\n4 \n\n\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nComirnaty has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of \nthe effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nThe safety of Comirnaty was evaluated in participants 16 years of age and older in 2 clinical studies \nthat included 21,744 participants that have received at least one dose of Comirnaty.  \n \nIn Study 2, a total of 21,720 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty \nand a total of 21,728 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and \n145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of \n20,519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.  \n \nAt the time of the analysis of Study 2, a total of 19,067 (9,531 Comirnaty and 9,536 placebo) \nparticipants 16 years of age or older were evaluated for safety for at least 2 months after the second \ndose of Comirnaty. This included a total of 10,727 (5,350 Comirnaty and 5,377 placebo) participants \n16 to 55 years of age and a total of 8,340 (4,181 Comirnaty and 4,159 placebo) participants 56 years \nand older. \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older were injection site pain \n(> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia and chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia \nand injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within \na few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with \ngreater age. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions from clinical studies \n \nAdverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below according to the following \nfrequency categories:  \n \nVery common (≥ 1/10),  \nCommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10),  \nUncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100),  \nRare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000),  \nVery rare (< 1/10,000),  \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions from Comirnaty clinical trials \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \ncommon \n(≥ 1/10) \n\nCommon \n(≥ 1/100 to \n\n< 1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to \n\n< 1/100) \n\nRare \n(≥ 1/10,000 \n\nto < 1/1,000) \n\nNot known \n(cannot be \n\nestimated from \nthe available \n\ndata) \nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n  Lymphadenopathy   \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n    Anaphylaxis; \nhypersensitivity \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n  Insomnia   \n\n5 \n\n\n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \ncommon \n(≥ 1/10) \n\nCommon \n(≥ 1/100 to \n\n< 1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to \n\n< 1/100) \n\nRare \n(≥ 1/10,000 \n\nto < 1/1,000) \n\nNot known \n(cannot be \n\nestimated from \nthe available \n\ndata) \nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache   Acute \nperipheral \nfacial \nparalysis† \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea    \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\nArthralgia; \nmyalgia \n\n Pain in extremity   \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection \nsite pain; \nfatigue; \nchills; \npyrexia*; \ninjection \nsite \nswelling \n\nInjection \nsite redness \n\nMalaise; injection \nsite pruritus \n\n  \n\n* A higher frequency of pyrexia was observed after the 2nd dose. \n† Throughout the safety follow-up period to date, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by \n\nfour participants in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group. Onset was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not \nreceive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) \nwere reported in the placebo group. \n\n \nThe safety profile in 545 subjects receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at \nbaseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error \nin dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in \nreactogenicity or adverse reactions.  \n \nIn the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is \nrecommended. \n \n \n\n6 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX03 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which \nenable delivery of the non replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the \nSARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point \nmutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an \nantigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and \ncellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against \nCOVID-19. \n \nEfficacy \n \nStudy 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind \ndose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. \nRandomisation was stratified by age: 12 through 15 years of age, 16 through 55 years of age, or \n56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study \nexcluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or \nmicrobiological diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as \ndisease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the \n6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). At the time of the \nanalysis of Study 2, information presented is based on participants 16 years and older. \n \nEfficacy in participants 16 years of age and older \n \nIn the Phase 2/3 portion, approximately 44,000 participants were randomised equally and were to \nreceive 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo separated by 21 days. The efficacy analyses \nincluded participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first \nvaccination. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments \nof safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a \nminimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to \nreceive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required \nto observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or \nimmunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or \nCOVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. \n \nThe population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included, 36,621 participants 12 years \nof age and older (18,242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18,379 in the placebo group) \nwho did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. \nIn addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 \nmRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1616 participants 75 years of age and older \n(804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). \n \nEfficacy against COVID-19  \n \nAt the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic \nCOVID-19 for in total 2,214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total \n2,222 person-years in the placebo group.  \n \nThere were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at \nrisk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe \n\n7 \n\n\n\nCOVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes \nmellitus, hypertension). \n \nThe vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Vaccine efficacy – First COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2, by age \n\nsubgroup – participants without evidence of infection prior to 7 days after Dose 2 – \nevaluable efficacy (7 days) population \n\nFirst COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 in participants without evidence of prior \nSARS-CoV-2 infection* \n\nSubgroup \n\nCOVID-19 mRNA \nVaccine \n\nNa = 18,198 \nCases \n\nn1b \nSurveillance timec (n2d) \n\nPlacebo \n \n\nNa = 18,325 \nCases \n\nn1b \nSurveillance timec (n2d) \n\nVaccine efficacy \n% (95% CI)f \n\n  All subjectse 8 \n2.214 (17,411) \n\n162 \n2.222 (17,511) 95.0 (90.0, 97.9) \n\n  16 to 64 years 7 \n1.706 (13,549) \n\n143 \n1.710 (13,618) 95.1 (89.6, 98.1) \n\n  65 years and older 1 \n0.508 (3848) \n\n19 \n0.511 (3880) 94.7 (66.7, 99.9) \n\n  65 to 74 years 1 \n0.406 (3074) \n\n14 \n0.406 (3095) 92.9 (53.1, 99.8) \n\n  75 years and older 0 \n0.102 (774)  \n\n5 \n0.106 (785)  100.0 (-13.1, 100.0) \n\nNote: Confirmed cases were determined by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and \nat least 1 symptom consistent with COVID-19 [*Case definition: (at least 1 of) fever, new or increased cough, \nnew or increased shortness of breath, chills, new or increased muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, sore \nthroat, diarrhoea or vomiting.] \n* Participants who had no serological or virological evidence (prior to 7 days after receipt of the last dose) of \n\npast SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., N-binding antibody [serum] negative at Visit 1 and SARS-CoV-2 not \ndetected by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) [nasal swab] at Visits 1 and 2), and had negative \nNAAT (nasal swab) at any unscheduled visit prior to 7 days after Dose 2 were included in the analysis. \n\na.

This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency \nwill review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be \nupdated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose \ntoxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. \n \nGeneral toxicity \n \nRats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating \nrelatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site \noedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) \nconsistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without \nevidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. \n \nGenotoxicity/Carcinogenicity \n \nNeither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids \nand mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  \n \nReproductive toxicity \n \nReproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and \ndevelopmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to \nmating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat \ndue to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). \nSARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating \nto the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no \nvaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No \nComirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1.  What Comirnaty is and what it is used for  \n2.  What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty \n3.  How Comirnaty is given  \n4.  Possible side effects  \n5.  How to store Comirnaty \n6.  Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Comirnaty is and what it is used for \n \nComirnaty is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus.  \n \nComirnaty is given to adults and adolescents from 16 years of age and older.  \n \nThe vaccine causes the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood \ncells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. \n \nAs Comirnaty does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty  \n \nComirnaty should not be given \n• if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6)  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if: \n• you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine \n\ninjection or after you were given Comirnaty in the past. \n• you have ever fainted following any needle injection. \n• you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination \n\nif you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. \n• you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots. \n• you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine \n\nsuch as corticosteroid that affects your immune system \n \nAs with any vaccine, the 2-dose vaccination course of Comirnaty may not fully protect all those who \nreceive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. \n\n25 \n\n\n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nComirnaty is not recommended for children aged under 16 years. \n \nOther medicines and Comirnaty \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines \nor have recently received any other vaccine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before you receive this vaccine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily \naffect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or \nuse machines. \n \nComirnaty contains potassium and sodium \nThis vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘potassium-free’. \n \nThis vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How Comirnaty is given \n \nComirnaty is given after dilution as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm. \n \nYou will receive 2 injections, given at least 21 days apart. \n \nAfter the first dose of Comirnaty, you should receive a second dose of the same vaccine after 21 days \nto complete the vaccination course.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all vaccines, Comirnaty can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nVery common side effects: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n• injection site: pain, swelling  \n• tiredness \n• headache \n• muscle pain  \n• joint pain \n• chills, fever \n \nCommon side effects: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n• injection site redness  \n• nausea \n \n\n26 \n\n\n\nUncommon side effects: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n• enlarged lymph nodes \n• feeling unwell \n• pain in limb \n• insomnia \n• injection site itching \n \nRare side effects: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people \n• temporary one sided facial drooping \n \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data)  \n• severe allergic reaction  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. By reporting side effects you \ncan help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Comirnaty \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nThe following information about storage, expiry and use and handling is intended for healthcare \nprofessionals. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and label after EXP. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in freezer at -90 °C to -60 °C. \n \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nAfter thawing, the vaccine should be diluted and used immediately. However, in-use stability data \nhave demonstrated that once removed from freezer, the undiluted vaccine can be stored for up to \n5 days at 2 °C to 8 °C, or up to 2 hours at temperatures up to 30 °C, prior to use. \n \nAfter dilution, store the vaccine at 2 °C to 30 °C and use within 6 hours. Discard any unused vaccine. \n \nOnce removed from the freezer and diluted, the vials should be marked with the new discard date and \ntime. Once thawed, the vaccine cannot be re-frozen. \n \nDo not use this vaccine if you notice particulates in the dilution or discolouration. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use.

Do not shake. \n\n• Prior to dilution, the thawed dispersion \nmay contain white to off-white opaque \namorphous particles.  \n \n\nNo more than \n2 hours at \n\nroom \ntemperature \n(up to 30 °C) \n\n30 \n\nhttp://www.comirnatyglobal.com/\n\n\nDILUTION \n\n \n \n\n• The thawed vaccine must be diluted in \nits original vial with 1.8 mL sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \ninjection, using a 21 gauge or narrower \nneedle and aseptic techniques.  \n\n \n \n\n• Equalise vial pressure before removing \nthe needle from the vial stopper by \nwithdrawing 1.8 mL air into the empty \ndiluent syringe. \n \n\n1.8 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride \ninjection \n\nPull back plunger to 1.8 mL to \nremove air from vial \n\n31 \n\n\n\n \n \n\n• Gently invert the diluted dispersion \n10 times. Do not shake. \n\n• The diluted vaccine should present as \nan off-white dispersion with no \nparticulates visible. Discard the diluted \nvaccine if particulates or discolouration \nare present. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n• The diluted vials should be marked \nwith the appropriate date and time. \n\n• Do not freeze or shake the diluted \ndispersion. If refrigerated, allow the \ndiluted dispersion to come to room \ntemperature prior to use. \n \n\nGently x 10 \n\nRecord appropriate date and time. \nUse within 6 hours after dilution \n\n32 \n\n\n\nPREPARATION OF INDIVIDUAL 0.3 mL DOSES OF COMIRNATY \n\n \n \n\n• After dilution, the vial contains \n2.25 mL from which 6 doses of 0.3 mL \ncan be extracted.  \n\n• Using aseptic technique, cleanse the \nvial stopper with a single-use antiseptic \nswab. \n\n• Withdraw 0.3 mL of Comirnaty.  \n \n\nLow dead-volume syringes and/or \nneedles should be used in order to \nextract 6 doses from a single vial. The \nlow dead-volume syringe and needle \ncombination should have a dead \nvolume of no more than 35 microlitres. \n\n \nIf standard syringes and needles are \nused, there may not be sufficient \nvolume to extract a sixth dose from a \nsingle vial. \n\n• Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of \nvaccine.   \n\n• If the amount of vaccine remaining in \nthe vial cannot provide a full dose of \n0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess \nvolume.  \n\n• Discard any unused vaccine within \n6 hours after dilution. \n\n \n \nDisposal \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.  \n\n0.3 mL diluted  \nvaccine \n\n33 \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
