This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIMVANEX suspension for injection \nSmallpox vaccine (Live Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne dose (0.5 ml) contains: \n \nModified Vaccinia Ankara – Bavarian Nordic Live virus1 no less than 5 x 107 Inf.U * \n \n*infectious units \n1 Produced in chick embryo cells \n \nThis vaccine contains trace residues of chicken protein, benzonase, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \n \nLight yellow to pale white, milky suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nActive immunisation against smallpox in adults (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nThe use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPrimary vaccination (individuals previously not vaccinated against smallpox): \nA first dose of 0.5 ml should be administered on an elected date. \nA second dose of 0.5 ml should be administered no less than 28 days after the first dose. \nSee sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \nBooster vaccination (individuals previously vaccinated against smallpox): \nThere are inadequate data to determine the appropriate timing of booster doses. If a booster dose is \nconsidered necessary then a single dose of 0.5 ml should be administered. \nSee sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial population: \nImmunocompromised patients (e.g. HIV infected, patients under immunosuppressive therapy) who \nhave been previously vaccinated against smallpox should receive two booster doses. The second \nbooster vaccination should be given no less than 28 days after the first dose. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of IMVANEX in children below 18 years have not been established. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by subcutaneous injection, preferably into the upper arm (deltoid). \n \nFor instructions on administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or trace \nresidues (chicken protein, benzonase, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability  \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nImmunisation should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness or \nacute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not result in the \ndeferral of vaccination. \n \nIMVANEX should not be administered by intravascular injection. \n \nThe protective efficacy of IMVANEX against smallpox has not been studied. See section 5.1. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees. \n \nThere are inadequate data to determine the appropriate timing of booster doses. \n \nPrior vaccination with IMVANEX may modify the cutaneous response (‘take’) to subsequently \nadministered replication-competent smallpox vaccine resulting in a reduced or absent take. See \nsection 5.1. \n \nIndividuals with atopic dermatitis developed more local and general symptoms after vaccination (see \nsection 4.8) \n \nData have been generated in HIV infected individuals with CD4 counts ≥ 100 cells/µl and \n≤ 750 cells/µl. Lower immune response data have been observed in HIV infected individuals \ncompared to healthy individuals (see section 5.1). There are no data on the immune response to \nIMVANEX in other immunosuppressed individuals. \n \nTwo doses of IMVANEX given at a 7-day interval showed lower immune responses and slightly more \nlocal reactogenicity than two doses given at a 28-day interval. Therefore, dose intervals of less than \n4 weeks should be avoided. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSodium content \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say \nessentially ’sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies with other vaccines or medicinal products have been performed. Therefore, \nconcomitant administration of IMVANEX with other vaccines should be avoided. \nThe concomitant administration of the vaccine with any immunoglobulin including Vaccinia Immune \nGlobulin (VIG) has not been studied and should be avoided. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of IMVANEX in pregnant \nwomen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive \ntoxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure the use of IMVANEX should be avoided during \npregnancy unless it is considered that the possible benefit in terms of preventing smallpox would \noutweigh the potential risk. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether IMVANEX is excreted in human milk. \n \nIMVANEX should be avoided during breastfeeding unless it is considered that the possible benefit in \nterms of preventing smallpox would outweigh the potential risk. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies did not reveal any evidence of impaired female and male fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the undesirable effects mentioned in section 4.8 may affect the ability to drive or use \nmachines (e.g. dizziness). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of IMVANEX has been assessed in 20 clinical trials in which 5,261 Vaccinia-naïve \nindividuals received two doses of no less than 5 x 107 Inf.U four weeks apart while 534 Vaccinia- and \nIMVANEX-experienced individuals received a single booster dose. \n \nThe most common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were injection site reactions and \ncommon systemic reactions typical for vaccines which were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved \nwithout intervention within seven days following vaccination. \n \nAdverse reaction rates reported after either vaccination dose (1st, 2nd or booster) were similar. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions from all clinical trials are listed according to the following frequency: \n \nVery common (≥1/10) \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10) \n\n\n\n5 \n\nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \n\nTable 1: Adverse Reactions Reported in Completed Clinical Trials with IMVANEX \n(N = 7,082 subjects) \n\nMedDRA System \nOrgan Class \n\nVery \ncommon  \n(≥1/10) \n\nCommon  \n(≥1/100 to <1/10)  \n\n \n\nUncommon  \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \n\nRare \n(≥1/10,000 to \n\n<1/1,000) \nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n- -

- Contusion \n\n \nIndividuals with atopic dermatitis (AD) \nIn a non-placebo controlled clinical trial that compared the safety of IMVANEX in individuals with \nAD to healthy individuals, individuals with AD reported erythema (61.2%) and swelling (52.2%) at \nthe injection site with a higher frequency than healthy individuals (49.3% and 40.8%, respectively). \nThe following general symptoms were reported more frequently in individuals with AD compared to \nhealthy individuals: headache (33.1% vs. 24.8%), myalgia (31.8% vs. 22.3%), chills (10.7% vs. \n3.8 %), nausea (11.9% vs. 6.8%), and fatigue (21.4% vs. 14.4%). \n7% of the individuals with AD in clinical trials with IMVANEX experienced a flare-up or worsening \nof their skin condition during the course of the trial.  \n \nRash \nIMVANEX may trigger local rashes or more widespread eruptions. Events of rash after vaccination \n(related cases observed in 0.4% of subjects) with IMVANEX tend to occur within the first days after \nvaccination, are mild to moderate in intensity and usually resolve without sequelae. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n7 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccine, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX \n \nEfficacy in animals \n \nNon-human primate (NHP) studies have demonstrated that vaccination with IMVANEX induced a \ncomparable immune response and protective efficacy to traditional smallpox vaccines used to \neradicate smallpox and protected NHP from severe disease associated with a lethal challenge of \nmonkeypox virus. As seen with traditional smallpox vaccines, a significant reduction in both mortality \nand morbidity (viral load, weight loss, number of pox lesions, etc.) compared to non-vaccinated \ncontrols was demonstrated for NHP vaccinated with IMVANEX. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nSeroconversion rates in Vaccinia-naïve healthy and special populations \n \nThe Vaccinia-naïve study population included healthy individuals as well as individuals with HIV \ninfection and AD who received 2 doses of IMVANEX 4 weeks apart. Seroconversion rates in \nVaccinia-naïve individuals were defined as appearance of antibody titers equal or greater than the \nassay cut-off value following receipt of two doses of IMVANEX. Seroconversion by ELISA and \nPRNT were as follows: \n \n\nSCR - ELISA  Day 7/141 Day 281 Day 421 \n\nStudy Health status N \nSCR % \n\n(95% CI) \nSCR % \n\n(95% CI) \nSCR % \n\n(95% CI) \n\nPOX-MVA-0052  Healthy 183 70.9  (63.7, 77.4) \n88.9  \n\n(83.4, 93.1) \n98.9  \n\n(96.0, 99.9) \n\nPOX-MVA-0083 \nHealthy 194 12.5  (8.1, 18.2) \n\n85.4  \n(79.6, 90.1) \n\n98.5  \n(95.5, 99.7) \n\nAD 257 22.9  (17.8, 28.6) \n85.4  \n\n(80.5, 89.5) \n97.3  \n\n(94.5, 98.9) \n\nPOX-MVA-0094 Healthy 66 69.7  (57.1, 80.4) \n72.2  \n\n(60.4, 83.0) \n96.8  \n\n(89.0, 99.6) \n\nPOX-MVA-0112 \nHealthy 88 29.6  (20.0, 40.8) \n\n83.7  \n(74.2, 90.8) \n\n98.7  \n(93.1, 100) \n\nHIV 351 29.2  (24.3, 34.5) \n67.5  \n\n(62.1, 72.5) \n96.2  \n\n(93.4, 98.0) \n\nPOX-MVA-0132 Healthy 2,1196 N/A5 N/A5 99.7  (99.4;

ACAM2000 was administered via scarification. \n \nThe first co-primary endpoint compared vaccinia-specific neutralizing antibody responses at the peak \nvisits (Day 42 after first vaccination for Imvanex where the subjects received two doses according to \nthe standard vaccination schedule and Day 28 for ACAM2000). Imvanex induced a peak neutralizing \nantibody geometric mean titer (GMT) of 153.5 (n = 185; 95% CI 134.3, 175.6), which was non-\ninferior to the GMT of 79.3 (n = 186; 95% CI 67.1, 93.8) obtained after scarification with \nACAM2000. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nThe second co-primary endpoint evaluated if vaccination with Imvanex (n = 165) prior to \nadministration of ACAM2000 results in an attenuation of the cutaneous reaction to ACAM2000 (n = \n161) as measured by maximum lesion area in mm2. At day 13-15, the median maximum lesion area for \nsubjects who were administered ACAM2000 was 75mm2 (95% CI 69.0, 85.0) and for those who \nreceived Imvanex it was 0.0 (95% CI 0.0, 2.0). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nIMVANEX in all subsets of the paediatric population for prevention of smallpox infection by active \nimmunisation against smallpox infection and disease (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse). \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’. \nThis means that because of the lack of smallpox disease in the world it has not been possible to obtain \ncomplete information on this medicinal product. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, \nfemale fertility, embryo-foetal and postnatal toxicity. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What IMVANEX is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive IMVANEX \n3. How IMVANEX is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store IMVANEX \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What IMVANEX is and what it is used for \n \nIMVANEX is a vaccine used to prevent smallpox infection in adults. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will \nproduce its own protection in the form of antibodies against the smallpox virus. \nIMVANEX does not contain smallpox virus (Variola) and cannot spread or cause smallpox. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive IMVANEX \n \nYou must not receive IMVANEX: \n \n• if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of \n\nImvanex (these are listed in section 6) or chicken protein, benzonase gentamicin or \nciprofloxacin which may be present in the vaccine in very small amounts. \n \n\n• if you are ill with a high temperature. In this case, your doctor will postpone the vaccination \nuntil you are feeling better. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not require \npostponement of the vaccination, but talk to your doctor or nurse first. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before receiving IMVANEX: \n\n• if you have atopic dermatitis (see section 4). \n• if you have HIV infection or any other condition or treatment leading to a weakened immune \n\nsystem. \n \nThe protective efficacy of IMVANEX against smallpox has not been studied. \n \nIMVANEX may not fully protect all people who are vaccinated. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \nPrior vaccination with IMVANEX may modify the cutaneous response (‘take’) to subsequently \nadministered replication-competent smallpox vaccine resulting in a reduced or absent take. \n \nOther medicines or vaccines and IMVANEX \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or if you have \nrecently received any other vaccine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are a pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nto your doctor for advice. The use of this vaccine during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not \nrecommended. However, your doctor will assess whether the possible benefit in terms of preventing \nsmallpox would outweigh the potential risks of giving you this vaccine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThere is no information on the effect of IMVANEX on your ability to drive or use machines. \nHowever, it is possible that if you experience any of the side effects listed in section 4, then some of \nthese may affect your ability to drive or use machines (e.g. dizziness). \n \nIMVANEX contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say \nessentially ’sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How IMVANEX is given \n \nYou can be given this vaccine whether or not you have received smallpox vaccination in the past. \n \nThe vaccine will be injected under the skin, preferably into the upper arm, by your doctor or a nurse. It \nmust not be injected into a blood vessel. \n \nIf you have never been vaccinated against smallpox: \n\n• You will receive two injections. \n• The second injection will be given no less than 28 days after the first. \n• Make sure you complete the vaccination course of two injections. \n\n \nIf you have previously been vaccinated against smallpox: \n\n• You will receive one injection. \n• If your immune system is weakened you will receive two injections with the second injection \n\nno less than 28 days after the first. \n \nIf you forget to receive IMVANEX \n \nIf you miss a scheduled injection, tell your doctor or nurse and arrange another visit. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects \nContact a doctor immediately, or go immediately to the emergency department of your nearest \nhospital if you experience any of the following symptoms: \n\n• difficulty in breathing \n• dizziness \n• swelling of the face and neck. \n\n \nThese symptoms may be a sign of a serious allergic reaction. \n \nOther side effects \n \nIf you already have atopic dermatitis, you may experience more intense local skin reactions (such as \nredness, swelling and itching) and other general symptoms (such as headache, muscle pain, feeling \nsick or tired), as well as a flare-up or worsening of your skin condition. \n \nThe most common side effects reported were at the site of injection. Most of them were mild to \nmoderate in nature and resolved without any treatment within seven days. \n \nIf you get any of the following side effects, tell your doctor. \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n• headache, \n• aching muscles, \n• feeling sick, \n• tiredness, \n• pain, redness, swelling, hardness or itching at the injection site. \n\n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n• chills, \n• fever, \n• joint pain, pain in extremities, \n• loss of appetite, \n• lump, discolouration, bruising or warmth at the injection site. \n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\n• nose and throat infection, upper respiratory tract infection, \n• swollen lymph nodes, \n• abnormal sleep, \n• dizziness, abnormal skin sensations, \n• muscle stiffness,  \n• sore throat, runny nose, cough, \n• diarrhea, vomiting,  \n• rash, itch, skin inflammation,  \n• bleeding, irritation,  \n• underarm swelling, feeling unwell, flushing, chest pain, pain in the armpit, \n• increase of cardiac laboratory values (like Troponin I ), liver enzyme increased, white blood \n\ncell count decreased, mean platelet volume decreased. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people): \n• sinus infection, \n• influenza, \n• pink eye, \n• hives (nettle rash), \n• skin discolouration, \n• sweating, \n• skin bruising, \n• night sweats, \n• lump in skin,  \n• back pain,  \n• neck pain, \n• muscle cramps, \n• muscle pain, \n• muscle weakness, \n• swelling of the ankles, feet or fingers, \n• faster heart beat, \n• ear and throat ache, \n• abdominal pain,  \n• dry mouth, \n• spinning sensation (vertigo), \n• migraine, \n• nerve disorder causing weakness, tingling or numbness, \n• drowsiness, \n• scaling, inflammation, abnormal skin sensation, reaction at the injection site, rash, numbness, \n\ndryness, movement impairment, vesicles at the injection site, \n• weakness, \n• influenza like illness, \n• swelling of the face, mouth and throat, \n• white blood cell count increased, \n• bruising. \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store IMVANEX \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the label after Exp.
