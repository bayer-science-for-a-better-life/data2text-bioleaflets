This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIOA 2.5 mg/1.5 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nWhite active film-coated tablets: Each film-coated tablet contains 2.5 mg nomegestrol acetate and \n1.5 mg estradiol (as hemihydrate). \nYellow placebo film-coated tablets: The tablet does not contain active substances. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \nEach white active film-coated tablet contains 57.71 mg of lactose monohydrate. \nEach yellow placebo film-coated tablet contains 61.76 mg of lactose monohydrate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \nActive film-coated tablets: white, round and coded ‘ne’ on both sides. \nPlacebo film-coated tablets: yellow, round and coded ‘p’ on both sides. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOral contraception.  \n \nThe decision to prescribe IOA should take into consideration the individual woman’s current risk \nfactors, particularly those for venous thromboembolism (VTE), and how the risk of VTE with IOA \ncompares with other CHCs (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nOne tablet is to be taken daily for 28 consecutive days. Each pack starts with 24 white active tablets, \nfollowed by 4 yellow placebo tablets. A subsequent pack is started immediately after finishing the \nprevious pack, without a break in daily tablet intake and irrespective of presence or absence of \nwithdrawal bleeding. Withdrawal bleeding usually starts on day 2-3 after intake of the last white tablet \nand may not have finished before the next pack is started. See ‘Cycle control’ in section 4.4. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nAlthough data in renal impaired patients are not available, renal impairment is unlikely to affect the \nelimination of nomegestrol acetate and estradiol. \n \n\n2 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nHepatic impairment \nNo clinical studies have been performed in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Since the metabolism \nof steroid hormones might be impaired in patients with severe hepatic disease, the use of IOA in these \nwomen is not indicated as long as liver function values have not returned to normal (see section 4.3). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \n \nHow to take IOA \nTablets must be taken every day at about the same time without regard to meals. Tablets should be \ntaken with some liquid as needed, and in the order as directed on the blister. Stickers marked with the \n7 days of the week are provided. The woman should choose the sticker that starts with the day she \nbegins taking the tablets and stick it on the blister. \n \nHow to start IOA \nNo preceding hormonal contraceptive use (in the past month) \nTablet-taking has to start on day 1 of the woman’s natural cycle (i.e. the first day of her menstrual \nbleeding). When doing so, no additional contraceptive measures are necessary. \n \nChanging from a combined hormonal contraceptive (combined oral contraceptive (COC), vaginal \nring or transdermal patch) \nThe woman should start with IOA preferably on the day after the last active tablet (the last tablet \ncontaining the active substances) of her previous COC, but at the latest on the day following the usual \ntablet-free or placebo tablet interval of her previous COC. In case a vaginal ring or transdermal patch \nhas been used, the woman should start using IOA preferably on the day of removal, but at the latest \nwhen the next application would have been due. \n \nChanging from a progestogen-only-method (minipill, implant, injectable) or from a \nhormone-medicated Intra Uterine System (IUS) \nThe woman may switch any day from the minipill and IOA should be started on the next day. An \nimplant or IUS may be removed any day, and IOA should be started on the day of its removal. When \nchanging from an injectable, IOA should be started on the day when the next injection would have \nbeen due. In all of these cases, the woman should be advised to additionally use a barrier method until \nshe has completed 7 days of uninterrupted white active tablet-taking. \n \nFollowing first-trimester abortion \nThe woman may start immediately. When doing so, no additional contraceptive measures are necessary. \n \nFollowing delivery or second-trimester abortion \nWomen should be advised to start between day 21 and 28 after delivery or second-trimester abortion. \nWhen starting later, the woman should be advised to additionally use a barrier method until she has \ncompleted 7 days of uninterrupted white active tablet-taking. However, if intercourse has already \noccurred, pregnancy should be excluded before the actual start of COC use or the woman has to wait \nfor her first menstrual period. \nFor breast-feeding women see section 4.6. \n \nManagement of missed tablets \n \nThe following advice only refers to missed white active tablets: \n \nIf the woman is less than 12 hours late in taking any active tablet, contraceptive protection is not \nreduced. The woman should take the tablet as soon as she remembers and should take further tablets at \nthe usual time. \n \n\n3 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nIf she is more than 12 hours late in taking any active tablet, contraceptive protection may be reduced. \nThe management of missed tablets can be guided by the following two basic rules: \n• 7 days of uninterrupted ‘white active tablet’-taking are required to attain adequate suppression \n\nof the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian-axis. \n• The more ‘white active tablets’ are missed and the closer the missed tablets are to the 4 yellow \n\nplacebo tablets, the higher the risk of a pregnancy. \n \nDay 1-7 \nThe user should take the last missed tablet as soon as she remembers, even if this means taking two \ntablets at the same time. She then continues to take tablets at her usual time. In addition, a barrier \nmethod such as a condom should be used for the next 7 days. If intercourse took place in the preceding \n7 days, the possibility of a pregnancy should be considered.  \nDay 8-17 \nThe user should take the last missed tablet as soon as she remembers, even if this means taking two \ntablets at the same time. She then continues to take tablets at her usual time. Provided that the woman \nhas taken her tablets correctly in the 7 days preceding the first missed tablet, there is no need to use \nextra contraceptive precautions. However, if she has missed more than 1 tablet, the woman should be \nadvised to use extra precautions for 7 days. \nDay 18-24 \nThe risk of reduced reliability is imminent because of the forthcoming placebo tablet phase. However, \nby adjusting the tablet-intake schedule, reduced contraceptive protection can still be prevented. By \nadhering to either of the following two options, there is therefore no need to use extra contraceptive \nprecautions, provided that in the 7 days preceding the first missed tablet the woman has taken all tablets \ncorrectly. If this is not the case, she should follow the first of these two options and use extra \nprecautions for the next 7 days as well. \n1. The user should take the last missed tablet as soon as she remembers, even if this means taking \n\ntwo tablets at the same time. She then continues to take tablets at her usual time until the active \ntablets are used up. The 4 placebo tablets from the last row must be discarded. The next blister \npack must be started right away. The user is unlikely to have a withdrawal bleed until the end of \nthe active tablets section of the second pack, but she may experience spotting or breakthrough \nbleeding on tablet-taking days. \n\n2. The woman may also be advised to discontinue active tablet-taking from the current blister pack. \nShe should then take placebo tablets from the last row for up to 4 days, including the days she \nmissed tablets, and subsequently continue with the next blister pack. \n\n \nIf the woman missed tablets and subsequently has no withdrawal bleed in the placebo tablet phase, the \npossibility of a pregnancy should be considered. \n \nYellow placebo tablets missed \nContraceptive protection is not reduced. Yellow tablets from the last (4th) row of the blister can be \ndisregarded. However, the missed tablets should be discarded to avoid unintentionally prolonging the \nplacebo tablet phase. \n \nAdvice in case of gastro-intestinal disturbances \n \nIn case of severe gastro-intestinal disturbance (e.g., vomiting or diarrhoea), absorption of the active \nsubstances may not be complete and additional contraceptive measures should be taken. \nIf vomiting occurs within 3-4 hours after white tablet-taking, a new tablet should be taken as soon as \npossible. The new tablet should be taken within 12 hours of the usual time of tablet-taking if possible. \nIf more than 12 hours elapse, the advice concerning missed tablets, as given in section 4.2 \n\"Management of missed tablets\", is applicable. If the woman does not want to change her normal \ntablet-taking schedule, she has to take the extra white tablet(s) from another pack. \n \nHow to shift periods or how to delay a period \n \nTo delay a period the woman should continue with another blister pack of IOA without taking the \nyellow placebo tablets from her current pack. The extension can be carried on for as long as wished \n\n4 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nuntil the end of the white active tablets in the second pack. Regular intake of IOA is then resumed \nafter the yellow placebo tablets have been taken of the second pack. During the extension the woman \nmay experience breakthrough-bleeding or spotting. \n \nTo shift her periods to another day of the week than the woman is used to with her current scheme, she \ncan be advised to shorten her forthcoming yellow placebo tablet phase with a maximum of 4 days. The \nshorter the interval, the higher the risk that she does not have a withdrawal bleed and may experience \nbreakthrough-bleeding and spotting during the subsequent pack (just as when delaying a period). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nCombined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) should not be used in the following conditions. As no \nepidemiological data are yet available with 17β-estradiol containing CHCs, the contraindications for \nethinylestradiol containing CHCs are considered applicable to the use of IOA. Should any of the \nconditions appear for the first time during IOA use, the medicinal product should be stopped \nimmediately.  \n\n• Presence or risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) \no Venous thromboembolism - current VTE (on anticoagulants) or history of (e.g. deep \n\nvenous thrombosis [DVT] or pulmonary embolism [PE]). \no Known hereditary or acquired predisposition for venous thromboembolism, such as APC-\n\nresistance (including Factor V Leiden), antithrombin-III-deficiency, protein C deficiency, \nprotein S deficiency. \n\no Major surgery with prolonged immobilisation (see section 4.4). \no A high risk of venous thromboembolism due to the presence of multiple risk factors (see \n\nsection 4.4).  \n• Presence or risk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE) \n\no Arterial thromboembolism - current arterial thromboembolism, history of arterial \nthromboembolism (e.g. myocardial infarction) or prodromal condition (e.g. angina \npectoris). \n\no Cerebrovascular disease – current stroke, history of stroke or prodromal condition \n(e.g.transient ischaemic attack, TIA). \n\no Known hereditary or acquired predisposition for arterial thromboembolism, such as \nhyperhomocysteinaemia and antiphospholipid-antibodies (anticardiolipin-antibodies, \nlupus anticoagulant). \n\no History of migraine with focal neurological symptoms. \no A high risk of arterial thromboembolism due to multiple risk factors (see section 4.4) or \n\nto the presence of one serious risk factor such as: \n• diabetes mellitus with vascular symptoms \n• severe hypertension \n• severe dyslipoproteinaemia.  \n\n• Pancreatitis or a history thereof if associated with severe hypertriglyceridaemia. \n• Presence or history of severe hepatic disease as long as liver function values have not returned \n\nto normal. \n• Presence or history of liver tumours (benign or malignant). \n• Known or suspected sex steroid-influenced malignancies (e.g., of the genital organs or the \n\nbreasts). \n• Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.  \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWarnings \n \nIf any of the conditions or risk factors mentioned below is present, the suitability of IOA should be \ndiscussed with the woman .  \n \n\n5 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nIn the event of aggravation, or first appearance of any of these conditions or risk factors, the woman \nshould be advised to contact her doctor to determine whether the use of IOA should be discontinued. \nAll data presented below are based upon epidemiological data obtained with CHCs containing \nethinylestradiol. IOA contains 17β-estradiol. As no epidemiological data are yet available with \nestradiol containing-CHCs, the warnings are considered applicable to the use of IOA. \n \nRisk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) \n• The use of any combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) increases the risk of venous \n\nthromboembolism (VTE) compared with no use. Products that contain levonorgestrel, \nnorgestimate or norethisterone are associated with the lowest risk of VTE. It is not yet \nknown how the risk with IOA compares with these lower risk products. The decision to \nuse any product other than one known to have the lowest VTE risk should be taken only \nafter a discussion with the woman to ensure she understands the risk of VTE with CHCs, \nhow her current risk factors influence this risk, and that her VTE risk is highest in the \nfirst ever year of use. There is also some evidence that the risk is increased when a CHC is \nre-started after a break in use of 4 weeks or more. \n\n• In women who do not use a CHC and are not pregnant about 2 out of 10,000 will develop a \nVTE over the period of one year. However, in any individual woman, the risk may be far \nhigher, depending on her underlying risk factors (see below). \n\n• Epidemiological studies in women who use low dose (<50 µg ethinylestradiol) combined \nhormonal contraceptives have found that out of 10,000 women between 6 and 12 will develop a \nVTE in one year. \n\n• It is estimated that out of 10,000 women who use a levonorgestrel-containing CHC about 61 will \ndevelop a VTE in one year. \n\n• It is not yet known how the risk of VTE with CHCs that contain nomegestrol acetate in \ncombination with estradiol compares with the risk with low dose levonorgestrel-containing \nCHCs. \n\n• The number of VTEs per year with low dose CHCs is fewer than the number expected in \nwomen during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. \n\n• VTE may be fatal in 1-2 % of cases. \n• Extremely rarely, thrombosis has been reported to occur in CHC users in other blood vessels, \n\ne.g. hepatic, mesenteric, renal, or retinal veins and arteries. \n \n\nRisk factors for VTE \nThe risk for venous thromboembolic complications in CHC users may increase substantially in a \nwoman with additional risk factors, particularly if there are multiple risk factors (see table). \n \nIOA is contraindicated if a woman has multiple risk factors that put her at high risk of venous \nthrombosis (see section 4.3). If a woman has more than one risk factor, it is possible that the increase \nin risk is greater than the sum of the individual factors – in this case her total risk of VTE should be \nconsidered. If the balance of benefits and risks is considered to be negative, a CHC should not be \nprescribed (see section 4.3). \n \nTable: Risk factors for VTE \nRisk factor Comment \nObesity (body mass index over 30 kg/m²) Risk increases substantially as BMI rises. \n\n \nParticularly important to consider if other risk \nfactors also present. \n \n\n1 Mid-point of range of 5-7 per 10,000 WY, based on a relative risk for CHCs containing levonorgestrel versus non-use \nof approximately 2.3 to 3.6 \n\n6 \n\n                                                      \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nProlonged immobilisation, major surgery, any \nsurgery to the legs or pelvis, neurosurgery, or \nmajor trauma \n \nNote: Temporary immobilisation including air \ntravel > 4 hours can also be a risk factor for VTE, \nparticularly in women with other risk factors. \n\nIn these situations it is advisable to discontinue \nuse of the pill (in the case of elective surgery at \nleast four weeks in advance) and not resume until \ntwo weeks after complete remobilisation. Another \nmethod of contraception should be used to avoid \nunintentional pregnancy. \n \nAntithrombotic treatment should be considered if \nIOA has not been discontinued in advance. \n \n\nPositive family history (venous thromboembolism \never in a sibling or parent especially at a \nrelatively early age, e.g., before 50) \n\nIf a hereditary predisposition is suspected, the \nwoman should be referred to a specialist for \nadvice before deciding about any CHC use. \n \n\nOther medical conditions associated with VTE Cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus, \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome, chronic \ninflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or \nulcerative colitis) and sickle cell disease \n \n\nIncreasing age  Particularly above 35 years \n \n\n \n• There is no consensus about the possible role of varicose veins and superficial thrombophlebitis \n\nin the onset or progression of venous thrombosis. \n• The increased risk of thromboembolism in pregnancy, and particularly the 6-week period of the \n\npuerperium, must be considered (for information on \"Pregnancy and lactation\" see section 4.6). \n \nSymptoms of VTE (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) \nIn the event of symptoms women should be advised to seek urgent medical attention and to inform the \nhealthcare professional that she is taking a CHC. \n \nSymptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can include: \n\n- unilateral swelling of the leg and/or foot or along a vein in the leg; \n- pain or tenderness in the leg which may be felt only when standing or walking; \n- increased warmth in the affected leg; red or discoloured skin on the leg. \n \n\nSymptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE) can include: \n- sudden onset of unexplained shortness of breath or rapid breathing; \n- sudden coughing which may be associated with haemoptysis; \n- sharp chest pain; \n- severe light headedness or dizziness; \n- rapid or irregular heartbeat. \n \n\nSome of these symptoms (e.g. “shortness of breath”, “coughing”) are non-specific and might be \nmisinterpreted as more common or less severe events (e.g. respiratory tract infections). \nOther signs of vascular occlusion can include: sudden pain, swelling and slight blue discoloration of \nan extremity. \nIf the occlusion occurs in the eye symptoms can range from painless blurring of vision which can \nprogress to loss of vision. Sometimes loss of vision can occur almost immediately. \n \nRisk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE) \nEpidemiological studies have associated the use of CHCs with an increased risk for arterial \nthromboembolism (myocardial infarction) or for cerebrovascular accident (e.g., transient ischaemic \nattack, stroke). Arterial thromboembolic events may be fatal. \n\n \n\n7 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nRisk factors for ATE \nThe risk of arterial thromboembolic complications or of a cerebrovascular accident in CHC users \nincreases in women with risk factors (see table). IOA is contraindicated if a woman has one serious or \nmultiple risk factors for ATE that puts her at high risk of arterial thrombosis (see section 4.3). If a \nwoman has more than one risk factor, it is possible that the increase in risk is greater than the sum of \nthe individual factors – in this case her total risk should be considered. If the balance of benefits and \nrisks is considered to be negative a CHC should not be prescribed (see section 4.3). \n \nTable: Risk factors for ATE \nRisk factor Comment \nIncreasing age \n \n\nParticularly above 35 years \n\nSmoking Women should be advised not to smoke if they \nwish to use a CHC.

No epidemiological data on the risk of cervical cancer in \nusers of IOA are available. \n\n• With the use of the higher-dosed COCs (50 µg ethinylestradiol) the risk of endometrial and \novarian cancer is reduced. Whether this also applies to 17β-estradiol-containing COCs remains \nto be confirmed. \n\n• A meta-analysis from 54 epidemiological studies reported that there is a slightly increased \nrelative risk (RR = 1.24) of having breast cancer diagnosed in women who are currently using \nCOCs. The excess risk gradually disappears during the course of the 10 years after cessation of \nCOC use. Because breast cancer is rare in women under 40 years of age, the excess number of \nbreast cancer diagnoses in current and recent COC users is small in relation to the overall risk of \nbreast cancer. The breast cancers diagnosed in ever-users tend to be less advanced clinically \nthan the cancers diagnosed in never-users. The observed pattern of increased risk may be due to \nan earlier diagnosis of breast cancer in COC users, the biological effects of COCs or a \ncombination of both. \n\n• In rare cases, benign liver tumours, and even more rarely, malignant liver tumours have been \nreported in users of COCs. In isolated cases, these tumours have led to life-threatening intra-\nabdominal haemorrhages. Therefore, a hepatic tumour should be considered in the differential \ndiagnosis when severe upper abdominal pain, liver enlargement or signs of intra-abdominal \nhaemorrhage occur in women taking COCs. \n\n \nOther conditions \n• Women with hypertriglyceridaemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of \n\npancreatitis when using COCs. \n• Although small increases in blood pressure have been reported in many women taking COCs, \n\nclinically relevant increases are rare. A relationship between COC use and clinical hypertension \nhas not been established. However, if a sustained clinically significant hypertension develops \nduring the use of a COC, then it is prudent for the physician to suspend the intake of the tablets \nand treat the hypertension. Where considered appropriate, COC use may be resumed if \nnormotensive values can be achieved with antihypertensive therapy.  \n\n• The following conditions have been reported to occur or deteriorate with both pregnancy and \nCOC use, but the evidence of an association with COC use is inconclusive: jaundice and/or \npruritus related to cholestasis; gallstone formation; porphyria; systemic lupus erythematosus; \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome; Sydenham’s chorea; herpes gestationis; otosclerosis-related \nhearing loss. \n\n• In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms \nof angioedema. \n\n• Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use \nuntil markers of liver function return to normal. Recurrence of cholestatic jaundice which occurred \nfirst during pregnancy or previous use of sex steroids necessitates the discontinuation of COCs. \n\n• Although COCs may have an effect on peripheral insulin resistance and glucose tolerance, there \nis no evidence for a need to alter the therapeutic regimen in diabetics using low-dose COCs \n(containing < 0.05 mg ethinylestradiol). However, diabetic women should be carefully observed \nwhile taking a COC, especially in the first months of use. \n\n• Worsening of depression, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis have been associated with COC \nuse. \n\n• Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. \nWomen with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation \nwhilst taking COCs. \n\n9 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n• Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \nMedical examination/consultation \n \nPrior to the initiation or reinstitution of IOA use a complete medical history (including family history) \nshould be taken and pregnancy must be ruled out. Blood pressure should be measured and a physical \nexamination should be performed, guided by the contraindications (see section 4.3) and warnings (see \nsection 4.4). It is important to draw a woman’s attention to the information on venous and arterial \nthrombosis, including the risk of IOA compared with other CHCs, the symptoms of VTE and ATE, \nthe known risk factors and what to do in the event of a suspected thrombosis. \n \nThe woman should also be instructed to carefully read the user leaflet and to adhere to the advice \ngiven. The frequency and nature of examinations should be based on established practice guidelines \nand be adapted to the individual woman. \n \nWomen should be advised that hormonal contraceptives do not protect against HIV infections (AIDS) \nand other sexually transmitted diseases. \n \nReduced efficacy \n \nThe efficacy of COCs may be reduced in the event of e.g., missed tablets (see section 4.2), gastro-\nintestinal disturbances during active tablet-taking (see section 4.2) or use of concomitant medicinal \nproducts (see section 4.5). \n \nCycle control \n \nWith all COCs, irregular bleeding (spotting or breakthrough bleeding) may occur, especially during \nthe first months of use. Therefore, the evaluation of any irregular bleeding is only meaningful after an \nadaptation interval of about 3 cycles. The percentage of women using IOA experiencing intracyclic \nbleeding after this adaptation period ranged from 15-20 %.  \n \nIf bleeding irregularities persist or occur after previously regular cycles, then non-hormonal causes \nshould be considered and adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to exclude malignancy or \npregnancy. These may include curettage. \n \nThe duration of the withdrawal bleeding in women using IOA is on average 3-4 days. Users of IOA \nmay also miss their withdrawal bleeding although not being pregnant. During clinical trials, absence of \nwithdrawal bleeding ranged over the cycles 1-12 from 18 % to 32 %. In such cases, absence of \nwithdrawal bleeding was not associated with a higher occurrence of breakthrough bleeding/spotting in \nthe subsequent cycles. 4.6 % of the women did not have a withdrawal bleeding in the first three cycles \nof use and the occurrences of absence of withdrawal bleeding in the later cycles of use were high in \nthis subgroup, ranging from 76 % to 87 % of women. 28 % of the women experienced absence of \nwithdrawal bleeding in at least one of the cycles 2, 3 and 4, associated with higher occurrences of \nabsence of withdrawal bleeding in the later cycles of use, ranging from 51 % to 62 %. \n \nIf absence of withdrawal bleeding occurs and IOA has been taken according to the instructions as \ndescribed in section 4.2, it is unlikely that the woman is pregnant. However, pregnancy must be ruled \nout before IOA use is continued, if IOA has not been taken as directed or if two consecutive \nwithdrawal bleedings are missed. \n \nPaediatric population \nIt is unknown whether the amount of estradiol in IOA is sufficient to maintain adequate levels of \nestradiol in adolescents, especially for bone mass accrual (see section 5.2). \n \n\n10 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteractions \n \nInfluence of other medicinal products on IOA \nInteractions between oral contraceptives and enzyme-inducing medicinal products may lead to \nbreakthrough bleeding and even contraceptive failure. \n \nExamples of active substances that induce hepatic enzymes and thus result in increased clearance of \nsex hormones are: phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, bosentan, carbamazepine, rifampicin, and \nmedicinal products or herbal preparations containing St. John’s wort, and, to a lesser extent, \noxcarbazepine, topiramate, felbamate, and griseofulvin. Also HIV protease inhibitors with an inducing \npotential (e.g. ritonavir and nelfinavir) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g. \nnevirapine and efavirenz), may affect hepatic metabolism. \nWith hepatic enzyme-inducing substances, a barrier method should be used during the time of \nconcomitant medicinal product administration and for 28 days after their discontinuation. In case of \nlong-term treatment with hepatic enzyme-inducing substances another method of contraception should \nbe considered. \n \nMedicinal product interaction studies were not performed with IOA, but two studies with rifampicin \nand ketoconazole, respectively, were performed with a higher dosed nomegestrol acetate-estradiol \ncombination (nomegestrol acetate 3.75 mg + 1.5 mg estradiol) in post-menopausal women. \nConcomitant use of rifampicin decreases the AUC0-∞ of nomegestrol acetate by 95 % and increases the \nAUC0-tlast of estradiol by 25 %. Concomitant use of ketoconazole (200 mg single dose) does not \nmodify estradiol metabolism whereas increases in the peak concentration (85 %) and AUC0-∞ (115 %) \nof nomegestrol acetate were observed, which were of no clinical relevance. Similar conclusions are \nexpected in women of childbearing potential. \n \nInfluence of IOA on other medicinal products \nOral contraceptives may affect the metabolism of other medicinal products. Special attention should \nbe paid to the interaction with lamotrigine. \n \nLaboratory tests \n \nThe use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, including \nbiochemical parameters of liver, thyroid, adrenal and renal function, plasma levels of (carrier) \nproteins, e.g., corticosteroid binding globulin and lipid/lipoprotein fractions, parameters of \ncarbohydrate metabolism and parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Changes generally remain \nwithin the normal laboratory range. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nIOA is not indicated during pregnancy. \n \nIf pregnancy occurs while taking IOA, further intake should be stopped. Most epidemiological studies \nhave revealed neither an increased risk of birth defects in infants born to women who used \nethinylestradiol-containing COCs prior to pregnancy, nor a teratogenic effect when ethinylestradiol-\ncontaining COCs were taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. \n \nClinical data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse effect of IOA on the \nfoetus or neonate. \n \nIn animal studies, reproductive toxicity has been observed with the nomegestrol acetate / estradiol \ncombination (see preclinical safety data in section 5.3). \n \n\n11 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nThe increased risk of VTE during the postpartum period should be considered when re-starting IOA \n(see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \nSmall amounts of the contraceptive steroids and/or their metabolites may be excreted with the breast \nmilk, but there is no evidence that this adversely affects infant health. \n \nBreastfeeding may be influenced by COCs as they may reduce the quantity and change the \ncomposition of breast milk. Therefore, the use of COCs should not be recommended until the nursing \nmother has completely weaned her child and an alternative contraceptive method should be proposed \nto women wishing to breastfeed.  \n \nFertility \nIOA is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy. For information on return to fertility, see section 5.1. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed with IOA. \nHowever, no effects on ability to drive and use machines have been observed in users of COCs. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nSix multi-centre clinical trials of up to one year duration were used to evaluate safety of IOA. In total \n3,434 women, aged 18-50, were enrolled and completed 33,828 cycles.  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nAn increased risk of arterial and venous thrombotic and thromboembolic events, including myocardial \ninfarction, stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism has been \nobserved in women using CHCs, which are discussed in more detail in section 4.4. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nPossibly related adverse reactions that have been reported in clinical trials or during postmarketing use \nwith IOA are listed in the table below. \n \nAll adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency; very common (≥ 1/10), common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). \n \n\n \nSystem organ class \n\nAdverse reaction in MedDRA Term1 \n\nVery common Common \n \n\nUncommon \n \n\nRare \n \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n  increased \nappetite, fluid \nretention \n\ndecreased \nappetite \n\nPsychiatric disorders  decreased libido, \ndepression/ \ndepressed mood, \nmood altered \n\n increased libido \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n headache, \nmigraine \n\n cerebrovascular \naccident, \ntransient \nischaemic attack, \ndisturbance in \nattention \n\nEye disorders    contact lens \nintolerance/dry \neye \n\n12 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \nSystem organ class \n\nAdverse reaction in MedDRA Term1 \nVery common Common \n\n \nUncommon \n\n \nRare \n\n \nVascular disorders   hot flush venous \n\nthromboembolism \nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n nausea abdominal \ndistension \n\ndry mouth \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n   cholelithiasis, \ncholecystitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nacne  hyperhydrosis, \nalopecia, \npruritus, dry \nskin, seborrhea \n\nchloasma, \nhypertrichosis \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n  sensation of \nheaviness \n\n \n\nReproductive system \nand breast disorders \n\nabnormal \nwithdrawal \nbleeding \n\nmetrorrhagia, \nmenorrhagia, \nbreast pain, \npelvic pain \n\nhypomenorrhoea, \nbreast swelling, \ngalactorrhoea, \nuterine spasm, \npremenstrual \nsyndrome, breast \nmass, \ndyspareunia, \nvulvovaginal \ndryness \n\nvaginal odour, \nvulvovaginal \ndiscomfort \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\n  irritability, \noedema \n\nhunger \n\nInvestigations  weight increased hepatic enzyme \nincreased \n\n \n\n1The most appropriate MedDRA term to describe a certain adverse reaction is listed.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, progestogens and \nestrogens, fixed combinations, ATC code: G03AA14. \n \nNomegestrol acetate is a highly selective progestogen derived from the naturally occurring steroid \nhormone, progesterone. Nomegestrol acetate has a strong affinity for the human progesterone receptor \nand has an anti-gonadotropic activity, a progesterone receptor-mediated anti-estrogenic activity, a \nmoderate anti-androgenic activity, and is devoid of any estrogenic, androgenic, glucocorticoid or \nmineralocorticoid activity. \n \nThe estrogen contained in IOA is 17β-estradiol, a natural estrogen identical to the endogenous human \n17β-estradiol. \n \nThe contraceptive effect of IOA is based on the interaction of various factors, the most important of \nwhich are seen as the inhibition of ovulation and the changes in the cervical secretion. \n \nIn two randomized, open-label, comparative efficacy-safety trials, more than 3,200 women have been \ntreated for up to 13 consecutive cycles with IOA and more than 1,000 women with drospirenone 3 mg \n– ethinylestradiol 30 μg (21/7 regimen). \nIn the IOA group, acne was reported by 15.4 % of the women (versus 7.9 % in the comparator group), \nweight increased was reported by 8.6 % of the women (versus 5.7 % in the comparator group), and \nabnormal withdrawal bleeding (predominantly absence of withdrawal bleeding) was reported by \n10.5 % of the women (versus 0.5 % in the comparator group). \n \nIn the clinical trial performed with IOA in the European Union the following Pearl Indices for the age \nclass 18-35 years were calculated: \n \nMethod failure: 0.40 (upper limit 95 % confidence interval 1.03) \nMethod and user failure: 0.38 (upper limit 95 % confidence interval 0.97) \n \nIn the clinical trial performed with IOA in the United States the following Pearl Indices for the age \nclass 18-35 years were calculated: \n \nMethod failure: 1.22 (upper limit 95 % confidence interval 2.18) \nMethod and user failure: 1.16 (upper limit 95 % confidence interval 2.08) \n \nIn a randomized, open label trial, 32 women were treated for 6 cycles with IOA. \nAfter discontinuation of IOA, return to ovulation in the first 28 days after last tablet intake was \nobserved in 79 % of the women.  \n \nEndometrial histology was investigated in a subgroup of women (n=32) in one clinical study after \n13 cycles of treatment. There were no abnormal results. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data on efficacy and safety are available in adolescents below 18 years. Available pharmacokinetic \ndata are described in section 5.2. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNomegestrol acetate \n \nAbsorption \nOrally administered nomegestrol acetate is rapidly absorbed.  \n\n14 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nMaximum plasma concentrations of nomegestrol acetate of about 7 ng/ml are reached at 2 h after \nsingle administration. The absolute bioavailability of nomegestrol acetate after a single dose is 63 %. \nNo clinically relevant effect of food was observed on the bioavailability of nomegestrol acetate. \n \nDistribution \nNomegestrol acetate is extensively bound to albumin (97-98 %), but does not bind to sex hormone \nbinding globulin (SHBG) or corticoid binding globulin (CBG). The apparent volume of distribution of \nnomegestrol acetate at steady-state is 1,645 ± 576 l. \n \nBiotransformation \nNomegestrol acetate is metabolized into several inactive hydroxylated metabolites by liver \ncytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 with possible contribution of CYP2C19 \nand CYP2C8. Nomegestrol acetate and its hydroxylated metabolites undergo extensive phase 2 \nmetabolism to form glucuronide- and sulphate conjugates. The apparent clearance at steady state is \n26 l/h. \n \nElimination \nThe elimination half-life (t1/2) is 46 h (ranging from 28-83 h) at steady state. The elimination half-life \nof metabolites was not determined. \nNomegestrol acetate is excreted via urine and feces. Approximately 80 % of the dose is excreted in \nurine and feces within 4 days. Excretion of nomegestrol acetate was nearly complete after 10 days and \namounts excreted were higher in feces than in urine. \n \nLinearity \nDose-linearity was observed in the range 0.625-5 mg (assessed in fertile and post-menopausal \nwomen). \n \nSteady-state conditions \nThe pharmacokinetics of nomegestrol acetate are not influenced by SHBG.  \nSteady-state is achieved after 5 days. Maximum plasma concentrations of nomegestrol acetate of about \n12 ng/ml are reached 1.5 h after dosing. Average steady state plasma concentrations are 4 ng/ml. \n \nDrug drug interactions \nNomegestrol acetate causes in vitro no notable induction or inhibition of any cytochrome P450 \nenzymes and has no clinically relevant interaction with the P-gp transporter.  \n \nEstradiol \n \nAbsorption \nEstradiol is subject to a substantial first-pass effect after oral administration. The absolute \nbioavailability is about 1 %. No clinically relevant effect of food was observed on the bioavailability \nof estradiol. \n \nDistribution \nThe distribution of exogenous and endogenous estradiol is similar. Estrogens are widely distributed in \nthe body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estradiol \ncirculates in the blood bound to SHBG (37 %) and to albumin (61 %), while only approximately \n1-2 % is unbound. \n \nBiotransformation \nOral exogenous estradiol is extensively metabolized. The metabolism of exogenous and endogenous \nestradiol is similar. Estradiol is rapidly transformed in the gut and the liver in several metabolites, \nmainly estrone, which are subsequently conjugated and undergo entero-hepatic circulation. There is a \ndynamic equilibrium between estradiol, estrone and estrone-Sulfate due to various enzymatic activities \nincluding estradiol-dehydrogenases, sulfotransferases and aryl sulfatases. Oxidation of estrone and \nestradiol involves cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly CYP1A2, CYP1A2 (extra hepatic), CYP3A4, \nCYP3A5, and CYP1B1 and CYP2C9. \n\n15 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \nElimination \nEstradiol is rapidly cleared from the circulation. Due to metabolism and enterohepatic circulation, a \nlarge circulating pool of estrogen sulfates and glucuronides is present. This results in a highly variable \nbaseline-corrected elimination half-life of estradiol, which is calculated to be 3.6 ± 1.5 h, after \nintravenous administration. \n \nSteady-state conditions \nMaximum serum concentrations of estradiol are about 90 pg/ml and are reached 6 h after dosing. \nAverage serum concentrations are 50 pg/ml and these estradiol levels correspond with the early and \nlate phase of a woman’s menstrual cycle. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of nomegestrol acetate (primary objective) after single oral dosing of IOA in \nhealthy postmenarcheal female adolescents and adult subjects were similar. However, after single oral \ndosing, for the estradiol component (secondary objective), the exposure was 36 % lower in adolescents \nversus adult subjects. The clinical relevance of this result is unknown. \n \nEffect of renal impairment \nNo studies were performed to evaluate the effect of renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of IOA. \n \nEffect of hepatic impairment \nNo studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of IOA. \nHowever, steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. \n \nEthnic groups \nNo formal studies were performed to assess pharmacokinetics in ethnic groups. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeat dose toxicity studies with estradiol, nomegestrol acetate or combination have indicated \nexpected estrogenic and gestagen effects. \nReproductive toxicity studies performed with the combination have shown foetotoxicity which is \nconsistent with estradiol exposure. \nGenotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies were not conducted with the combination. Nomegestrol \nacetate is not genotoxic. \nHowever, it must be borne in mind that sex steroids can promote the growth of certain hormone-\ndependent tissues and tumours. \n \n \n6.

What IOA is and what it is used for \n \nIOA is a contraceptive pill that is used to prevent pregnancy. \n \n• All 24 white film-coated tablets are active tablets that contain a small amount of two different \n\nfemale hormones. These are nomegestrol acetate (a progestogen) and estradiol (an oestrogen).  \n• The 4 yellow tablets are inactive tablets that do not contain hormones and are called placebo \n\ntablets. \n• Contraceptive pills that contain two different hormones, like IOA, are called ‘combined pills’. \n• Estradiol, the oestrogen in IOA, is identical to the hormone produced by your ovaries during a \n\nmenstrual cycle. \n• Nomegestrol acetate, the progestogen in IOA, is derived from the hormone progesterone. \n\nProgesterone is produced by your ovaries during a menstrual cycle. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use IOA \n \nGeneral notes \n \nBefore you start using IOA you should read the information on blood clots (thrombosis) in section 2. It \nis particularly important to read the symptoms of a blood clot – see section 2 “Blood clots”). \n \nBefore you can begin taking IOA, your doctor will ask you some questions about your personal health \nhistory and that of your close relatives. The doctor will also measure your blood pressure and, \ndepending upon your personal situation, may also carry out some other tests. \n \nIn this leaflet, several situations are described where you should stop taking the pill, or where the \nreliability of the pill may be decreased. In such situations you should not have sexual intercourse or \nyou should take extra non-hormonal contraceptive precautions, e.g., use a condom or another barrier \nmethod. Do not use rhythm or temperature methods. These methods can be unreliable because the pill \nalters the usual changes in temperature and cervical mucus that occur during the menstrual cycle. \n \nIOA, like other hormonal contraceptives, does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) or any \nother sexually transmitted disease. \n \nWhen you should not use IOA \n You should not use IOA if you have any of the conditions listed below. If you do have any of the \nconditions listed below, you must tell your doctor. Your doctor will discuss with you what other form \nof birth control would be more appropriate. \n \n• if you have (or have ever had) a blood clot in a blood vessel  of your legs (deep vein thrombosis, \n\nDVT), your lungs (pulmonary embolus, PE) or other organs; \n• if you know you have a disorder affecting your blood clotting - for instance, protein C \n\ndeficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin – III deficiency, Factor V Leiden or \nantiphospholipid antibodies; \n\n• if you need an operation or if you are off your feet for a long time (see section ‘Blood clots); \n• if you have ever had a heart attack or a stroke; \n• if you have (or have ever had) angina pectoris (a condition that causes severe chest pain and \n\nmay be a first sign of a heart attack ) or transient ischaemic attack (TIA – temporary stroke \nsymptoms); \n\n• if you have any of the following diseases that may increase your risk of a clot in the arteries:  \n– severe diabetes with blood vessel damage \n– very high blood pressure \n– a very high level of fat in the blood (cholesterol or triglycerides); \n– a condition known as hyperhomocysteinaemia \n\n• if you have (or have ever had) a type of migraine called ‘migraine with aura’; \n\n29 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n• if you have (had) inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) associated with high levels of fat \nin your blood; \n\n• if you have (had) severe liver disease and your liver is not yet working normally; \n• if you have (had) a benign or malignant tumour in the liver; \n• if you have (had), or if you may have, cancer of the breast or the genital organs; \n• if you have any unexplained bleeding from the vagina. \n• if you are allergic to estradiol or nomegestrol acetate, or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n \nIf any of these conditions appear for the first time while using IOA, stop taking it at once and tell your \ndoctor. In the meantime, use a non-hormonal contraceptive. See also ‘General Notes’ in section 2 \nabove.  \n \nWhen to take special care with IOA \n \nWhen should you contact your doctor? \n \nSeek urgent medical attention \n \n• if you notice possible signs of a blood clot that may mean you are suffering from a blood clot in \n\nthe leg (i.e., deep vein thrombosis), a blood clot in the lung (i.e., pulmonary embolism), a heart \nattack or a stroke (see “Blood clots” section below). \n\nFor a description of the symptoms of these serious side effects please go to “How to recognise a blood \nclot”. \n• if you notice any changes in your own health, especially involving any of the items mentioned \n\nin this leaflet (see also in section 2 ‘When you should not use IOA’; do not forget about the \nchanges in the health of your immediate family); \n\n• if you feel a lump in your breast; \n• if you experience symptoms of angioedema such as swollen face, tongue and/or throat and/or \n\ndifficulty swallowing or hives together with difficulty breathing; \n• if you are going to use other medicines (see also in section 2 ‘Other medicines and IOA’); \n• if you are to be immobilised or are to have surgery (tell your doctor at least four weeks in \n\nadvance); \n• if you have unusual, heavy vaginal bleeding; \n• if you forgot two tablets or more in the first week of the blister pack and had intercourse in the \n\nseven days before (see also in section 3 ‘If you forget to take IOA’); \n• if you have severe diarrhoea; \n• if you miss periods and suspect you may be pregnant (do not start the next blister pack until \n\nyour doctor tells you, see also in section 3 ‘If you have missed one or more periods’). \n \nTell your doctor if any of the following conditions apply to you.  \nIf the condition develops, or gets worse while you are using IOA, you should also tell your doctor. \n• if you have hereditary angioedema. Consult your doctor immediately if you experience \n\nsymptoms of angioedema such as swollen face, tongue and/or throat and/or difficulty \nswallowing or hives, together with difficulty breathing. Products containing oestrogens may \ninduce or worsen symptoms of angioedema; \n\n• if a close relative has or has ever had breast cancer; \n• if you have epilepsy (see in section 2 ‘Other medicines and IOA’); \n• if you have liver disease (for instance jaundice) or gallbladder disease (for instance gallstones); \n• if you have diabetes; \n• if you have depression; \n• if you have Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis (chronic inflammatory bowel disease); \n• if you have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE - a disease affecting your natural defense \n\nsystem); \n• if you have haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS - a disorder of blood clotting causing failure of \n\nthe kidneys); \n\n30 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n• if you have sickle cell anaemia (an inherited disease of the red blood cells); \n• if you have elevated levels of fat in the blood (hypertriglyceridaemia) or a positive family \n\nhistory for this condition. Hypertriglyceridaemia has been associated with an increased risk of \ndeveloping pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas); \n\n• if you need an operation or if you are off your feet for a long time (see in section 2 ‘Blood \nclots). \n\n• if you have just given birth you are at an increased risk of blood clots. You should ask your \ndoctor how soon after delivery you can start taking IOA. \n\n• if you have an inflammation in the veins under the skin (superficial thrombophlebitis); \n• if you have varicose veins. \n• if you have a condition that occurred for the first time or worsened during pregnancy or \n\nprevious use of sex hormones (e.g. hearing loss, porphyria [a disease of the blood], herpes \ngestationis [skin rash with vesicles during pregnancy], Sydenham’s chorea [a disease of the \nnerves in which sudden movements of the body occur] (see in section 2 ‘When should you \ncontact your doctor’); \n\n• if you have (or have ever had) chloasma [yellowish-brown pigment patches, so called \n‘pregnancy patches’, particularly on the face]. If so, avoid too much exposure to the sun or \nultraviolet light;  \n\n \nBLOOD CLOTS \n \nUsing a combined hormonal contraceptive such as IOA increases your risk of developing a blood clot \ncompared with not using one. In rare cases a blood clot can block blood vessels and cause serious \nproblems.   \n \nBlood clots can develop \n• in veins (referred to as ‘venous thrombosis’, ‘venous thromboembolism’ or VTE) \n• in the arteries (referred to as an ‘arterial thrombosis’, ‘arterial thromboembolism’ or ATE). \nRecovery from blood clots is not always complete. Rarely, there may be serious lasting effects or, very \nrarely, they may be fatal. \n \nIt is important to remember that the overall risk of a harmful blood clot due to IOA is small. \n \nHOW TO RECOGNISE A BLOOD CLOT \n \nSeek urgent medical attention if you notice any of the following signs or symptoms. \n \nAre you experiencing any of these signs? What are you possibly \n\nsuffering from? \n \n\n• swelling of one leg or along a vein in the leg or foot especially when \naccompanied by: \n\n• pain or tenderness in the leg which may be felt only when \nstanding or walking \n\n• increased warmth in the affected leg \n• change in colour of the skin on the leg e.g. turning pale, red or \n\nblue \n \n\nDeep vein thrombosis \n\n31 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n• sudden unexplained breathlessness or rapid breathing; \n• sudden cough without an obvious cause, which may bring up blood; \n• sharp chest pain which may increase with deep breathing; \n• severe light headedness or dizziness; \n• rapid or irregular heartbeat; \n• severe pain in your stomach; \n \nIf you are unsure, talk to a doctor as some of these symptoms such as \ncoughing or being short of breath may be mistaken for a milder condition \nsuch as a respiratory tract infection (e.g., a ‘common cold’). \n \n\nPulmonary embolism \n\nSymptoms most commonly occur in one eye: \n• immediate loss of vision or \n• painless blurring of vision which can progress to loss of vision \n \n\nRetinal vein thrombosis \n(blood clot in the eye) \n\n• chest pain, discomfort, pressure, heaviness \n• sensation of squeezing or fullness in the chest, arm or below the \n\nbreastbone; \n• fullness, indigestion or choking feeling; \n• upper body discomfort radiating to the back, jaw, throat, arm and \n\nstomach; \n• sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness; \n• extreme weakness, anxiety, or shortness of breath; \n• rapid or irregular heartbeats \n \n\nHeart attack \n\n• sudden weakness or numbness of the face, arm or leg, especially on \none side of the body; \n\n• sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding; \n• sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; \n• sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination; \n• sudden, severe or prolonged headache with no known cause; \n• loss of consciousness or fainting with or without seizure. \n \nSometimes the symptoms of stroke can be brief with an almost immediate \nand full recovery, but you should still seek urgent medical attention as you \nmay be at risk of another stroke. \n \n\nStroke \n\n• swelling and slight blue discolouration of an extremity; \n• severe pain in your stomach (acute abdomen). \n\n \n\nBlood clots blocking \nother blood vessels \n \n\n \nBLOOD CLOTS IN A VEIN \n \nWhat can happen if a blood clot forms in a vein? \n• The use of combined hormonal contraceptives has been connected with an increase in the risk of \n\nblood clots in the vein (venous thrombosis). However, these side effects are rare. Most \nfrequently, they occur in the first year of use of a combined hormonal contraceptive. \n\n• If a blood clot forms in a vein in the leg or foot it can cause a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). \n• If a blood clot travels from the leg and lodges in the lung it can cause a pulmonary embolism. \n• Very rarely a clot may form in a vein in another organ such as the eye (retinal vein thrombosis). \n \nWhen is the risk of developing a blood clot in a vein highest? \nThe risk of developing a blood clot in a vein is highest during the first year of taking a combined \nhormonal contraceptive for the first time. The risk may also be higher if you restart taking a combined \nhormonal contraceptive (the same product or a different product) after a break of 4 weeks or more. \n\n32 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \nAfter the first year, the risk gets smaller but is always slightly higher than if you were not using a \ncombined hormonal contraceptive. \n \nWhen you stop IOA your risk of a blood clot returns to normal within a few weeks. \n \nWhat is the risk of developing a blood clot? \nThe risk depends on your natural risk of VTE and the type of combined hormonal contraceptive you \nare taking. \n \nThe overall risk of a blood clot in the leg or lung (DVT or PE) with IOA is small. \n• Out of 10,000 women who are not using any combined hormonal contraceptive and are not \n\npregnant, about 2 will develop a blood clot in a year. \n• Out of 10,000 women who are using a combined hormonal contraceptive that contains \n\nlevonorgestrel, norethisterone, or norgestimate, about 5-7 will develop a blood clot in a year. \n• It is not yet known how the risk of a blood clot with IOA compares to the risk with a combined \n\nhormonal contraceptive that contains levonorgestrel. \n• The risk of having a blood clot will vary according to your personal medicinal history (see \n\n“Factors that increase your risk of a blood clot” below). \n \n Risk of developing a blood clot \n\nin a year \nWomen who are not using a combined hormonal pill and are not \npregnant \n \n\nAbout 2 out of 10,000 women \n\nWomen using a combined hormonal contraceptive pill containing \nlevonorgestrel, norethisterone or norgestimate \n \n\nAbout 5-7 out of 10,000 women \n\nWomen using IOA Not yet known \n \nFactors that increase your risk of a blood clot in a vein \nThe risk of a blood clot with IOA is small but some conditions will increase the risk. Your risk is \nhigher: \n• if you are very overweight (body mass index or BMI over 30kg/m2); \n• if one of your immediate family has had a blood clot in the leg, lung or other organ at a young \n\nage (e.g., below the age of about 50). In this case you could have a hereditary blood clotting \ndisorder; \n\n• if you need to have an operation, or if you are off your feet for a long time because of an injury \nor illness, or you have your leg in a cast. The use of IOA may need to be stopped several weeks \nbefore surgery or while you are less mobile. If you need to stop IOA ask your doctor when you \ncan start using it again. \n\n• as you get older (particularly above about 35 years); \n• if you gave birth less than a few weeks ago \n \nThe risk of developing a blood clot increases the more conditions you have. \nAir travel (>4 hours) may temporarily increase your risk of a blood clot, particularly if you have some \nof the other factors listed. \nIt is important to tell your doctor if any of these conditions apply to you, even if you are unsure. Your \ndoctor may decide that IOA needs to be stopped. \nIf any of the above conditions change while you are using IOA, for example a close family member \nexperiences a thrombosis for no known reason or you gain a lot of weight, tell your doctor. \n \n\n33 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nBLOOD CLOTS IN AN ARTERY \n \nWhat can happen if a blood clot forms in an artery? \nLike a blood clot in a vein, a clot in an artery can cause serious problems. For example, it can cause a \nheart attack or a stroke. \n \nFactors that increase your risk of a blood clot in an artery \n \nIt is important to note that the risk of a heart attack or stroke from using IOA is very small but can \nincrease: \n \n• with increasing age (beyond about 35 years); \n• if you smoke. When using a combined hormonal contraceptive like IOA you are advised to stop \n\nsmoking. If you are unable to stop smoking and are older than 35 your doctor may advise you to \nuse a different type of contraceptive; \n\n• if you are overweight; \n• if you have high blood pressure; \n• if a member of your immediate family has had a heart attack or stroke at a young age (less than \n\nabout 50). In this case you could also have a higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke; \n• if you, or someone in your immediate family, have a high level of fat in the blood (cholesterol \n\nor triglycerides); \n• if you get migraines, especially migraines with aura; \n• if you have a problem with your heart (valve disorder, disturbance of the rhythm called atrial \n\nfibrillation) \n• if you have diabetes. \n \nIf you have more than one of these conditions or if any of them are particularly severe, the risk of \ndeveloping a blood clot may be increased even more. \nIf any of the above conditions change while you are using IOA, for example, you start smoking, a \nclose family member experiences a thrombosis for no known reason or you gain a lot of weight, tell \nyour doctor. \n \nCancer \nBreast cancer has been found slightly more often in women using combined pills, but it is not known \nwhether this is caused by the combined pills. For example, it may be that tumours are found more in \nwomen on combined pills because they are examined by the doctor more often. After stopping the \ncombined pill, the increased risk gradually reduces.  \nIt is important to check your breasts regularly and you should contact your doctor if you feel any \nlump. You should also tell your doctor if a close relative has, or ever had breast cancer (see section 2 \n“When to take special care with IOA”). \n \nIn rare cases, benign (noncancerous) liver tumours, and in even fewer cases malignant (cancerous) \nliver tumours have been reported in pill users. Contact your doctor if you have unusual severe \nabdominal pain. \n \nCervical cancer is caused by an infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). It has been reported \nto occur more often in women using the pill for a long time. It is unknown if this finding is due to the \nuse of hormonal contraceptives or to other factors, such as difference in sexual behaviour. \n \nLaboratory tests \nIf you are having any blood or urinary test, tell your doctor that you are using IOA as it may affect the \nresults of some tests. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nNo data on efficacy and safety are available in adolescents below 18 years. \n \n\n34 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nOther medicines and IOA \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. \nAlso tell any other doctor or dentist who prescribes another medicine (or the dispensing pharmacist) \nthat you use IOA. They can tell you if you need to take additional contraceptive precautions (barrier \nmethod) and, if so, for how long. \n• There are medicines that can make IOA less effective in preventing pregnancy, or can cause \n\nunexpected bleeding. These include medicines used to treat: \n– epilepsy (e.g. primidone, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, \n\ntopiramate, felbamate); \n– tuberculosis (e.g. rifampicin); \n– HIV infections (e.g. ritonavir, nevirapine, nelfinavir, efavirenz); \n– other infectious diseases (e.g. griseofulvin); \n– high blood pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs (bosentan). \n\n• The herbal product St. John’s wort may also stop IOA from working properly. If you want to \nuse herbal products containing St. John’s wort while you are already using IOA you should \nconsult your doctor first. \n\n• Some medicines can increase the levels of the active substances of IOA in the blood. The \neffectiveness of the pill is maintained, but tell your doctor if you are using anti-fungal medicines \ncontaining ketoconazole. \n\n• IOA may also interfere with the working of other medicines – such as the anti-epileptic \nlamotrigine. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIOA must not be used by women who are pregnant, or who think they may be pregnant. If you get \npregnant while using IOA you should stop using IOA and contact your doctor. \nIf you want to stop IOA because you want to get pregnant, see in section 3 ‘If you stop taking IOA’. \n \nIOA is not usually recommended for use during breast-feeding. If you wish to use the pill while \nbreast-feeding, please seek the advice of your doctor. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIOA is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nIOA contains lactose \nIOA contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some \nsugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to use IOA \n \nWhen and how to take the tablets \nThe IOA blister contains 28 tablets: 24 white tablets with the active substances (number 1-24) and 4 \nyellow tablets without active substances (number 25-28). \nEach time you start a new blister of IOA, take the number 1 white active tablet in the left-hand top \ncorner (see ‘Start’). Choose from the 7 stickers with day indicators the one in the grey column that \nbegins with your starting day. For example, if you start on a Wednesday, use the day label sticker that \nstarts with ‘WED’. Stick it on the blister, just above the row of white active tablets where it reads \n‘Place day label here’. This allows you to check whether you took your daily tablet. \nTake one tablet each day at about the same time, with some water if necessary. \nFollow the direction of the arrows on the blister, so use the white active tablets first and then the \nyellow placebo tablets. \nYour period will start during the 4 days that you use the yellow placebo tablets (so-called withdrawal \nbleeding). Usually it will start 2-3 days after the last white active tablet and may not have finished \nbefore the next blister is started. \n\n35 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nStart taking your next blister immediately after the last yellow tablet, even if your period hasn’t \nfinished. This means that you will always start a new blister on the same day of the week, and also that \nyou have your period on roughly the same days each month. \nSome users may not have their period every month during the intake of the yellow tablets. If you have \ntaken IOA every day according to these directions, it is unlikely that you are pregnant (see also section \n3 ‘If you have missed one or more periods’). \n \nStarting your first pack of IOA \n \nWhen no hormonal contraceptive has been used in the past month \nStart taking IOA on the first day of your cycle (i.e. the first day of your menstrual bleeding). IOA will \nwork immediately. You do not need to use an additional contraceptive method. \n \nWhen changing from another combined hormonal contraceptive (combined pill, vaginal ring, or \ntransdermal patch) \nYou can start taking IOA the day after you have taken the last tablet from your present pill blister (this \nmeans no tablet-free break). If your present pill blister also contains inactive (placebo) tablets you can \nstart IOA on the day after taking the last active tablet (if you are not sure which this is, ask your doctor \nor pharmacist). You can also start later, but never later than the day following the tablet-free break of \nyour present pill (or the day after the last inactive tablet of your present pill). In case you use a vaginal \nring or transdermal patch, it is best to start using IOA on the day you remove the ring or patch. You \ncan also start, at the latest, on the day you would have started using the next ring or patch. \nIf you follow these instructions, it is not necessary to use an additional contraceptive method. \n \nWhen changing from a progestogen-only pill (minipill) \nYou can stop taking the minipill any day and start taking IOA the next day. But if you are having \nintercourse, make sure you also use a barrier method of contraception for the first 7 days that you are \ntaking IOA. \n \nWhen changing from a progestogen-only injectable, implant or a hormone-medicated intrauterine \nsystem (IUS) \nStart using IOA when your next injection is due or on the day that your implant or IUS is removed. \nBut if you are having intercourse, make sure you also use a barrier method of contraception for the \nfirst 7 days that you are taking IOA. \n \nAfter having a baby \nYou can start IOA between 21 and 28 days after having a baby. If you start later than day 28, you \nshould also use a barrier method of contraception during the first 7 days of IOA use. If, after having a \nbaby, you have had sexual intercourse before starting IOA, be sure that you are not pregnant or wait \nuntil the next menstrual period. If you want to start IOA after having a baby and are breast-feeding, \nsee also section 2 ‘Pregnancy and Breast-feeding’. \nAsk your doctor what to do if you are not sure when to start.  \n \nAfter a miscarriage or an abortion \nFollow the advice of your doctor. \n \nIf you take more IOA than you should \nThere have been no reports of serious harmful effects from taking too many IOA tablets at one time. If \nyou have taken several tablets at a time, you may have nausea, vomiting or vaginal bleeding. If you \ndiscover that a child has taken IOA, ask your doctor for advice. \n \nIf you forget to take IOA \nThe following advice only refers to missed white active tablets. \n• if you are less than 12 hours late in taking a tablet, the reliability of the pill is maintained. Take \n\nthe tablet as soon as you remember and take the next tablets at the usual time. \n• if you are more than 12 hours late in taking any tablet, the reliability of the pill may be \n\nreduced. The more consecutive tablets you have missed, the higher the risk that the \n\n36 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\ncontraceptive efficacy is decreased. There is a particularly high risk of becoming pregnant if \nyou miss white active tablets at the beginning or at the end of the blister. Therefore you should \nfollow the rules given below. \n\n \nDay 1-7 of white active tablet intake (see picture and schedule) \nTake the last white active missed tablet as soon as you remember (even if this means taking two \ntablets at the same time) and take the next tablet at the usual time. However, use a barrier method as an \nextra precaution for the next 7 days. \nIf you had sexual intercourse in the week before missing the tablets, there is a possibility of becoming \npregnant. So contact your doctor immediately. \n \nDay 8-17 of white active tablet intake (see picture and schedule) \nTake the last missed tablet as soon as you remember (even if this means taking two tablets at the same \ntime) and take the next tablets at the usual time. The protection against pregnancy is not reduced, and \nyou do not need to take extra precautions. However, if you have missed more than 1 tablet, you should \nuse extra precautions for 7 days. \n \nDay 18-24 of white active tablet intake (see picture and schedule) \nThere is a particularly high risk of becoming pregnant if you miss white active tablets close to the \nyellow placebo tablet interval. By adjusting your intake schedule this higher risk can be prevented. \nTwo options can be followed: \nOption 1) \nTake the last missed white active tablet as soon as you remember (even if this means taking two \ntablets at the same time) and take the next tablets at the usual time. Start the next blister as soon as the \nwhite active tablets in the current blister are finished, so skip the yellow placebo tablets. You may not \nhave your period until you take the yellow placebo tablets at the end of the second blister, but you may \nhave spotting (drops or flecks of blood) or breakthrough bleeding while taking the white active tablets. \nOption 2) \nStop taking the white active tablet immediately and go directly to the yellow placebo tablet interval. At \nthe end of the placebo tablet interval, start with the next blister. \n \nIf you cannot remember how many white active tablets you have missed, follow the first option, use a \nbarrier method as a precaution for the next 7 days and contact your doctor. \nIf you have forgotten to take white active tablets in a blister, and you do not have the expected \nmonthly period while taking the yellow placebo tablets from the same blister, you may be pregnant. \nConsult your doctor before you start with the next blister. \n \nYellow placebo tablets missed \nThe last 4 yellow tablets of the fourth row are placebo tablets which do not contain active substances. \nIf you forgot to take one of these tablets the reliability of IOA is maintained. Throw away the yellow \nplacebo tablet(s) you missed and continue taking the next tablets at the usual time. \n \nPicture \n \n\n \n \n\n37 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nSchedule: if you are more than 12 hours late taking white tablets \n\n \n \nIf you vomit or have severe diarrhoea \nIf you vomit within 3-4 hours of taking a white active tablet, or you have severe diarrhoea, the active \ningredients of your IOA tablet may not have been completely absorbed into your body. The situation \nis similar to if you forget a white active tablet. After vomiting or diarrhoea, you must take another \nwhite active tablet from a reserve blister as soon as possible. If possible take it within 12 hours of \nwhen you normally take your pill. If this is not possible or 12 hours have passed, you should follow \nthe advice given under \"If you forget to take IOA\". If you have severe diarrhoea, please tell your \ndoctor.  \nThe yellow tablets are placebo tablets which do not contain active substances. If you vomit or have \nsevere diarrhoea within 3-4 hours of taking a yellow tablet, the reliability of IOA is maintained. \n \nIf you want to delay your period \nYou can delay your period by not taking the yellow placebo tablets and going straight to a new blister \nof IOA. You may experience light or menstruation-like bleeding while using this second blister. When \nyou wish your period to begin during the second blister, stop taking the white active tablets and start \ntaking the yellow placebo tablets. After finishing the 4 yellow placebo tablets from the second blister, \nstart with the next (third) blister. \n \nIf you want to change the starting day of your period \nIf you take the tablets according to the instructions, then your period will begin during the placebo \ndays. If you have to change this day, reduce the number of placebo days – when you take the yellow \nplacebo tablets – (but never increase them – 4 is the maximum). For example, if you start taking the \nplacebo tablets on Friday, and you want to change this to a Tuesday (3 days earlier) you must start a \nnew blister 3 days earlier than usual. You may not have any bleeding during the shortened period of \nyellow placebo tablet intake. While using the next blister you may have some spotting (drops or flecks \nof blood) or breakthrough bleeding on white active tablet-taking days. \nIf you are not sure what to do, consult your doctor. \n \nIf you have unexpected bleeding \nWith all combined pills, for the first few months, you can have some irregular vaginal bleeding \n(spotting or breakthrough bleeding) between your periods. You may need to use sanitary protection, \nbut keep taking your tablets as usual. Irregular vaginal bleeding usually stops once your body has \nadjusted to the pill (usually after about 3 months). If bleeding continues, becomes heavy or starts \nagain, contact your doctor. \n \n\n38 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nIf you have missed one or more periods \nClinical trials with IOA have shown that you may occasionally miss your regular monthly period after \nDay 24. \n• If you have taken all the tablets correctly, and you have not vomited or had severe diarrhoea, or \n\nused other medicines, then it is very unlikely that you are pregnant. Keep taking IOA as usual. \nSee also in section 3 ‘If you vomit or have severe diarrhoea’ or in section 2 ‘Other medicines \nand IOA’. \n\n• If you have not taken all the tablets correctly, or if your expected period does not happen twice \nin a row, you may be pregnant. Contact your doctor immediately. Do not start the next blister of \nIOA until your doctor has checked that you are not pregnant. \n\n \nIf you stop taking IOA \nYou can stop taking IOA at any time. If you do not want to become pregnant, first ask your doctor \nabout other methods of birth control. \nIf you stop taking IOA because you want to get pregnant, you are recommended to wait until you have \nhad a natural period before trying to conceive. This will help you to determine when the baby will be \ndue. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, IOA can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \nIf you get any side effect, particularly if severe or persistent, or have any change to your health that \nyou think may be due to IOA, please talk to your doctor. \n \nAn increased risk of blood clots in your veins (venous thromboembolism (VTE)) or blood clots in \nyour arteries (arterial thromboembolism (ATE)) is present for all women taking combined hormonal \ncontraceptives. For more detailed information on the different risks from taking combined hormonal \ncontraceptives, please see section 2, “What you need to know before you use IOA”. \nThe following side effects have been linked with the use of IOA: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n• acne \n• changes to menstrual periods (e.g. absence or irregularity) \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n• decreased interest in sex; depression/depressed mood; mood changes \n• headache or migraine \n• feeling sick (nausea) \n• heavy menstrual periods; breast pain; pelvic pain \n• weight gain \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n• increased appetite; fluid retention (oedema) \n• hot flush \n• swollen abdomen \n• increased sweating; hair loss; itching; dry skin; oily skin \n• heaviness in limbs \n• regular but scanty periods; larger breasts; breast lump; milk production while not pregnant; \n\npremenstrual syndrome; pain during intercourse; dryness in the vagina or vulva; spasm of the \nuterus \n\n• irritability \n• increased liver enzymes \n \n\n39 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people):  \n• harmful blood clots in a vein or artery, for example: \n\no in a leg or foot (i.e., DVT) \no in a lung (i.e., PE) \no heart attack \no stroke \no mini-stroke or temporary stroke-like symptoms known as a transient ischaemic attack \n\n(TIA) \no blood clots in the liver, stomach/intestine, kidneys or eye. \n\nThe chance of having a blood clot may be higher if you have any other conditions that increase this \nrisk (See section 2 for more information on the conditions that increase risk for blood clots and the \nsymptoms of a blood clot.) \n• decreased appetite \n• increased interest in sex \n• disturbance in attention \n• dry eye; contact lens intolerance \n• dry mouth \n• golden brown pigment patches, mostly in the face; excessive hair growth \n• vaginal smell; discomfort in the vagina or vulva \n• hunger \n• disease of the gallbladder \n \nAllergic (hypersensitive) reactions have been reported in users of IOA, but the frequency cannot be \nestimated from the available data. \n \nFurther information on the possible side effect changes to menstrual periods (e.g. absence or irregular) \nduring the use of IOA is described in section 3 ‘When and how to take the tablets’, ‘If you have \nunexpected bleeding’ and ‘If you have missed one or more periods’). \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet.  \nYou can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By \nreporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store IOA \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the blister and carton after EXP. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nThis medicine does not require any special storage conditions. \n \nCombined pills (including IOA tablets) no longer required should not be disposed via wastewater or \nthe municipal sewage system. The hormonal active ingredients in the tablet may have harmful effects \nif they reach the aquatic environment. Return them to a pharmacy or dispose them in another safe way \naccording to local requirements. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n\n40 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n6.
