NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nQutenza 179 mg cutaneous patch\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach 280 cm2 cutaneous patch contains a total of 179 mg of capsaicin or 640 micrograms of capsaicin \nper cm2 of patch.\n\nExcipient with known effect\n\nEach 50 g tube of cleansing gel for Qutenza contains 0.2 mg/g butylhydroxyanisole (E320).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nCutaneous patch.\n\nEach patch is 14 cm x 20 cm (280 cm2) and consists of an adhesive side containing the active \nsubstance and an outer surface backing layer. The adhesive side is covered with a removable, clear, \nunprinted, diagonally cut, release liner. The outer surface of the backing layer is imprinted with \n\u2018capsaicin 8%\u2019.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nQutenza is indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in adults either alone or in \ncombination with other medicinal products for the treatment of pain.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nThe Qutenza cutaneous patch should be applied by a physician or by a health care professional under \nthe supervision of a physician.\n\nPosology\n\nThe cutaneous patch should be applied to the most painful skin areas (using up to a maximum of \n4 patches).  The painful area should be determined by the physician and marked on the skin. Qutenza \nmust be applied to intact, non-irritated, dry skin, and allowed to remain in place for 30 minutes for the \nfeet (e.g. HIV-associated neuropathy, painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy) and 60 minutes for other \nlocations (e.g. postherpetic neuralgia). Qutenza treatments may be repeated every 90 days, as \nwarranted by the persistence or return of pain.\n\nThe treatment area may be pre-treated with a topical anaesthetic or the patient may be administered an \noral analgesic prior to application of Qutenza to reduce potential application related discomfort. The \ntopical anaesthetic should be applied to cover the entire Qutenza treatment area and surrounding 1 to \n2 cm. In clinical trials, patients were pre-treated with topical lidocaine (4%), lidocaine \n(2.5%)/prilocaine (2.5%) or with 50 mg of tramadol. Topical anaesthetics should be removed prior to \napplying Qutenza and the skin washed and dried thoroughly.\n\n\n\n3\n\nRenal and/or hepatic impairment\n\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Qutenza in children from birth to 18 years has not been established. No \ndata are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nCutaneous use only.\n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product\nIt is advisable to administer Qutenza in a well ventilated treatment area.\n\nNitrile gloves should be worn at all times while handling Qutenza and cleaning treatment areas. Latex \ngloves should NOT be worn as they do not provide adequate protection. Use of a mask and protective \nglasses is recommended, particularly during application and removal of the patch.\n\nThese precautions should be taken to avoid unintentional contact with the patches or other materials \nthat have come in contact with the treated areas. This may result in transient erythema and burning \nsensation (with mucous membranes being particularly susceptible), eye pain, eye and throat irritation \nand cough. \n\nPatches should not be held near eyes or mucous membranes.\n\nIf necessary, hairs in the affected area should be clipped to promote patch adherence (do not shave). \nThe treatment area(s) should be gently washed with soap and water. Following hair removal and \nwashing, the skin should be thoroughly dried.\n\nInstructions for use\n\nQutenza is a single use patch and can be cut to match the size and shape of the treatment area. Qutenza \nshould be cut prior to removal of the release liner. The release liner should NOT be removed until just \nprior to application. There is a diagonal cut in the release liner to aid in its removal. A section of the \nrelease liner should be peeled and folded and the adhesive side of the printed patch placed on the \ntreatment area. The patch should be held in place. The release liner should slowly and carefully be \npeeled from underneath with one hand while the patch should simultaneously be smoothed onto the \nskin with the other to ensure that there is complete contact between the patch and the skin, with no air \nbubbles and no moisture.\n\nWhen treating feet, Qutenza patches can be wrapped around the dorsal, lateral and plantar surfaces of \neach foot to completely cover the treatment area.\n\nTo ensure Qutenza maintains contact to the treatment area, stretchable socks or rolled gauze may be \nused.\n\nThe Qutenza patches should be removed gently and slowly by rolling them inward to minimize the \nrisk of aerosolisation of capsaicin. After removal of Qutenza, cleansing gel should be applied liberally \nto the treatment area and left on for at least one minute. Cleansing gel should be wiped off with dry \ngauze to remove any remaining capsaicin from the skin. After the cleansing gel has been wiped off, \nthe area should be gently washed with soap and water.\n\nPatients experiencing pain during and after patch application should be provided with supportive \ntreatment (see section 4.4).\nFor instructions on handling and disposal of the treatment materials see section 6.6.\n\n\n\n4\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nDermal assessment\n\nQutenza must be used only on dry, intact (unbroken) skin and not on the face, above the hairline of the \nscalp, and/or in proximity to mucous membranes. In patients with painful diabetic peripheral \nneuropathy, a careful visual examination of the feet should be undertaken prior to each application of \nQutenza and at subsequent clinic visits to detect skin lesions related to underlying neuropathy and\nvascular insufficiency.\n\nSensory function\n\nReductions in sensory function have been reported following administration of Qutenza. Decreases in \nsensory functions are generally minor and temporary (including to thermal and sharp stimuli), \nhowever, a single case of persistent hypoesthesia has been reported in clinical studies in painful \ndiabetic neuropathy.  For this case a relationship with Qutenza could not be excluded. Caution should \nbe exercised in patients with reduced sensation in the feet and in those at increased risk for such \nchanges in sensory function. All patients with pre-existing sensory deficits should be clinically \nassessed for signs of sensory loss to prior to each application of Qutenza. If sensory loss is detected or \nworsens, Qutenza treatment should be reconsidered.\n\nMonitoring and management of application site reactions\n\nApplication site reactions, such as transient local applications site burning, pain, erythema and pruritus \nare common or very common. In addition, there have been reported cases of burns, including second \ndegree burns, in patients treated with capsaicin patches (see section 4.8). In patients reporting severe \npain, the patch should be removed and the skin examined for chemical burn.\n\nUnintended exposure\n\nIf Qutenza comes in contact with skin not intended to be treated, cleansing gel should be applied for \none minute and wiped off with dry gauze to remove any remaining capsaicin from the skin surface.  \nAfter the cleansing gel has been wiped off, the area should be gently washed with soap and water. If \nburning of eyes, skin, or airway occurs, the affected individual should be removed from the vicinity of \nQutenza.  Eyes or mucous membranes should be flushed or rinsed with water. Appropriate medical \ncare should be provided if shortness of breath develops.\n\nIncrease in blood pressure\n\nAs a result of treatment-related increases in pain, transient increases in blood pressure (on average \n< 8.0 mm Hg) may occur during and shortly after the Qutenza treatment. Blood pressure should be \nmonitored during the treatment procedure. For patients with unstable or poorly controlled hypertension \nor a history of cardiovascular disease, the risk of adverse cardiovascular events due to the potential \nstress of the procedure should be considered prior to initiating Qutenza treatment. Particular attention \nshould be given to diabetic patients with comorbidities of coronary artery disease, hypertension and \ncardiovascular autonomic neuropathy.\n\nTreatment-related discomfort\n\nPatients experiencing pain during and after patch application should be provided with supportive \ntreatment such as local cooling (such as a cool compress) or oral analgesics (i.e. short acting opioids).\n\n\n\n5\n\nPatients using high doses of opioids may not respond to oral opioid analgesics when used for acute \npain during and following the treatment procedure. A thorough history should be reviewed prior to \ninitiating treatment and an alternative pain reduction strategy put in place prior to Qutenza treatment in \npatients with suspected high opioid tolerance.\n\nCleansing gel\n\nThe cleansing gel for Qutenza contains butylhydroxyanisole, which may cause local skin reactions \n(e.g. contact dermatitis) or irritation of the eyes and mucous membranes.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo formal interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed as only transient low \nlevels of systemic absorption have been shown to occur with Qutenza.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of capsaicin in pregnant women. \nBased on human pharmacokinetics, which show transient, low systemic exposure to capsaicin, the \nlikelihood that Qutenza increases the risk of developmental abnormalities when given to pregnant \nwomen is very low.  However, caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether capsaicin/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of capsaicin/metabolites in milk \n(for details see 5.3).\n\nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.\n\nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Qutenza.\n\nFertility\n\nThere is no data in humans available on fertility. A reproductive toxicology study in rats showed a \nreduction in the number and percent of motile sperm and the number of pregnancies (see section 5.3). \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nQutenza has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions were transient local application site burning, pain, \nerythema and pruritus.  \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nIn Table 1 below all adverse reactions, which occurred at an incidence greater than control and in \nmore than one patient in controlled clinical trials in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), painful \nHuman Imunodeficiency Virus \u2013 Associated Neuropathy (HIV-AN) and painful diabetic peripheral \nneuropathy, are listed by system organ class and frequency: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 \n\n\n\n6\n\nto < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1: Tabulated list of adverse reactions\nSystem organ class and \n\nfrequency\nAdverse reaction\n\nInfections and infestations\n\nUncommon Herpes zoster\n\nNervous system disorders\n\nCommon Burning sensation\n\nUncommon Dysgeusia, hypoaesthesia\n\nEye disorders\n\nUncommon Eye irritation\n\nCardiac disorders\n\nUncommon First degree atrio-ventricular (AV) block, tachycardia, palpitations\n\nVascular disorders\n\nCommon Hypertension\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders\n\nCommon: Cough\n\nUncommon Throat irritation\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nCommon Nausea\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders\n\nCommon Pruritus\n\nMusculoskeletal and \n\nconnective tissue disorders\n\nCommon Pain in extremity, muscle spasms\n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions\n\nVery common Application site pain, application site erythema\n\nCommon\n\nApplication site pruritus, application site papules, application site vesicles, \n\napplication site oedema, application site swelling, application site dryness, \n\nperipheral oedema\n\nUncommon\n\nApplication site urticaria, application site paraesthesia, application site \n\ndermatitis, application site hyperaesthesia, application site inflammation, \n\napplication site reaction, application site irritation, application site bruising, \n\nInvestigations\n\nCommon Increased blood pressure\n\nInjury, poisoning and \n\nprocedural complications\n\nNot known\nBurns second degree, accidental exposure (including eye pain, eye and \n\nthroat irritation and cough)\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions were transient, self limiting and usually mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled \ntrials, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 2.0% for patients receiving Qutenza and \n0.9% for patients receiving control.\n\n\n\n7\n\nTemporary, minor changes in heat detection (1\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C) and sharp sensations were detected at the \nQutenza application site in clinical trials with healthy volunteers.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo case of overdose has been reported. Qutenza is required to be administered by a physician or under \nthe supervision of a physician. Therefore, overdosing is unlikely to occur. Overdose may be associated \nwith severe application site reactions, e.g. application site pain, application site erythema, application \nsite pruritus. In case of suspected overdose, the patches should be removed gently, cleansing gel \nshould be applied for one minute and then wiped off with dry gauze and the area should be gently \nwashed with soap and water. Supportive measures should be taken as clinically needed. There is no \nantidote to capsaicin.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anaesthetics, other local anaesthetics, ATC code: N01BX04\n\nMechanism of action\n\nCapsaicin, or 6-nonenamide, N-[(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) methyl]-8-methyl, (6E), is a highly \nselective agonist for the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1). The initial effect of \ncapsaicin is the activation of TRPV1-expressing cutaneous nociceptors, which results in pungency and \nerythema due to the release of vasoactive neuropeptides.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nFollowing capsaicin exposure, cutaneous nociceptors become less sensitive to a variety of stimuli. \nThese later-stage effects of capsaicin are frequently referred to as \u201cdesensitization\u201d and are thought to \nunderlie the pain relief. Sensations from non TRPV1-expressing cutaneous nerves are expected to \nremain unaltered, including the ability to detect mechanical and vibratory stimuli. Capsaicin-induced \nalterations in cutaneous nociceptors are reversible and it has been reported and observed that normal \nfunction (the detection of noxious sensations) returns within weeks in healthy volunteers.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nEfficacy of a single 30-minute application of Qutenza to the feet has been shown in controlled clinical \ntrials conducted in patients with painful Human Imunodeficiency Virus \u2013 Associated Neuropathy\n(HIV-AN) and painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Efficacy of a single 60-minute application of \nQutenza to locations other than the feet has been shown in controlled clinical trials conducted in \npatients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Pain reduction was observed at week 1 in PHN, week 2 in \nHIV-AN and week 3 in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. For all three aetiologies efficacy was \nmaintained throughout the 12-week study period. For painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy consistent \nand reproducible efficacy has been demonstrated with repeated treatments during a 52-week period.\n\nThe safety profile of Qutenza in diabetic patients was consistent with that seen in the non-diabetic \npopulation. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8\n\nQutenza has been shown to be effective when used alone or when used in combination with systemic \nmedicinal products for neuropathic pain.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe capsaicin contained in Qutenza is intended for delivery into the skin.  In vitro data (active \nsubstance dissolution and skin permeation assays) demonstrate that the rate of release of capsaicin \nfrom Qutenza is linear during the application time. Based on in vitro studies, approximately 1% of \ncapsaicin is estimated to be absorbed into the epidermal and dermal layers of skin during one-hour \napplications. As the amount of capsaicin released from the patch per hour is proportional to the surface \narea of application, this amounts to an estimated total maximum possible dose for a 1000 cm2 area of \napplication of approximately 7 mg. Assuming 1000 cm2 of patch area delivers approximately 1% of \ncapsaicin from the patch to a 60 kg person, the maximum potential exposure to capsaicin is \napproximately 0.12 mg/kg, once every 3 months.\n\nAccording to the EC Scientific Committee on Food, the average European oral intake of capsaicin is \n1.5 mg/day (0.025 mg/kg/day for a 60 kg person) and the highest dietary exposure is 25 to 200 mg/day \n(up to 3.3 mg/kg/day for a 60 kg person).\n\nPharmacokinetic data in humans showed transient, low (< 5 ng/ml) systemic exposure to capsaicin in \nabout one third of PHN patients, in 3% of patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathyand in \nno HIV-AN patients following 60-minute applications of Qutenza. No data are available following \n30-minute treatments. In general, the proportions of PHN patients with systemic exposure to capsaicin \nincreased with larger treatment areas and with longer treatment durations. The highest concentration of \ncapsaicin detected in patients treated for 60 minutes was 4.6 ng/mL, which occurred immediately after \nQutenza removal. Most quantifiable levels were observed at the time of Qutenza removal, with a clear \ntrend towards disappearance by 3 to 6 hours after Qutenza removal. No detectable levels of \nmetabolites were observed in any subject.\n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients treated for 60 and 90 minutes indicated that \ncapsaicin levels in plasma peaked around 20 minutes after Qutenza removal and declined very rapidly, \nwith a mean elimination half-life of about 130 minutes.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single-dose toxicity, and repeated-dose toxicity.\n\nGenotoxicity studies performed with capsaicin show a weak mutagenic response in the mouse \nlymphoma assay and negative responses in the Ames, mouse micronucleus and chromosomal \naberrationin human peripheral blood lymphocytes assays.\n\nA carcinogenicity study performed in mice indicates that capsaicin is not carcinogenic.\n\nA reproductive toxicology study conducted in rats showed a statistically significant reduction in the \nnumber and percent of motile sperms in rats treated 3 hours/day beginning 28 days before \ncohabitation, through cohabitation and continuing through the day before sacrifice. Although neither \nstatistically significant nor dose dependent, the Fertility Index and the number of pregnancies per \nnumber of rats in cohabitation were reduced in all capsaicin-treated groups.\n\nA teratology study conducted in rabbits did not show any potential for embryofetal toxicity. Delays in \nskeletal ossification (reductions in ossified metatarsals) were observed in a rat teratology study at dose \nlevels higher than human therapeutic levels; the significance of this finding for humans is unknown. \nPeri- and post-natal toxicology studies, conducted in rats do not show potential for reproductive \ntoxicity. Lactating rats exposed to Qutenza daily for 3 hours showed measurable levels of capsaicin in \nthe mothers\u2019 milk.\n\n\n\n9\n\nA mild sensitization was seen in a cutaneous sensitization study with guinea pigs.\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n24\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nQutenza 179 mg cutaneous patch\ncapsaicin\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n\uf0b7 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor.\n\uf0b7 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\uf0b7 If you get any side effects talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Qutenza is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before Qutenza is used\n3. How to use Qutenza\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Qutenza\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Qutenza is and what it is used for\n\nQutenza contains capsaicin and belongs to a group of medicines called anaesthetics. \nQutenza is indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in adults either alone or in \ncombination with other medicines for the treatment of pain.\n\nQutenza is used to relieve pain in people who have nerve pain due to damaged nerves in the skin. \nDamaged nerves in your skin may occur as a result of a variety of diseases such as shingles, HIV \ninfection, diabetes, certain medicines and other conditions. You may experience pain relief between 1 \nand 3 weeks after treatment.\n\n2. What you need to know before Qutenza is used\n\nDo not use Qutenza\n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to capsaicin, chilli peppers or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor before using Qutenza\n\nDo not use Qutenza on any part of your head or face.\n\nDo not use Qutenza on broken skin or open wounds.\n\nDo not touch Qutenza or other materials that have come in contact with the treated areas as it may \ncause burning and stinging. Do not touch your eyes, mouth or other sensitive areas as it may cause \nirritation and pain. Sniffing or inhaling close to the Qutenza patches may cause coughing, throat \nirritation or sneezing.\n\nIt is usual for the skin to sting or become red and burn during and after Qutenza treatment for a short \nwhile. Because of the pain, your blood pressure may go up and therefore, your doctor will measure \n\n\n\n25\n\nyour blood pressure several times during your treatment. If you experience a lot of pain, your doctor \nwill apply local cooling or give you medicine for pain. If you experience very severe pain, ask your \ndoctor to remove the patch. \n\nGenerally small, short-term changes in the ability to feel when something is hot or sharp have been \nseen after use of capsaicin.\n\nIf you have unstable or poorly controlled high blood pressure or had heart problems, your doctor will\nconsider the risk of side effects to your heart or blood pressure due to the potential stress of the \nprocedure before treating you with Qutenza.\n\nIf you are using high doses of opioids, you may not respond to oral opioid analgesics when used for\nacute pain during and following the treatment procedure. In this case, your doctor will use other \nmeasures to reduce your pain following Qutenza treatment.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n\nQutenza is not recommended for treatment in patients under 18 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and Qutenza\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Qutenza acts \nlocally on your skin and is not expected to influence other medicines.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nQutenza should be used with caution if you are pregnant. You should discontinue breastfeeding before \ntreatment with Qutenza is started. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or \nare planning to have a baby ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nThere are no studies of the effects of Qutenza on the ability to drive and use machines. When using \nQutenza, only very small amounts of the active substance may be present in the blood stream for a \nvery short time. Therefore, Qutenza is unlikely to have any direct effects on your ability to concentrate\nor your ability to drive or use machinery.\n\nCleansing gel for Qutenza contains butylhydroxyanisole\n\nThe cleansing gel for Qutenza contains butylhydroxyanisole which may cause local skin reactions (e.g. \ncontact dermatitis), or irritation of the eyes and mucous membranes.\n\n3. How to use Qutenza\n\nQutenza should only be applied by your doctor or by a nurse under the supervision of your doctor.\n\nNo more than 4 patches should be used at the same time.\n\nQutenza is for use on your skin.\n\nYour doctor will mark the most painful areas on your skin with a pen or marker.\n\nBefore placing the Qutenza patches on the skin, the treatment area(s) will be washed with soap and \nwater and dried. Hair in treatment areas will be clipped.\n\n\n\n26\n\nBefore placing the Qutenza patches on the skin, your doctor or nurse may apply a numbing gel or \ncream or give you an oral pain medicine to reduce potential stinging. The gel or cream should be \nremoved prior to applying Qutenza and the skin washed and dried thoroughly.\n\nYour doctor or nurse may wear gloves, and sometimes a mask and protective glasses, while handling\nthe Qutenza patches. Do not sniff or inhale close to the Qutenza patches as this may cause coughing or\nsneezing. \n\nQutenza may be cut into smaller pieces to fit the treatment area. Your doctor or nurse will remove the \npatches after 30 minutes if you\u2019re being treated for nerve pain on your feet or 60 minutes if you\u2019re \nbeing treated for nerve pain on other parts of your body.\n\nIt may take between 1 to 3 weeks before you experience pain relief with Qutenza. If after that time you \nstill have a lot of pain, please talk to your doctor.\n\nQutenza therapy may be repeated at 90-day intervals, if necessary.\n\nYou may be given pain medicines to take for the pain you experience with Qutenza therapy.\n\nIt is common for the skin to sting or become red and burn during Qutenza treatment.\n\nDisposable socks may be worn on top of the Qutenza patches if your feet are being treated.\n\nSometimes your doctor or nurse may put a bandage on top of the Qutenza patch to keep the patch \nfirmly on your skin.\n\nDo not attempt to remove the patch yourself. Your doctor or nurse will remove it for you.\nAt the end of the Qutenza treatment your doctor or nurse will clean the treated skin with cleansing gel \nfrom a tube supplied with the kit. Cleansing gel will be left on your skin for one minute and then \nwiped off to remove any remaining medicine that may be left on your skin after treatment. After the\ncleansing gel has been wiped off, the area will be gently washed with soap and water.\n\nDo not touch the patch with your hands.\nDo not touch your eyes, mouth or other sensitive areas. If you accidentally touch the Qutenza patch \nor treated skin before cleansing gel is applied it may burn and/or sting. Call your doctor immediately.\n\nDo not take Qutenza patches away from the clinic.\n\nDo not use Qutenza patches at home.\n\nIf Qutenza is used longer than it should\n\nOverdosing is unlikely to occur. However, if Qutenza is applied longer than it should you might \nexperience severe application site reactions like pain, redness and itching.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.

not use qutenza on any part of your head or face. do not use qutenza on broken skin or open wounds. do not touch qutenza or other materials that have come in contact with the treated areas as it may cause burning and stinging. do not touch your eyes, mouth or other sensitive areas as it may cause irritation and pain. sniffing or inhaling close to the qutenza patches may cause coughing, throat irritation or sneezing. it is usual for the skin to sting or become red and burn during and after qutenza treatment for a short while. because of the pain, your blood pressure may go up and therefore, your doctor will measure 25 your blood pressure several times during your treatment. if you experience a lot of pain, your doctor will apply local cooling or give you medicine for pain. if you experience very severe pain, ask your doctor to remove the patch. generally small, short-term changes in the ability to feel when something is hot or sharp have been seen after use of capsaicin. if you have unstable or poorly controlled high blood pressure or had heart problems, your doctor will consider the risk of side effects to your heart or blood pressure due to the potential stress of the procedure before treating you with qutenza. if you are using high doses of opioids, you may not respond to oral opioid analgesics when used for acute pain during and following the treatment procedure. in this case, your doctor will use other measures to reduce your pain following qutenza treatment. children and adolescents qutenza is not recommended for treatment in patients under 18 years of age. other medicines and qutenza tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. qutenza acts locally on your skin and is not expected to influence other medicines. pregnancy and breast-feeding qutenza should be used with caution if you are pregnant. you should discontinue breastfeeding before treatment with qutenza is started. if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. driving and using machines there are no studies of the effects of qutenza on the ability to drive and use machines. when using qutenza, only very small amounts of the active substance may be present in the blood stream for a very short time. therefore, qutenza is unlikely to have any direct effects on your ability to concentrate or your ability to drive or use machinery. cleansing gel for qutenza contains butylhydroxyanisole the cleansing gel for qutenza

only be applied by your doctor or by a nurse under the supervision of your doctor. no more than 4 patches should be used at the same time. qutenza is for use on your skin. your doctor will mark the most painful areas on your skin with a pen or marker. before placing the qutenza patches on the skin, the treatment area(s) will be washed with soap and water and dried. hair in treatment areas will be clipped. before placing the qutenza patches on the skin, your doctor or nurse may apply a numbing gel or cream or give you an oral pain medicine to reduce potential stinging. the gel or cream should be removed prior to applying qutenza and the skin washed and dried thoroughly. your doctor or nurse may wear gloves, and sometimes a mask and protective glasses, while handling the qutenza patches. do not sniff or inhale close to the qutenza patches as this may cause coughing or sneezing. qutenza may be cut into smaller pieces to fit the treatment area. your doctor or nurse will remove the patches after 30 minutes if you're being treated for nerve pain on your feet or 60 minutes if you're being treated for nerve pain on other parts of your body. it may take between 1 to 3 weeks before you experience pain relief with qutenza. if after that time you still have a lot of pain, please talk to your doctor. qutenza therapy may be repeated at 90-day intervals, if necessary. you may be given pain medicines to take for the pain you experience with qutenza therapy. it is common for the skin to sting or become red and burn during qutenza treatment. disposable socks may be worn on top of the qutenza patches if your feet are being treated. sometimes your doctor or nurse may put a bandage on top of the qutenza patch to keep the patch firmly on your skin. do not attempt to remove the patch yourself. your doctor or nurse will remove it for you. at the end of the qutenza treatment your doctor or nurse will clean the treated skin with cleansing gel from a tube supplied with the kit. cleansing gel will be left on your skin for one minute and then wiped off to remove any remaining medicine that may be left on your skin after treatment. after the cleansing gel has been wiped off, the area will be gently washed with soap and water. do not touch the patch with your hands. do not touch your eyes, mouth or other sensitive areas. if you accidentally touch the qutenza patch or treated skin before cleansing gel is applied it may burn and/or sting. call your doctor immediately. do not take qutenza patches away from the clinic. do not use qutenza patches at home. if qutenza is used longer than it should overdosing is unlikely to occur. however, if qutenza is applied longer than it should you might experience severe application site reactions like pain, redness and itching. if you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "qutenza", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0},
