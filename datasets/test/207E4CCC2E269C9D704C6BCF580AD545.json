NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nPraxbind 2.5 g/50 mL solution for injection/infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach mL of solution for injection/infusion contains 50 mg idarucizumab.\n\nEach vial contains 2.5 g idarucizumab in 50 mL.\n\nIdarucizumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary cells.\n\nExcipients with known effect\n\nEach vial contains 2 g sorbitol and 25 mg sodium in 50 mL (see section 4.4).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection/infusion\n\nClear to slightly opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPraxbind is a specific reversal agent for dabigatran and is indicated in adult patients treated with Pradaxa\n(dabigatran etexilate) when rapid reversal of its anticoagulant effects is required:\n\uf0b7 For emergency surgery/urgent procedures;\n\uf0b7 In life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nRestricted to hospital use only.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose is 5 g idarucizumab (2 vials of 2.5 g/50 mL).\n\nIn a subset of patients, recurrence of plasma concentrations of unbound dabigatran and concomitant \nprolongation of clotting tests have occurred up to 24 hours after administration of idarucizumab (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nAdministration of a second 5 g dose of idarucizumab may be considered in the following situations:\n\uf0b7 recurrence of clinically relevant bleeding together with prolonged clotting times, or\n\uf0b7 if potential re-bleeding would be life-threatening and prolonged clotting times are observed, or\n\uf0b7 patients require a second emergency surgery/urgent procedure and have prolonged clotting times.\n\nRelevant coagulation parameters are activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), diluted thrombin time \n(dTT) or ecarin clotting time (ECT) (see section 5.1).\n\nA maximum daily dose has not been investigated.\n\n\n\n3\n\nRestarting antithrombotic therapy\nPradaxa (dabigatran etexilate) treatment can be re-initiated 24 hours after administration of idarucizumab, if \nthe patient is clinically stable and adequate haemostasis has been achieved.\n\nAfter administration of idarucizumab, other antithrombotic therapy (e.g. low-molecular weight heparin) can \nbe started at any time, if the patient is clinically stable and adequate haemostasis has been achieved.\n\nAbsence of antithrombotic therapy exposes patients to the thrombotic risk of their underlying disease or\ncondition.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients aged 65 years and above (see section 5.2).\n\nPatients with renal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required in renally impaired patients. Renal impairment did not impact the reversal \neffect of idarucizumab (see section 5.2).\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic injury (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Praxbind in children below the age of 18 years have not been established.\nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nIntravenous use.\n\nPraxbind (2 vials of 2.5 g/50 mL) is administered intravenously as two consecutive infusions over \n5 to 10 minutes each or as a bolus injection.\n\nFor additional instructions for use and handling see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nNone.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nIdarucizumab binds specifically to dabigatran and reverses its anticoagulant effect. It will not reverse the \neffects of other anticoagulants (see section 5.1).\n\nPraxbind treatment can be used in conjunction with standard supportive measures, which should be \nconsidered as medically appropriate.\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded.\n\n\n\n4\n\nHypersensitivity\n\nThe risk of using Praxbind in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylactoid reaction) to \nidarucizumab or to any of the excipients needs to be weighed cautiously against the potential benefit of such \nan emergency treatment. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration \nof Praxbind should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.\n\nHereditary fructose intolerance\n\nThe recommended dose of Praxbind contains 4 g sorbitol as an excipient. In patients with hereditary fructose \nintolerance, parenteral administration of sorbitol has been associated with reports of hypoglycemia, \nhypophosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, increase in uric acid, acute liver failure with breakdown of excretory \nand synthetic function, and death. Therefore, in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance the risk of \ntreatment with Praxbind must be weighed against the potential benefit of such an emergency treatment. If \nPraxbind is administered in these patients, intensified medical care during Praxbind exposure and within \n24 hours of exposure is required.\n\nThromboembolic events\n\nPatients being treated with dabigatran have underlying disease states that predispose them to thromboembolic \nevents. Reversing dabigatran therapy exposes patients to the thrombotic risk of their underlying disease. To \nreduce this risk, resumption of anticoagulant therapy should be considered as soon as medically appropriate\n(see section 4.2).\n\nUrinary protein testing\n\nPraxbind causes transient proteinuria as a physiologic reaction to renal protein overflow after bolus/short \nterm application of 5 g idarucizumab intravenously (see section 5.2). The transient proteinuria is not \nindicative of renal damage, which should be taken into account for urine testing.\n\nSodium content\n\nThis medicinal product contains 50 mg sodium per dose, equivalent to 2.5% of the WHO recommended \nmaximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo formal interaction studies with Praxbind and other medicinal products have been performed. Based on \nthe pharmacokinetic properties and the high specificity in binding to dabigatran, clinically relevant \ninteractions with other medicinal products are considered unlikely.\n\nPreclinical investigations with idarucizumab have shown no interactions with \n\uf0b7 volume expanders.\n\uf0b7 coagulation factor concentrates, such as prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs, e.g. 3 factor and \n\n4 factor), activated PCCs (aPCCs) and recombinant factor VIIa.\n\uf0b7 other anticoagulants (e.g. thrombin inhibitors other than dabigatran, factor Xa inhibitors including \n\nlow-molecular weight heparin, vitamin K-antagonists, heparin). Thus idarucizumab will not reverse \nthe effects of other anticoagulants.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data for the use of idarucizumab in pregnant women. Reproductive and developmental toxicity \nstudies have not been performed, given the nature and the intended clinical use of the medicinal product. \nPraxbind may be used during pregnancy, if the expected clinical benefit outweighs the potential risks.\n\n\n\n5\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether idarucizumab/metabolites are excreted in human milk.\n\nFertility\n\nThere are no data on the effect of idarucizumab on fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNot relevant.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nIn a phase III study the safety of Praxbind has been evaluated in 503 patients, who had uncontrolled bleeding \nor required emergency surgery or procedures and were under treatment with Pradaxa (dabigatran etexilate), \nas well as in 224 volunteers in phase I studies. One paediatric patient was treated in the context of a\npaediatric safety trial. Furthermore, 359 patients were enrolled in a global idarucizumab administration \nsurveillance program to collect data on usage patterns in a real-world-setting.\n\nNo adverse reactions have been identified.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no clinical experience with overdoses of idarucizumab.\n\nThe highest single dose of idarucizumab studied in healthy subjects was 8 g. No safety signals have been \nidentified in this group.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: all other therapeutic products, antidotes, ATC code: V03AB37\n\nMechanism of action\n\nIdarucizumab is a specific reversal agent for dabigatran. It is a humanised monoclonal antibody fragment \n(Fab) that binds to dabigatran with very high affinity, approximately 300-fold more potent than the \nbinding affinity of dabigatran for thrombin. The idarucizumab-dabigatran complex is characterised by a \nrapid on-rate and extremely slow off-rate resulting in a very stable complex. Idarucizumab potently and \nspecifically binds to dabigatran and its metabolites and neutralises their anticoagulant effect.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nThe pharmacodynamics of idarucizumab after administration of dabigatran etexilate were investigated in \n141 subjects in phase I studies, of which data for a representative subgroup of 6 healthy subjects aged 45 to \n64 years receiving a dose of 5 g as intravenous infusion are presented. The median peak dabigatran exposure \nin the investigated healthy subjects was in the range of a twice daily administration of 150 mg dabigatran \netexilate in patients.\n\nEffect of idarucizumab on the exposure and anticoagulant activity of dabigatran\nImmediately after the administration of idarucizumab, the plasma concentrations of unbound dabigatran were \nreduced by more than 99%, resulting in levels with no anticoagulant activity. \n\nThe majority of the patients showed sustained reversal of dabigatran plasma concentrations up to 12 hours \n(\u226590%). In a subset of patients, recurrence of plasma levels of unbound dabigatran and concomitant \nelevation of clotting times was observed, possibly due to re-distribution of dabigatran from the periphery. \nThis occurred 1-24 hours after administration of idarucizumab mainly at timepoints \u226512 hours.\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Plasma-levels of unbound dabigatran in the representative group of healthy subjects\n(administration of idarucizumab or placebo at 0 h)\n\nDabigatran prolongs the clotting time of coagulation markers such as dTT, TT, aPTT and ECT, which \nprovide an approximate indication of the anticoagulation intensity. A value in the normal range after \nadministration of idarucizumab indicates that a patient is no longer anticoagulated. A value above the normal \nrange may reflect residual active dabigatran or other clinical conditions e.g., presence of other active \nsubstances or transfusion coagulopathy. These tests were used to assess the anticoagulant effect of \ndabigatran. A complete and sustained reversal of dabigatran-induced clotting time prolongation was \nobserved immediately after the idarucizumab infusion, lasting over the entire observation period of at least \n24 h.\n\n\n\n7\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Reversal of dabigatran-induced clotting time prolongation determined by dTT in the \nrepresentative group of healthy subjects (administration of idarucizumab or placebo at 0 h)\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Reversal of dabigatran-induced clotting time prolongation determined by ECT in the \nrepresentative group of healthy subjects (administration of idarucizumab or placebo at 0 h)\n\n\n\n8\n\nThrombin generation parameters\nDabigatran exerts pronounced effects on parameters of the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP). \nIdarucizumab treatment normalised both thrombin lag time ratio and time to peak ratio to baseline levels as \ndetermined 0.5 to 12 hours after the end of the idarucizumab infusion. Idarucizumab alone has shown no \nprocoagulant effect measured as ETP. This suggests that idarucizumab has no prothrombotic effect.\n\nRe-administration of dabigatran etexilate\n24 hours after the idarucizumab infusion, re-administration of dabigatran etexilate resulted in expected \nanticoagulant activity.\n\nPreclinical pharmacodynamics\nA trauma model in pigs was performed using a blunt liver injury after dosing with dabigatran to achieve \nsupratherapeutic concentrations of about 10-fold of human plasma levels. Idarucizumab effectively and \nrapidly reversed the life-threatening bleeding within 15 min after the injection. All pigs survived at \nidarucizumab doses of approximately 2.5 and 5 g. Without idarucizumab, the mortality in the anticoagulated \ngroup was 100%.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nThree randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I studies in 283 subjects (224 treated with \nidarucizumab) were conducted to assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics of idarucizumab, given alone or after administration of dabigatran etexilate. The \ninvestigated population consisted of healthy subjects and subjects exhibiting specific population \ncharacteristics covering age, body weight, race, sex and renal impairment. In these studies the doses of \nidarucizumab ranged from 20 mg to 8 g and the infusion times ranged from 5 minutes to 1 hour.\n\nRepresentative values for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were established on the basis \nof healthy subjects aged 45-64 years receiving 5 g idarucizumab (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n\nOne prospective, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled study (RE-VERSE AD) was conducted to \ninvestigate the treatment of adult patients who presented with dabigatran-related life-threatening or \nuncontrolled bleeding (group A) or who required emergency surgery or urgent procedures (group B). The \nprimary endpoint was the maximum percentage reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within \n4 hours after the administration of idarucizumab, based on central laboratory determination of dTT or ECT. \nA key secondary endpoint was the restoration of haemostasis.\n\nRE-VERSE AD included data for 503 patients: 301 patients with serious bleeding (group A) and \n202 patients requiring an urgent procedure/surgery (group B). Approximately half of the patients in each \ngroup were male. The median age was 78 years and the median creatinine clearance (CrCl) was \n52.6 mL/min. 61.5% of patients in group A and 62.4% of patients in group B had been treated with \ndabigatran 110 mg twice daily. \n\nReversal was only evaluable for those patients showing prolonged coagulation times prior to idarucizumab \ntreatment. Most patients in both groups A and B, achieved complete reversal of the anticoagulant effect of \ndabigatran (dTT: 98.7%; ECT: 82.2%; aPTT: 92.5% of evaluable patients, respectively) in the first 4 hours \nafter administration of 5 g idarucizumab. Reversal effects were evident immediately after administration.\n\n\n\n9\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Reversal of dabigatran-induced clotting time prolongation determined by dTT in patients from the \nRE-VERSE AD study (N=487)\n\nTime post Idarucizumab\n\nBaseline Between10-30 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 12 h 24 h\n\nd\nT\n\nT\n [\n\ns]\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\nvials\n\nT      10th/90th percentilesIndividual data with median\n\nand 25th/75th percentiles\n5th/95th percentiles\n\nUpper limit normal\n\n\n\n10\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Reversal of dabigatran-induced clotting time prolongation determined by ECT in patients from the \nRE-VERSE AD study (N=487)\n\nTime post Idarucizumab\n\nBaseline Between10-30 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 12 h 24 h\n\nE\nC\n\nT\n [\n\ns]\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n\n175\n\n200\n\n225\n\n250\n\n275\n\n300\n\n325\n\n350\n\n375\n\nvials\n\nT      10th/90th percentilesIndividual data with median\n\nand 25th/75th percentiles\n5th/95th percentiles\n\nUpper limit normal\n\n\n\n11\n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Reversal of dabigatran-induced clotting time prolongation determined by aPTT in patients from \nthe RE-VERSE AD study (N=486)\n\nRestoration of haemostasis was achieved in 80.3% of evaluable patients who had serious bleeding and \nnormal haemostasis was observed in 93.4% of patients who required an urgent procedure. \n\nOf the total 503 patients, 101 patients died; each of these deaths could be attributed either as a complication \nof the index event or associated with co-morbidities. Thrombotic events were reported in 34 patients (23 out \nof the 34 patients were not on antithrombotic therapy at the time of the event) and in each of these cases, the \nthrombotic event could be attributed to the underlying medical condition of the patient. Mild symptoms of \npotential hypersensitivity (pyrexia, bronchospasm, hyperventilation, rash or pruritus) were reported. A causal \nrelationship to idarucizumab could not be established.\n\nTime post Idarucizumab\n\nBaseline Between10-30 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 12 h 24 h\n\naP\nT\n\nT\n [\n\ns]\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\nvials\n\nT      10th/90th percentilesIndividual data with median\n\nand 25th/75th percentiles\n5th/95th percentiles\n\nUpper limit normal\n\n\n\n12\n\nPaediatric Population\n\nOne paediatric patient was included in a single dose, open label, safety trial of intravenous administration of\nidarucizumab. The trial enrolled paediatric patients from clinical trials with dabigatran etexilate for the\ntreatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). For inclusion, patients required\nrapid reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran. The patient (between 16-<18 years old) was treated \nwith dabigatran etexilate for secondary prevention of VTE due to the presence of a clinical risk factor. A \nbleeding event required a surgical intervention and adequate haemostasis. Treatment with 5 g idarucizumab \nresulted in a rapid and complete reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran. The pharmacokinetics of\nidarucizumab and its effects on pharmacodynamics were consistent with data obtained in adults.\n\nImmunogenicity\n\nSerum samples from 283 subjects in phase I studies (224 volunteers treated with idarucizumab) and \n501 patients were tested for antibodies to idarucizumab before and after treatment. Pre-existing antibodies \nwith cross-reactivity to idarucizumab were detected in approximately 12% (33/283) of the phase I subjects\nand 3.8% (19/501) of the patients. No impact on the pharmacokinetics or the reversal effect of idarucizumab \nor hypersensitivity reactions were observed.\n\nTreatment-emergent possibly persistent anti-idarucizumab antibodies with low titers were observed in 4% \n(10/224) of the phase I subjects and 1.6% (8/501) of the patients suggesting a low immunogenic potential of \nidarucizumab. In a subgroup of 6 phase I subjects, idarucizumab was administered a second time, two \nmonths after the first administration. No anti-idarucizumab antibodies were detected in these subjects prior to \nthe second administration. In one subject, treatment-emergent anti-idarucizumab antibodies were detected \nafter the second administration. Nine patients were re-dosed with idarucizumab. All 9 patients were re-dosed \nwithin 6 days after the first idarucizumab dose. None of the patients re-dosed with idarucizumab tested \npositive for anti-idarucizumab antibodies.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of idarucizumab were investigated in 224 subjects in phase I studies, of which data for \na representative subgroup of 6 healthy subjects aged 45 to 64 years receiving a dose of 5 g as intravenous \ninfusion are presented.\n\nDistribution\n\nIdarucizumab exhibited multiphasic disposition kinetics and limited extravascular distribution. Following the \nintravenous infusion of a 5 g dose, the geometric mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) was 8.9 L \n(geometric coefficient of variation (gCV) 24.8%).\n\nBiotransformation\n\nSeveral pathways have been described that may contribute to the metabolism of antibodies. All of these \npathways involve biodegradation of the antibody to smaller molecules, i.e. small peptides or amino acids,\nwhich are then reabsorbed and incorporated in the general protein synthesis.\n\nElimination\n\nIdarucizumab was rapidly eliminated with a total clearance of 47.0 mL/min (gCV 18.4%), an initial half-life\n(t1/2) of 47 minutes (gCV 11.4%) and a terminal t1/2 of 10.3 h (gCV 18.9%). After intravenous administration \nof 5 g idarucizumab, 32.1% (gCV 60.0%) of the dose was recovered in urine within a collection period of \n6 hours and less than 1% in the following 18 hours. The remaining part of the dose is assumed to be \neliminated via protein catabolism, mainly in the kidney.\n\n\n\n13\n\nAfter treatment with idarucizumab proteinuria has been observed. The transient proteinuria is a physiologic \nreaction to renal protein overflow after bolus/short term application of 5 g idarucizumab intravenously. The \ntransient proteinuria usually peaked about 4 h after idarucizumab administration and normalised within \n12-24 hours. In single cases the transient proteinuria persisted for more than 24 hours.\n\nPatients with renal impairment\n\nIn phase I studies Praxbind has been investigated in subjects with a creatinine clearance ranging from 44 to \n213 mL/min. Subjects with a creatinine clearance below 44 mL/min have not been studied in phase I.\nDepending on the degree of renal impairment the total clearance was reduced compared to healthy subjects, \nleading to an increased exposure of idarucizumab.\n\nBased on pharmacokinetic data from 347 patients with different degrees of renal function (median CrCl\n21 - 99 mL/min) it is estimated that mean idarucizumab exposure (area under the concentration-time curve \n(AUC0\u201324h)) increases by 38% in patients with mild (CrCl 50-<80 mL/min), by 90% in moderate \n(30-<50 mL/min) and by 146% in severe (0-<30 mL/min) renal impairment. Since dabigatran is also \nexcreted primarily via the kidneys, increases in the exposure to dabigatran are also seen with worsening renal \nfunction.\n\nBased on these data and the extent of reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran in patients, renal \nimpairment does not impact the reversal effect of idarucizumab.\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\n\nAn impact of hepatic impairment, assessed by hepatic injury as determined by elevated liver function tests,\non the pharmacokinetics of idarucizumab has not been observed.\n\nIdarucizumab has been studied in 58 patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Compared to \n272 patients without hepatic impairment, the median AUC of idarucizumab was changed by -6%, 37% and \n10% in patients with AST/ALT elevations of 1 to <2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (N=34), 2 to \n<3 times the ULN (N=3) and >3 times the ULN (N=21), respectively. Based on pharmacokinetic data from \n12 patients with liver disease, the AUC of idarucizumab was increased by 10% as compared to patients \nwithout liver disease.\n\nElderly / Gender / Race\n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, age, gender and race do not have a clinically meaningful \neffect on the pharmacokinetics of idarucizumab.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on repeated dose toxicity studies of up to \n4 weeks in rats and 2 weeks in monkeys. Safety pharmacology studies have demonstrated no effects on the \nrespiratory, central nervous or cardiovascular system.\n\nStudies to evaluate the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of idarucizumab have not been performed. \nBased on its mechanism of action and the characteristics of proteins no carcinogenic or genotoxic effects are \nanticipated.\n\nStudies to assess the potential reproductive effects of idarucizumab have not been performed. No treatment-\nrelated effects have been identified in reproductive tissues of either sex during repeat dose intravenous \ntoxicity studies of up to 4 weeks in the rat and 2 weeks in monkeys. Additionally, no idarucizumab binding \nto human reproductive tissues was observed in a tissue cross-reactivity study. Therefore, preclinical results \ndo not suggest a risk to fertility or embryo-fetal development.\n\nNo local irritation of the blood vessel was observed after i.v. or paravenous administration of idarucizumab.\nThe idarucizumab formulation did not produce haemolysis of human whole blood in vitro.\n\n\n\n14\n\n6.

What Praxbind is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Praxbind is\nPraxbind contains the active substance idarucizumab. Idarucizumab is a reversal agent specific for dabigatran\n(Pradaxa), a blood thinner medicine that blocks a substance in the body, which is involved in blood clot \nformation.\n\nPraxbind is used to rapidly trap dabigatran in order to inactivate its effect.\n\nWhat Praxbind is used for\nPraxbind is used in adults in emergency situations where your doctor decides that rapid inactivation of the \neffect of Pradaxa is required:\n- For emergency surgery/urgent procedures;\n- In life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding.\n\n2. What you need to know when you receive Praxbind\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before receiving Praxbind:\n- if you are allergic to idarucizumab or to any other of the substances listed in section 6.\n- if you have a genetic disease called hereditary fructose intolerance. In this case, the substance sorbitol \n\ncontained in this medicine may cause serious adverse reactions.\nThey will take this into account before treating you with Praxbind.\n\nThis medicine will only remove dabigatran from your body. It will not remove other medicines used to \nprevent the formation of blood clots.\n\nAfter dabigatran has been removed from your body, you are not protected from the formation of blood clots. \nYour doctor will continue treating you with medicines used to prevent the formation of blood clots as soon \nas your medical condition allows.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThere is no information on the use of Praxbind in children.\n\n\n\n27\n\nOther medicines and Praxbind\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.\n\nThis medicine has been designed to only bind to dabigatran. It is unlikely that Praxbind will influence the \neffect of other medicines or that other medicines will influence Praxbind.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor for advice before receiving this medicine.\n\nThere is no information on the effects of this medicine in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Praxbind does \nnot affect any functions in the body as such, so your doctor may decide to give you this medicine, if the \nexpected benefits outweigh any potential risks.\n\nPraxbind contains sodium\nThis medicine contains 50 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. This is \nequivalent to 2.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.\n\n3. How to use Praxbind\n\nThis medicine is for hospital use only.\n\nThe recommended dose is 5 g (2 vials of 2.5 g/50 mL).\n\nIn rare cases you may still have too much dabigatran in your blood after a first dose of this medicine and\nyour doctor may decide to give you a second 5 g dose in specific situations.\n\nYour doctor or nurse will give you this medicine by injection or infusion into a vein.\n\nAfter you have received this medicine, your doctor will decide on the continuation of your treatment to \nprevent blood clot formation. Dabigatran can be given again 24 hours after administration of this medicine.\n\nDetailed instructions for your doctor or nurse on how to administer this medicine can be found at the end of \nthis package leaflet (see 'Handling instructions').\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine may cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nUntil now, no side effects have been identified.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in \nthis leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.\n\n5.

It will not reverse the effects of \nother anticoagulants.\n\nPraxbind treatment can be used in conjunction with standard supportive measures, which should be \nconsidered as medically appropriate.\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nThe recommended dose of Praxbind contains 4 g sorbitol as an excipient. In patients with hereditary fructose \nintolerance there is a risk for serious adverse reactions, which must be weighed against the benefit of an \nemergency treatment with Praxbind. If Praxbind is administered in these patients, intensified medical care \nduring Praxbind exposure and within 24 hours of exposure is required.\n\nDosage and administration:\nThe recommended dose is 5 g idarucizumab (2 vials of 2.5 g/50 mL).\n\nAdministration of a second 5 g dose of idarucizumab may be considered in the following situations:\n\uf0b7 recurrence of clinically relevant bleeding together with prolonged clotting times, or\n\uf0b7 if potential re-bleeding would be life-threatening and prolonged clotting times are observed, or\n\uf0b7 patients require a second emergency surgery/urgent procedure and have prolonged clotting times.\n\nRelevant coagulation parameters are activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), diluted thrombin time \n(dTT) or ecarin clotting time (ECT).\n\nA maximum daily dose has not been investigated.\n\nPraxbind (2 vials of 2.5 g/50 mL) is administered intravenously, as two consecutive infusions over \n5 to 10 minutes each or as a bolus injection. \n\nPatients being treated with dabigatran have underlying disease states that predispose them to thromboembolic \nevents. Reversing dabigatran therapy exposes patients to the thrombotic risk of their underlying disease. To \nreduce this risk, resumption of anticoagulant therapy should be considered as soon as medically appropriate.\n\nPradaxa (dabigatran etexilate) treatment can be re-initiated 24 hours after administration of idarucizumab, if \nthe patient is clinically stable and adequate haemostasis has been achieved.\n\nAfter administration of idarucizumab, other antithrombotic therapy (e.g. low-molecular weight heparin) can \nbe started at any time, if the patient is clinically stable and adequate haemostasis has been achieved. \n\nHandling instructions:\nPraxbind must not be mixed with other medicinal products. A pre-existing intravenous line may be used for \nadministration of Praxbind. The line must be flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \ninjection prior to and at the end of infusion. No other infusion should be administered in parallel via the same \nintravenous access.\n\nPraxbind is for single-use only and does not contain preservatives.\n\nPrior to use, the unopened vial may be kept at room temperature (up to 30\u00b0C) for up to 48 hours, if stored in \nthe original package in order to protect from light. After opening the vial, chemical and physical in-use \nstability of idarucizumab has been demonstrated for 6 hours at room temperature (up to 30\u00b0C). The solution \nshould not be exposed to light for more than 6 hours (in unopened vial and/or inuse).\n\n\n\n32\n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, unless the method of opening precludes the risk of microbial \ncontamination, the product shall be used immediately after opening. If not used immediately, in-use storage \ntimes and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user.\n\nNo incompatibilities between Praxbind and polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene or polyurethane infusion sets or \npolypropylene syringes have been observed.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.\tMANUFACTURER(S) OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVE SUBSTANCE(S) AND MANUFACTURER(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.\tCONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE\n\tC.\tOTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION\n\tD.\tCONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\tA.
