NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCuprior 150 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains trientine tetrahydrochloride equivalent to 150 mg trientine. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nYellow, 16 mm x 8 mm oblong film-coated tablet with a score line on each side. \n \nThe tablet can be divided into equal doses. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCuprior is indicated for the treatment of Wilson\u2019s disease in adults, adolescents and children \u2265 5 years \nintolerant to D-penicillamine therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should only be initiated by specialist physicians with experience in the management of \nWilson\u2019s disease.  \n \nPosology \nThe starting dose would usually correspond to the lowest dose in the range and the dose should \nsubsequently be adapted according to the patient\u2019s clinical response (see section 4.4). \n \nThe recommended dose is between 450 mg and 975 mg (3 to 6\u00bd film-coated tablets) per day in 2 to \n4 divided doses.  \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly  \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients. \n \nRenal impairment \nThere is limited information in patients with renal impairment. No specific dose adjustment is required \nin these patients (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe starting dose in paediatrics is lower than for adults and depends on age and body weight.  \n \nChildren \u2265 5 years  \nThe dose is usually between 225 mg and 600 mg per day (1\u00bd to 4 film-coated tablets) in 2 to 4 divided \ndoses.  \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nChildren aged < 5 years \nThe safety and efficacy of trientine in children aged < 5 years have not been established.  \nThe pharmaceutical form is not suitable for administration to children < 5 years. \n \nThe recommended doses of Cuprior are expressed as mg of trientine base (i.e. not in mg of the \ntrientine tetrahydrochloride salt).  \n  \nMethod of administration \nCuprior is for oral use. The film-coated tablets should be swallowed with water. The scored film-\ncoated tablet can be divided in two equal halves, if required, to provide a more precise dose or \nfacilitate administration. \n \nIt is important that Cuprior is given on an empty stomach, at least one hour before meals or two hours \nafter meals and at least one hour apart from any other medicinal product, food, or milk (see section \n4.5).  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhen switching a patient from another formulation trientine, caution is advised because doses \nexpressed in trientine base may not be equivalent (see section 4.2).   \n \nTrientine is a chelating agent which has been found to reduce serum iron levels. Iron supplements may \nbe necessary in  case of iron deficiency anaemia and should be administered at a different time (see \nsection 4.5).  \n \nThe combination of trientine with zinc is not recommended. There are only limited data on \nconcomitant use available and no specific dose recommendations can be made. \n \nIn patients who were previously treated with D-penicillamine, lupus-like reactions have been reported \nduring subsequent  treatment with trientine, however it is not possible to determine if there is a causal \nrelationship with trientine. \n \nMonitoring \nPatients receiving Cuprior should remain under regular medical supervision and be monitored for \nappropriate control of symptoms and copper levels in order to optimise the dose (see section 4.2).  \n \nThe aim of maintenance treatment is to maintain free copper levels in the serum within acceptable \nlimits. The most reliable index for monitoring therapy is the determination of serum free copper which \nis calculated using the difference between the total copper and the ceruloplasmin-bound copper \n(normal level of free copper in the serum is usually 100 to 150 microgram/L).  \n \nThe measurement of copper excretion in the urine may be performed during therapy. Since chelation \ntherapy leads to an increase in urinary copper levels, this may/will not give an accurate reflection of \nthe excess copper load in the body but may be a useful measure of treatment compliance. \n \nWorsening of clinical symptoms, including neurological deterioration, may occur at the beginning of \nchelation therapy due to excess of free serum copper during the initial response to treatment. Close \nmonitoring is required to optimise the dose or to adapt treatment if necessary. \n \nSpecial populations \nOvertreatment carries the risk of copper deficiency. Monitoring for manifestations of overtreatment \nshould be undertaken, particularly when copper requirements may change, such as in pregnancy (see \n\n\n\n4 \n\nsection 4.6) and in children where appropriate control of copper levels are required to ensure proper \ngrowth and mental development. \n \nPatients with renal impairment receiving trientine should remain under regular medical supervision for \nappropriate control of symptoms and copper levels. Close monitoring of renal function is also \nrecommended in these patients (see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nTrientine has been found to reduce serum iron levels, possibly by reducing its absorption, and iron \nsupplements may be required. Since iron and trientine may inhibit absorption of each other, iron \nsupplements should be taken after at least two hours have elapsed from the administration of trientine. \n \nAs trientine is poorly absorbed following oral intake and the principal mechanism of action requires its \nsystemic exposure (see section 5.1), it is important that the film-coated tablets are taken on empty \nstomach at least one hour before meals or 2 hours after meals and at least one hour apart from any \nother medicinal product, food, or milk (see section 4.2).  This maximises the absorption of trientine \nand reduces the likelihood of the medicinal product binding to metals in the gastrointestinal tract. \nHowever, no food interaction studies have been performed and so the extent of the food effect on \nsystemic trientine exposure is unknown.  \n \nAlthough there is no evidence that calcium or magnesium antacids alter the efficacy of trientine, it is \ngood practice to separate their administration. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of trientine in pregnant women. \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity, which was probably a result of trientine-induced \ncopper deficiency (see section 5.3). \n \nCuprior should only be used in pregnancy after careful consideration of the benefits compared with the \nrisks of treatment in the individual patient. Factors which need to be born in mind include the risks \nassociated with the disease itself, the risk of those alternative treatments which are available and the \npossible teratogenic effects of trientine (see section 5.3). \n \nSince copper is required for proper growth and mental development, dose adjustments may be \nrequired to ensure that the foetus will not become copper deficient and close monitoring of the patient \nis essential (see section 4.4). \n \nThe pregnancy should be closely monitored in order to detect possible foetal abnormality and to assess \nmaternal serum copper levels throughout the pregnancy. The dose of trientine used should be adjusted \nin order to maintain serum copper levels within the normal range.  \n \nBabies born to mothers being treated with trientine should be monitored for serum copper levels where \nappropriate. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether trientine is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain \nfrom Cuprior therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nFertility \nIt is unknown whether trientine has an effect on human fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCuprior has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse reaction with trientine is nausea. Serious iron deficiency \nanaemia and severe colitis may occur during treatment.   \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with the use of trientine for Wilson\u2019s disease.  \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). \n \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reactions \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Not known: iron deficiency anaemia. \nGastrointestinal disorders Common: nausea.  \n\nNot known: duodenitis, colitis (including \nsevere colitis). \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorder Uncommon: skin rash, pruritus, erythema.  \nNot known: urticaria. \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOccasional cases of trientine overdose have been reported. In cases up to 20 g of trientine base there \nwere no apparent adverse effects reported. A large overdose of 40 g of trientine base resulted in self-\nlimiting dizziness and vomiting with no other clinical sequelae or significant biochemical \nabnormalities reported.  \n \nThere is no antidote for trientine acute overdose. \n \nChronic over treatment can lead to copper deficiency and reversible sideroblastic anaemia.  \nOvertreatment and excess copper removal can be monitored using values of urine copper excretion \nand of non-ceruloplasmin bound copper. Close monitoring is required to optimise the dose or to adapt \ntreatment if necessary (see section 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, various alimentary tract \nand metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX12. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nMechanism of action  \nTrientine is a copper-chelating agent whose principal mechanism of action is to eliminate absorbed \ncopper from the body by forming a stable complex that is then eliminated through urinary excretion. \nTrientine may also chelate copper in the intestinal tract and so inhibit copper absorption. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThe absorption of trientine following oral administration is low and variable in patients with Wilson \ndisease. The pharmacokinetic profile of Cuprior has been evaluated after a single oral dose of 450, \n600 mg and 750 mg trientine in healthy male and female subjects. Plasma levels of trientine rose \nrapidly following administration with the median peak level reached after 1.25 to 2 hours. The \ntrientine plasma concentration then declined in a multiphasic manner, initially rapidly, followed by a \nslower elimination phase. The overall pharmacokinetic profiles were similar between males and \nfemales, although males had higher levels of trientine.   \n \nDistribution \nLittle is known on the distribution of trientine in organs and tissues.  \n \nBiotransformation \nTrientine is acetylated in two majors metabolites, N(1)-acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT) and \nN(1),N(10)-diacetyltriethylenetetramine (DAT). MAT may also participate to the overall clinical \nactivity of Cuprior, however the extent of MAT to the overall effect of Cuprior on copper levels  \nremains to be determined. \n \nElimination \nTrientine and its metabolites are rapidly excreted in the urine, although low levels of trientine could \nstill be detected in the plasma after 20 hours. Unabsorbed trientine is eliminated through faecal \nexcretion. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nPlasma exposures in humans have shown a linear relationship with oral doses of trientine. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data obtained with trientine have shown adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, \nbut seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to \nclinical use as follows: \n \nRepeat dose toxicity \nIn mice administered in drinking water, trientine displayed increased frequencies of inflammation of \nthe lung interstitium and liver periportal fatty infiltration. Hematopoietic cell proliferation was seen in \nthe spleen of males. Kidney and body weights were reduced in males as was the incidence of renal \ncytoplasmic vacuolisation. The NOAEL was established at approximately 92 mg/kg/day for males and \n99 mg/kg/day for females. In rats administered oral trientines doses, up to 600 mg/kg/day for 26 \nweeks, histopathology revealed a dose-related incidence and severity of focal chronic interstitial \npneumonitis accompanied by fibrosis of the alveolar wall. The microscopic changes in lung were \nconsidered indicative of a persistent inflammatory reaction or persistent toxic effect on alveolar cells. \nTaking into account that trientine has irritating properties, it was estimated that the observed chronic \ninterstitial pneumonitis was explained by a cytotoxic effect of trientine upon accumulation into \nbronchiolar epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes. These findings were not reversible. The rat \nNOAEL was considered 50 mg/kg/day for females, a NOAEL was not established for males. \nDogs receiving oral doses of trientine up to 300 mg/kg/day, showed neurological and/or \nmusculo-skeletal clinical symptoms (abnormal gait, ataxia, weak limbs, body tremors) in repeat-dose \ntoxicity studies, attributed to the copper-depleting activity of trientine. The NOAEL was established at \n\n\n\n7 \n\n50 mg/kg/day resulting in safety margins of about 4 in males and 17 in females, towards human \ntherapeutic exposures. \n \nGenotoxicity \nOverall, trientine has shown positive effects in in vitro genotoxicity studies, including the Ames test \nand genotoxicity tests in mammalian cells. In vivo, trientine was however negative in the mouse \nmicronucleus test. \n \nReproductive and developmental toxicity \nWhen rodents were fed throughout pregnancy a diet containing trientine, the frequency of resorptions \nand the frequency of abnormal fetuses at term showed a dose-related increase. These effects are \npossibly due to trientine induced-copper and zinc deficiency.  \n \nLocal tolerance \nIn silico data predict that trientine displays irritating and sensitising properties. Positive results for \nsensitization potential in Guinea pig maximization tests were reported. \n \n \n6.

What Cuprior is and what it is used for \n \nCuprior is a medicine used to treat Wilson\u2019s disease that contains the active substance trientine.  \n \nWilson\u2019s disease is an inherited condition in which the body cannot transport copper around the body \nin the normal way or remove copper in the normal way as a secretion from the liver into the gut. This \nmeans that the small amounts of copper from food and drink build up to excessive levels and can lead \nto liver damage and problems in the nervous system. This medicine mainly works by attaching to \ncopper in the body which then allows it to be removed in the urine instead, helping to lower copper \nlevels. It may also attach to copper in the gut and so reduce the amount taken up into the body.  \nCuprior is given to adults, adolescents and children aged 5 years and over who cannot tolerate another \nmedicine that is used to treat this disease, called penicillamine. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Cuprior  \n \nDo not take Cuprior \nIf you are allergic to trientine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Cuprior. \n \nIf you were already taking another trientine medicine, your doctor may modify your daily dose, the \nnumber of tablets or the number of intake in the day when switching to Cuprior treatment.  \n \nYour symptoms may initially get worse after starting the treatment. If this happens, you must tell your \ndoctor. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nYour doctor will regularly check your blood and urine to ensure that  you receive the right dose of \nCuprior to properly control your symptoms and copper levels.  \n \nYou should tell your doctor if you get any side effects as this may indicate that your dose of Cuprior \nneeds to be adjusted up or down.  \n \nThis medicine may also reduce the level of iron in your blood and your doctor may prescribe iron \nsupplements (see section \u201cOther medicines and Cuprior\u201d below). \n \nIf you have kidney problems, your doctor will regularly check that the treatment dose is appropriate \nand does not affect the functioning of your kidney. \n \nThe association of trientine with another medicine that contains zinc is not recommended.  \n \nLupus-like reactions (symptoms may include persistent rash, fever, joint pain, and tiredness) have \nbeen reported in some patients switched to trientine medicine after penicillamine medicine. However it \nwas not possible to determine if the reaction was due to trientine or to previous penicillamine \ntreatment.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nYour doctor will carry out checks more frequently to ensure your copper levels are maintained at a \nsuitable level for normal growth and mental development.  \nThis medicine is not recommended for children aged below 5 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Cuprior \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.  \n \nIn particular, you must tell your doctor if you are already taking iron supplements or if you take \nindigestion remedies (medicines that reduce discomfort after eating). If you take these medicines you \nmay need to take Cuprior at a different time in the day because otherwise Cuprior may not be as \neffective. If you take iron supplements, make sure that at least two hours have passed between taking \nCuprior and taking your iron supplements. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  \n \nIt is very important to continue treatment to reduce copper during pregnancy. You and your doctor \nshould fully discuss the potential benefits of treatment whilst considering any possible risks that there \nmay be. Your doctor will advise you which treatment and which dose is best in your situation. \n \nIf you are pregnant and taking Cuprior, you will be monitored throughout your pregnancy for any \neffects on the baby or changes in your copper levels. When your baby is born, the copper level in the \nbaby\u2019s blood will also be monitored.  \n \nIt is not known if Cuprior can pass into breast milk. It is important to tell your doctor if you are \nbreast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding \nor to stop taking Cuprior, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of \nCuprior to the mother. Your doctor will decide which treatment and which dose is best in your \nsituation. \n \nDriving and using machines \nCuprior is not expected to affect your ability to drive a car or use any tools or machines. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\n3. How to take Cuprior \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nIn adults of all ages, the recommended total daily dose is 3 to 6\u00bd tablets per day (making a total of \nbetween 450 and 975 mg). This daily total will be divided into 2 to 4 smaller doses to be taken during \nthe day. Your doctor will tell you how many tablets you should take and how often in the day. Tablets \ncan be divided in half if needed. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nThe dose that you will take is usually lower than for an adult and depends on your age and body \nweight.  \nThe usual total daily dose is between 225 and 600 mg (1\u00bd to 4 tablets daily), which will be divided \ninto 2 to 4 smaller doses to be taken during the day. Your doctor will tell you how many tablets you \nshould take and how often in the day. \n \nOnce you have started the treatment, your doctor may adjust the dose based on the response to \ntreatment. \n \nSwallow the tablets with water on an empty stomach, at least one hour before meals or two hours after \nmeals and at least one hour apart from any other medicines, food, or milk. \n \nIf you take iron supplements, take them at least two hours after taking a dose of Cuprior. \n \nIf you take more Cuprior than you should \nTake Cuprior only as it is prescribed for you. If you think you may have taken more Cuprior than you \nwere told to, contact your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you forget to take Cuprior \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

trientine. wilson's disease is an inherited condition in which the body cannot transport copper around the body in the normal way or remove copper in the normal way as a secretion from the liver into the gut. this means that the small amounts of copper from food and drink build up to excessive levels and can lead to liver damage and problems in the nervous system. this medicine mainly works by attaching to copper in the body which then allows it to be removed in the urine instead, helping to lower copper levels. it may also attach to copper in the gut and so reduce the amount taken up into the body. cuprior is given to adults, adolescents and children aged 5 years and over who cannot tolerate another medicine that is used to treat this disease, called penicillamine.",

when switching to cuprior treatment. your symptoms may initially get worse after starting the treatment. if this happens, you must tell your doctor. your doctor will regularly check your blood and urine to ensure that you receive the right dose of cuprior to properly control your symptoms and copper levels. you should tell your doctor if you get any side effects as this may indicate that your dose of cuprior needs to be adjusted up or down. this medicine may also reduce the level of iron in your blood and your doctor may prescribe iron supplements (see section \"other medicines and cuprior\" below). if you have kidney problems, your doctor will regularly check that the treatment dose is appropriate and does not affect the functioning of your kidney. the association of trientine with another medicine that contains zinc is not recommended. lupus-like reactions (symptoms may include persistent rash, fever, joint pain, and tiredness) have been reported in some patients switched to trientine medicine after penicillamine medicine. however it was not possible to determine if the reaction was due to trientine or to previous penicillamine treatment. children and adolescents your doctor will carry out checks more frequently to ensure your copper levels are maintained at a suitable level for normal growth and mental development. this medicine is not recommended for children aged below 5 years of age. other medicines and cuprior tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. in particular, you must tell your doctor if you are already taking iron supplements or if you take indigestion remedies (medicines that reduce discomfort after eating). if you take these medicines you may need to take cuprior at a different time in the day because otherwise cuprior may not be as effective. if you take iron supplements, make sure that at least two hours have passed between taking cuprior and taking your iron supplements. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. it is very important to continue treatment to reduce copper during pregnancy. you and your doctor should fully discuss the potential benefits of treatment whilst considering any possible risks that there may be. your doctor will advise you which treatment and which dose is best in your situation. if you are pregnant and taking cuprior, you will be monitored throughout your pregnancy for any effects on the baby or changes in your copper levels. when your baby is born, the copper level in the baby's blood will also be monitored. it is not known if cuprior can pass into breast milk. it is important to tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding or to stop taking cuprior, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of cuprior to the mother. your doctor will decide which treatment and which dose is best in your situation. driving and using machines cuprior is not expected to affect your ability to drive a
