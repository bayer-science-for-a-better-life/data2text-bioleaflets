NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nVPRIV 400 Units powder for solution for infusion \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach vial contains 400 Units* of velaglucerase alfa**. \n\nAfter reconstitution, one ml of the solution contains 100 Units of velaglucerase alfa. \n\n \n\n*An enzyme unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that is required to convert one micromole of \n\np-nitrophenyl \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside to p-nitrophenol per minute at 37 \u00baC. \n\n**produced in an HT-1080 human fibroblast cell line by recombinant DNA technology. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect \n\n \n\nEach vial contains 12.15 mg sodium. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder for solution for infusion. \n\n \n\nWhite to off-white powder. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nVPRIV is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with type 1 Gaucher \n\ndisease.  \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nVPRIV treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the management of patients with \n\nGaucher disease.  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 60 Units/kg administered every other week.  \n\n \n\nDose adjustments can be made on an individual basis based on achievement and maintenance of \n\ntherapeutic goals. Clinical studies have evaluated doses ranging from 15 to 60 Units/kg every other \n\nweek. Doses higher than 60 Units/kg have not been studied. \n\n \n\nPatients currently treated with imiglucerase enzyme replacement therapy for type 1 Gaucher disease \n\nmay be switched to VPRIV, using the same dose and frequency. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \nElderly (\u226565 years old) \n\nElderly patients may be treated within the same dose range (15 to 60 units/kg) as other adult patients \n\n(see section 5.1). \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dosing adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment based on current knowledge \n\nof the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of velaglucerase alfa (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dosing adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment based on current \n\nknowledge of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of velaglucerase alfa (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nTwenty of the 94 patients (21%) who received velaglucerase alfa during clinical studies were in the \n\npaediatric and adolescent age range (4 to 17 years). The safety and efficacy profiles were similar \n\nbetween paediatric and adult patients (see section 5.1 for further information).  \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of velaglucerase alfa in children below the age of 4 years have not yet been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor intravenous infusion use only.  \n\nTo be administered as a 60-minute intravenous infusion. \n\nMust be administered through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter. \n\n \n\nHome administration under the supervision of a healthcare professional may be considered only for \n\nthose patients who have received at least three infusions and were tolerating their infusions well. \n\nAppropriate medical support, including adequately trained personnel in emergency measures, should \n\nbe readily available when velaglucerase alfa is administered. If anaphylactic or other acute reactions \n\noccur, immediately discontinue the infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \n\nsection 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nSevere allergic reaction to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and batch number of \n\nthe administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded.  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions, including symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis, have been reported in \n\npatients in clinical studies and in post-marketing experience. The majority of hypersensitivity \n\nreactions usually occur up to 12 hours post infusion. The most frequently reported symptoms of \n\nhypersensitivity include nausea, rash dyspnoea, back pain, chest discomfort (including chest \n\ntightness), urticaria, arthralgia, and headache. \n\n \n\nInfusion-related reactions \n\n \n\nAn infusion-related reaction is defined as any adverse drug reaction occurring within 24 hours after \n\nthe initiation of velaglucerase alfa infusion. Infusion-related reactions (IRR) were the most commonly \n\nobserved adverse reactions in patients treated in clinical studies. An IRR often appears as a \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. The most frequently reported symptoms of hypersensitivity include nausea, \n\nrash, dyspnoea, back pain, chest discomfort (including chest tightness), urticaria, arthralgia, and \n\nheadache. Symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis have been reported in patients in clinical studies and \n\nin post-marketing experience. Apart from symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions IRRs \n\nmight show as fatigue, dizziness, pyrexia, blood pressure increase, pruritus, or vision blurred. In \n\ntreatment-na\u00efve patients, the majority of infusion-related reactions occurred during the first 6 months \n\nof treatment. \n\n \n\nPrevention and management of infusion related reactions including hypersensitivity reactions  \n \n\nThe management of infusion-related reactions should be based on the severity of the reaction, and \n\ninclude slowing the infusion rate, treatment with medicinal products such as antihistamines, \n\nantipyretics and/or corticosteroids, and/or stopping and resuming treatment with increased infusion \n\ntime. \n\n \n\nDue to the risk for hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, appropriate medical support, \n\nincluding adequately trained personnel in emergency measures, should be readily available when \n\nvelaglucerase alfa is administered. If anaphylactic or other acute reactions occur, in the clinic or home \n\nsetting, immediately discontinue the infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment. For patients \n\ndeveloping anaphylaxis in a home setting it should be considered to continue treatment in a clinical \n\nsetting. \n\n \n\nTreatment should be approached with caution in patients who have exhibited symptoms of \n\nhypersensitivity to velaglucerase alfa or other enzyme replacement therapy. \n\n \n\nPre-treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may prevent subsequent reactions in those \n\ncases where symptomatic treatment was required.  \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\n \n\nAntibodies may play a role in treatment-related reactions found with the use of velaglucerase alfa. To \n\nfurther evaluate the relationship, in cases of severe infusion-related reactions and in cases of lack or \n\nloss of effect, patients should be tested for the presence of antibodies and the results reported to the \n\ncompany. \n\n \n\nIn the clinical studies one of 94 (1%) patients developed IgG-class antibodies to velaglucerase alfa. In \n\nthis one event, the antibodies were determined to be neutralising in an in vitro assay. No \n\ninfusion-related reactions were reported for this patient. No patients developed IgE antibodies to \n\nvelaglucerase alfa. \n\n \n\nSodium \n \n\nThis medicinal product contains 12.15 mg sodium per vial. This is equivalent to 0.6% of the WHO \n\nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\n \n\nPatients who have Gaucher disease and become pregnant may experience a period of increased disease \n\nactivity during pregnancy and the puerperium. A risk-benefit assessment is required for women with \n\nGaucher disease who are considering pregnancy. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of velaglucerase alfa in pregnant women. Animal \n\nstudies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \n\ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. Close monitoring of the pregnancy and clinical \n\nmanifestations of Gaucher disease is necessary for the individualisation of therapy. Caution should be \n\nexercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nThere is insufficient information on the excretion of velaglucerase alfa or its metabolites in human \n\nmilk. Velalglucerase is a synthetic form of beta-glucocerebrosidase, which is a normal component of \n\nhuman milk. Studies with other forms of the enzyme have found very low levels of the enzyme in \n\nbreastmilk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain \n\nfrom VPRIV taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy \n\nfor the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nAnimal studies show no evidence of impaired fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nVPRIV has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n  \n\nThe most serious adverse reactions in patients in clinical studies were hypersensitivity reactions \n\n(2.1%). \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions were infusion-related reactions (39.4%). The most commonly \n\nobserved symptoms of infusion-related reactions were: headache, dizziness, hypotension, \n\nhypertension, nausea, fatigue/asthenia, and pyrexia/body temperature increased (see section 4.4 for \n\nfurther information). The only adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of treatment was an \n\ninfusion-related reaction. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions reported in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease are listed in Table 1. Information is \n\npresented by system organ class and frequency according to MedDRA convention. Frequency is \n\ndefined as very common (\uf0b31/10), common (\uf0b31/100 to <1/10), and uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n\n \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported with VPRIV in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease  \n\n \n\nSystem organ class \n\n \n\nAdverse reaction \n\n Very common Common Uncommon \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n hypersensitivity reactions \n\n(includes dermatitis allergic \n\nand \n\nanaphylactic*/anaphylactoid \n\nreactions) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\nheadache, dizziness   \n\nEye disorders   vision blurred* \n\nCardiac disorders  tachycardia  \n\nRespiratory, \n\nthoracic and \n\nmediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\n dyspnoea*  \n\nVascular disorders  hypertension, hypotension, \n\nflushing \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n\nabdominal \n\npain/abdominal pain \n\nupper, \n\nnausea vomiting* \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n rash, urticaria, pruritus*  \n\nMusculoskeletal \n\nand connective \n\ntissue disorders \n\nbone pain, arthralgia, \n\nback pain \n\n  \n\nGeneral disorders \n\nand administration \n\nsite conditions \n\ninfusion-related \n\nreaction, \n\nasthenia/fatigue, \n\npyrexia/body \n\ntemperature \n\nincreased \n\nchest discomfort*  \n\nInvestigations  activated partial \n\nthromboplastin time \n\nprolonged, neutralizing \n\nantibody positive \n\n \n\n*Adverse reactions derived from post-marketing reports \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nVomiting \n\n \n\nIn some cases vomiting can be serious and severe. Vomiting most often occurs during the infusion and \n\nup to 24 hours after the infusion. \n\n   \n\nOther special populations \n\n \n\nElderly population (\u226565 years) \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of VPRIV in clinical studies involving patients aged 65 years and above was similar \n\nto that observed in other adult patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of VPRIV in clinical studies involving children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years \n\nwas similar to that observed in adult patients.  \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere is limited information available regarding overdose with velaglucerase alfa. In the majority of \n\nthe cases reporting overdose, no additional adverse events were observed. However, in the event of \n\naccidental or intentional overdose, patients should be carefully observed and treatment should be \n\nsymptomatic and supportive. There is no antidote available. The maximum dose of velaglucerase alfa \nin clinical studies was 60 Units/kg (see section 4.4). \n\n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, enzymes, ATC code: \n\nA16AB10. \n\n \n\nGaucher disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the GBA gene which \n\nresults in a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase. This enzymatic deficiency \n\ncauses an accumulation of glucocerebroside primarily in macrophages, giving rise to foam cells or \n\n\"Gaucher cells\". In this lysosomal storage disorder (LSD), clinical features are reflective of the \n\ndistribution of Gaucher cells in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, skeleton, and lungs. The accumulation \n\nof glucocerebroside in the liver and spleen leads to organomegaly. Bone involvement results in \n\nskeletal abnormalities and deformities as well as bone pain crises. Deposits in the bone marrow and \n\nsplenic sequestration lead to clinically significant anaemia and thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nThe active substance of VPRIV is velaglucerase alfa, which is produced by gene activation technology \n\nin a human cell line. Velaglucerase alfa is a glycoprotein. The monomer is approximately 63 kDa, has \n\n497 amino acids, and the same amino acid sequence as the naturally occurring human enzyme, \n\nglucocerebrosidase. There are 5 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, four of which are occupied. \n\nVelaglucerase alfa is manufactured to contain predominantly high-mannose-type glycans to facilitate \n\ninternalisation of the enzyme by the phagocytic target cells via the mannose receptor. \n\n \n\nVelaglucerase alfa supplements or replaces beta-glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme that catalyses the \n\nhydrolysis of glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide in the lysosome, reducing the amount of \n\naccumulated glucocerebroside and correcting the pathophysiology of Gaucher disease. Velaglucerase \n\nalfa increases haemoglobin concentration and platelet counts and reduces liver and spleen volumes in \n\npatients with type 1 Gaucher disease. \n\n \n\nIn studies 025EXT and 034, patients were offered home therapy. In study 025EXT, 7 of 10 patients \n\nreceived home therapy at least once during 60 months of treatment. In study 034, 25 of 40 patients \n\nreceived home therapy at least once during the 12-month study. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nStudies in treatment na\u00efve patients \n\n \n\nStudy 025 was a 9 month, open-label study in 12 adult (\u226518 years) patients who were na\u00efve to ERT \n\n(defined as having not been treated with ERT for at least 12 months prior to study entry). \n\nVelaglucerase alfa was initially administered in a dose-escalating fashion in the first 3 patients (15, 30, \n\n60 Units/kg) and the 9 remaining patients began treatment with 60 Units/kg. \n\n \n\nClinically meaningful improvements from baseline were observed in haemoglobin concentration and \n\nplatelet counts as early as 3 months and in liver and spleen volumes at both 6 months and 9 months \n\nfollowing the initiation of treatment with velaglucerase alfa. \n\n \n\nTen patients who completed Study 025 enrolled in an open-label extension study (025EXT), 8 of \n\nwhom completed the study. After a minimum of 12 months of continuous treatment with \n\nvelaglucerase alfa, all patients qualified to have the dose of velaglucerase alfa reduced in a step-wise \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nfashion from 60 to 30 Units/kg after achieving at least 2 of the 4 \u201cYear 1\u201d therapeutic goals of ERT for \n\ntype 1 Gaucher disease. Patients received doses ranging from 30 to 60 Units/kg (median dose \n\n35 Units/kg) every other week for up to 84 months (7 years). Sustained clinical activity continued to \n\nbe demonstrated during treatment as observed by improvements in haemoglobin concentrations and \n\nplatelet counts and reduced liver and spleen volumes. \n\n \n\nBy month 57, 8 out of the 8 patients had achieved a reduction of at least 2 points in the lumbar spine \n\nBone Marrow Burden (BMB) score as assessed by MRI scan. Improvement from baseline in mean \n\nlumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) Z-scores were observed at month 24 (0.4; \n\n95% CI 0.1, 0.7) and month 33 (0.4; 95% CI 0.2, 0.6), respectively. After seven years of treatment, the \n\nmean increase from baseline in Z-scores were 0.7 (95% CI 0.4, 1.0) for the lumbar spine and 0.5 (95% \n\nCI 0.2, 0.7) for the femoral neck. No patients were classified at a more severe WHO classification of \n\nbone density compared to baseline.   \n\n \n\nStudy 032 was a 12-month, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group efficacy study in 25 patients \n\naged 2 years and older who were na\u00efve to ERT (defined as having not been treated with ERT for at \n\nleast 30 months prior to study entry). Patients were required to have Gaucher disease-related anaemia \n\nand either thrombocytopenia or organomegaly. Patients were randomised to receive velaglucerase alfa \n\nat a dose of either 45 Units/kg (N=13) or 60 Units/kg (N=12) every other week.  \n\n \n\nVelaglucerase alfa 60 Units/kg given intravenously every other week demonstrated clinically \n\nmeaningful increases from baseline in mean haemoglobin concentration (+2.4 g/dl) and platelet count \n\n(+50.9 x 109/l), liver volume was reduced from 1.46 to 1.22 times normal (mean reduction of 17%) \n\nand spleen volume was reduced from 14.0 to 5.75 times normal (mean reduction of 50%). Meaningful \n\nincreases from baseline were observed in the 45 Units/kg dose group in haemoglobin concentration \n\n(+2.4 g/dl) and platelet count (+40.9 x 109/l), liver volume was reduced from 1.40 to 1.24 times \n\nnormal (mean reduction of 6%) and spleen volume was reduced from 14.5 to 9.50 times normal (mean \n\nreduction of 40%). \n\n \n\nStudy 039 was a 9-month, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator (imiglucerase) \n\ncontrolled, parallel-group efficacy study in 34 patients aged 2 years and older who were na\u00efve to ERT \n\n(defined as having not been treated with ERT for at least 12 months prior to study entry). Patients \n\nwere required to have Gaucher disease-related anaemia and either thrombocytopenia or organomegaly. \n\nPatients received either 60 Units/kg of velaglucerase alfa (N=17) or 60 Units/kg of imiglucerase \n\n(N=17) every other week. \n\n \n\nThe mean absolute increase from baseline in haemoglobin concentrations was 1.624 g/dl (\u00b10.223 SE) \n\nfollowing 9 months of treatment with velaglucerase alfa. This increase in haemoglobin concentration \n\nwas demonstrated to be clinically and statistically non-inferior to imiglucerase (mean treatment \n\ndifference of change from baseline to 9 months [velaglucerase alfa \u2013 imiglucerase]: 0.135 g/dl). There \n\nwere no statistically significant differences between velaglucerase alfa and imiglucerase in changes in \n\nplatelet counts and liver and spleen volumes after 9 months of velaglucerase alfa treatment, and in the \n\ntime to first haemoglobin response (defined as 1 g/dl increase from baseline). \n\n \n\nStudy in patients switching from imiglucerase treatment to VPRIV \n\n \n\nStudy 034 was a 12-month, open-label safety study in 40 patients aged 2 years and older who had been \n\nreceiving treatment with imiglucerase at doses ranging from 15 to 60 Units/kg for a minimum of \n\n30 consecutive months. Patients were required to have a stable dose of imiglucerase for at least \n\n6 months prior to study enrolment. Treatment with velaglucerase alfa was administered as the same \n\nnumber of units and regimen as their imiglucerase dose. Haemoglobin concentration and platelet \n\ncounts were evaluated as changes from baseline, which was defined as the end of the patient\u2019s \n\ntreatment with imiglucerase. \n\n \n\nIn patients who switched from imiglucerase to velaglucerase alfa, haemoglobin concentrations and \n\nplatelet counts were sustained at therapeutic levels through 12 months of treatment.  \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nStudy 058 was an open-label clinical safety study in 211 patients including 205 patients previously \n\ntreated with imiglucerase 6 treatment-na\u00efve patients and 57 patients aged 65 years or older (56/57 had \n\nswitched from imiglucerase to velaglucerase alfa). Patients transferring from imiglucerase were \n\nadministered velaglucerase alfa infusions every other week at the same number of units as \n\nimiglucerase within the range of 15 to 60 Units/kg. Patients transferring from a dose of <15 Units/kg \n\nimiglucerase were administered 15 Units/kg of velaglucerase alfa.  \n\n \n\nPatients previously treated with imiglucerase received a median of 8 velaglucerase alfa infusions with \n\nmedian duration of treatment of 15.1 weeks. The safety profile in these patients was similar to that \n\nobserved in other clinical studies. Only 1 out of 163 patients assessed developed anti-velaglucerase \n\nalfa antibodies during the study. \n\n \n\nThe mean haemoglobin concentration and platelet count of patients previously treated with \n\nimiglucerase were maintained throughout the study and remained within the reference intervals. \n\n \n\nExtension study 044 \n\n \n\nA total of 95 patients (73 adult and 22 paediatric) who participated in studies 032, 034, and 039 \n\nenrolled in the open label extension study and were treated with velaglucerase alfa. 57 patients were \n\ntreatment na\u00efve. All patients received at least 2 years of ERT and were followed for a mean of 4.5 \n\nyears (min. 2.3 years, max 5.8 years). \n\n \n\nIn this study, haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, liver volume and spleen volume were \n\nassessed in treatment-na\u00efve patients after 24 months of treatment. The results are presented in Table 2. \n\n \n\nTable 2: Results at 24 months - change from baseline \u2013 study 044 ITT population \n\nClinical parameters Overall velaglucerase \n\nalfa group (N=39) \n\n \n\n \n\n- \n\nMean change from \n\nbaseline (95% CI) \n\nPatients treated \n\nwith \n\nimiglucerase \n\nfor 9 months \n\nand then \n\nvelaglucerase \n\nalfa for 15 \n\nmonths (N=16) \n\n- \n\nMean change \n\nfrom baseline \n\n(95% CI) \n\nPatients who switched \n\nfrom long-term \n\nimiglucerase \n\ntreatment to \n\nvelaglucerase alfa \n\n(N=38) \n\n- \n\nMean change from \n\nbaseline (95% CI) \n\nHaemoglobin \n\nconcentration (g/dL) \n\n2.75 \n\n(2.28, 3.22)  \n\n2.00 \n\n(1.25, 2.75) \n\n-0.05 \n\n(-0.34, 0.25) \n\nPlatelet count (x109/L) 87.85 \n\n(72.69, 103.00) \n\n160.94 \n\n(117.22, 204.66) \n\n9.03 \n\n(-2.60, 20.66) \n\nNormalised liver volume* \n\n(%BW) \n\n-1.21 \n\n(-1.50, -0.91) \n\n-1.69 \n\n(-2.16, -1.21) \n\n-0.03 \n\n(-0.10, 0.05) \n\nNormalised spleen \n\nvolume* \n\n(%BW)\u00a7 \n\n-2.66 \n\n(-3.50, -1.82) \n\n-3.63 \n\n(-7.25, - 0.02) \n\n-0.11 \n\n(-0.19, -0.03) \n\n\u00a7 Excludes patients with splenectomy.

Among 31 treatment-na\u00efve adult patients treated with velaglucerase alfa, the mean lumbar spine \n\nBMD Z-score at baseline was -1.820 (95% CI: -2.21, -1.43) and increased by 0.62 (95% CI: 0.39, \n\n0.84) from baseline following 24 months of treatment with velaglucerase alfa. Similar results were \n\nseen in treatment-na\u00efve patients who received 9 months of imiglucerase followed by velaglucerase alfa \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nfor 15 months. In patients who switched from long-term imiglucerase to velaglucerase alfa, lumbar \n\nspine BMD was maintained at 24 months. In contrast, no significant change in femoral neck BMD was \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\nIn the paediatric population (ages 4 to 17 years studied), increases in the mean height Z-score were \n\nseen through 60 months of treatment in the overall treatment-na\u00efve population, suggesting a beneficial \n\ntreatment effect with velaglucerase alfa on linear growth. Similar treatment effects were seen through \n\n48 months in the paediatric population who received 9 months of imiglucerase followed by \n\nvelaglucerase alfa. Paediatric subjects who switched from long-term imiglucerase to velaglucerase alfa \n\nin study 034 had greater mean height Z-scores at baseline and their mean height Z-scores remained \n\nstable over time. \n\n \n\nThese treatment effects on haemoglobin, platelet count, organ volumes, bone mineral density and \n\nheight were maintained through the end of the study. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nUse in the age group 4 to 17 is supported by evidence from controlled studies in adults and paediatric \n\n[20 of 94 (21%)] patients. The safety and efficacy profiles were similar between paediatric and adult \n\npatients. The studies allowed the inclusion of patients 2 years and older and the safety and efficacy \n\nprofiles are expected to be similar down to the age of 2 years. However, no data are available for \n\nchildren under the age of 4 years. The effect on height was assessed in the study 044 (see section 5.1, \n\nextension study 044). \n\n \n\nPhase I/II study HGT-GCB-068 was conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of velaglucerase alfa \n\nERT in treatment na\u00efve children and adolescents with type 3 Gaucher disease. This was a multicentre, \n\nopen-label study in which 60 U/kg of velaglucerase alfa was administered by intravenous infusion \n\nevery other week (EOW) over 12 months in 6 patients (2 to 17 years of age at enrolment) with a \n\nconfirmed diagnosis of type 3 Gaucher disease. \n\n \n\nIn this small, exploratory study, the non-neurological efficacy findings and the safety profile of \n\nintravenous velaglucerase alfa in type 3 Gaucher patients were consistent with those observed in \n\npatients with type 1 Gaucher disease. There was no indication of significant improvements of the \n\nneurological manifestations of type 3 Gaucher disease except for one patient in this study. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nVPRIV in all subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 Gaucher disease (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use).  \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThere were no apparent pharmacokinetic differences between male and female patients with type 1 \n\nGaucher disease. None of the subjects in the pharmacokinetic studies were positive for \n\nanti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies on the days of pharmacokinetic evaluation. Therefore, it was not \n\npossible to evaluate the effect of antibody response on the pharmacokinetic profile of velaglucerase \n\nalfa. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nVelaglucerase alfa serum concentrations rose rapidly for the first 20 minutes of the 60-minute infusion \n\nbefore levelling off, and Cmax was typically attained between 40 and 60 minutes after the start of the \n\ninfusion. After the end of the infusion, velaglucerase alfa serum concentrations fell rapidly in a \n\nmonophasic or biphasic fashion with a mean t1/2 ranging from 5 to 12 minutes at doses of 15, 30, 45, \n\nand 60 Units/kg. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nVelaglucerase alfa exhibited an approximately linear (i.e. first-order) pharmacokinetic profile, and \n\nCmax and AUC increased approximately proportional to the dose over the dose range 15 to 60 Units/kg. \n\nThe steady state volume of distribution was approximately 10% of the body weight. The high \n\nclearance of velaglucerase alfa from serum (mean 6.7 to 7.6 ml/min/kg) is consistent with the rapid \n\nuptake of velaglucerase alfa into macrophages via mannose receptors. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe range of velaglucerase alfa clearance in paediatric patients (N=7, age range 4 to 17 years) was \n\ncontained within the range of clearance values in adult patients (N=15, age range 19 to 62 years). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nVPRIV 400 Units powder for solution for infusion \n\nvelaglucerase alfa  \n\n  \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet (see section 4).  \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet  \n\n \n\n1. What VPRIV is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before VPRIV is used \n\n3. How VPRIV is used \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store VPRIV \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What VPRIV is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nVPRIV is a long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. \n\n \n\nGaucher disease is a genetic disorder caused by a missing or defective enzyme named \n\nglucocerebrosidase. When this enzyme is missing or does not work properly, a substance called \n\nglucocerebroside builds up inside cells in the body. The build-up of this material causes the signs and \n\nsymptoms found in Gaucher disease. \n\n \n\nVPRIV contains a substance called velaglucerase alfa which is designed to replace the missing or \n\ndefective enzyme, glucocerebrosidase, in patients with Gaucher disease. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before VPRIV is used \n\n \n\nDo not use VPRIV  \n\n- if you are severely allergic to velaglucerase alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n(listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before VPRIV is used \n\n- If you are treated with VPRIV, you may experience side effects during or following the infusion \n(see section 4, possible side effects). These are called infusion related reactions and might \n\nappear as a hypersensitivity reaction with symptoms like nausea, rash, difficulty in breathing, \n\nback pain, chest discomfort (chest tightness), hives, joint pain or headache. \n\n- Apart from symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions infusion-related reactions might show as \ndizziness, high blood pressure, tiredness, fever, itching, or blurry vision. \n\nIf you experience any of the symptoms, you must tell your doctor immediately. \n\n- You may be given additional medicines to treat or help prevent future reactions. These \nmedicines may include antihistamines, antipyretics, and corticosteroids. \n\n- If the reaction is severe, your doctor will stop the intravenous infusion immediately and start \ngiving you appropriate medical treatment. \n\n- If the reactions are severe and/or there is a loss of effect from this medicine, your doctor will \nperform a blood test to check for antibodies which may affect the outcome of your treatment  \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n- Your doctor or nurse may decide to continue to administer VPRIV even if you experience any \ninfusion related-reaction. Your condition will be closely monitored. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you have previously experienced an infusion-related reaction with other ERT for \n\nGaucher disease. \n\n \n\nChildren \n\nVPRIV should not be used in children under the age of 4 years because there is no experience of using \n\nthe medicine in this age group. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and VPRIV \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \n\nGaucher disease may become more active in a woman during pregnancy and for a few weeks after \n\nbirth.
