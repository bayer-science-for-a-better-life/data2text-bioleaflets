This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See \n\nsection 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nRaplixa sealant powder \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach gram of powder contains 79 mg human fibrinogen and 726 IU human thrombin. \n\nRaplixa is supplied in three different presentations 0.5 grams (39.5 mg human fibrinogen and 363 IU \n\nhuman thrombin), 1 gram (79 mg human fibrinogen and 726 IU human thrombin) and 2 grams (158 mg \n\nhuman fibrinogen and 1452 IU human thrombin). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSealant powder \n\nDry white powder. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nSupportive treatment where standard surgical techniques are insufficient for improvement of haemostasis. \n\nRaplixa must be used in combination with an approved gelatin sponge (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nRaplixa is indicated in adults over 18 years of age. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nThe use of Raplixa is restricted to experienced surgeons. \n\nGelatin sponges must be used in combination with Raplixa. Gelatin sponges are CE marked and separately \n\nsupplied and packed (see instructions for use for the specific gelatin sponge selected for use). \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe amount of Raplixa to be applied and the frequency of application should always be oriented towards \n\nthe underlying clinical needs for the patient. The dose to be applied is governed by variables including, but \n\nnot limited to, the type of surgery, the size of the bleeding surface area, the severity of bleeding, the mode \n\nof application selected by the surgeon, and the number of applications. \n\nApplication of the product must be individualised by the treating surgeon. In clinical trials a thin layer of \n\nRaplixa produced doses that typically ranged from 0.3 to 2 g. For some procedures eg. liver resection, \n\nlarger amounts may be required. The initial amount of the product to be applied at a chosen anatomic site \n\nor target surface area should be sufficient to entirely cover the intended application area with a thin layer \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nof Raplixa which is then covered by an absorbable gelatin sponge (saline-wetted). The application can be \n\nrepeated, if necessary. \n\n \n\nThe required dose of Raplixa, can vary based on the size of the area to be treated. In clinical trials, smaller \n\nbleeding sites (< 10 cm\u00b2) used 0.5 g to 1 g on average. Larger bleeding sites used 1 to 2 grams \n\n(10-100 cm\u00b2). It is known from in vitro testing that 1 g can cover 100 cm\u00b2 using the RaplixaSpray device. \n\nMaximum amount of Raplixa recommended is 3 gram. \n\n \n\nThe required dose of Raplixa based on the size of the bleeding surface area to be treated is shown in the \n\ntable below: \n\n \n\nTable 1: Required Dose of Raplixa \n\nMaximum Surface Area \n\nDirect Application from Vial \n\nMaximum Surface Area \n\nApplication Using RaplixaSpray \n\nRaplixa Package Size \n\n25 cm\u00b2 50 cm\u00b2 0.5 g \n\n50 cm\u00b2 100 cm\u00b2 1.0 g \n\n \n\nPaediatric Population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Raplixa in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available, Raplixa is therefore not recommended for use in children and \n\nadolescents. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nDose adjustment not required. \n\n \n\nMethod and route of administration \n\nFor epilesional use only. \n\nFor instructions on use of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\nOne of the following methods of application of Raplixa may be used based on the type of surgery, location \n\nand size and severity of the bleeding: \n\n \n\nDirect application followed by gelatin sponge \n\nPowder is applied directly from the vial onto the bleeding surface and then applied to a CE marked gelatin \n\nsponge cut to the appropriate size and apply manual pressure with sterile gauze. \n\n \n\nApply first to gelatin sponge \n\nPowder is applied directly from the vial onto a saline-wetted CE marked gelatin sponge and then applied \n\nto the bleeding site. When using a moistened gelatin sponge, a thin layer of Raplixa should be applied to \n\nthe sponge immediately prior to application to the bleeding site. \n\n \n\nSpray application using RaplixaSpray device followed by gelatin sponge \n\nThe vial and RaplixaSpray device are taken out of their respective pouches maintaining sterility. Connect \n\nthe RaplixaSpray device to the RaplixaReg pressure regulator and thereby to the medical CO2 gas supply \n\n(CO2 is recommended; Raplixa may be also used with medical grade air) set to a pressure setting of \n\n1.5 bar (22 psi). \n\n \n\nThe vial should be held upright, shaken gently and the aluminium cap and rubber stopper should be \n\nremoved. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nThe vial with powder is attached to the RaplixaSpray device by inverting the device over the upright vial \n\nand pushing the vial into place. \n\n \n\nThe RaplixaSpray device is used to spray the powder on to the bleeding site and then the gelatin sponge is \n\napplied (see Instructions For Use for RaplixaSpray device and gelatin sponge). \n\nApplication must be within 2 hours after connecting the vial to the device. \n\nThe RaplixaSpray device comes with the rigid nozzle attached. This may be removed and the flexible \n\nnozzle can be attached depending on the intended use and surgeon preference. \n\n \n\nTo avoid the risk of potentially life-threatening air embolism Raplixa is recommended to be sprayed using \n\npressurised CO2. Raplixa may also be used with medical air (see sections 4.4 and 6.6). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nKnown hypersensitivity to the Raplixa active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nRaplixa must not be applied intravascularly. \n\nSpray application of Raplixa must not be used in endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures. \n\nRaplixa must not be used as a glue for the fixation of patches. \n\nRaplixa must not be used as a glue for intestines (gastrointestinal anastomoses). \n\nDo not use Raplixa for treatment of severe arterial bleeding. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nUse and Application \n\nFor epilesional use only. Do not apply intravascularly. Follow specific instructions for use of the \n\nabsorbable gelatin sponge. \n\nDo not use Raplixa (and gelatin sponge) in contaminated areas of the body, or in the presence of active \n\ninfection. \n\n \n\nIntravascular application \n\nLife threatening thromboembolic complications may occur if the preparation is unintentionally applied \n\nintravascularly. \n\n \n\nAir or gas emboli \n\nLife threatening air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing a pressure \n\nregulator to administer fibrin sealant/haemostatic products. This event appears to be related to the use of \n\nspray devices at higher than recommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface. The \n\nrisk appears to be higher when fibrin sealants are sprayed with air, as compared to CO2 and therefore \n\ncannot be excluded with Raplixa. Before administration of Raplixa care is to be taken that parts of the \n\nbody outside the desired application area are sufficiently protected (covered) to prevent tissue adhesion at \n\nundesired sites. Spray application of Raplixa should only be used if it is possible to accurately judge the \n\nspray distance. Spray distance from tissue and pressure should be within the ranges recommended by the \n\nmanufacturer (see table in section 6.6 for pressure and distance). \n\n \n\nWhen spraying Raplixa, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation and end tidal CO2 should be \n\nmonitored because of the possibility of occurrence of air or gas embolism. \n\nWhen using accessory nozzles with this product, the instructions for use of the nozzles should be \n\nfollowed. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nAs with any protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Signs of hypersensitivity \n\nreactions may include hives, generalized urticarial, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and \n\nanaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur, the administration should be discontinued immediately. \n\nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n\n \n\nTransmissible infectious agents \n\nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from \n\nhuman blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools \n\nfor specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the \n\ninactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or \n\nplasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This \n\nalso applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. \n\nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such human immunodeficiency virus \n\n(HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). \n\nThe measures may be of limited value against non- enveloped viruses such as HAV and parvovirus B19. \n\nParvovirus B19 may be serious for pregnant women (fetal infection) and of individuals with \n\nimmunodeficiency or increased erythropoiesis (e.g. Haemolytic anaemia). \n\n \n\nOther \n\nRaplixa has been studied in patients undergoing spinal surgery, vascular surgery, soft tissue surgery and \n\nhepatic resection. There is limited experience of use of Raplixa in vascular surgery when applied with the \n\nRaplixaSpray device. \n\nData are not available to support the use of this product in tissue gluing, neurosurgery, application through \n\na flexible endoscope for treatment of bleeding or in gastrointestinal anastomoses. \n\n \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time Raplixa is administered to a patient, the name and batch \n\nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \n\nproduct. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nNo formal interaction studies have been performed. \n\nRaplixa may be denatured after exposure to solutions containing alcohol, iodine or heavy metals (e.g. \n\nantiseptic solutions). Such substances should be removed as much as possible before applying the product. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy and Breast-feeding \n\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Raplixa. The safety of Raplixa for use in \n\nhuman pregnancy or during breast-feeding has not been established in controlled clinical trials. \n\nThe product should not be administered to pregnant and breast-feeding women. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nFertility studies have not been conducted. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nNot relevant. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \n\napplication site, bronchospasm, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, \n\nlethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) may occur \n\nin isolated cases in patients treated with fibrin sealants / haemostatics: these reactions have progressed to \n\nsevere anaphylaxis. Such reactions may especially be seen, if the preparation is applied repeatedly, or \n\nadministered to patients known to be hypersensitive to constituents of the product. \n\n \n\nAntibodies against components of fibrin sealant/haemostatic products may occur rarely. \n\nInadvertent intravascular injection could lead to thromboembolic event and disseminated intravascular \n\ncoagulation (DIC), and there is also a risk of anaphylactic reaction (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nLife threatening air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing pressure \n\nregulators to administer the fibrin sealant. This event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at \n\nhigher than recommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface. The risk appears to be \n\nhigher when fibrin sealants are sprayed with air, as compared to CO2 and therefore cannot be excluded \n\nwith Raplixa. \n\n \n\nFor safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nSystem organ class Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \n\nGeneral disorders and administrative site conditions Insomnia \n\nPruritus \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. \n\nHealthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting \n\nsystem. \n\n \n\nIreland \n\nHPRA Pharmacovigilance \n\nEarlsfort Terrace \n\nIRL - Dublin 2 \n\nTel: +353 1 6764971 \n\nFax: +353 1 6762517 \n\nWebsite: www.hpra.ie \n\ne-mail: medsafety@hpra.ie \n\n \n\nUnited Kingdom \n\nYellow Card Scheme \n\nWebsite: www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nIn the event of overdose, patients must be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions \n\nand appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive measures instituted. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: local haemostatics, other haemostatics \n\nATC code: B02BC30 \n\n \n\nMechanism of Action \n\nThe fibrin adhesion system initiates the last phase of physiological blood coagulation. Conversion of \n\nfibrinogen into fibrin occurs by the splitting of fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and fibrinopeptides. The \n\nfibrin monomers aggregate and form a fibrin clot. Factor XIIIa, which is activated from factor XIII by \n\nthrombin, crosslinks fibrin. Calcium ions are required for both, the conversion of fibrinogen and the \n\ncrosslinkage of fibrin. \n\n \n\nAs wound healing progresses, increased fibrinolytic activity is induced by plasmin and decomposition of \n\nfibrin to fibrin degradation products is initiated. \n\nClinical studies with Raplixa demonstrating haemostasis were conducted in patients undergoing spinal \n\n(n=146), vascular (n=137), liver (n=158) and soft tissue surgery (n=125). \n\n \n\nClinical studies in the EU were done with the CE marked Spongostan gelatin sponge. Bleeding at target \n\nsites was mild or moderate. Conventional surgical techniques such as suture, ligature and cautery were \n\nineffective or impractical. The combination of Raplixa and a gelatin sponge reduced the median time to \n\nhaemostasis at target sites by up to 2 minutes compared to a gelatin sponge alone. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Raplixa \n\nin one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of haemorrhage resulting from surgical \n\nprocedure as per Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) decision, for the granted indication (see section 4.2 \n\nfor information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nRaplixa is intended for epilesional use only. Intravascular administration is contraindicated. As a \n\nconsequence, intravascular pharmacokinetic studies were not performed in man. \n\nFibrin Sealants/haemostatics are metabolised in the same way as endogenous fibrin by fibrinolysis and \n\nphagocytosis. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

The Raplixa should be stored at \n\ncontrolled, ambient room temperature. The outer aluminium foil sachet may be opened in a non-sterile \n\noperating area. The vial must be opened in a sterile field. \n\n \n\nThere are three methods of application: direct application of Raplixa to the bleeding tissue followed by \n\napplication of the gelatin sponge or application of Raplixa first to a gelatin sponge and application of the \n\nsponge to the bleeding tissue; or application of the Raplixa powder by using the RaplixaSpray device \n\nfollowed by the application of the gelatin sponge. \n\n \n\nPrior to applying Raplixa the surface area of the wound needs to be dried by standard techniques (e.g. \n\nintermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices). \n\n \n\nThe product should only be administered according to the instructions and with the devices recommended \n\nfor this product. \n\n \n\nThe initial amount of the product to be applied at a chosen anatomic site or target surface area should be \n\nsufficient to entirely cover the intended application area with a thin layer of Raplixa which is then covered \n\nby an absorbable gelatin sponge (saline-wetted). The application can be repeated, if necessary. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nWhen using the RaplixaSpray device \n\nTake the vial and device out of their respective pouches maintaining sterility. Connect the RaplixaSpray \n\ndevice to the RaplixaReg air pressure regulator or CO2 pressure regulator and thereby to the medical air or \n\nCO2 gas supply set to a pressure setting of 1.5 bar (22 psi). Hold the vial upright, shake gently and remove \n\nthe aluminium cap and rubber stopper. \n\n \n\nConnect the vial to the device by inverting the device over the upright vial and pushing the vial into place. \n\nRaplixa should not be sprayed at a distance closer than that recommended by the spray device \n\nmanufacturer and in no case closer than 5 cm from the tissue surface. \n\n \n\nThe pressure should be within the range recommended by ProFibrix. Spray application of Raplixa should \n\nonly be done using the provided spray application accessories and the pressure should not exceed 1.5 bars \n\n(22 psi). \n\n \n\nApplication must be within 2 hours after connecting the vial to the device. The RaplixaSpray device \n\ncomes with the rigid nozzle attached, which can be easily removed and the flexible nozzle attached \n\ndepending on the intended use and surgeon preference. \n\nTo avoid the risk of potentially life-threatening air embolism, it is recommended that Raplixa should be \n\nsprayed using pressurised CO2. Raplixa may also be used with medical air. See section 4.4. \n\n \n\nWhen spraying Raplixa, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation and end tidal CO2 should be \n\nmonitored because of the possibility of occurrence of air or gas embolism. \n\n \n\nSurgery Spray set to \n\nbe used \n\nApplicator \n\ntips to be used \n\nPressure \n\nregulator to \n\nbe used \n\nRecommended \n\ndistance from \n\ntarget tissue \n\nRecommended \n\nspray pressure \n\nOpen surgery 1 1 or 2 RaplixaReg 5 cm 1.5 Bar (22 psi) \n\n \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

What Raplixa is and what it is used for \n \n\nThe active ingredient fibrinogen is a concentrate of clottable protein; the other active ingredient thrombin \n\nis an enzyme that causes clottable protein to coalesce to form a plug. \n\n \n\nRaplixa is applied during surgical operations, to reduce bleeding and oozing during and after the operation \n\nin adults. In combination with a gelatin sponge, Raplixa is applied or sprayed onto cut tissue where it \n\nforms a layer that helps to stop bleeding. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are treated with Raplixa \n \n\nDo not use Raplixa: \n\n- if you are allergic to human fibrinogen, human thrombin or any of the other ingredients of this \nmedicine (listed in section 6) \n\n- directly inside a blood vessel \n- in endoscopic procedures (procedures that use an endoscope for viewing internal organs) or keyhole \n\nsurgery \n\n- as a glue for the fixation of patches \n- as a glue for intestines (gastrointestinal anastomoses) \n- on severe arterial bleeds \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n\uf0b7 When Raplixa is applied during surgery, the surgeon must ensure that it is only applied onto the \nsurface of tissue. Raplixa must not be injected into blood vessels because it would cause clots which \n\ncould be fatal. \n\n\uf0b7 Use of Raplixa has only been shown to arrest bleeding in surgery visualized through the incision \n(open surgery). \n\n\uf0b7 Raplixa will be applied as a thin layer. Excessive clot thickness may negatively interfere with the \nproduct\u2019s efficacy and the wound healing process. \n\n \n\nLife-threatening events have occurred with the use of other spray devices employing a pressure regulator \n\nto administer other fibrin sealants. This event occurs when an air or gas bubble or bubbles enter a vein or \n\nartery and block it. It is called an air or gas embolism. This event appears to be related to the use of the \n\nspray device at higher than recommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface. The \n\nrisk appears to be higher when fibrin sealants are sprayed with air as compared to CO2 and therefore \n\ncannot be excluded with Raplixa. The Raplixa spray device (RaplixaSpray) should only be used if it is \n\npossible to accurately judge the spray distance. \n\n \n\nWhen applying Raplixa using a spray device, a defined pressure within the range recommended by the \n\nspray device manufacturer is to be used. In addition, the spray device should not be used closer than the \n\nrecommended distances. When spraying Raplixa, safety will be monitored because of the possibility of \n\noccurrence of air or gas embolism. The spray device and the accessory nozzle are provided with \n\ninstructions for use, which should be carefully followed. \n\n\uf0b7 Nearby areas should be protected to make sure that Raplixa is only applied onto the surface which \nis to be treated. \n\n\uf0b7 When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put into place to \nprevent infections being passed on to patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma \n\ndonors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each \n\ndonation and pools of plasma for signs of viruses/infections. Manufacturers of these products also \n\ninclude steps in the processing of the blood and plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. \n\nDespite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, \n\nthe possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown \n\nor emerging viruses, or other types of infections. \n\n \n\nThe measures taken in the manufacture of fibrinogen and thrombin are considered effective for lipid \n\ncoated viruses such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. The \n\nmeasures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses as hepatitis A virus and parvovirus \n\nB19 (causing fifth disease). Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (foetal \n\ninfection) and for individuals whose immune system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia (for \n\nexample sickle cell disease or haemolytic anaemia). \n\n \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Raplixa the name and batch number of \n\nthe medicine are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nRaplixa has not been evaluated for safety and effectiveness in children. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Raplixa \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nRaplixa should not be administered during pregnancy and breast-feeding. There is not enough information \n\navailable to know whether any particular risks are associated with the use of Raplixa during pregnancy or \n\nwhilst breast-feeding. \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \n\ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to Use Raplixa \n \n\nThe use of Raplixa is restricted to experienced surgeons who have been trained in the use of Raplixa. \n\n \n\nThe surgeon treating you will administer Raplixa during surgery. \n\nPrior to applying Raplixa the surface area of the wound needs to be dried by standard techniques (e.g. \n\nintermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices). \n\n \n\nThere are three methods of administration of Raplixa: \n\n- Application of Raplixa straight from the vial to the bleeding site followed by the application of the \ngelatin sponge. \n\n- Application from the vial onto a wetted gelatin sponge and then applied to the bleeding site. \n- The third method is application of Raplixa onto the bleeding site using the recommended spray \n\ndevice followed by the application of the gelatin sponge. \n\n \n\nThe amount of Raplixa that will be applied depends on the surface area to be treated during the operation \n\nand the severity of the blood loss. When Raplixa is applied directly to the surgical bleeding site, a thin \n\nlayer should be used to cover the bleeding/oozing area completely. If application of a single layer of \n\nRaplixa does not completely stop the bleeding, more may be applied. \n\n \n\nWhen applying Raplixa using the recommended spray device, your surgeon must be sure to use a pressure \n\nand a distance from tissue within the range recommended by the manufacturer as follows: \n\n \n\nSurgery Spray set to \n\nbe used \n\nApplicator \n\ntips to be used \n\nPressure \n\nregulator to \n\nbe used \n\nRecommended \n\ndistance from \n\ntarget tissue \n\nRecommended \n\nspray pressure \n\nOpen surgery 1 1 or 2 RaplixaReg 5 cm 1.5 Bar (22 psi) \n\n \n\nWhen spraying Raplixa, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation and end tidal CO2 should be \n\nmonitored because of the possibility of occurrence of air or gas embolism. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nFibrin sealants may, in rare cases (up to 1 in 1,000 people), cause an allergic reaction. If you experience an \n\nallergic reaction you might have one or more of the following symptoms: skin rash, hives or wheals \n\n(nettle-rash), tightness of the chest, chills, flushing, headache, low blood pressure, lethargy, nausea, \n\nrestlessness, increased heart rate, tingling, vomiting or wheezing. If you experience any symptoms such as \n\nvomiting with blood, blood in your stool, blood in your draining tube from your abdomen, swelling or \n\nskin discolouration in your extremities, chest pain and shortness of breath, and/or any other symptoms \n\nrelated to your surgery, please contact your doctor or surgeon immediately. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\nThere is also a possibility that you could develop antibodies to the proteins in Raplixa, which could \n\npotentially interfere with blood clotting. The frequency of the type of event is not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from available data). \n\n \n\nThe following side effects have also been reported: \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n\uf0b7 Itch \n\n\uf0b7 Difficulty sleeping \n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system. \n\nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n\n \n\nIreland \n\nHPRA Pharmacovigilance \n\nEarlsfort Terrace \n\nIRL - Dublin 2 \n\nTel: +353 1 6764971 \n\nFax: +353 1 6762517 \n\nWebsite: www.hpra.ie \n\ne-mail: medsafety@hpra.ie \n\n \n\nUnited Kingdom \n\nYellow Card Scheme \n\nWebsite: www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

When using a moistened gelatin sponge, a thin layer of Raplixa should be applied to \n\nthe sponge immediately prior to application to the bleeding site. \n\n \n\nSpray application using Raplixa spray device followed by gelatin sponge \n\nUse Raplixa with the Raplixa spray device. \n\n \n\nThe vial and Raplixa spray device should be taken out of their respective pouches maintaining sterility. \n\n \n\nThe Raplixa spray device is connected to the RaplixaReg pressure regulator and thereby to the medical \n\ngas supply set to a pressure setting of 1.5 bar (22 psi). \n\n \n\nThe vial should be held upright, shake gently and the aluminium cap and rubber stopper should be \n\nremoved. \n\n \n\nThe vial with powder is attached to the Raplixa spray device by inverting the device over the upright vial \n\nand pushing the vial into place. \n\n \n\nThe Raplixa spray device is used to spray the powder on to the bleeding site and then the gelatin sheet is \n\napplied (see Instructions For Use for Raplixa spray device and gelatin sponge). \n\n \n\nApplication must be within 2 hours after connecting the vial to the device. \n\n \n\nThe Raplixa spray device comes with the rigid nozzle attached. This may be removed and the flexible \n\nnozzle attached depending on the intended use and surgeon preference. \n\n \n\nLife threatening air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing pressure \n\nregulators to administer the fibrin sealant. This event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at \n\nhigher than recommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface. The risk appears to be \n\nhigher when fibrin sealants are sprayed with air, as compared to CO2 and therefore cannot be excluded \n\nwith Raplixa. \n\nTo avoid the risk of potentially life-threatening air embolism Raplixa is recommended to be sprayed using \n\npressurised CO2. Raplixa may also be used with medical air. \n\n \n\nWhen spraying Raplixa, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation, and end tidal CO2 should be \n\nmonitored because of the possibility of occurrence of air or gas embolism. \n\nWhen applying Raplixa using the Raplixa spray device, the pressure should be within the range \n\nrecommended by ProFibrix. Spray application of Raplixa should only be done using the provided spray \n\napplication accessories and the pressure should not exceed 1.5 bars (22 psi). Raplixa should not be \n\nsprayed at a distance closer than that recommended by the spray device manufacturer and in no case closer \n\nthan 5 cm from the tissue surface. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nSurgery Spray set to \n\nbe used \n\nApplicator \n\ntips to be used \n\nPressure \n\nregulator to \n\nbe used \n\nRecommended \n\ndistance from \n\ntarget tissue \n\nRecommended \n\nspray pressure \n\nOpen surgery 1 1 or 2 RaplixaReg 5 cm 1.5 Bar (22 psi) \n\n \n\nDisposal \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

human thrombin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) - directly inside a blood vessel - in endoscopic procedures (procedures that use an endoscope for viewing internal organs) or keyhole surgery - as a glue for the fixation of patches - as a glue for intestines (gastrointestinal anastomoses) - on severe arterial bleeds 24 warnings and precautions when raplixa is applied during surgery, the surgeon must ensure that it is only applied onto the surface of tissue. raplixa must not be injected into blood vessels because it would cause clots which could be fatal. use of raplixa has only been shown to arrest bleeding in surgery visualized through the incision (open surgery). raplixa will be applied as a thin layer. excessive clot thickness may negatively interfere with the product's efficacy and the wound healing process. life-threatening events have occurred with the use of other spray devices employing a pressure regulator to administer other fibrin sealants. this event occurs when an air or gas bubble or bubbles enter a vein or artery and block it. it is called an air or gas embolism. this event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at higher than recommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface. the risk appears to be higher when fibrin sealants are sprayed with air as compared to co2 and therefore cannot be excluded with raplixa. the raplixa spray device (raplixaspray) should only be used if it is possible to accurately judge the spray distance. when applying raplixa using a spray device, a defined pressure within the range recommended by the spray device manufacturer is to be used. in addition, the spray device should not be used closer than the recommended distances. when spraying raplixa, safety will be monitored because of the possibility of occurrence of air or gas embolism. the spray device and the accessory nozzle are provided with instructions for use, which should be carefully followed. nearby areas should be protected to make sure that raplixa is only applied onto the surface which is to be treated. when medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put into place to prevent infections being passed on to patients. these include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of viruses/infections. manufacturers of these products also include steps in the processing of the blood and plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. this also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses, or other types of infections. the measures taken in the manufacture of fibrinogen and thrombin are considered effective for lipid coated viruses such as hiv (human immunodeficiency virus), hepatitis b virus and hepatitis c virus. the measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses as hepatitis a virus and parvovirus b19 (causing fifth disease). parvovirus b19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals whose immune system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia (for example sickle cell disease or haemolytic anaemia). it is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of raplixa the name and batch number of the medicine are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. children and adolescents raplixa has not been evaluated for safety and effectiveness in children. other medicines and raplixa tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. pregnancy and breast-feeding raplixa should not be administered during pregnancy and breast-feeding. there is not enough information available to know whether any particular risks are associated with the use of raplixa during pregnancy or whilst breast-feeding. if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have

been trained in the use of raplixa. the surgeon treating you will administer raplixa during surgery. prior to applying raplixa the surface area of the wound needs to be dried by standard techniques (e.g. intermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices). there are three methods of administration of raplixa: - application of raplixa straight from the vial to the bleeding site followed by the application of the gelatin sponge. - application from the vial onto a wetted gelatin sponge and then applied to the bleeding site. - the third method is application of raplixa onto the bleeding site using the recommended spray device followed by the application of the gelatin sponge. the amount of raplixa that will be applied depends on the surface area to be treated during the operation and the severity of the blood loss. when raplixa is applied directly to the surgical bleeding site, a thin layer should be used to cover the bleeding/oozing area completely. if application of a single layer of raplixa does not completely stop the bleeding, more may be applied. when applying raplixa using the recommended spray device, your surgeon must be sure to use a pressure and a distance from tissue within the range recommended by the manufacturer as follows: surgery spray set to be used applicator tips to be used pressure regulator to be used recommended distance from target tissue recommended spray pressure open surgery 1 1 or 2 raplixareg 5 cm 1.5 bar (22 psi) when spraying raplixa, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation and end tidal co2 should be
