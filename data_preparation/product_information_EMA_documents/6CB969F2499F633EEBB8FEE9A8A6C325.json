NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nREZOLSTA 800 mg/150 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 800 mg of darunavir (as ethanolate) and 150 mg of cobicistat.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).\nPink oval shaped tablet of 23 mm x 11.5 mm, debossed with “800” on one side and “TG” on the other \nside.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nREZOLSTA is indicated, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, for the \ntreatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and adolescents (aged \n12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg).\n\nGenotypic testing should guide the use of REZOLSTA (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a healthcare provider experienced in the management of HIV infection.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose regimen in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, weighing at least \n40 kg, is one tablet taken once daily with food.\n\nART-naïve patients\nThe recommended dose regimen is one film-coated tablet of REZOLSTA once daily taken with food.\n\nART-experienced patients\nOne film-coated tablet of REZOLSTA once daily taken with food may be used in patients with prior \nexposure to antiretroviral medicinal products, but without darunavir resistance associated mutations \n(DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/mL and CD4+ cell count \n≥ 100 cells x 106/L (see section 4.1).\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V, L89V.\n\nIn all other ART-experienced patients or if HIV-1 genotype testing is not available, the use of\nREZOLSTA is not appropriate and another antiretroviral regimen should be used. Refer to the \nSummary of Product Characteristics of other antiretroviral medicinal products for dosing information.\n\nAdvice on missed doses\nIf REZOLSTA is missed within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, patients should be instructed \nto take the prescribed dose of REZOLSTA with food as soon as possible. If this is noticed later than \n12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the missed dose should not be taken and the patient should \nresume the usual dosing schedule.\n\n\n\n3\n\nIf a patient vomits within 4 hours of taking the medicine, another dose of REZOLSTA should be taken \nwith food as soon as possible. If a patient vomits more than 4 hours after taking the medicine, the \npatient does not need to take another dose of REZOLSTA until the next regularly scheduled time.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nLimited information is available in this population, and therefore, REZOLSTA should be used with \ncaution in patients above 65 years of age (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nThere are no pharmacokinetic data regarding the use of REZOLSTA in patients with hepatic \nimpairment.\n\nDarunavir and cobicistat are metabolised by the hepatic system. Separate trials of darunavir/ritonavir \nand cobicistat suggest no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) \nor moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, however, REZOLSTA should be used with \ncaution in these patients.\n\nThere are no data regarding the use of darunavir or cobicistat in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. Severe hepatic impairment could result in an increase of darunavir and/or cobicistat \nexposure and a worsening of its safety profile. Therefore, REZOLSTA must not be used in patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nCobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular \nsecretion of creatinine. REZOLSTA should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less \nthan 70 mL/min, if any co-administered medicinal product (e.g. emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir \ndisoproxil (as fumarate, phosphate or succinate), or adefovir dipivoxil) requires dose adjustment based \non creatinine clearance (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2).\n\nBased on the very limited renal elimination of cobicistat and darunavir, no special precautions or dose \nadjustments of REZOLSTA are required for patients with renal impairment. Darunavir, cobicistat, or \nthe combination of both have not been studied in patients receiving dialysis, and therefore no \nrecommendation can be made for these patients (see section 5.2).\n\nFor more information consult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of REZOLSTA in paediatric patients aged 3 to 11 years, or weighing < 40 kg,\nhave not been established (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). No data are available. REZOLSTA should not be \nused in paediatric patients below 3 years of age because of safety concerns (see sections 4.4 and 5.3).\n\nPregnancy and postpartum\nTreatment with REZOLSTA during pregnancy results in low darunavir exposure (see sections 4.4 and \n5.2). Therefore, therapy with REZOLSTA should not be initiated during pregnancy, and women who \nbecome pregnant during therapy with REZOLSTA should be switched to an alternative regimen (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.6). Darunavir/ritonavir may be considered as an alternative.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use\nTo ensure administration of the entire dose of both darunavir and cobicistat, the tablet should be \nswallowed whole. For patients unable to swallow the whole tablet, REZOLSTA may be split into two \npieces using a tablet-cutter, and the entire dose should be consumed immediately after splitting.\n\n\n\n4\n\nPatients should be instructed to take REZOLSTA within 30 minutes after completion of a meal (see \nsections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nPatients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.\n\nCo-administration with the following medicinal products due to the potential for loss of therapeutic \neffect (see section 4.5):\n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- rifampicin\n- lopinavir/ritonavir\n- St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).\n\nCo-administration with the following medicinal products due to the potential for serious and/or \nlife-threatening adverse reactions (see section 4.5):\n- alfuzosin\n- amiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine, quinidine, ranolazine\n- astemizole, terfenadine\n- colchicine, when used in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see section 4.5)\n- rifampicin\n- ergot derivatives (e.g. dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergonovine)\n- cisapride\n- dapoxetine\n- domperidone\n- naloxegol\n- lurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine, sertindole (see section 4.5)\n- elbasvir/grazoprevir\n- triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, \n\nsee section 4.5)\n- sildenafil - when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, avanafil\n- simvastatin, lovastatin and lomitapide (see section 4.5)\n- dabigatran, ticagrelor.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nRegular assessment of virological response is advised. In the setting of lack or loss of virological \nresponse, resistance testing should be performed.\n\nDarunavir binds predominantly to 1-acid glycoprotein. This protein binding is concentration \ndependent indicative for saturation of binding. Therefore, protein displacement of medicinal products \nhighly bound to 1-acid glycoprotein cannot be ruled out (see section 4.5).\n\nART-experienced patients\n\nREZOLSTA should not be used in treatment-experienced patients with one or more DRV-RAMs or \nHIV-1 RNA ≥ 100,000 copies/mL or CD4+ cell count < 100 cells x 106/L (see section 4.2).\n\nCombinations with optimised background regimens (OBRs) other than ≥ 2 NRTIs have not been \nstudied in this population. Limited data is available in patients with HIV-1 clades other than B (see \nsection 5.1).\n\n\n\n5\n\nPregnancy\n\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg during the second and third trimester has been shown\nto result in low darunavir exposure, with a reduction of around 90% in Cmin levels (see section 5.2). \nCobicistat levels decrease and may not provide sufficient boosting. The substantial reduction in \ndarunavir exposure may result in virological failure and an increased risk of mother to child \ntransmission of HIV infection. Therefore, therapy with REZOLSTA should not be initiated during \npregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with REZOLSTA should be switched to \nan alternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.6). Darunavir given with low dose ritonavir may be \nconsidered as an alternative.\n\nElderly\n\nAs limited information is available on the use of REZOLSTA in patients aged 65 and over, caution \nshould be exercised, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic function and of concomitant \ndisease or other therapy (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nSevere skin reactions\n\nDuring the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N = 3,063), severe skin reactions, which \nmay be accompanied with fever and/or elevations of transaminases, have been reported in 0.4% of \npatients. DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome has been rarely (< 0.1%) reported, and during post-marketing experience toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis and acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. REZOLSTA should be \ndiscontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include,\nbut are not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied with fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or\njoint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia.\n\nRash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing \ndarunavir/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to patients receiving darunavir/ritonavir without raltegravir \nor raltegravir without darunavir/ritonavir (see section 4.8).\n\nSulphonamide allergy\n\nDarunavir contains a sulphonamide moiety. REZOLSTA should be used with caution in patients with \na known sulphonamide allergy.\n\nHepatotoxicity\n\nDrug-induced hepatitis (e.g. acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with \ndarunavir/ritonavir. During the clinical development program (N = 3,063), hepatitis was reported in \n0.5% of patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy with darunavir/ritonavir. Patients with \npre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for \nliver function abnormalities including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of \nconcomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for \nthese medicinal products.\n\nAppropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with REZOLSTA and \npatients should be monitored during treatment. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered \nin patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment \nelevations of transaminases, especially during the first several months of REZOLSTA treatment.\n\nIf there is evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of \nliver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver \ntenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients using REZOLSTA, interruption or discontinuation of treatment \nshould be considered promptly.\n\n\n\n6\n\nPatients with coexisting conditions\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe safety and efficacy of REZOLSTA, darunavir, or cobicistat have not been established in patients \nwith severe underlying liver disorders. REZOLSTA is, therefore, contraindicated in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment. Due to an increase in the unbound darunavir plasma concentrations, \nREZOLSTA should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nCobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular \nsecretion of creatinine. This effect on serum creatinine, leading to a decrease in the estimated \ncreatinine clearance, should be taken into consideration when REZOLSTA is administered to patients,\nin whom the estimated creatinine clearance is used to guide aspects of their clinical management, \nincluding adjusting doses of co-administered medicinal products. For more information consult the \ncobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.\n\nREZOLSTA should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min when \nco-administered with one or more agent requiring dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance (e.g. \nemtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate, phosphate or succinate) or adefovir\ndipivoxil) (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2).\n\nNo special precautions or dose adjustments are required in patients with renal impairment. As \ndarunavir and cobicistat are highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that they will be \nsignificantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nThere are currently inadequate data to determine whether co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and \ncobicistat is associated with a greater risk of renal adverse reactions compared with regimens that \ninclude tenofovir disoproxil without cobicistat.\n\nHaemophiliac patients\nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthrosis in patients with haemophilia type A and B treated with HIV PIs. In some patients \nadditional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with HIV PIs was \ncontinued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship has been \nsuggested, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should,\ntherefore, be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters\n\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.\n\nOsteonecrosis\n\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\n\n\n7\n\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)\n\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant \nexamples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and \npneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any\ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. In addition, \nreactivation of herpes simplex and herpes zoster has been observed in clinical trials with darunavir \nco-administered with low dose ritonavir.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and\nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).\n\nInteractions with medicinal products\n\nLife-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein (see section 4.5).\n\nREZOLSTA should not be used in combination with another antiretroviral that requires \npharmacoenhancement since dosing recommendations for such combination have not been \nestablished. REZOLSTA should not be used concurrently with products containing ritonavir or \nregimens containing ritonavir or cobicistat.\n\nUnlike ritonavir, cobicistat is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or \nUGT1A1. If switching from ritonavir as a pharmacoenhancer to cobicistat, caution is required during \nthe first two weeks of treatment with REZOLSTA, particularly if doses of any concomitantly \nadministered medicinal products have been titrated or adjusted during use of ritonavir as a \npharmacoenhancer.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nREZOLSTA is not recommended for use in paediatric patients (3 to 11 years of age). REZOLSTA \nshould not be used in paediatric patients below 3 years of age (see sections 4.2 and 5.3).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nAs REZOLSTA contains darunavir and cobicistat, interactions that have been identified with \ndarunavir (in combination with cobicistat or with low dose ritonavir) or with cobicistat determine the \ninteractions that may occur with REZOLSTA. Interaction trials with darunavir/cobicistat, \ndarunavir/ritonavir and with cobicistat have only been performed in adults.\n\nMedicinal products that may be affected by darunavir/cobicistat\n\nDarunavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A, a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 and an inhibitor of P-gp. Cobicistat \nis a mechanism based inhibitor of CYP3A, and a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor. Cobicistat inhibits the \ntransporters p-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Co-administration of \ncobicistat with medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters can result in increased \nplasma concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products. Cobicistat is not expected to inhibit \nCYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. Cobicistat is not expected to induce CYP1A2, \nCYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, UGT1A1, or P-gp (MDR1). Co-administration of darunavir/cobicistat\nand medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased systemic exposure to \nsuch medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse \nreactions.\n\n\n\n8\n\nREZOLSTA must therefore not be combined with medicinal products that are highly dependent on \nCYP3A for clearance and for which increased systemic exposure is associated with serious and/or \nlife-threatening events (narrow therapeutic index) (see section 4.3).\n\nMedicinal products that affect darunavir/cobicistat exposure\n\nDarunavir and cobicistat are metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity \nwould be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and cobicistat, resulting in lowered plasma \nconcentrations of darunavir and cobicistat (e.g. efavirenz, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital,\nrifampicin, rifapentine, rifabutin, St John’s wort) (see section 4.3 and interaction table below).\n\nCo-administration of REZOLSTA and other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the \nclearance of darunavir and cobicistat and may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir \nand cobicistat (e.g. azole antifungals such as clotrimazole). These interactions are described in the \ninteraction table below.\n\nREZOLSTA should not be used concurrently with products or regimens containing ritonavir or \ncobicistat. REZOLSTA should not be used in combination with the individual components of \nREZOLSTA (darunavir or cobicistat). REZOLSTA should not be used in combination with another \nantiretroviral that requires pharmacoenhancement since dosing recommendations for such \ncombination have not been established.\n\nInteraction table\n\nExpected interactions between REZOLSTA and antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts are listed in the table below and are based on the identified interactions with \ndarunavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat and with cobicistat.\n\nThe interaction profile of darunavir depends on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as \npharmacokinetic enhancer, therefore there may be different recommendations for the use of darunavir \nwith concomitant medicine. In the table below it is specified when recommendations for REZOLSTA \ndiffer from those for darunavir boosted with low dose ritonavir. Refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for PREZISTA for further information.\n\nThe below list of examples of drug drug interactions is not comprehensive and therefore the label of \neach drug that is co-administered with REZOLSTA should be consulted for information related to the \nroute of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with \nregards to co-administration.\n\nINTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS\nMedicinal products by \ntherapeutic areas\n\nInteraction Recommendations concerning \nco-administration\n\nHIV ANTIRETROVIRALS\nIntegrase strand transfer inhibitors\n\nDolutegravir Based on theoretical \nconsiderations dolutegravir is not \nexpected to affect the \npharmacokinetics of REZOLSTA.\n\nREZOLSTA and dolutegravir \ncan be used without dose \nadjustments.\n\nRaltegravir Some clinical trials suggest \nraltegravir may cause a modest \ndecrease in darunavir plasma \nconcentrations.\n\nAt present the effect of \nraltegravir on darunavir plasma \nconcentrations does not appear \nto be clinically relevant;\nREZOLSTA and raltegravir can \nbe used without dose \nadjustments.\n\n\n\n9\n\nHIV Nucleo(s/t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)\nDidanosine\n400 mg once daily\n\nNo mechanistic interaction \nexpected based on theoretical \nconsideration.\n\nREZOLSTA and didanosine can \nbe used without dose \nadjustments.\nWhen didanosine is \nco-administered with \nREZOLSTA, didanosine should \nbe administered on an empty \nstomach 1 hour before or 2 hours \nafter REZOLSTA (which is \nadministered with food).\n\nTenofovir disoproxil *\n\n*study was done with tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate\n\nBased on theoretical \nconsiderations REZOLSTA is \nexpected to increase tenofovir \nplasma concentrations.\n(P-glycoprotein inhibition)\n\nREZOLSTA and tenofovir \ndisoproxil can be used without \ndose adjustments.\nMonitoring of renal function \nmay be indicated when \nREZOLSTA is given in \ncombination with tenofovir \ndisoproxil, particularly in \npatients with underlying \nsystemic or renal disease, or in \npatients taking nephrotoxic \nagents.\n\nEmtricitabine/tenofovir \nalafenamide\n\nTenofovir alafenamide ↔\nTenofovir ↑\n\nThe recommended dose of \nemtricitabine/tenofovir \nalafenamide is 200/10 mg once \ndaily when used with \nREZOLSTA. \n\nAbacavir\nEmtricitabine\nLamivudine\nStavudine\nZidovudine\n\nBased on the different elimination \npathways of the other NRTIs (i.e. \nemtricitabine, lamivudine, \nstavudine and zidovudine) that are \nprimarily renally excreted, and \nabacavir for which metabolism is \nnot mediated by CYP, no \ninteractions are expected for these \nmedicinal compounds and \nREZOLSTA.\n\nREZOLSTA can be used with \nthese NRTIs without dose \nadjustment.\n\nHIV Non-nucleo(s/t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)\nEfavirenz Based on theoretical \n\nconsiderations efavirenz is \nexpected to decrease darunavir \nand/or cobicistat plasma \nconcentrations.\n(CYP3A induction)\n\nCo-administration of \nREZOLSTA and efavirenz is not \nrecommended.\n\nThis recommendation is \ndifferent from ritonavir-boosted \ndarunavir.

Monitor for \nfesoterodine or solifenacin \nadverse reactions, dose reduction \nof fesoterodine or solifenacin\nmay be necessary.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no adequate and well controlled trials with darunavir, or cobicistat, in pregnant women.\nStudies in animals do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).\n\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg during pregnancy results in low darunavir exposure \n(see section 5.2), which may be associated with an increased risk of treatment failure and an increased \nrisk of HIV transmission to the child. Therapy with REZOLSTA should not be initiated during \npregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with REZOLSTA should be switched to \nan alternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n\n\n20\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether darunavir or cobicistat are excreted in human milk. Studies in rats have \ndemonstrated that darunavir is excreted in milk and at high levels (1,000 mg/kg/day) resulted in \ntoxicity. Studies in animals have demonstrated that cobicistat is excreted in milk. Because of both the \npotential for HIV transmission and the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, mothers \nshould be instructed not to breast-feed under any circumstances if they are receiving REZOLSTA.\n\nFertility\n\nNo human data on the effect of darunavir or cobicistat on fertility are available. There was no effect on \nmating or fertility in animals (see section 5.3). Based on animal studies, no effect on mating or fertility \nis expected with REZOLSTA.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nREZOLSTA may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness has been \nreported in some patients during treatment with regimens containing darunavir administered with \ncobicistat and should be borne in mind when considering a patient’s ability to drive or operate \nmachinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe overall safety profile of REZOLSTA is based on available clinical trial data from darunavir \nboosted with either cobicistat or ritonavir, from cobicistat and from post-marketing data from \ndarunavir/ritonavir.\n\nAs REZOLSTA contains darunavir and cobicistat, the adverse reactions associated with each of the \nindividual compounds may be expected.\n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions reported in the pooled data of the Phase III study GS-US-216-130 \nand the REZOLSTA arm of Phase III study TMC114FD2HTX3001 were diarrhoea (23%), nausea\n(17%), rash (13%), and headache (10%). Serious adverse reactions were diabetes mellitus, (drug) \nhypersensitivity, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome,\nand vomiting. All of these serious ADRs occurred in one (0.1%) subject except for rash in 4 (0.6%) \nsubjects.\n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions reported during the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development \nprogram and as spontaneous reports are diarrhoea, nausea, rash, headache, and vomiting. The most \nfrequent serious reactions are acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, immune reconstitution \ninflammatory syndrome, thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, diarrhoea, hepatitis, and pyrexia.\n\nIn the 96 week analysis, the safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily in \ntreatment-naïve subjects was similar to that seen with darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily in \ntreatment-experienced subjects except for nausea which was observed more frequently in \ntreatment-naïve subjects. This was driven by mild intensity nausea. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency category. Within each \nfrequency category, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequency \ncategories are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and not known (frequency cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data).\n\n\n\n21\n\nAdverse reactions with darunavir/cobicistat in adult patients\n\nMedDRA system organ class\nFrequency category\n\nAdverse reaction\n\nImmune system disorders\nCommon (drug) hypersensitivity\n\nUncommon immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nCommon anorexia, hypercholesterolaemia, \n\nhypertriglyceridaemia\n\nUncommon diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, \nhyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nCommon abnormal dreams\nNervous system disorders\nVery common headache\nGastrointestinal disorders\nVery common diarrhoea, nausea\n\nCommon vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, \ndyspepsia, flatulence\n\nUncommon pancreatitis acute, pancreatic enzymes increased\nHepatobiliary disorders\nCommon hepatic enzyme increased\n\nUncommon hepatitis*, cytolytic hepatitis*\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nVery common rash (including macular, maculopapular, \n\npapular, erythematous, pruritic rash, generalised \nrash, and allergic dermatitis)\n\nCommon pruritus\n\nUncommon Stevens-Johnson syndrome#, angioedema,\nurticaria\n\nRare drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \nsymptoms*\n\nNot known toxic epidermal necrolysis*, acute generalised \nexanthematous pustulosis*\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nCommon myalgia\n\nUncommon osteonecrosis*\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nUncommon gynaecomastia*\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon fatigue, asthenia\nInvestigations\nCommon increased blood creatinine\n\n\n\n22\n\n* These adverse drug reactions have not been reported in clinical trial experience with darunavir/cobicistat but have\nbeen noted with darunavir/ritonavir treatment and could be expected with darunavir/cobicistat too.\n\n#\nWhen also taking into account the clinical trial data of DRV/COBI/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, Stevens-\nJohnson syndrome occurred rarely (in 1 out of 2,551 subjects) consistent with the DRV/rtv clinical trial program (see \nSevere skin reactions in section 4.4).\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nRash\nIn clinical trials with darunavir/ritonavir and darunavir/cobicistat, rash was mostly mild to moderate, \noften occurring within the first four weeks of treatment and resolving with continued dosing (see \nsection 4.4). The pooled data of a single-arm trial investigating darunavir 800 mg once daily in \ncombination with cobicistat 150 mg once daily and other antiretrovirals and one arm of a trial in which\nREZOLSTA 800/150 mg once daily and other antiretrovirals were administered, showed that 1.9% of \npatients discontinued treatment due to rash.\n\nMetabolic parameters\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nMusculoskeletal abnormalities\nIncreased CPK, myalgia, myositis and, rarely, rhabdomyolysis have been reported with the use of HIV \nprotease inhibitors, particularly in combination with NRTIs.\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination\nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nBleeding in haemophiliac patients\nThere have been reports of increased spontaneous bleeding in haemophiliac patients receiving \nantiretroviral protease inhibitors (see section 4.4).\n\nDecrease estimated creatinine clearance\nCobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of renal tubular\nsecretion of creatinine. An increase in serum creatinine due to the inhibitory effect of cobicistat \ngenerally does not exceed 0.4 mg/dL.\n\nThe effect of cobicistat on serum creatinine was investigated in a Phase I trial in subjects with normal \nrenal function (eGFR ≥ 80 mL/min, n = 12) and mild to moderate renal impairment \n(eGFR:50-79 mL/min, n = 18). Change of estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated by \nCockcroft-Gault method (eGFRCG) from baseline was observed within 7 days after start of treatment \nwith cobicistat 150 mg among subjects with normal renal function (-9.9 ± 13.1 mL/min) and mild to \nmoderate renal impairment (-11.9 ± 7.0 mL/min). These decreases in eGFRCG were reversible after\ncobicistat was discontinued and did not affect the actual glomerular filtration rate, as determined by \nthe clearance of probe drug iohexol.\n\nIn the Phase III single-arm trial (GS-US-216-130), a decrease in eGFRCG was noted at week 2, which \nremained stable through week 48. The mean eGFRCG change from baseline was –9.6 mL/min at \nweek 2, and –9.6 mL/min at week 48. In the REZOLSTA arm of Phase III trial\nTMC114FD2HTX3001, mean eGFRCG change from baseline was -11.1 mL/min at week 48 and mean \neGFRcystatin C change from baseline was +2.9 mL/min/1.73 m² at week 48.\n\n\n\n23\n\nFor more information consult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety of components of REZOLSTA was evaluated in adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years,\nweighing at least 40 kg through the clinical trial GS-US-216-0128 (treatment-experienced, \nvirologically suppressed, N = 7). Safety analyses of this study in adolescent subjects did not identify\nnew safety concerns compared to the known safety profile of darunavir and cobicistat in adult \nsubjects.\n\nOther special populations\n\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus\nLimited information is available on the use of REZOLSTA in patients co-infected with hepatitis B \nand/or C virus. Among 1,968 treatment-experienced patients receiving darunavir co-administered with \nritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily, 236 patients were co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Co-infected \npatients were more likely to have baseline and treatment emergent hepatic transaminase elevations \nthan those without chronic viral hepatitis (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nHuman experience of acute overdose with REZOLSTA or darunavir in combination with cobicistat is \nlimited. Single doses up to 3,200 mg of darunavir as oral solution alone and up to 1,600 mg of the \ntablet formulation of darunavir in combination with ritonavir have been administered to healthy \nvolunteers without untoward symptomatic effects.\n\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with REZOLSTA. Treatment of overdose with REZOLSTA\nconsists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient. Since darunavir and cobicistat are highly protein bound, dialysis is \nunlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the active substances.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infection,\ncombinations ATC code: J05AR14\n\nMechanism of action\n\nDarunavir is an inhibitor of the dimerisation and of the catalytic activity of the HIV-1 protease \n(KD of 4.5 x 10\n\n-12M). It selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded Gag-Pol polyproteins in virus \ninfected cells, thereby preventing the formation of mature infectious virus particles.\n\nCobicistat is a mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochromes P450 of the CYP3A subfamily. Inhibition \nof CYP3A-mediated metabolism by cobicistat enhances the systemic exposure of CYP3A substrates, \nsuch as darunavir, where bioavailability is limited and half-life is shortened due to CYP3A-dependent \nmetabolism.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n24\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\n\nDarunavir exhibits activity against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 and laboratory \nstrains of HIV-2 in acutely infected T-cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and \nhuman monocytes/macrophages with median EC50 values ranging from 1.2 to 8.5 nM (0.7 to\n5.0 ng/mL). Darunavir demonstrates antiviral activity in vitro against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M \n(A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and group O primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from < 0.1 to 4.3 nM.\nThese EC50 values are well below the 50% cellular toxicity concentration range of 87 µM to\n> 100 µM.\n\nCobicistat has no detectable antiviral activity against HIV-1 and does not antagonise the antiviral \neffect of darunavir.\n\nResistance\n\nIn vitro selection of darunavir-resistant virus from wild type HIV-1 was lengthy (> 3 years). The \nselected viruses were unable to grow in the presence of darunavir concentrations above 400 nM. \nViruses selected in these conditions and showing decreased susceptibility to darunavir (range: \n23-50-fold) harboured 2 to 4 amino acid substitutions in the protease gene. The decreased \nsusceptibility to darunavir of the emerging viruses in the selection experiment could not be explained \nby the emergence of these protease mutations.\n\nThe resistance profile of REZOLSTA is driven by darunavir. Cobicistat does not select any HIV\nresistance mutations, due to its lack of antiviral activity. The resistance profile of REZOLSTA is \nsupported by two Phase III trials conducted with darunavir/ritonavir in treatment-naïve (ARTEMIS) \nand treatment-experienced (ODIN) patients and the analysis of 48 week data from trial\nGS-US-216-130 in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients.\n\nLow rates of developing resistant HIV-1 virus were observed in ART-naïve patients who are treated \nfor the first time with REZOLSTA or darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily in combination with \nother ART, and in ART-experienced patients with no darunavir RAMs receiving REZOLSTA or \ndarunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily in combination with other ART. The table below shows the \ndevelopment of HIV-1 protease mutations and loss of susceptibility to HIV PIs in virologic failures at \nendpoint in the GS-US-216-130, ARTEMIS and ODIN trials.\n\nGS-US-216-130\na\n\nARTEMIS\nb\n\nODIN\nb\n\nTreatment-naïve\ndarunavir/cobicistat \n\n800/150 mg\nonce daily\n\nN = 295\n\nTreatment-experienced\ndarunavir/cobicistat \n\n800/150 mg\nonce daily\n\nN = 18\n\nTreatment-naïve\ndarunavir/ritonavir\n\n800/100 mg\nonce daily\n\nN = 343\n\nTreatment-experienced\ndarunavir/ritonavir\n\n800/100 mg\nonce daily\n\nN = 294\n\nTreatment-experienced\ndarunavir/ritonavir\n\n600/100 mg\ntwice daily\n\nN = 296\n\nNumber of subjects with virologic failure and genotype data that develop mutations\nc\n\nat endpoint, n/N\n\nPrimary\n(major) PI \nmutations\n\n0/8 1/7 0/43 1/60 0/42\n\nPI RAMs 2/8 1/7 4/43 7/60 4/42\n\nNumber of subjects with virologic failure and phenotype data that show a loss of susceptibility to PIs at endpoint compared to baseline\nd\n, n/N\n\nHIV PI\ndarunavir 0/8 0/7 0/39 1/58 0/41\namprenavir 0/8 0/7 0/39 1/58 0/40\natazanavir 0/8 0/7 0/39 2/56 0/40\nindinavir 0/8 0/7 0/39 2/57 0/40\nlopinavir 0/8 0/7 0/39 1/58 0/40\nsaquinavir 0/8 0/7 0/39 0/56 0/40\ntipranavir 0/8 0/7 0/39 0/58 0/41\n\n\n\n25\n\na\nVirologic failures selected for resistance testing were defined as: never suppressed: HIV-1 RNA < 1 log10 reduction from baseline and ≥ 50 copies/mL at week 8, \nconfirmed at the following visit; rebound: HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL followed by confirmed HIV-1 RNA to ≥ 400 copies/mL or confirmed > 1 log10\nHIV-1 RNA increase from the nadir; discontinuations with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL at last visit\n\nb\nVirologic failures based on TLOVR non-VF censored algorithm (HIV-1 RNA > 50 copies/mL)\n\nc\nIAS-USA lists\n\nd\nIn GS-US-216-130 baseline phenotype was not available\n\nCross-resistance\n\nIn the virologic failures of the GS-US-216-130 trial no cross-resistance with other HIV PIs was \nobserved. Refer to the table above for information on ARTEMIS and ODIN.\n\nClinical results\n\nThe antiretroviral effect of REZOLSTA is due to the darunavir component. The activity of cobicistat \nas a pharmacokinetic enhancer to darunavir has been demonstrated in pharmacokinetic trials. In these \npharmacokinetic trials, the exposure of darunavir 800 mg boosted with cobicistat 150 mg was \nconsistent with that observed when boosted with ritonavir 100 mg. Darunavir as a component of \nREZOLSTA is bioequivalent to darunavir 800 mg once daily in combination with cobicistat 150 mg \nonce daily co-administered as single medicinal products (see section 5.2).\n\nThe evidence of efficacy of REZOLSTA once daily is based on the analysis of 48 week data from trial\nGS-US-216-130 in ART-naïve and ART-experienced patients, trial TMC114FD2HTX3001 in \nART-naïve patients, and two Phase III trials ARTEMIS and ODIN conducted with darunavir/ritonavir \n800/100 mg q.d. in ART-naïve and ART-experienced patients, respectively.\n\nDescription of clinical studies of REZOLSTA in adults\n\nEfficacy of darunavir 800 mg once daily co-administered with 150 mg cobicistat once daily in \nART-naïve and ART-experienced patients\nGS-US-216-130 is a single-arm, open-label, Phase III trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety, \ntolerability, and efficacy of darunavir with cobicistat in 313 HIV-1 infected adult patients \n(295 treatment-naïve and 18 treatment-experienced). These patients received darunavir 800 mg once \ndaily in combination with cobicistat 150 mg once daily with an investigator selected optimised \nbackground regimen (OBR) consisting of 2 active NRTIs.\n\nHIV-1 infected patients who were eligible for this trial had a screening genotype showing no darunavir \nRAMs and plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 1,000 copies/mL.

For additional supportive information, refer to the \nSummary of Product Characteristics of darunavir and cobicistat.\n\nIn the open-label, Phase II/III trial GS-US-216-0128, the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of \ndarunavir 800 mg and cobicistat 150 mg (administered as separate tablets) and at least 2 NRTIs were \nevaluated in 7 HIV-1 infected, treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed adolescents (see \nsection 5.2). Patients were on a stable antiretroviral regimen (for at least 3 months), consisting of \ndarunavir adminstered with ritonavir, combined with 2 NRTIs. They were switched from ritonavir to \ncobicistat 150 mg once daily and continued darunavir (N = 7) and 2 NRTIs.\n\nVirologic outcome in ART-experienced, virologically suppressed adolescents at week 48\nGS-US-216-0128\n\nOutcomes at week 48 Darunavir/cobicistat + at least 2 NRTIs\n(N = 7)\n\nHIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL per FDA Snapshot\nApproach\n\n85.7% (6)\n\nCD4+ percent median change from baseline -6.1%\nCD4+ cell count median change from baseline -342 cells/mm³\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nREZOLSTA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the condition of treatment of HIV-1 \ninfection.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nDarunavir exposure was shown to be comparable in a bioavailability trial between REZOLSTA and\ndarunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg q.d. at steady-state and fed conditions in healthy subjects.\nThe bioequivalence between REZOLSTA and darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg co-administered as\nsingle agents was established under fed and fasted conditions in healthy subjects.\n\nAbsorption\n\nDarunavir\nThe absolute oral bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of darunavir alone is approximately 37%.\n\nDarunavir was rapidly absorbed following oral administration of REZOLSTA in healthy volunteers. \nMaximum plasma concentration of darunavir in the presence of cobicistat is generally achieved within \n3 to 4.5 hours. Following oral administration of REZOLSTA in healthy volunteers, maximum plasma \nconcentrations of cobicistat were observed 2 to 5 hours post-dose.\n\nWhen administered with food, the relative exposure of darunavir is 1.7-fold higher as compared to \nintake without food. Therefore, REZOLSTA tablets should be taken with food. The type of food does\nnot affect exposure to REZOLSTA.\n\n\n\n29\n\nDistribution\n\nDarunavir\nDarunavir is approximately 95% bound to plasma protein. Darunavir binds primarily to plasma α1-acid \nglycoprotein.\nFollowing intravenous administration, the volume of distribution of darunavir alone was 88.1 ± 59.0 L\n(Mean ± SD) and increased to 131 ± 49.9 L (Mean ± SD) in the presence of 100 mg twice-daily \nritonavir.\n\nCobicistat\nCobicistat is 97 to 98% bound to human plasma proteins and the mean plasma to blood-drug \nconcentration ratio was approximately 2.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nDarunavir\nIn vitro experiments with human liver microsomes (HLMs) indicate that darunavir primarily \nundergoes oxidative metabolism. Darunavir is extensively metabolised by the hepatic CYP system and \nalmost exclusively by isozyme CYP3A4. A 14C-darunavir trial in healthy volunteers showed that a \nmajority of the radioactivity in plasma after a single 400/100 mg darunavir with ritonavir dose was due \nto the parent active substance. At least 3 oxidative metabolites of darunavir have been identified in \nhumans; all showed activity that was at least 10-fold less than the activity of darunavir against wild \ntype HIV.\n\nCobicistat\nCobicistat is metabolised via CYP3A (major)- and CYP2D6 (minor)-mediated oxidation and does not \nundergo glucuronidation. Following oral administration of 14C-cobicistat, 99% of circulating \nradioactivity in plasma was unchanged cobicistat. Low levels of metabolites are observed in urine and \nfeces and do not contribute to the CYP3A inhibitory activity of cobicistat.\n\nElimination\n\nDarunavir\nAfter a 400/100 mg 14C-darunavir with ritonavir dose, approximately 79.5% and 13.9% of the \nadministered dose of 14C-darunavir could be retrieved in faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged \ndarunavir accounted for approximately 41.2% and 7.7% of the administered dose in faeces and urine, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of darunavir was approximately 15 hours when \ncombined with ritonavir.\nThe intravenous clearance of darunavir alone (150 mg) and in the presence of low dose ritonavir was \n32.8 L/h and 5.9 L/h, respectively.\n\nCobicistat\nFollowing oral administration of 14C-cobicistat, 86% and 8.2% of the dose were recovered in feces and \nurine, respectively. The median terminal plasma half-life of cobicistat following administration of \nREZOLSTA is approximately 3-4 hours.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\nAvailable pharmacokinetic data for the different components of REZOLSTA indicate there were no \nclinically relevant differences in exposure between adults and adolescents. In addition, the \npharmacokinetics of darunavir 800 mg co-administered with cobicistat 150 mg in paediatric patients \nhave been studied in 7 adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years, weighing at least 40 kg who received \ndarunavir 800 mg co-administered with cobicistat 150 mg in Study GS-US-216-0128. The geometric \nmean adolescent exposure (AUCtau) was similar for darunavir and increased 19% for cobicistat\ncompared to exposures achieved in adults who received darunavir 800 mg co-administered with \n\n\n\n30\n\ncobicistat 150 mg in Study GS-US-216-0130.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV \ninfected patients showed that darunavir pharmacokinetics are not considerably different in the age \nrange (18 to 75 years) evaluated in HIV infected patients (n = 12, age  65 years) (see section 4.4). \nHowever, only limited data were available in patients above the age of 65 years.\n\nCobicistat\nPharmacokinetics of cobicistat have not been fully evaluated in older people (65 years of age and\nolder).\n\nGender\nDarunavir\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed a slightly higher darunavir exposure (16.8%) in HIV \ninfected females compared to males. This difference is not clinically relevant.\n\nCobicistat\nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender have been identified for cobicistat.\n\nRenal impairment\nREZOLSTA has not been investigated in patients with renal impairment.\n\nDarunavir\nResults from a mass balance study with 14C-darunavir with ritonavir showed that approximately 7.7% \nof the administered dose of darunavir is excreted in the urine unchanged.\n\nAlthough darunavir has not been studied in patients with renal impairment, population \npharmacokinetic analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of darunavir were not significantly\naffected in HIV infected patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl between 30-60 mL/min, \nn = 20) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n\n\n31\n\nCobicistat\nA trial of the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with \nsevere renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min). No meaningful \ndifferences in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with severe renal \nimpairment and healthy subjects, consistent with low renal clearance of cobicistat.\n\nHepatic impairment\nREZOLSTA has not been investigated in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\nDarunavir\nDarunavir is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. In a multiple dose trial with\ndarunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg) twice daily, it was demonstrated that the total plasma concentrations \nof darunavir in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, n = 8) and moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, \nn = 8) hepatic impairment were comparable with those in healthy subjects. However, unbound \ndarunavir concentrations were approximately 55% (Child-Pugh Class A) and 100% (Child-Pugh \nClass B) higher, respectively. The clinical relevance of this increase is unknown, therefore,\ndarunavir/ritonavir should be used with caution. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of darunavir has not been studied (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nCobicistat\nCobicistat is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. A trial of the pharmacokinetics of \ncobicistat was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class B). No clinically relevant differences in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed \nbetween subjects with moderate impairment and healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment of \nREZOLSTA is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat has not been studied.\n\nHepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection\nThere were insufficient pharmacokinetic data in the clinical trials to determine the effect of hepatitis B\nand/or C virus infection on the pharmacokinetics of darunavir and cobicistat (refer to sections 4.4 and\n4.8).\n\nPregnancy and postpartum\nTreatment with REZOLSTA during pregnancy results in low darunavir exposure. In women receiving \nREZOLSTA during the second trimester of pregnancy, mean intra-individual values for total\ndarunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin were 49%, 56% and 92% lower, respectively, as compared with \npostpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total darunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were \n37%, 50% and 89% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum. The unbound fraction was also \nsubstantially reduced, including around 90% reductions of Cmin levels. The main cause of these low \nexposures is a marked reduction in cobicistat exposure as a consequence of pregnancy-associated \nenzyme induction (see below).\n\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/cobicistat \n800/150 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, the third trimester of pregnancy, and postpartum\nPharmacokinetics of \ntotal darunavir\n(mean ± SD)\n\nSecond trimester \nof pregnancy\n\nN = 7\n\nThird trimester \nof pregnancy\n\nN = 6\n\nPostpartum \n(6-12 weeks)\n\nN = 6\nCmax, ng/mL 4,340 ± 1,616 4,910 ± 970 7,918 ± 2,199\nAUC24h, ng.h/mL 47,293 ± 19,058 47,991 ± 9,879 99,613 ± 34,862\nCmin, ng/mL 168 ± 149 184 ± 99 1,538 ± 1,344\n\nThe exposure to cobicistat was lower during pregnancy, potentially leading to suboptimal boosting of \ndarunavir. During the second trimester of pregnancy, cobicistat Cmax, AUC24h, and Cmin were 50%, \n63%, and 83% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum. During the third trimester of \n\n\n\n32\n\npregnancy, cobicistat Cmax, AUC24h, and Cmin, were 27%, 49%, and 83% lower, respectively, as \ncompared with postpartum.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nDarunavir\n\nAnimal toxicology studies have been conducted at exposures up to clinical exposure levels with \ndarunavir alone, in mice, rats and dogs and in combination with ritonavir in rats and dogs.\n\nIn repeated-dose toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs, there were only limited effects of treatment \nwith darunavir. In rodents the target organs identified were the haematopoietic system, the blood \ncoagulation system, liver and thyroid. A variable but limited decrease in red blood cell-related \nparameters was observed, together with increases in activated partial thromboplastin time.\n\nChanges were observed in liver (hepatocyte hypertrophy, vacuolation, increased liver enzymes) and \nthyroid (follicular hypertrophy). In the rat, the combination of darunavir with ritonavir lead to a small \nincrease in effect on RBC parameters, liver and thyroid and increased incidence of islet fibrosis in the \npancreas (in male rats only) compared to treatment with darunavir alone. In the dog, no major toxicity \nfindings or target organs were identified up to exposures equivalent to clinical exposure at the \nrecommended dose.\n\nIn a study conducted in rats, the number of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased in the \npresence of maternal toxicity. Otherwise, there were no effects on mating or fertility with darunavir \ntreatment up to 1,000 mg/kg/day and exposure levels below (AUC-0.5 fold) of that in human at the \nclinically recommended dose. Up to same dose levels, there was no teratogenicity with darunavir in \nrats and rabbits when treated alone nor in mice when treated in combination with ritonavir. The \nexposure levels were lower than those with the recommended clinical dose in humans. In a pre- and \npostnatal development assessment in rats, darunavir with and without ritonavir, caused a transient \nreduction in body weight gain of the offspring pre-weaning and there was a slight delay in the opening \nof eyes and ears. Darunavir in combination with ritonavir caused a reduction in the number of pups \nthat exhibited the startle response on day 15 of lactation and a reduced pup survival during lactation. \nThese effects may be secondary to pup exposure to the active substance via the milk and/or maternal \ntoxicity. No post weaning functions were affected with darunavir alone or in combination with \nritonavir. In juvenile rats receiving darunavir up to days 23-26, increased mortality was observed with \nconvulsions in some animals. Exposure in plasma, liver and brain was considerably higher than in \nadult rats after comparable doses in mg/kg between days 5 and 11 of age. After day 23 of life, the \nexposure was comparable to that in adult rats. The increased exposure was likely at least partly due to \nimmaturity of the drug-metabolising enzymes in juvenile animals. No treatment related mortalities \nwere noted in juvenile rats dosed at 1,000 mg/kg darunavir (single dose) on day 26 of age or at \n500 mg/kg (repeated dose) from day 23 to 50 of age, and the exposures and toxicity profile were\ncomparable to those observed in adult rats.\n\nDue to uncertainties regarding the rate of development of the human blood brain barrier and liver \nenzymes REZOLSTA should not be used in paediatric patients below 3 years of age.\n\nDarunavir was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats up \nto 104 weeks. Daily doses of 150, 450 and 1,000 mg/kg were administered to mice and doses of 50,\n150 and 500 mg/kg were administered to rats. Dose-related increases in the incidences of\nhepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were observed in males and females of both species. Thyroid \nfollicular cell adenomas were noted in male rats. Administration of darunavir did not cause a \nstatistically significant increase in the incidence of any other benign or malignant neoplasm in mice or \nrats. The observed hepatocellular and thyroid tumours in rodents are considered to be of limited \nrelevance to humans. Repeated administration of darunavir to rats caused hepatic microsomal enzyme\ninduction and increased thyroid hormone elimination, which predispose rats, but not humans, to \nthyroid neoplasms. At the highest tested doses, the systemic exposures (based on AUC) to darunavir \n\n\n\n33\n\nwhen co-administered with ritonavir were between 0.4- and 0.7-fold (mice) and 0.7- and 1-fold (rats), \nrelative to those observed in humans at the recommended therapeutic doses.\n\nAfter 2 years administration of darunavir at exposures at or below the human exposure, kidney \nchanges were observed in mice (nephrosis) and rats (chronic progressive nephropathy).\n\nDarunavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including \nbacterial reverse mutation (Ames), chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes and in vivo\nmicronucleus test in mice.\n\nCobicistat\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose\ntoxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development. No teratogenic effects were\nobserved in rats and rabbit developmental toxicity studies. In rats, ossification changes in the spinal\ncolumn and sternebrae of fetuses occurred at a dose that produced significant maternal toxicity.\n\nEx vivo rabbit studies and in vivo dog studies suggest that cobicistat has a low potential for QT\nprolongation, and may slightly prolong the PR interval and decrease left ventricular function at mean\nconcentrations at least 10-fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended 150 mg daily \ndose.\n\nA long term carcinogenicity study of cobicistat in rats revealed tumourigenic potential specific for this\nspecies, that is regarded as of no relevance for humans. A long term carcinogenicity study in mice did\nnot show any carcinogenic potential.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What REZOLSTA is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take REZOLSTA\n3. How to take REZOLSTA\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store REZOLSTA\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What REZOLSTA is and what it is used for\n\nWhat is REZOLSTA?\nREZOLSTA contains the active substances darunavir and cobicistat.\nDarunavir belongs to a group of HIV medicines called ‘protease inhibitors’ which work by reducing \nthe amount of HIV in your body to a very low level. It is given with cobicistat, which increases the \namount of darunavir in your blood. \nTreatment with REZOLSTA will improve your immune system (your body’s natural defences) and \nreduce the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection, but REZOLSTA is not a cure for HIV \ninfection.\n\nWhat it is used for?\nREZOLSTA is used to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older who weigh at least \n40 kilograms and who are infected by HIV (see How to take REZOLSTA).\n\nREZOLSTA must be taken in combination with other HIV medicines. Your doctor will discuss with \nyou which combination of medicines is best for you.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take REZOLSTA\n\nDo not take REZOLSTA\n- if you are allergic to darunavir, cobicistat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6).\n- if you have severe liver problems. Ask your doctor if you are unsure about the severity of your \n\nliver disease. Some additional tests might be necessary.\n\nDo not combine REZOLSTA with any of the following medicines\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor about switching to another medicine.\n\nMedicine Purpose of the medicine\nAlfuzosin to treat enlarged prostate\nAmiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine,\nquinidine, ranolazine\n\nto treat certain heart disorders e.g. abnormal \nheart beat\n\n\n\n45\n\nCarbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin to prevent seizures \nAstemizole or terfenadine to treat allergy symptoms \nColchicine (if you have kidney/liver problems) to treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever\nThe combination product lopinavir/ritonavir anti-HIV medicine\nRifampicin to treat some infections such as tuberculosis\nLurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine or sertindole to treat psychiatric conditions\nErgot alkaloids like ergotamine, \ndihydroergotamine, ergometrine and \nmethylergonovine\n\nto treat migraine headaches\n\nCisapride to treat some stomach conditions\nSt John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) a herbal product used for depression\nElbasvir/grazoprevir to treat hepatitis C infection\nLovastatin, simvastatin, and lomitapide to lower cholesterol levels\nTriazolam or oral (taken by mouth) midazolam to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety\nSildenafil to treat a heart and lung disorder called \n\npulmonary arterial hypertension. There are other \nuses for sildenafil. Please see section ‘Other \nmedicines and REZOLSTA’.\n\nAvanafil to treat erectile dysfunction\nDabigatran, ticagrelor to help stop the clumping of platelets in the \n\ntreatment of patients with a history of a heart \nattack\n\nNaloxegol to treat opioid induced constipation\nDapoxetine to treat premature ejaculation\nDomperidone to treat nausea and vomiting\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking REZOLSTA.\n\nYou can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople.\nPeople taking REZOLSTA may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV \ninfection. You must keep in regular contact with your doctor.\n\nPeople taking REZOLSTA may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or \npotentially life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.\n\nIn patients taking REZOLSTA and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) \nmay occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately.\n\nREZOLSTA has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this \nage group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use REZOLSTA.\n\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.\n- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C\n\ninfection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \ntake REZOLSTA.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your kidneys. Your doctor will carefully \nconsider whether to treat you with REZOLSTA.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. REZOLSTA might increase sugar levels in the blood.\n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged \n\nlymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of unusual \ninfections due to a weakened immune system (opportunistic infection), signs and symptoms of \ninflammation from previous infections may occur soon after HIV treatment is started. It is \n\n\n\n46\n\nbelieved that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, \nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.\n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs \nwhen the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking \nmedicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many \nmonths after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms \nsuch as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the \ntrunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately \nso you can be given the necessary treatment.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. REZOLSTA might increase the risk of bleeding.\n- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).\n- Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking \n\ncombination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of \nbone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). This may be more likely with long-term \nHIV treatment, more severe damage to the immune system, overweight, or the use of alcohol or \nother medicines called corticosteroids. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains \n(especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these \nsymptoms please inform your doctor.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nREZOLSTA is not for use in children younger than 12 years, or weighing less than \n40 kilograms.\n\nOther medicines and REZOLSTA\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.\n\nThere are some medicines that you must not combine with REZOLSTA. These are mentioned above \nunder the heading ‘Do not combine REZOLSTA with any of the following medicines:’\n\nREZOLSTA must not be used with another antiviral medicine that contains a booster or another \nantiviral that requires boosting. In some cases dosage of other medicines might need to be changed. \nTherefore, always tell your doctor if you take other anti-HIV medicines and follow your doctor’s \ninstruction carefully on which medicines can be combined.\n\nThe effects of REZOLSTA might be reduced if you take any of the following products. Tell your \ndoctor if you take:\n- Bosentan (to treat heart disease)\n- Dexamethasone (injectable) (corticosteroid)\n- Efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine (to treat HIV infection)\n- Rifapentine, rifabutin (to treat bacterial infections).\n\nThe effects of other medicines might be influenced if you take REZOLSTA. Tell your doctor if you \ntake:\n- Amlodipine, carvedilol, diltiazem, disopyramide, felodipine, flecainide, lidocaine, metoprolol, \n\nmexiletine, nicardipine, nifedipine, propafenone, timolol, verapamil (for heart disease) as the \ntherapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines may be increased.\n\n- Apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, warfarin (to reduce clotting of the blood) as their therapeutic \neffect or side effects may be altered; your doctor may have to check your blood.\n\n- Clonazepam (to prevent seizures).\n- Oestrogen-based hormonal contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy. REZOLSTA\n\nmight reduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, alternative methods of \nnon-hormonal contraception are recommended.\n\n- Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. REZOLSTA might increase the risk for elevated potassium \nlevels by drospirenone.\n\n- Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). \nThe risk of muscle damage might be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol \nlowering regimen is best for your specific situation.\n\n\n\n47\n\n- Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as \nthe therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased. Your doctor might \nwant to do some additional tests.\n\n- Corticosteroids including betamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, \ntriamcinolone. These medicines are used to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel \ndiseases, inflammatory conditions of the eyes, joints and muscles and other inflammatory \nconditions. If alternatives cannot be used, its use should only take place after medical evaluation \nand under close monitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid side effects.\n\n- Buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone (medicines to treat opioid dependence)\n- Salmeterol (medicine to treat asthma)\n- Artemether/lumefantrine (a combination medicine to treat malaria)\n- Dasatinib, irinotecan, nilotinib, vinblastine, vincristine (medicines to treat cancer)\n- Perphenazine, risperidone, thioridazine (psychiatric medicines)\n- Clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam (medicines to treat sleeping disorders or anxiety)\n- Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction or to treat a heart and lung disorder \n\ncalled pulmonary arterial hypertension)\n- Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (to treat hepatitis C infection)\n- Fesoterodine, solifenacin (to treat urologic disorders).\n\nThe dosage of other medicines might need to be changed since either their own or REZOLSTA’s \ntherapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined.\nTell your doctor if you take:\n- Alfentanil (injectable, strong and short-acting, painkiller that is used for surgical procedures)\n- Digoxin (to treat certain heart disorders)\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)\n- Clotrimazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, isavuconazole, posaconazole (against fungal \n\ninfections). Voriconazole should only be taken after medical evaluation.\n- Rifabutin (against bacterial infections)\n- Tadalafil, sildenafil, vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction or high blood pressure in the \n\npulmonary circulation)\n- Amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone (to treat \n\ndepression and anxiety)\n- Maraviroc (to treat HIV infection)\n- Colchicine (to treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever). If you have renal and/or hepatic \n\nimpairment see section ‘Do not combine REZOLSTA with any of the following medicines’.\n- Bosentan (to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation)\n- Buspirone, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, zolpidem, midazolam when used as \n\ninjection (medicines to treat trouble with sleeping and/or anxiety)\n- Metformin (to treat type 2 diabetes)\n- Fentanyl, oxycodone, tramadol (to treat pain).\n\nThis is not a complete list of medicines. Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines that you are\ntaking.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or if you are \nbreast-feeding. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take REZOLSTA. It is recommended \nthat HIV infected women must not breast-feed their infants because of both the possibility of your \nbaby becoming infected with HIV through your breast milk and because of the unknown effects of the \nmedicine on your baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not operate machines or drive if you feel dizzy after taking REZOLSTA.\n\n\n\n48\n\n3. How to take REZOLSTA\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.\n\nYou must take REZOLSTA every day and always with food. REZOLSTA cannot work properly \nwithout food. You must eat a meal or a snack within 30 minutes prior to taking your REZOLSTA. The \ntype of food is not important.\n\n- Swallow the tablet whole with a drink such as water or milk. If you have difficulty swallowing \nREZOLSTA, tell your doctor. The tablet may be split using a tablet-cutter. After splitting the \ntablet, the entire dose (both halves) should then be taken right away with a drink such as water \nor milk.\n\n- Take your other HIV medicines used in combination with REZOLSTA as recommended by \nyour doctor.\n\nRemoving the child resistant cap\n\nThe plastic bottle comes with a child resistant cap and must be opened as follows:\n- Push the plastic screw cap down while turning it counter clockwise.\n- Remove the unscrewed cap.\n\nIf you take more REZOLSTA than you should\nContact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately.\n\nIf you forget to take REZOLSTA\nIf you notice within 12 hours, you must take the tablet immediately. Always take with food. If you \nnotice after 12 hours, then skip the intake and take the next doses as usual. Do not take a double dose\nto make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you vomit after taking REZOLSTA\nIf you vomit within 4 hours of taking the medicine, another dose of REZOLSTA should be taken with \nfood as soon as possible. If you vomit more than 4 hours after taking the medicine, then you do not \nneed to take another dose of REZOLSTA until the next regularly scheduled time.\n\nContact your doctor if you are uncertain about what to do if you miss a dose or vomit.\n\nDo not stop taking REZOLSTA without talking to your doctor first\nAfter therapy has started, it must not be stopped without instruction of the doctor.\n\nAnti-HIV medicines may make you feel better. Even when you feel better, do not stop taking \nREZOLSTA. Talk to your doctor first.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\n\n\n49\n\nTell your doctor if you develop any of the following side effects\nLiver problems that may occasionally be severe have been reported. Your doctor should do blood tests \nbefore you start REZOLSTA. If you have chronic hepatitis B or C infection, your doctor should check \nyour blood tests more often because you have an increased chance of developing liver problems. Talk \nto your doctor about the signs and symptoms of liver problems. These may include yellowing of your \nskin or whites of your eyes, dark (tea coloured) urine, pale coloured stools (bowel movements), \nnausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching, or pain and discomfort on your right side below \nyour ribs.\n\nA common side effect of REZOLSTA is skin rash (more often when used in combination with \nraltegravir), itching. The rash is usually mild to moderate. A skin rash might also be a symptom of a \nrare severe situation. It is, therefore, important to talk to your doctor if you develop a rash. Your \ndoctor will advise you how to deal with your symptoms or whether REZOLSTA must be stopped.\n\nOther severe side effects, seen up to 1 patient in 10, were diabetes. Inflammation of the pancreas\n(pancreatitis) has been reported in up to 1 patient in 100.\n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)\n- headache\n- diarrhoea, nausea.\n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n- allergic reactions such as itching\n- decreased appetite\n- abnormal dreams\n- vomiting, pain or swelling of the belly, indigestion, flatulence\n- muscle pain\n- tiredness\n- abnormal blood test results such as some tests for your liver or kidney. Your doctor will explain\n\nthese to you.\n- weakness.\n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)\n- symptoms of infection or of autoimmune disorders (immune reconstitution inflammatory \n\nsyndrome)\n- osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone)\n- enlargement of breasts\n- abnormal blood test results such as some tests for your pancreas, high level of sugar, abnormal \n\nlevels of ‘lipids’ (fats). Your doctor will explain these to you.\n- allergic reactions such as nettle rash (urticaria), severe swelling of the skin and other tissues \n\n(most often the lips or the eyes)\n- severe rash with blisters and peeling skin, particularly around the mouth, nose, eyes and \n\ngenitals.\n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)\n- a reaction called DRESS [severe rash, which may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, swelling of \n\nthe face or lymph glands, increase of eosinophils (type of white blood cells), effects on liver, \nkidney or lung].\n\nSide effects with unknown frequency: a rash may become severe or potentially life-threatening: \n- rash with blisters and peeling skin over much of the body\n- red rash covered with small pus-filled bumps that can spread over the body, sometimes with a \n\nfever.\n\nSome side effects are typical for HIV medicines in the same family as REZOLSTA. These are:\n- muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. On rare occasions, these muscle disorders have been \n\nserious.\n\n\n\n50\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.\n\n5.
