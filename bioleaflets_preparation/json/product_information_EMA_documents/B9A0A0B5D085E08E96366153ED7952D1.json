CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMVASI in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is indicated for treatment of adult \npatients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. \n \nMVASI in combination with paclitaxel is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with \nmetastatic breast cancer. For further information as to human epidermal growth factor receptor \n2 (HER2) status, please refer to section 5.1. \n \nMVASI, in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer other than \npredominantly squamous cell histology. \n \nMVASI in combination with interferon alfa-2a is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients \nwith advanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nMVASI, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is indicated for the front-line treatment of \nadult patients with advanced (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) \nstages IIIB, IIIC and IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (see section \n5.1). \n \nMVASI, in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or in combination with carboplatin and \npaclitaxel, is indicated for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive \nepithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy \nwith bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted agents. \n \nMVASI in combination with topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is indicated for the \ntreatment of adult patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or \nprimary peritoneal cancer who received no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens and who have \nnot received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted \nagents (see section 5.1). \n \nMVASI, in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, paclitaxel and topotecan in \npatients who cannot receive platinum therapy, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with \npersistent, recurrent, or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nMVASI must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of \nantineoplastic medicinal products. \n \nPosology \n \nMetastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum (mCRC) \n \nThe recommended dose of MVASI, administered as an intravenous infusion, is either 5 mg/kg or \n10 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks or 7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg of body weight given \nonce every 3 weeks. \n \nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \nunacceptable toxicity. \n \nMetastatic breast cancer (mBC) \n \nThe recommended dose of MVASI is 10 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg \nof body weight given once every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion. \n \nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \nunacceptable toxicity. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) \n \nFirst-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy \n \nMVASI is administered in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy for up to 6 cycles of treatment \nfollowed by MVASI as a single agent until disease progression. \n \nThe recommended dose of MVASI is 7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every \n3 weeks as an intravenous infusion. \n \nClinical benefit in NSCLC patients has been demonstrated with both 7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg doses \n(see section 5.1). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \nunacceptable toxicity. \n \nAdvanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) \n \nThe recommended dose of MVASI is 10 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks as an \nintravenous infusion. \n \nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \nunacceptable toxicity. \n \nEpithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer \n \nFront-line treatment: MVASI is administered in addition to carboplatin and paclitaxel for up to \n6 cycles of treatment followed by continued use of MVASI as single agent until disease progression or \nfor a maximum of 15 months or until unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs earlier. \n \nThe recommended dose of MVASI is 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 weeks as an \nintravenous infusion. \n \nTreatment of platinum-sensitive recurrent disease: MVASI is administered in combination with either \ncarboplatin and gemcitabine for 6 cycles and up to 10 cycles or in combination with carboplatin and \npaclitaxel for 6 cycles and up to 8 cycles, followed by continued use of MVASI as single agent until \ndisease progression. The recommended dose of MVASI is 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every \n3 weeks as an intravenous infusion. \n \nTreatment of platinum-resistant recurrent disease: MVASI is administered in combination with one of \nthe following agents - topotecan (given weekly) or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The \nrecommended dose of MVASI is 10 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks as an \nintravenous infusion. When MVASI is administered in combination with topotecan (given on days \n1-5, every 3 weeks), the recommended dose of MVASI is 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every \n3 weeks as an intravenous infusion. It is recommended that treatment be continued until disease \nprogression or unacceptable toxicity (see section 5.1, study MO22224). \n \nCervical cancer \n \nMVASI is administered in combination with one of the following chemotherapy regimens: paclitaxel \nand cisplatin or paclitaxel and topotecan. \n \nThe recommended dose of MVASI is 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 weeks as an \nintravenous infusion. \n \nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \nunacceptable toxicity (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients: No dose adjustment is required in the elderly. \n \nPatients with renal impairment: The safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with renal \nimpairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment: The safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with \nhepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in children less than 18 years old have not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nThere is no relevant use of bevacizumab in the paediatric population in the indications for treatment of \ncancers of the colon, rectum, breast, lung, ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneum, cervix and kidney. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nMVASI is for intravenous use. The initial dose should be delivered over 90 minutes as an intravenous \ninfusion. If the first infusion is well tolerated, the second infusion may be administered over \n60 minutes. If the 60-minute infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be administered \nover 30 minutes. \n \nIt should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. \n \nDose reduction for adverse reactions is not recommended. If indicated, therapy should either be \npermanently discontinued or temporarily suspended as described in section 4.4. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. MVASI \ninfusions should not be administered or mixed with glucose solutions. This medicinal product must \nnot be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n• Hypersensitivity to Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell products or other recombinant human or \n\nhumanised antibodies. \n• Pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. \n \nGastrointestinal (GI) perforations and Fistulae (see section 4.8) \n \nPatients may be at an increased risk for the development of gastrointestinal perforation and gall \nbladder perforation when treated with bevacizumab. Intra-abdominal inflammatory process may be a \nrisk factor for gastrointestinal perforations in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or \nrectum, therefore, caution should be exercised when treating these patients. Prior radiation is a risk \nfactor for GI perforation in patients treated for persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with \nMVASI and all patients with GI perforation had a history of prior radiation. Therapy should be \npermanently discontinued in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation. \n \nGI-vaginal Fistulae in study GOG-0240 \n \nPatients treated for persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer with bevacizumab are at \nincreased risk of fistulae between the vagina and any part of the GI tract (Gastrointestinal-vaginal \nfistulae). Prior radiation is a major risk factor for the development of GI-vaginal fistulae and all \npatients with GI-vaginal fistulae had a history of prior radiation. Recurrence of cancer within the field \nof prior radiation is an additional important risk factor for the development of GI-vaginal fistulae. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nNon-GI Fistulae (see section 4.8) \n \nPatients may be at increased risk for the development of fistulae when treated with bevacizumab. \nPermanently discontinue MVASI in patients with tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula or any grade 4 fistula \n[US National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE v.3)]. \nLimited information is available on the continued use of bevacizumab in patients with other fistulae. \nIn cases of internal fistula not arising in the gastrointestinal tract, discontinuation of MVASI should be \nconsidered. \n \nWound healing complications (see section 4.8) \n \nBevacizumab may adversely affect the wound healing process. Serious wound healing complications, \nincluding anastomotic complications, with a fatal outcome have been reported. Therapy should not be \ninitiated for at least 28 days following major surgery or until the surgical wound is fully healed. In \npatients who experienced wound healing complications during therapy, treatment should be withheld \nuntil the wound is fully healed. Therapy should be withheld for elective surgery. \n \nNecrotising fasciitis, including fatal cases, has rarely been reported in patients treated with \nbevacizumab. This condition is usually secondary to wound healing complications, gastrointestinal \nperforation or fistula formation. MVASI therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop \nnecrotising fasciitis, and appropriate treatment should be promptly initiated. \n \nHypertension (see section 4.8) \n \nAn increased incidence of hypertension was observed in bevacizumab-treated patients. Clinical safety \ndata suggest that the incidence of hypertension is likely to be dose-dependent. Pre-existing \nhypertension should be adequately controlled before starting MVASI treatment. There is no \ninformation on the effect of bevacizumab in patients with uncontrolled hypertension at the time of \ninitiating therapy. Monitoring of blood pressure is generally recommended during therapy. \n \nIn most cases hypertension was controlled adequately using standard antihypertensive treatment \nappropriate for the individual situation of the affected patient. The use of diuretics to manage \nhypertension is not advised in patients who receive a cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen. MVASI \nshould be permanently discontinued if medically significant hypertension cannot be adequately \ncontrolled with antihypertensive therapy, or if the patient develops hypertensive crisis or hypertensive \nencephalopathy. \n \nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) (see section 4.8) \n \nThere have been rare reports of bevacizumab-treated patients developing signs and symptoms that are \nconsistent with PRES, a rare neurologic disorder, which can present with the following signs and \nsymptoms among others: seizures, headache, altered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical \nblindness, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by \nbrain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In patients developing PRES, treatment \nof specific symptoms including control of hypertension is recommended along with discontinuation of \nMVASI. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is \nnot known. \n \nProteinuria (see section 4.8) \n \nPatients with a history of hypertension may be at increased risk for the development of proteinuria \nwhen treated with bevacizumab. There is evidence suggesting that all grade (US National Cancer \nInstitute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI-CTCAE v.3]) proteinuria may be \nrelated to the dose. Monitoring of proteinuria by dipstick urinalysis is recommended prior to starting \nand during therapy. Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) was seen in up to 1.4% of patients \ntreated with bevacizumab. Therapy should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop \nnephrotic syndrome (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nArterial thromboembolism (see section 4.8) \n \nIn clinical trials, the incidence of arterial thromboembolic reactions including cerebrovascular \naccidents (CVAs), transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) and myocardial infarctions (MIs) was higher in \npatients receiving bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to those who received \nchemotherapy alone. \n \nPatients receiving bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, with a history of arterial thromboembolism, \ndiabetes or age greater than 65 years have an increased risk of developing arterial thromboembolic \nreactions during therapy. Caution should be taken when treating these patients with MVASI. \n \nTherapy should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop arterial thromboembolic \nreactions. \n \nVenous thromboembolism (see section 4.8) \n \nPatients may be at risk of developing venous thromboembolic reactions, including pulmonary \nembolism under bevacizumab treatment. \n \nPatients treated for persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer with bevacizumab in \ncombination with paclitaxel and cisplatin may be at increased risk of venous thromboembolic events. \n \nMVASI should be discontinued in patients with life-threatening (grade 4) thromboembolic reactions, \nincluding pulmonary embolism (NCI-CTCAE v.3). Patients with thromboembolic reactions ≤ grade 3 \nneed to be closely monitored (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n \nHaemorrhage \n \nPatients treated with bevacizumab have an increased risk of haemorrhage, especially tumour-\nassociated haemorrhage. MVASI should be discontinued permanently in patients who experience \ngrade 3 or 4 bleeding during bevacizumab therapy (NCI-CTCAE v.3) (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients with untreated CNS metastases were routinely excluded from clinical trials with \nbevacizumab, based on imaging procedures or signs and symptoms. Therefore, the risk of CNS \nhaemorrhage in such patients has not been prospectively evaluated in randomised clinical trials (see \nsection 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CNS bleeding, and MVASI \ntreatment discontinued in cases of intracranial bleeding. \n \nThere is no information on the safety profile of bevacizumab in patients with congenital bleeding \ndiathesis, acquired coagulopathy or in patients receiving full dose of anticoagulants for the treatment \nof thromboembolism prior to starting bevacizumab treatment, as such patients were excluded from \nclinical trials. Therefore, caution should be exercised before initiating therapy in these patients. \nHowever, patients who developed venous thrombosis while receiving therapy did not appear to have \nan increased rate of grade 3 or above bleeding when treated with a full dose of warfarin and \nbevacizumab concomitantly (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n \nPulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis \n \nPatients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with bevacizumab may be at risk of serious, and in \nsome cases fatal, pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis. Patients with recent pulmonary \nhaemorrhage/haemoptysis (> 2.5 mL of red blood) should not be treated with bevacizumab. \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) (see section 4.8) \n \nReactions consistent with CHF were reported in clinical trials. The findings ranged from \nasymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction to symptomatic CHF, requiring treatment or \n\n\n\n8 \n\nhospitalisation. Caution should be exercised when treating patients with clinically significant \ncardiovascular disease such as pre-existing coronary artery disease, or congestive heart failure with \nbevacizumab. \n \nMost of the patients who experienced CHF had metastatic breast cancer and had received previous \ntreatment with anthracyclines, prior radiotherapy to the left chest wall or other risk factors for CHF \nwere present. \n \nIn patients in AVF3694g who received treatment with anthracyclines and who had not received \nanthracyclines before, no increased incidence of all grade CHF was observed in the anthracycline + \nbevacizumab group compared to the treatment with anthracyclines only. CHF grade 3 or higher \nreactions were somewhat more frequent among patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with \nchemotherapy than in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. This is consistent with results in patients \nin other studies of metastatic breast cancer who did not receive concurrent anthracycline treatment \n(NCI-CTCAE v.3) (see section 4.8). \n \nNeutropenia and infections (see section 4.8) \n \nIncreased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection with or without severe \nneutropenia (including some fatalities) have been observed in patients treated with some myelotoxic \nchemotherapy regimens plus bevacizumab in comparison to chemotherapy alone. This has mainly \nbeen seen in combination with platinum- or taxane-based therapies in the treatment of NSCLC, mBC, \nand in combination with paclitaxel and topotecan in persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions/infusion reactions (see section 4.8) \n \nPatients may be at risk of developing infusion/hypersensitivity reactions. Close observation of the \npatient during and following the administration of bevacizumab is recommended as expected for any \ninfusion of a therapeutic humanised monoclonal antibody. If a reaction occurs, the infusion should be \ndiscontinued and appropriate medical therapies should be administered. A systematic premedication is \nnot warranted. \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (see section 4.8) \n \nCases of ONJ have been reported in cancer patients treated with bevacizumab, the majority of whom \nhad received prior or concomitant treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates, for which ONJ is an \nidentified risk. Caution should be exercised when bevacizumab and intravenous bisphosphonates are \nadministered simultaneously or sequentially. \n \nInvasive dental procedures are also an identified risk factor. A dental examination and appropriate \npreventive dentistry should be considered prior to starting the treatment with MVASI. In patients who \nhave previously received or are receiving intravenous bisphosphonates invasive dental procedures \nshould be avoided, if possible. \n \nAneurysms and artery dissections (see section 4.8)  \n \nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the \nformation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating MVASI, this risk should be \ncarefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. \n \nIntravitreal use \n \nMVASI is not formulated for intravitreal use. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nEye disorders \n \nIndividual cases and clusters of serious ocular adverse reactions have been reported following \nunapproved intravitreal use of bevacizumab compounded from vials approved for intravenous \nadministration in cancer patients. These reactions included infectious endophthalmitis, intraocular \ninflammation such as sterile endophthalmitis, uveitis and vitritis, retinal detachment, retinal pigment \nepithelial tear, intraocular pressure increased, intraocular haemorrhage such as vitreous haemorrhage \nor retinal haemorrhage and conjunctival haemorrhage. Some of these reactions have resulted in \nvarious degrees of visual loss, including permanent blindness. \n \nSystemic effects following intravitreal use \n \nA reduction of circulating VEGF concentration has been demonstrated following intravitreal anti-\nVEGF therapy. Systemic adverse reactions including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial \nthromboembolic reactions have been reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors. \n \nOvarian failure/fertility \n \nBevacizumab may impair female fertility (see sections 4.6 and 4.8). Therefore fertility preservation \nstrategies should be discussed with women of childbearing potential prior to starting treatment with \nbevacizumab. \n \nSodium content \n \nMVASI 25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion (4 mL) \n \nThis medicinal product contains 4.7 mg sodium per 4 mL vial, equivalent to 0.2% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nMVASI 25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion (16 mL) \n \nThis medicinal product contains 18.8 mg sodium per 16 mL vial, equivalent to 0.9% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffect of antineoplastic agents on bevacizumab pharmacokinetics \n \nNo clinically relevant interaction of co-administered chemotherapy on bevacizumab pharmacokinetics \nwas observed based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. There were neither \nstatistically significant nor clinically relevant differences in bevacizumab clearance in patients \nreceiving bevacizumab monotherapy compared to patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with \ninterferon alfa-2a, erlotinib or chemotherapies (IFL, 5-FU/LV, carboplatin/paclitaxel, capecitabine, \ndoxorubicin or cisplatin/gemcitabine). \n \nEffect of bevacizumab on the pharmacokinetics of other antineoplastic agents \n \nNo clinically relevant interaction of bevacizumab was observed on the pharmacokinetics of \nco-administered interferon alfa 2a, erlotinib (and its active metabolite OSI-420), or the chemotherapies \nirinotecan (and its active metabolite SN38), capecitabine, oxaliplatin (as determined by measurement \nof free and total platinum), and cisplatin. Conclusions on the impact of bevacizumab on gemcitabine \npharmacokinetics cannot be drawn. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nCombination of bevacizumab and sunitinib malate \n \nIn two clinical trials of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia \n(MAHA) was reported in 7 of 19 patients treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every two weeks) and \nsunitinib malate (50 mg daily) combination. \n \nMAHA is a haemolytic disorder which can present with red cell fragmentation, anaemia, and \nthrombocytopenia. In addition, hypertension (including hypertensive crisis), elevated creatinine, and \nneurological symptoms were observed in some of these patients. All of these findings were reversible \nupon discontinuation of bevacizumab and sunitinib malate (see Hypertension, Proteinuria, PRES in \nsection 4.4). \n \nCombination with platinum- or taxane-based therapies (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) \n \nIncreased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection with or without severe \nneutropenia (including some fatalities) have been observed mainly in patients treated with platinum- \nor taxane-based therapies in the treatment of NSCLC and mBC. \n \nRadiotherapy \n \nThe safety and efficacy of concomitant administration of radiotherapy and bevacizumab has not been \nestablished. \n \nEGFR monoclonal antibodies in combination with bevacizumab chemotherapy regimens \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. EGFR monoclonal antibodies should not be administered \nfor the treatment of mCRC in combination with bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy. Results from \nthe randomised phase III studies, PACCE and CAIRO-2, in patients with mCRC suggest that the use \nof anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies panitumumab and cetuximab, respectively, in combination with \nbevacizumab plus chemotherapy, is associated with decreased PFS and/or OS, and with increased \ntoxicity compared with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy alone. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during (and up to 6 months after) \ntreatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no clinical trial data on the use of bevacizumab in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity including malformations (see section 5.3). IgGs are known to cross the \nplacenta, and bevacizumab is anticipated to inhibit angiogenesis in the foetus, and thus is suspected to \ncause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. In the post-marketing setting, cases \nof foetal abnormalities in women treated with bevacizumab alone or in combination with known \nembryotoxic chemotherapeutics have been observed (see section 4.8). MVASI is contraindicated in \npregnancy (see section 4.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether bevacizumab is excreted in human milk. As maternal IgG is excreted in milk \nand bevacizumab could harm infant growth and development (see section 5.3), women must \ndiscontinue breast-feeding during therapy and not breast-feed for at least six months following the last \ndose of bevacizumab. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nFertility \n \nRepeat dose toxicity studies in animals have shown that bevacizumab may have an adverse effect on \nfemale fertility (see section 5.3). In a phase III trial in the adjuvant treatment of patients with colon \ncancer, a substudy with premenopausal women has shown a higher incidence of new cases of ovarian \nfailure in the bevacizumab group compared to the control group. After discontinuation of bevacizumab \ntreatment, ovarian function recovered in the majority of patients. Long term effects of the treatment \nwith bevacizumab on fertility are unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBevacizumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, \nsomnolence and syncope have been reported with bevacizumab use (see table 1 in section 4.8). If \npatients are experiencing symptoms that affect their vision or concentration, or their ability to react, \nthey should be advised not to drive and use machines until symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of bevacizumab is based on data from over 5,700 patients with various \nmalignancies, predominantly treated with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in clinical \ntrials. \n \nThe most serious adverse reactions were: \n \n• Gastrointestinal perforations (see section 4.4). \n• Haemorrhage, including pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis, which is more common in non-\n\nsmall cell lung cancer patients (see section 4.4). \n• Arterial thromboembolism (see section 4.4). \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse reactions across clinical trials in patients receiving bevacizumab \nwere hypertension, fatigue or asthenia, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. \n \nAnalyses of the clinical safety data suggest that the occurrence of hypertension and proteinuria with \nbevacizumab therapy are likely to be dose-dependent. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in this section fall into the following frequency categories: Very common \n(≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTables 1 and 2 list adverse reactions associated with the use of bevacizumab in combination with \ndifferent chemotherapy regimens in multiple indications. \n \nTable 1 provides all adverse reactions by frequency that were determined to have a causal relationship \nwith bevacizumab through: \n• comparative incidences noted between clinical trial treatment arms (with at least a 10% \n\ndifference compared to the control arm for NCI-CTCAE grade 1-5 reactions or at least a 2% \ndifference compared to the control arm for NCI-CTCAE grade 3-5 reactions), \n\n• post-authorisation safety studies, \n• spontaneous reporting, \n• epidemiological studies/non-interventional or observational studies, \n• or through an evaluation of individual case reports. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTable 2 provides the frequency of severe adverse reactions. Severe reactions are defined as adverse \nevents with at least a 2% difference compared to the control arm in clinical studies for NCI-CTCAE \ngrade 3-5 reactions. Table 2 also includes adverse reactions which are considered by the MAH to be \nclinically significant or severe. \n \nPost-marketing adverse reactions are included in both tables 1 and 2, where applicable. Detailed \ninformation about these post-marketing reactions are provided in table 3. \n \nAdverse reactions are added to the appropriate frequency category in the tables below according to the \nhighest incidence seen in any indication. \n \nWithin each frequency category, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \nSome of the adverse reactions are reactions commonly seen with chemotherapy; however, \nbevacizumab may exacerbate these reactions when combined with chemotherapeutic agents. Examples \ninclude palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or \ncapecitabine, peripheral sensory neuropathy with paclitaxel or oxaliplatin, nail disorders or alopecia \nwith paclitaxel and paronychia with erlotinib. \n \nTable 1.

Table 2 also includes clinically \nsignificant adverse reactions that were observed only in the post-marketing setting, therefore, the frequency and \nNCI-CTCAE grade is not known. These clinically significant reactions have therefore been included in table 2 \nwithin the column entitled “Frequency not known”. \n \na  Terms represent a group of events that describe a medical concept rather than a single condition or \nMedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) preferred term. This group of medical terms may \ninvolve the same underlying pathophysiology (e.g. arterial thromboembolic reactions include cerebrovascular \naccident, myocardial infarction, transient ischaemic attack and other arterial thromboembolic reactions). \nb  For additional information refer below within section “Description of selected serious adverse reactions”. \nc  For further information please refer to table 3 “Adverse reactions reported in post-marketing setting”. \nd  Recto-vaginal fistulae are the most common fistulae in the GI-vaginal fistula category. \n \nDescription of selected serious adverse reactions \n \nGastrointestinal (GI) perforations and Fistulae (see section 4.4) \n \nBevacizumab has been associated with serious cases of gastrointestinal perforation. \n \nGastrointestinal perforations have been reported in clinical trials with an incidence of less than 1% in \npatients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, up to 1.3% in patients with metastatic breast \ncancer, up to 2.0% in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or in patients with ovarian cancer, and \nup to 2.7% (including gastrointestinal fistula and abscess) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study GOG-\n0240), GI perforations (all grade) were reported in 3.2% of patients, all of whom had a history of prior \npelvic radiation. \n \nThe occurrence of those events varied in type and severity, ranging from free air seen on the plain \nabdominal X-ray, which resolved without treatment, to intestinal perforation with abdominal abscess \nand fatal outcome. In some cases underlying intra-abdominal inflammation was present, either from \ngastric ulcer disease, tumour necrosis, diverticulitis, or chemotherapy-associated colitis. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nFatal outcome was reported in approximately a third of serious cases of gastrointestinal perforations, \nwhich represents between 0.2%-1% of all bevacizumab-treated patients. \n \nIn bevacizumab clinical trials, gastrointestinal fistulae (all grade) have been reported with an incidence \nof up to 2% in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer, but were also reported \nless commonly in patients with other types of cancer. \n \nGI-vaginal Fistulae in study GOG-0240 \n \nIn a trial of patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, the incidence of GI-vaginal \nfistulae was 8.3% in bevacizumab-treated patients and 0.9% in control patients, all of whom had a \nhistory of prior pelvic radiation. The frequency of GI-vaginal fistulae in the group treated with \nbevacizumab + chemotherapy was higher in patients with recurrence within the field of prior radiation \n(16.7%) compared with patients with no prior radiation and/or no recurrence inside the field of prior \nradiation (3.6%). The corresponding frequencies in the control group receiving chemotherapy alone \nwere 1.1% vs. 0.8%, respectively. Patients who develop GI-vaginal fistulae may also have bowel \nobstructions and require surgical intervention as well as diverting ostomies. \n \nNon-GI Fistulae (see section 4.4) \n \nBevacizumab use has been associated with serious cases of fistulae including reactions resulting in \ndeath. \n \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (GOG-0240), \n1.8% of bevacizumab-treated patients and 1.4% of control patients were reported to have had non-\ngastrointestinal vaginal, vesical, or female genital tract fistulae. \n \nUncommon (≥ 0.1% to < 1%) reports of fistulae that involve areas of the body other than the \ngastrointestinal tract (e.g. bronchopleural and biliary fistulae) were observed across various \nindications. Fistulae have also been reported in post-marketing experience. \n \nReactions were reported at various time points during treatment ranging from one week to greater than \n1 year from initiation of bevacizumab, with most reactions occurring within the first 6 months of \ntherapy. \n \nWound healing (see section 4.4) \n \nAs bevacizumab may adversely impact wound healing, patients who had major surgery within the last \n28 days were excluded from participation in phase III clinical trials. \n \nIn clinical trials of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, there was no increased risk of post-\noperative bleeding or wound healing complications observed in patients who underwent major surgery \n28-60 days prior to starting bevacizumab. An increased incidence of post-operative bleeding or wound \nhealing complication occurring within 60 days of major surgery was observed if the patient was being \ntreated with bevacizumab at the time of surgery. The incidence varied between 10% (4/40) and 20% \n(3/15). \n \nSerious wound healing complications, including anastomotic complications, have been reported, some \nof which had a fatal outcome. \n \nIn locally recurrent and metastatic breast cancer trials, grade 3-5 wound healing complications were \nobserved in up to 1.1% of patients receiving bevacizumab compared with up to 0.9% of patients in the \ncontrol arms (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n \nIn clinical trials of ovarian cancer, grade 3-5 wound healing complications were observed in up to \n1.8% of patients in the bevacizumab arm versus 0.1% in the control arm (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nHypertension (see section 4.4) \n \nIn clinical trials, with the exception of study JO25567, the overall incidence of hypertension (all \ngrades) ranged up to 42.1% in the bevacizumab-containing arms compared with up to 14% in the \ncontrol arms. The overall incidence of NCI-CTC grade 3 and 4 hypertension in patients receiving \nbevacizumab ranged from 0.4% to 17.9%. Grade 4 hypertension (hypertensive crisis) occurred in up to \n1.0% of patients treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy compared to up to 0.2% of patients \ntreated with the same chemotherapy alone. \n \nIn study JO25567, all grade hypertension was observed in 77.3% of the patients who received \nbevacizumab in combination with erlotinib as first-line treatment for non-squamous NSCLC with \nEGFR activating mutations, compared to 14.3% of patients treated with erlotinib alone. Grade 3 \nhypertension was 60.0% in patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with erlotinib compared \nto 11.7% in patients treated with erlotinib alone. There were no grade 4 or 5 hypertension events. \n \nHypertension was generally adequately controlled with oral anti-hypertensives such as angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics and calcium-channel blockers. It rarely resulted in \ndiscontinuation of bevacizumab treatment or hospitalisation. \n \nVery rare cases of hypertensive encephalopathy have been reported, some of which were fatal. \n \nThe risk of bevacizumab-associated hypertension did not correlate with the patients’ baseline \ncharacteristics, underlying disease or concomitant therapy. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (see section 4.4) \n \nThere have been rare reports of bevacizumab-treated patients developing signs and symptoms that are \nconsistent with PRES, a rare neurological disorder. Presentation may include seizures, headache, \naltered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without associated \nhypertension. The clinical presentation of PRES is often nonspecific, and therefore the diagnosis of \nPRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably MRI. \n \nIn patients developing PRES, early recognition of symptoms with prompt treatment of specific \nsymptoms including control of hypertension (if associated with severe uncontrolled hypertension) is \nrecommended in addition to discontinuation of bevacizumab therapy. Symptoms usually resolve or \nimprove within days after treatment discontinuation, although some patients have experienced some \nneurologic sequelae. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab therapy in patients previously \nexperiencing PRES is not known. \n \nAcross clinical trials, 8 cases of PRES have been reported. Two of the eight cases did not have \nradiological confirmation via MRI. \n \nProteinuria (see section 4.4) \n \nIn clinical trials, proteinuria has been reported within the range of 0.7% to 54.7% of patients receiving \nbevacizumab. \n \nProteinuria ranged in severity from clinically asymptomatic, transient, trace proteinuria to nephrotic \nsyndrome, with the great majority as grade 1 proteinuria (NCI-CTCAE v.3). Grade 3 proteinuria was \nreported in up to 10.9% of treated patients. Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) was seen in up \nto 1.4% of treated patients. Testing for proteinuria is recommended prior to start of MVASI therapy. \nIn most clinical trials urine protein levels of ≥ 2g/24 hrs led to stopping treatment with bevacizumab \nuntil recovery to < 2g/24 hrs. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nHaemorrhage (see section 4.4) \n \nIn clinical trials across all indications the overall incidence of NCI-CTCAE v.3 grade 3-5 bleeding \nreactions ranged from 0.4% to 6.9% in bevacizumab-treated patients, compared with up to 4.5% of \npatients in the chemotherapy control group. \n \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study \nGOG-0240), grade 3-5 bleeding reactions have been reported in up to 8.3% of patients treated with \nbevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and topotecan compared with up to 4.6% of patients \ntreated with paclitaxel and topotecan. \n \nThe haemorrhagic reactions that have been observed in clinical trials were predominantly tumour-\nassociated haemorrhage (see below) and minor mucocutaneous haemorrhage (e.g. epistaxis). \n \nTumour-associated haemorrhage (see section 4.4) \n \nMajor or massive pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis has been observed primarily in trials in \npatients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Possible risk factors include squamous cell \nhistology, treatment with antirheumatic/anti-inflammatory substances, treatment with anticoagulants, \nprior radiotherapy, bevacizumab therapy, previous medical history of atherosclerosis, central tumour \nlocation and cavitation of tumours prior to or during therapy. The only variables that showed \nstatistically significant correlations with bleeding were bevacizumab therapy and squamous cell \nhistology. Patients with NSCLC of known squamous cell histology or mixed cell type with \npredominant squamous cell histology were excluded from subsequent phase III trials, while patients \nwith unknown tumour histology were included. \n \nIn patients with NSCLC excluding predominant squamous histology, all grade reactions were seen \nwith a frequency of up to 9.3% when treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy compared with up \nto 5% in the patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Grade 3-5 reactions have been observed in up \nto 2.3% of patients treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy as compared with < 1% with \nchemotherapy alone (NCI-CTCAE v.3). Major or massive pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis can \noccur suddenly and up to two thirds of the serious pulmonary haemorrhages resulted in a fatal \noutcome. \n \nGastrointestinal haemorrhages, including rectal bleeding and melaena have been reported in colorectal \ncancer patients, and have been assessed as tumour-associated haemorrhages. \n \nTumour-associated haemorrhage was also seen rarely in other tumour types and locations, including \ncases of central nervous system (CNS) bleeding in patients with CNS metastases (see section 4.4). \n \nThe incidence of CNS bleeding in patients with untreated CNS metastases receiving bevacizumab has \nnot been prospectively evaluated in randomised clinical trials. In an exploratory retrospective analysis \nof data from 13 completed randomised trials in patients with various tumour types, 3 patients out of 91 \n(3.3%) with brain metastases experienced CNS bleeding (all grade 4) when treated with bevacizumab, \ncompared to 1 case (grade 5) out of 96 patients (1%) that were not exposed to bevacizumab. In two \nsubsequent studies in patients with treated brain metastases (which included around 800 patients), one \ncase of grade 2 CNS haemorrhage was reported in 83 subjects treated with bevacizumab (1.2%) at the \ntime of interim safety analysis (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n \nAcross all clinical trials, mucocutaneous haemorrhage has been seen in up to 50% of bevacizumab-\ntreated patients. These were most commonly NCI-CTCAE v.3 grade 1 epistaxis that lasted less than \n5 minutes, resolved without medical intervention and did not require any changes in the bevacizumab \ntreatment regimen. Clinical safety data suggest that the incidence of minor mucocutaneous \nhaemorrhage (e.g. epistaxis) may be dose-dependent. \n \nThere have also been less common reactions of minor mucocutaneous haemorrhage in other locations, \nsuch as gingival bleeding or vaginal bleeding. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nThromboembolism (see section 4.4) \n \nArterial thromboembolism: An increased incidence of arterial thromboembolic reactions was observed \nin patients treated with bevacizumab across indications, including cerebrovascular accidents, \nmyocardial infarction, transient ischaemic attacks, and other arterial thromboembolic reactions. \n \nIn clinical trials, the overall incidence of arterial thromboembolic reactions ranged up to 3.8% in the \nbevacizumab-containing arms compared with up to 2.1% in the chemotherapy control arms. Fatal \noutcome was reported in 0.8% of patients receiving bevacizumab compared to 0.5% in patients \nreceiving chemotherapy alone. Cerebrovascular accidents (including transient ischaemic attacks) were \nreported in up to 2.7% of patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy \ncompared to up to 0.5% of patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Myocardial infarction was \nreported in up to 1.4% of patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy \ncompared to up to 0.7% of patients treated with chemotherapy alone. \n \nIn one clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in combination with 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid, \nAVF2192g, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were not candidates for treatment with \nirinotecan were included. In this trial arterial thromboembolic reactions were observed in 11% \n(11/100) of patients compared to 5.8% (6/104) in the chemotherapy control group. \n \nVenous thromboembolism: The incidence of venous thromboembolic reactions in clinical trials was \nsimilar in patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to those \nreceiving the control chemotherapy alone. Venous thromboembolic reactions include deep venous \nthrombosis, pulmonary embolism and thrombophlebitis. \n \nIn clinical trials across indications, the overall incidence of venous thromboembolic reactions ranged \nfrom 2.8% to 17.3% of bevacizumab-treated patients compared with 3.2% to 15.6% in the control \narms. \n \nGrade 3-5 (NCI-CTCAE v.3) venous thromboembolic reactions have been reported in up to 7.8% of \npatients treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab compared with up to 4.9% in patients treated \nwith chemotherapy alone (across indications, excluding persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical \ncancer). \n \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study \nGOG-0240), grade 3-5 venous thromboembolic events have been reported in up to 15.6% of patients \ntreated with bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin compared with up to 7.0% of \npatients treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin. \n \nPatients who have experienced a venous thromboembolic reaction may be at higher risk for a \nrecurrence if they receive bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy \nalone. \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) \n \nIn clinical trials with bevacizumab, congestive heart failure (CHF) was observed in all cancer \nindications studied to date, but occurred predominantly in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In \nfour phase III trials (AVF2119g, E2100, BO17708 and AVF3694g) in patients with metastatic breast \ncancer CHF grade 3 (NCI-CTCAE v.3) or higher was reported in up to 3.5% of patients treated with \nbevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with up to 0.9% in the control arms. For \npatients in study AVF3694g who received anthracyclines concomitantly with bevacizumab, the \nincidences of grade 3 or higher CHF for the respective bevacizumab and control arms were similar to \nthose in the other studies in metastatic breast cancer: 2.9% in the anthracycline + bevacizumab arm \nand 0% in the anthracycline + placebo arm. In addition, in study AVF3694g the incidences of all grade \nCHF were similar between the anthracycline + bevacizumab (6.2%) and the anthracycline + placebo \narms (6.0%). \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \nMost patients who developed CHF during mBC trials showed improved symptoms and/or left \nventricular function following appropriate medical therapy. \n \nIn most clinical trials of bevacizumab, patients with pre-existing CHF of NYHA (New York Heart \nAssociation) II-IV were excluded, therefore, no information is available on the risk of CHF in this \npopulation. \n \nPrior anthracyclines exposure and/or prior radiation to the chest wall may be possible risk factors for \nthe development of CHF. \n \nAn increased incidence of CHF has been observed in a clinical trial of patients with diffuse large \nB-cell lymphoma when receiving bevacizumab with a cumulative doxorubicin dose greater than \n300 mg/m2. This phase III clinical trial compared rituximab/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/ \nvincristine/prednisone (R-CHOP) plus bevacizumab to R-CHOP without bevacizumab. While the \nincidence of CHF was, in both arms, above that previously observed for doxorubicin therapy, the rate \nwas higher in the R-CHOP plus bevacizumab arm. These results suggest that close clinical observation \nwith appropriate cardiac assessments should be considered for patients exposed to cumulative \ndoxorubicin doses greater than 300 mg/m2 when combined with bevacizumab. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions/infusion reactions (see section 4.4 and Post-marketing experience below) \n \nIn some clinical trials anaphylactic and anaphylactoid-type reactions were reported more frequently in \npatients receiving bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone. The \nincidence of these reactions in some clinical trials of bevacizumab is common (up to 5% in \nbevacizumab-treated patients). \n \nInfections \n \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study \nGOG-0240), grade 3-5 infections have been reported in up to 24% of patients treated with \nbevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and topotecan compared with up to 13% of patients \ntreated with paclitaxel and topotecan. \n \nOvarian failure/fertility (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n \nIn NSABP C-08, a phase III trial of bevacizumab in adjuvant treatment of patients with colon cancer, \nthe incidence of new cases of ovarian failure, defined as amenorrhoea lasting 3 or more months, FSH \nlevel ≥ 30 mIU/mL and a negative serum β-HCG pregnancy test, has been evaluated in 295 \npremenopausal women. New cases of ovarian failure were reported in 2.6% patients in the \nmFOLFOX-6 group compared to 39% in the mFOLFOX-6 + bevacizumab group. After \ndiscontinuation of bevacizumab treatment, ovarian function recovered in 86.2% of these evaluable \nwomen. Long term effects of the treatment with bevacizumab on fertility are unknown. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nDecreased neutrophil count, decreased white blood cell count and presence of urine protein may be \nassociated with MVASI treatment. \n \nAcross clinical trials, the following grade 3 and 4 (NCI-CTCAE v.3) laboratory abnormalities \noccurred in patients treated with bevacizumab with at least a 2% difference compared to the \ncorresponding control groups: hyperglycaemia, decreased haemoglobin, hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, decreased white blood cell count, increased international normalised ratio (INR). \n \nClinical trials have shown that transient increases in serum creatinine (ranging between 1.5-1.9 times \nbaseline level), both with and without proteinuria, are associated with the use of bevacizumab. The \n\n\n\n21 \n\nobserved increase in serum creatinine was not associated with a higher incidence of clinical \nmanifestations of renal impairment in patients treated with bevacizumab. \n \nOther special populations \n \nElderly patients \n \nIn randomised clinical trials, age > 65 years was associated with an increased risk of developing \narterial thromboembolic reactions, including cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), transient ischaemic \nattacks (TIAs) and myocardial infarctions (MIs). Other reactions with a higher frequency seen in \npatients over 65 were grade 3-4 leucopenia and thrombocytopenia (NCI-CTCAE v.3); and all grade \nneutropenia, diarrhoea, nausea, headache and fatigue as compared to those aged ≤ 65 years when \ntreated with bevacizumab (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 under Thromboembolism). In one clinical trial, the \nincidence of hypertension of grade ≥ 3 was two fold higher in patients aged > 65 years than in the \nyounger age group (< 65 years). In a study of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer patients, \nalopecia, mucosal inflammation, peripheral sensory neuropathy, proteinuria and hypertension were \nalso reported and occurred at a rate at least 5% higher in the CT + BV arm for bevacizumab-treated \npatients ≥ 65 years of age compared with bevacizumab-treated patients aged < 65 years. \n \nNo increase in the incidence of other reactions, including gastrointestinal perforation, wound healing \ncomplications, congestive heart failure, and haemorrhage was observed in elderly patients (> 65 years) \nreceiving bevacizumab as compared to those aged ≤ 65 years treated with bevacizumab. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in children less than 18 years old have not been established. \n \nIn study BO25041 of bevacizumab added to post-operative radiation therapy (RT) with concomitant \nand adjuvant temozolomide in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial, infratentorial, \ncerebellar, or peduncular high-grade glioma, the safety profile was comparable with that observed in \nother tumour types in adults treated with bevacizumab. \n \nIn study BO20924 of bevacizumab with current standard of care in metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and \nnon-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, the safety profile of bevacizumab-treated children was \ncomparable with that observed in adults treated with bevacizumab. \n \nMVASI is not approved for use in patients under the age of 18 years. In published literature reports, \ncases of non-mandibular osteonecrosis have been observed in patients under the age of 18 years \ntreated with bevacizumab. \n \nPost-marketing experience  \n \nTable 3.

Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest dose tested in humans (20 mg/kg of body weight, intravenous every 2 weeks) was \nassociated with severe migraine in several patients. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, antineoplastic agents, other \nantineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC07. \n \nMVASI is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBevacizumab binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the key driver of vasculogenesis \nand angiogenesis, and thereby inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and \nKDR (VEGFR-2), on the surface of endothelial cells. Neutralising the biological activity of VEGF \n\n\n\n23 \n\nregresses the vascularisation of tumours, normalises remaining tumour vasculature, and inhibits the \nformation of new tumour vasculature, thereby inhibiting tumour growth. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nAdministration of bevacizumab or its parental murine antibody to xenotransplant models of cancer in \nnude mice resulted in extensive anti-tumour activity in human cancers, including colon, breast, \npancreas and prostate. Metastatic disease progression was inhibited and microvascular permeability \nwas reduced. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nMetastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum (mCRC) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of the recommended dose (5 mg/kg of body weight every two weeks) in \nmetastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum were studied in three randomised, active-controlled \nclinical trials in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based first-line chemotherapy. Bevacizumab was \ncombined with two chemotherapy regimens: \n \n• AVF2107g: A weekly schedule of irinotecan/bolus 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (IFL) for a total \n\nof 4 weeks of each 6 week-cycle (Saltz regimen). \n• AVF0780g: In combination with bolus 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (5-FU/FA) for a total of \n\n6 weeks of each 8 week-cycle (Roswell Park regimen). \n• AVF2192g: In combination with bolus 5-FU/FA for a total of 6 weeks of each 8 week-cycle \n\n(Roswell Park regimen) in patients who were not optimal candidates for first-line irinotecan \ntreatment. \n\n \nThree additional studies with bevacizumab have been conducted in mCRC patients: first-line \n(NO16966), second-line with no previous bevacizumab treatment (E3200), and second-line with \nprevious bevacizumab treatment following disease progression in first-line (ML18147). In these \nstudies, bevacizumab was administered at the following dosing regimens in combination with \nFOLFOX-4 (5-FU/LV/oxaliplatin), XELOX (capecitabine/oxaliplatin), and \nfluoropyrimidine/irinotecan and fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin: \n \n• NO16966: bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg of body weight every 3 weeks in combination with oral \n\ncapecitabine and intravenous oxaliplatin (XELOX) or bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks in \ncombination with leucovorin plus 5-fluorouracil bolus, followed by 5-fluorouracil infusion, with \nintravenous oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4). \n\n• E3200: bevacizumab 10 mg/kg of body weight every 2 weeks in combination with leucovorin \nand 5-fluorouracil bolus, followed by 5-fluorouracil infusion, with intravenous oxaliplatin \n(FOLFOX-4) in bevacizumab-naïve patients. \n\n• ML18147: bevacizumab 5.0 mg/kg of body weight every 2 weeks or bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg of \nbody weight every 3 weeks in combination with fluoropyrimidine/irinotecan or \nfluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin in patients with disease progression following first-line treatment \nwith bevacizumab. Use of irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-containing regimen was switched \ndepending on first-line usage of either oxaliplatin or irinotecan. \n\n \nAVF2107g \nThis was a phase III randomised, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab \nin combination with IFL as first-line treatment for metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. Eight \nhundred and thirteen patients were randomised to receive IFL + placebo (Arm 1) or IFL + \nbevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks, Arm 2). A third group of 110 patients received bolus 5-FU/FA \n+ bevacizumab (Arm 3). Enrolment in Arm 3 was discontinued, as pre-specified, once safety of \nbevacizumab with the IFL regimen was established and considered acceptable. All treatments were \ncontinued until disease progression. The overall mean age was 59.4 years; 56.6% of patients had an \nECOG performance status of 0, 43% had a value of 1 and 0.4% had a value of 2. 15.5% had received \nprior radiotherapy and 28.4% prior chemotherapy. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nThe primary efficacy variable of the trial was overall survival. The addition of bevacizumab to IFL \nresulted in statistically significant increases in overall survival, progression-free survival and overall \nresponse rate (see table 4). The clinical benefit, as measured by overall survival, was seen in all pre-\nspecified patient subgroups, including those defined by age, sex, performance status, location of \nprimary tumour, number of organs involved and duration of metastatic disease. \n \nThe efficacy results of bevacizumab in combination with IFL-chemotherapy are displayed in table 4. \n \nTable 4.

One \nhundred and five patients were randomised to 5-FU/FA + placebo arm and 104 patients to 5-FU/FA + \nbevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) arm. All treatments were continued until disease progression. \nThe addition of bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every two weeks to 5-FU/FA resulted in higher objective \nresponse rates, significantly longer progression-free survival, and a trend in longer survival as \ncompared to 5-FU/FA chemotherapy alone. \n \nAVF0780g \nThis was a phase II randomised, active-controlled, open-labelled clinical trial investigating \nbevacizumab in combination with 5-FU/FA as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The \nmedian age was 64 years. 19% of the patients had received prior chemotherapy and 14% prior \nradiotherapy. Seventy-one patients were randomised to receive bolus 5-FU/FA or 5-FU/FA + \nbevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks). A third group of 33 patients received bolus 5-FU/FA + \nbevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Patients were treated until disease progression. The primary \nendpoints of the trial were objective response rate and progression-free survival. The addition of \nbevacizumab 5 mg/kg every two weeks to 5-FU/FA resulted in higher objective response rates, longer \n\n\n\n25 \n\nprogression-free survival, and a trend in longer survival, compared with 5-FU/FA chemotherapy alone \n(see table 5). These efficacy data are consistent with the results from trial AVF2107g. \n \nThe efficacy data from trials AVF0780g and AVF2192g investigating bevacizumab in combination \nwith 5-FU/FA chemotherapy are summarised in table 5. \n \nTable 5.

In this trial, \nthere were two primary objectives: to show that XELOX was non-inferior to FOLFOX-4 and to show \nthat bevacizumab in combination with FOLFOX-4 or XELOX chemotherapy was superior to \nchemotherapy alone. Both co-primary objectives were met: \n \n• Non-inferiority of the XELOX-containing arms compared with the FOLFOX-4-containing arms \n\nin the overall comparison was demonstrated in terms of progression-free survival and overall \nsurvival in the eligible per-protocol population. \n\n• Superiority of the bevacizumab-containing arms versus the chemotherapy alone arms in the \noverall comparison was demonstrated in terms of progression-free survival in the ITT \npopulation (Table 7). \n\n \nSecondary PFS analyses, based on ‘on-treatment’-based response assessments, confirmed the \nsignificantly superior clinical benefit for patients treated with bevacizumab (analyses shown in \ntable 7), consistent with the statistically significant benefit observed in the pooled analysis. \n \nTable 7.

Treatment was given \nuntil progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary outcome measure was overall survival \ndefined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause. \n \nA total of 820 patients were randomised. The addition of bevacizumab to fluoropyrimidine-based \nchemotherapy resulted in a statistically significant prolongation of survival in patients with mCRC \nwho have progressed on a first-line bevacizumab-containing regimen (ITT = 819) (see table 9). \n \nTable 9.

Objective \nresponse rate was low in both treatment arms and the difference was not significant. \n \nStudy E3200 used a 5 mg/kg/week equivalent dose of bevacizumab in bevacizumab-naïve patients, \nwhile study ML18147 used a 2.5 mg/kg/week equivalent dose of bevacizumab in bevacizumab-\npretreated patients. A cross-trial comparison of the efficacy and safety data is limited by differences \nbetween these studies, most notably in patient populations, previous bevacizumab exposure and \nchemotherapy regimens. Both the 5 mg/kg/week and 2.5 mg/kg/week equivalent doses of \nbevacizumab provided a statistically significant benefit with regards to OS (HR 0.751 in study E3200; \nHR 0.81 in study ML18147) and PFS (HR 0.518 in study E3200; HR 0.68 in study ML18147). In \nterms of safety, there was a higher overall incidence of grade 3-5 AEs in study E3200 relative to study \nML18147. \n \nMetastatic breast cancer (mBC) \n \nA large phase III trial was designed to investigate the treatment effect of bevacizumab in combination \nwith paclitaxel, as measured by the primary endpoint of PFS. A clinically meaningful and statistically \nsignificant improvement in PFS was observed. \n \nSummarised below are PFS results: \n \n• Study E2100 (paclitaxel) \n\n•  Median PFS increase 5.6 months, HR 0.421 (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.343; 0.516)  \n \nFurther details on the study and the results are provided below. \n \nECOG E2100 \nTrial E2100 was an open-label, randomised, active-controlled, multicentre clinical trial evaluating \nbevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer in \npatients who had not previously received chemotherapy for locally recurrent and metastatic disease. \nPatients were randomised to paclitaxel alone (90 mg/m2 / IV over 1-hour once weekly for three out of \nfour weeks) or in combination with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg IV infusion every two weeks). Prior \nhormonal therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease was allowed. Adjuvant taxane therapy was \nallowed only if it was completed at least 12 months prior to trial entry. Of the 722 patients in the trial, \nthe majority of patients had HER2-negative disease (90%), with a small number of patients with \nunknown (8%) or confirmed HER2-positive status (2%), who had previously been treated with or \nwere considered unsuitable for trastuzumab therapy. Furthermore, 65% of patients had received \nadjuvant chemotherapy including 19% prior taxanes and 49% prior anthracyclines. Patients with \n\n\n\n30 \n\ncentral nervous system metastases, including previously-treated or resected brain lesions, were \nexcluded. \n \nIn trial E2100, patients were treated until disease progression. In situations where early \ndiscontinuation of chemotherapy was required, treatment with bevacizumab as a single agent \ncontinued until disease progression. The patient characteristics were similar across the trial arms. The \nprimary endpoint of this trial was progression-free survival (PFS), based on trial investigators’ \nassessment of disease progression. In addition, an independent review of the primary endpoint was \nalso conducted. The results of this trial are presented in table 10. \n \nTable 10.

An overall survival benefit has been demonstrated in trial E4599 with a \n15 mg/kg/q3wk dose of bevacizumab. Trial BO17704 has demonstrated that both 7.5 mg/kg/q3wk and \n15 mg/kg/q3wk bevacizumab doses increase progression-free survival and response rate. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nE4599 \nE4599 was an open-label, randomised, active-controlled, multicentre clinical trial evaluating \nbevacizumab as first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced (stage IIIB with malignant \npleural effusion), metastatic or recurrent NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology. \n \nPatients were randomised to platinum-based chemotherapy (paclitaxel 200 mg/m2) and carboplatin \nAUC = 6.0, both by IV infusion (PC) on day 1 of every 3-week cycle for up to 6 cycles or PC in \ncombination with bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg IV infusion day 1 of every 3-week cycle. After \ncompletion of six cycles of carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy or upon premature discontinuation of \nchemotherapy, patients on the bevacizumab + carboplatin-paclitaxel arm continued to receive \nbevacizumab as a single agent every 3 weeks until disease progression. 878 patients were randomised \nto the two arms. \n \nDuring the trial, of the patients who received trial treatment, 32.2% (136/422) of patients received \n7-12 administrations of bevacizumab and 21.1% (89/422) of patients received 13 or more \nadministrations of bevacizumab. \n \nThe primary endpoint was duration of survival.

In the bevacizumab-containing arms, patients could receive bevacizumab \n\n\n\n32 \n\nas a single agent every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Trial results show \nthat 94% (277 / 296) of eligible patients went on to receive single agent bevacizumab at cycle 7.

The 649 randomised patients (641 treated) had Karnofsky Performance Status \n(KPS) of ≥ 70%, no CNS metastases and adequate organ function. Patients were nephrectomised for \nprimary renal cell carcinoma. Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg was given every 2 weeks until disease \nprogression. IFN alfa-2a was given up to 52 weeks or until disease progression at a recommended \nstarting dose of 9 MIU three times a week, allowing a dose reduction to 3 MIU three times a week in 2 \nsteps. Patients were stratified according to country and Motzer score and the treatment arms were \nshown to be well balanced for the prognostic factors. \n \nThe primary endpoint was overall survival, with secondary endpoints for the trial including \nprogression-free survival. The addition of bevacizumab to IFN alfa-2a significantly increased PFS and \nobjective tumour response rate. These results have been confirmed through an independent \nradiological review. However, the increase in the primary endpoint of overall survival by 2 months \nwas not significant (HR = 0.91). A high proportion of patients (approximately 63% IFN/placebo; \n55% bevacizumab/IFN) received a variety of non-specified post-trial anti-cancer therapies, including \nantineoplastic agents, which may have impacted the analysis of overall survival. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nThe efficacy results are presented in table 13. \n \nTable 13.

Adjustment for these \nbaseline factors resulted in a treatment hazard ratio of 0.78 (95% CI [0.63; 0.96], p = 0.0219), \nindicating a 22% reduction in the risk of death for patients in the bevacizumab + IFN alfa-2a arm \ncompared to IFN alfa-2a arm. \n \nNinety-seven (97) patients in the IFN alfa-2a arm and 131 patients in the bevacizumab arm reduced \nthe dose of IFN alfa-2a from 9 MIU to either 6 or 3 MIU three times a week as pre-specified in the \nprotocol. Dose reduction of IFN alfa-2a did not appear to affect the efficacy of the combination of \nbevacizumab and IFN alfa-2a based on PFS event free rates over time, as shown by a subgroup \nanalysis. The 131 patients in the bevacizumab + IFN alfa-2a arm who reduced and maintained the IFN \nalfa-2a dose at 6 or 3 MIU during the trial, exhibited at 6, 12 and 18 months PFS event free rates of \n73, 52 and 21% respectively, as compared to 61, 43 and 17% in the total population of patients \nreceiving bevacizumab + IFN alfa-2a. \n \nAVF0890 \nThis was a randomised phase II trial conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab \nversus placebo. A total of 116 patients were randomised to receive bevacizumab 3 mg/kg every \n2 weeks (n = 39), 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks; (n = 37), or placebo (n = 40). An interim analysis showed \nthere was a significant prolongation of the time to progression of disease in the 10 mg/kg group as \ncompared with the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.55; p < 0.001). There was a small difference, of \nborderline significance, between the time to progression of disease in the 3 mg/kg group and that in \nthe placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.26; p = 0.053). Four patients had objective (partial) response, and all \nof these had received the 10 mg/kg dose bevacizumab; the ORR for the 10 mg/kg dose was 10%. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nEpithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer \n \nFront-line treatment of ovarian cancer \n \nThe safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in the front-line treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian, \nfallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer were studied in two phase III trials (GOG-0218 and \nBO17707) that evaluated the effect of the addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel \ncompared to the chemotherapy regimen alone. \n \nGOG-0218 \nThe GOG-0218 study was a phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three \narm study evaluating the effect of adding bevacizumab to an approved chemotherapy regimen \n(carboplatin and paclitaxel) in patients with advanced (stages IIIB, IIIC and IV according to FIGO \nstaging version dated 1988) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. \n \nPatients who had received prior therapy with bevacizumab or prior systemic anti-cancer therapy for \novarian cancer (e.g. chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, or \nhormonal therapy) or previous radiotherapy to the abdomen or pelvis were excluded from the study. \n \nA total of 1,873 patients were randomised in equal proportions to the following three arms: \n \n• CPP arm: Five cycles of placebo (started cycle 2) in combination with carboplatin (AUC 6) and \n\npaclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for 6 cycles followed by placebo alone, for a total of up to 15 months of \ntherapy \n\n• CPB15 arm: Five cycles of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg q3w started cycle 2) in combination with \ncarboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for 6 cycles followed by placebo alone, for a \ntotal of up to 15 months of therapy \n\n• CPB15+ arm: Five cycles of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg q3w started cycle 2) in combination with \ncarboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for 6 cycles followed by continued use of \nbevacizumab (15 mg/kg q3w) as single agent for a total of up to 15 months of therapy. \n\n \nThe majority of patients included in the study were white (87% in all three arms); the median age was \n60 years in CPP and CPB15 arms and 59 years in CPB15+ arm; and 29% of patients in CPP or CPB15 \nand 26% in CPB15+ were over 65 years of age. Overall approximately 50% of patients had a GOG PS \nof 0 at baseline, 43% a GOG PS score of 1, and 7% a GOG PS score of 2. Most patients had EOC \n(82% in CPP and CPB15, 85% in CPB15+) followed by PPC (16% in CPP, 15% in CPB15, 13% in \nCPB15+) and FTC (1% in CPP, 3% in CPB15, 2% in CPB15+). The majority of patients had serous \nadenocarcinoma histologic type (85% in CPP and CPB15, 86% in CPB15+). Overall approximately \n34% of patients were FIGO stage III optimally debulked with gross residual disease, 40% stage III \nsuboptimally debulked, and 26% were stage IV patients. \n \nThe primary endpoint was PFS based on investigator’s assessment of disease progression based on \nradiological scans or CA-125 levels, or symptomatic deterioration per protocol. In addition, a \npre-specified analysis of the data censoring for CA-125 progression events was conducted, as well as \nan independent review of PFS as determined by radiological scans. \n \nThe trial met its primary objective of PFS improvement. Compared to patients treated with \nchemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) alone in the front-line setting, patients who received \nbevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg q3w in combination with chemotherapy and continued to receive \nbevacizumab alone (CPB15+), had a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in \nPFS. \n \nIn patients who only received bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy and did not continue to \nreceive bevacizumab alone (CPB15), no clinically meaningful benefit in PFS was observed. \n \nThe results of this study are summarised in table 14. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nTable 14.

Treatment with bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg \nevery 3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) for 6 and up to 8 cycles, \nfollowed by bevacizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity resulted, when data were \nderived from eCRF, in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in OS \ncompared to treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone. \n \nMO22224 \nStudy MO22224 evaluated the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy \nfor platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. This \nstudy was designed as an open-label, randomised, two-arm phase III evaluation of bevacizumab plus \nchemotherapy (CT + BV) versus chemotherapy alone (CT). \n \nA total of 361 patients were enrolled into this study and administered either chemotherapy (paclitaxel, \ntopotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) alone or in combination with bevacizumab: \n \n• CT arm (chemotherapy alone): \n\n• Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 as a 1-hour IV infusion on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 4 weeks \n• Topotecan 4 mg/m2 as a 30-minute IV infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks. \n\nAlternatively, a 1.25 mg/m2 dose could be administered over 30 minutes on days 1-5 \nevery 3 weeks. \n\n• PLD 40 mg/m2 as a 1 mg/min IV infusion on day 1 only every 4 weeks. After cycle 1, the \nmedicinal product could be delivered as a 1-hour infusion. \n\n• CT + BV arm (chemotherapy plus bevacizumab): \n• The chosen chemotherapy was combined with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks \n\n(or bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks if used in combination with topotecan \n1.25 mg/m2 on days 1-5 every 3 weeks). \n\n \nEligible patients had epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer that progressed \nwithin < 6 months of previous platinum therapy consisting of a minimum of 4 platinum therapy \ncycles. Patients should have had a life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks and no prior radiotherapy to the \npelvis or abdomen. Most patients were FIGO stage IIIC or stage IV. The majority of patients in both \narms had an ECOG Performance Status (PS) of 0 (CT: 56.4% vs. CT + BV: 61.2%). The percentage of \npatients with an ECOG PS of 1 or ≥ 2 was 38.7% and 5.0% in the CT arm, and 29.8% and 9.0% in the \nCT + BV arm. Information on race exists for 29.3% of patients and nearly all patients were white. The \nmedian age of patients was 61.0 (range: 25-84) years. A total of 16 patients (4.4%) were > 75 years \nold. The overall rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 8.8% in the CT arm and 43.6% in \nthe CT + BV arm (mostly due to grade 2-3 adverse events) and the median time to discontinuation in \nthe CT + BV arm was 5.2 months compared with 2.4 months in the CT arm. The rates of \ndiscontinuation due to adverse events in the subgroup of patients > 65 years old were 8.8% in the CT \n\n\n\n42 \n\narm and 50.0% in the CT + BV arm. The HR for PFS was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.62) and 0.45 (95% \nCI: 0.31, 0.67) for the < 65 and ≥ 65 subgroups, respectively. \n \nThe primary endpoint was progression-free survival, with secondary endpoints including objective \nresponse rate and overall survival.

There is insufficient information to determine the safety and efficacy of \nbevacizumab in children with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma. \n \nIn a single-arm study (PBTC-022), 18 children with recurrent or progressive non-pontine high-grade \nglioma (including 8 with glioblastoma [WHO grade IV], 9 with anaplastic astrocytoma [grade III] and \n1 with anaplastic oligodendroglioma [grade III]) were treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) two \nweeks apart and then with bevacizumab in combination with CPT-11 (125-350 mg/m2) once every two \nweeks until progression. There were no objective (partial or complete) radiological responses \n(MacDonald criteria). Toxicity and adverse reactions included arterial hypertension and fatigue as well \nas CNS ischaemia with acute neurological deficit. \n \nIn a retrospective single institution series, 12 consecutive (2005 to 2008) children with relapsed or \nprogressive high-grade glioma (3 with WHO grade IV, 9 with grade III) were treated with \nbevacizumab (10 mg/kg) and irinotecan (125 mg/m2) every 2 weeks. There were no complete \nresponses and 2 partial responses (MacDonald criteria). \n \nIn a randomised phase II study (BO25041) a total of 121 patients aged ≥ 3 years to < 18 years with \nnewly diagnosed supratentorial or infratentorial cerebellar or peduncular high-grade glioma (HGG) \nwere treated with post-operative radiation therapy (RT) and adjuvant temozolomide (T) with and \nwithout bevacizumab: 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks IV. \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \nThe study did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a significant improvement of event free \nsurvival (EFS) (Central Radiology Review Committee (CRRC)-assessed) when bevacizumab was \nadded to the RT/T arm compared with RT/T alone (HR = 1.44; 95% CI: 0.90, 2.30). These results \nwere consistent with those from various sensitivity analyses and in clinically relevant subgroups. The \nresults for all secondary endpoints (investigator assessed EFS, and ORR and OS) were consistent in \nshowing no improvement associated with the addition of bevacizumab to the RT/T arm compared with \nthe RT/T arm alone. \n \nAddition of bevacizumab to RT/T did not demonstrate clinical benefit in study BO25041 in 60 \nevaluable children patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial or infratentorial cerebellar or \npeduncular high-grade glioma (HGG) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nSoft tissue sarcoma \n \nIn a randomised phase II study (BO20924) a total of 154 patients aged ≥ 6 months to < 18 years with \nnewly diagnosed metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma were \ntreated with standard of care (Induction IVADO/IVA+/- local therapy followed by maintenance \nvinorelbine and cyclophosphamide) with or without bevacizumab (2.5 mg/kg/week) for a total \nduration of treatment of approximately 18 months. At the time of the final primary analysis, the \nprimary endpoint of EFS by independent central review did not show a statistically significant \ndifference between the two treatment arms, with HR of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.41; p-value = 0.72). The \ndifference in ORR per independent central review was 18% (CI: 0.6%, 35.3%) between the two \ntreatment arms in the few patients who had evaluable tumour at baseline and had a confirmed response \nprior to receiving any local therapy: 27/75 patients (36.0%, 95% CI: 25.2%, 47.9%) in the chemo arm \nand 34/63 patients (54.0%, 95% CI: 40.9%, 66.6%) in the BV + chemo arm. The secondary endpoint \nof overall survival was not mature. Until mature OS results and safety data are available no definitive \nconclusion can be drawn on the benefit/risk balance. \n \nAddition of bevacizumab to standard of care did not demonstrate clinical benefit in clinical trial \nBO20924, in 71 evaluable children (from age 6 months to less than 18 years old) patients with \nmetastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \nThe incidence of adverse events, including grade ≥ 3 adverse events and serious adverse events, was \nsimilar between the two treatment arms. No adverse events leading to death occurred in either \ntreatment arm; all deaths were attributed to disease progression. Bevacizumab addition to multimodal \nstandard of care treatment seemed to be tolerated in this paediatric population. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic data for bevacizumab are available from ten clinical trials in patients with solid \ntumours. In all clinical trials, bevacizumab was administered as an IV infusion. The rate of infusion \nwas based on tolerability, with an initial infusion duration of 90 minutes. The pharmacokinetics of \nbevacizumab was linear at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe typical value for central volume (Vc) was 2.73 L and 3.28 L for female and male patients \nrespectively, which is in the range that has been described for IgGs and other monoclonal antibodies. \nThe typical value for peripheral volume (Vp) was 1.69 L and 2.35 L for female and male patients \nrespectively, when bevacizumab is co-administered with anti-neoplastic agents. After correcting for \nbody weight, male patients had a larger Vc (+ 20%) than female patients. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nBiotransformation \n \nAssessment of bevacizumab metabolism in rabbits following a single IV dose of 125I-bevacizumab \nindicated that its metabolic profile was similar to that expected for a native IgG molecule which does \nnot bind VEGF. The metabolism and elimination of bevacizumab is similar to endogenous IgG \ni.e. primarily via proteolytic catabolism throughout the body, including endothelial cells, and does not \nrely primarily on elimination through the kidneys and liver. Binding of the IgG to the FcRn receptor \nresults in protection from cellular metabolism and the long terminal half-life. \n \nElimination \n \nThe value for clearance is, on average, equal to 0.188 and 0.220 L/day for female and male patients, \nrespectively. After correcting for body weight, male patients had a higher bevacizumab clearance \n(+ 17%) than females. According to the two-compartmental model, the elimination half-life is 18 days \nfor a typical female patient and 20 days for a typical male patient. \n \nLow albumin and high tumour burden are generally indicative of disease severity. Bevacizumab \nclearance was approximately 30% faster in patients with low levels of serum albumin and 7% faster in \nsubjects with higher tumour burden when compared with a typical patient with median values of \nalbumin and tumour burden. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nThe population pharmacokinetics were analysed in adult and paediatric patients to evaluate the effects \nof demographic characteristics. In adults the results showed no significant difference in the \npharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in relation to age. \n \nRenal impairment  \n \nNo trials have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in renally impaired \npatients since the kidneys are not a major organ for bevacizumab metabolism or excretion. \n \nHepatic impairment  \n \nNo trials have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in patients with \nhepatic impairment since the liver is not a major organ for bevacizumab metabolism or excretion. \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab were evaluated in 152 children, adolescents and young adults \n(7 months to 21 years, 5.9 to 125 kg) across 4 clinical studies in paediatrics using a population \npharmacokinetic model. The pharmacokinetic results show that the clearance and volume of \ndistribution of bevacizumab were comparable between paediatric and adult patients when normalised \nby body weight, with exposure trending lower as body weight decreased. Age was not associated with \nthe pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab when body weight was taken into account. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab was well characterised by the paediatric population PK model \nfor 70 paediatric patients in study BO20924 (1.4 to 17.6 years; 11.6 to 77.5 kg) and 59 patients in \nstudy BO25041 (1 to 17 years; 11.2 to 82.3 kg). In study BO20924, bevacizumab exposure was \ngenerally lower compared to a typical adult patient at the same dose. In study BO25041, bevacizumab \nexposure was similar compared to a typical adult at the same dose. In both studies, bevacizumab \nexposure trended lower as body weight decreased. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nIn studies of up to 26 weeks duration in cynomolgus monkeys, physeal dysplasia was observed in \nyoung animals with open growth plates, at bevacizumab average serum concentrations below the \n\n\n\n48 \n\nexpected human therapeutic average serum concentrations. In rabbits, bevacizumab was shown to \ninhibit wound healing at doses below the proposed clinical dose. Effects on wound healing were \nshown to be fully reversible. \n \nStudies to evaluate the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of bevacizumab have not been \nperformed. \n \nNo specific studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the effect on fertility. An adverse \neffect on female fertility can however be expected as repeat dose toxicity studies in animals have \nshown inhibition of the maturation of ovarian follicles and a decrease/absence of corpora lutea and \nassociated decrease in ovarian and uterus weight as well as a decrease in the number of menstrual \ncycles. \n \nBevacizumab has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic when administered to rabbits. \nObserved effects included decreases in maternal and foetal body weights, an increased number of \nfoetal resorptions and an increased incidence of specific gross and skeletal foetal malformations. \nAdverse foetal outcomes were observed at all tested doses, of which the lowest dose resulted in \naverage serum concentrations approximately 3 times larger than in humans receiving 5 mg/kg every \n2 weeks. Information on foetal malformations observed in the post-marketing setting are provided in \nsections 4.6 and 4.8. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n63 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nMVASI 25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion \nbevacizumab \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What MVASI is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use MVASI \n3. How to use MVASI \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store MVASI \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What MVASI is and what it is used for \n \nMVASI contains the active substance bevacizumab, which is a humanised monoclonal antibody (a \ntype of protein that is normally made by the immune system to help defend the body from infection \nand cancer). Bevacizumab binds selectively to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth \nfactor (VEGF), which is found on the lining of blood and lymph vessels in the body. The VEGF \nprotein causes blood vessels to grow within tumours, these blood vessels provide the tumour with \nnutrients and oxygen. Once bevacizumab is bound to VEGF, tumour growth is prevented by blocking \nthe growth of the blood vessels which provide the nutrients and oxygen to the tumour. \n \nMVASI is a medicine used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced cancer in the large bowel, \ni.e., in the colon or rectum. MVASI will be administered in combination with chemotherapy treatment \ncontaining a fluoropyrimidine medicine. \n \nMVASI is also used for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic breast cancer. When used for \npatients with breast cancer, it will be administered with a chemotherapy medicinal product called \npaclitaxel. \n \nMVASI is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. \nMVASI will be administered together with a chemotherapy regimen containing platinum. \n \nMVASI is also used for treatment of adult patients with advanced kidney cancer. When used for \npatients with kidney cancer, it will be administered with another type of medicine called interferon. \n \nMVASI is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, \nor primary peritoneal cancer. When used for patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary \nperitoneal cancer, it will be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. \n \nWhen used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary \nperitoneal cancer whose disease has come back at least 6 months after the last time they were treated \n\n\n\n64 \n\nwith a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, MVASI will be administered in \ncombination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or with carboplatin and paclitaxel. \n \nWhen used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary \nperitoneal cancer whose disease has come back before 6 months after the last time they were treated \nwith a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, MVASI will be administered in \ncombination with topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. \n \nMVASI is also used for the treatment of adult patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical \ncancer. MVASI will be administered in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, \npaclitaxel and topotecan in patients who cannot receive platinum therapy. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use MVASI \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of this medicine, your doctor or pharmacist should record the \ntradename and the lot number of the product you have been given in your patient file. You may also \nwish to make a note of these details in case you are asked for this information in the future. \n \nDo not use MVASI if: \n \n• you are allergic (hypersensitive) to bevacizumab or to any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n• you are allergic (hypersensitive) to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell products or to other \n\nrecombinant human or humanised antibodies. \n• you are pregnant. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using MVASI \n \n• It is possible that MVASI may increase the risk of developing holes in the gut wall. If you have \n\nconditions causing inflammation inside the abdomen (e.g. diverticulitis, stomach ulcers, colitis \nassociated with chemotherapy), please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n• MVASI may increase the risk of developing an abnormal connection or passageway between \ntwo organs or vessels. The risk of developing connections between the vagina and any parts of \nthe gut can increase if you have persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. \n\n• MVASI can increase the risk of bleeding or increase the risk of problems with wound healing \nafter surgery. If you are going to have an operation, if you have had major surgery within the \nlast 28 days or if you still have an unhealed wound following surgery, you should not receive \nthis medicine. \n\n• MVASI may increase the risk of developing serious infections of the skin or deeper layers under \nthe skin, especially if you had holes in the gut wall or problems with wound healing. \n\n• MVASI can increase the incidence of high blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure \nwhich is not well controlled with blood pressure medicines, please consult your doctor as it is \nimportant to make sure that your blood pressure is under control before starting MVASI \ntreatment. \n\n• MVASI increases the risk of having protein in your urine especially if you already have high \nblood pressure. \n\n• The risk of developing blood clots in your arteries (a type of blood vessel) can increase if you \nare over 65 years old, if you have diabetes, or if you have had previous blood clots in your \narteries. Please talk to your doctor since blood clots can lead to heart attack and stroke. \n\n• MVASI can also increase the risk of developing blood clots in your veins (a type of blood \nvessel). \n\n• MVASI may cause bleeding, especially tumour-related bleeding. Please consult your doctor if \nyou or your family tend to suffer from bleeding problems or you are taking medicines to thin the \nblood for any reason. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n• It is possible that MVASI may cause bleeding in and around your brain. Please discuss this with \nyour doctor if you have metastatic cancer affecting your brain. \n\n• It is possible that MVASI can increase the risk of bleeding in your lungs, including coughing or \nspitting blood. Please discuss with your doctor if you noticed this previously. \n\n• MVASI can increase the risk of developing a weak heart. It is important that your doctor knows \nif you have ever received anthracyclines (for example doxorubicin, a specific type of \nchemotherapy used to treat some cancers) or had radiotherapy to your chest, or if you have heart \ndisease. \n\n• MVASI may cause infections and a decreased number of your neutrophils (a type of blood cell \nimportant for your protection against bacteria). \n\n• It is possible that MVASI can cause hypersensitivity and/or infusion reactions (reactions related \nto your injection of the medicine). Please let your doctor, pharmacist or nurse know if you have \npreviously experienced problems after injections, such as dizziness/feeling of fainting, \nbreathlessness, swelling or skin rash. \n\n• A rare neurological side effect named posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) \nhas been associated with MVASI treatment. If you have headache, vision changes, confusion or \nseizure with or without high blood pressure, please contact your doctor. \n\n• If you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a \ntear in a blood vessel wall. \n\n \nPlease consult your doctor, even if these above statements were only applicable to you in the past. \n \nBefore you are given MVASI or while you are being treated with MVASI: \n \n• if you have or have had pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the mouth, \n\nnumbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth tell your doctor and \ndentist immediately. \n\n• if you need to undergo an invasive dental treatment or dental surgery, tell your dentist that you \nare being treated with MVASI (bevacizumab), in particular when you are also receiving or have \nreceived an injection of bisphosphonate into your blood. \n\n \nYou may be advised to have a dental check-up before you start treatment with MVASI. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nMVASI use is not recommended in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the \nsafety and benefit have not been established in these patient populations. \n \nDeath of bone tissue (osteonecrosis) in bones other than the jaw have been reported in patients under \n18 years old when treated with bevacizumab. \n \nOther medicines and MVASI \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nCombinations of MVASI with another medicine called sunitinib malate (prescribed for renal and \ngastrointestinal cancer) may cause severe side effects. Discuss with your doctor to make sure that you \ndo not combine these medicine. \n \nTell your doctor if you are using platinum- or taxane-based therapies for lung or metastatic breast \ncancer. These therapies in combination with MVASI may increase the risk of severe side effects. \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you have recently received, or are receiving, radiotherapy. \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nYou must not use this medicine if you are pregnant. MVASI may cause damage to your unborn baby \nas it may stop the formation of new blood vessels. Your doctor should advise you about using \ncontraception during treatment with MVASI and for at least 6 months after the last dose of MVASI. \n \nTell your doctor straightaway if you are pregnant, become pregnant during treatment with this \nmedicine, or plan to become pregnant in the near future. \n \nYou must not breast-feed your baby during treatment with MVASI and for at least 6 months after the \nlast dose of MVASI, as this medicine may interfere with the growth and development of your baby. \n \nMVASI may impair female fertility. Please consult your doctor for more information. \n \nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nMVASI has not been shown to reduce your ability to drive or to use any tools or machines. However, \nsleepiness and fainting have been reported with MVASI use. If you experience symptoms that affect \nyour vision or concentration, or your ability to react, do not drive and use machines until symptoms \ndisappear. \n \nMVASI contains sodium \n \nMVASI 25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion (4 mL) \n \nThis medicine contains 4.7 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 4 mL vial. This \nis equivalent to 0.2% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \nMVASI 25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion (16 mL) \n \nThis medicine contains 18.8 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 16 mL vial. \nThis is equivalent to 0.9% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \n \n3. How to use MVASI \n \nDosage and frequency of administration \n \nThe dose of MVASI needed depends on your body weight and the kind of cancer to be treated. The \nrecommended dose is 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg per kilogram of your body weight. Your doctor \nwill prescribe a dose of MVASI that is right for you. You will be treated with MVASI once every 2 or \n3 weeks. The number of infusions that you receive will depend on how you are responding to \ntreatment; you should continue to receive this medicine until MVASI fails to stop your tumour \ngrowing. Your doctor will discuss this with you. \n \nMethod and route of administration \n \nMVASI is a concentrate for solution for infusion. Depending on the dose prescribed for you, some or \nall of the contents of the MVASI vial will be diluted with sodium chloride solution before use. A \ndoctor or nurse will give you this diluted MVASI solution by intravenous infusion (a drip into your \nvein). The first infusion will be given to you over 90 minutes. If this is well-tolerated the second \ninfusion may be given over 60 minutes. Later infusions may be given to you over 30 minutes. \n \n\n\n\n67 \n\nThe administration of MVASI should be temporarily discontinued \n \n• if you develop severe high blood pressure requiring treatment with blood pressure medicines, \n• if you have problems with wound healing following surgery, \n• if you undergo surgery. \n \nThe administration of MVASI should be permanently discontinued if you develop \n \n• severe high blood pressure which cannot be controlled by blood pressure medicines; or a sudden \n\nsevere rise in blood pressure, \n• presence of protein in your urine accompanied by swelling of your body, \n• a hole in your gut wall, \n• an abnormal tube-like connection or passage between the windpipe and the gullet, between \n\ninternal organs and skin, between the vagina and any parts of the gut or between other tissues \nthat are not normally connected (fistula), and are judged by your doctor to be severe, \n\n• serious infections of the skin or deeper layers under the skin, \n• a blood clot in your arteries, \n• a blood clot in the blood vessels of your lungs, \n• any severe bleeding. \n \nIf too much MVASI is given \n \n• you may develop a severe migraine. If this happens you should talk to your doctor, pharmacist \n\nor nurse immediately. \n \nIf a dose of MVASI is missed \n \n• your doctor will decide when you should be given your next dose of MVASI. You should \n\ndiscuss this with your doctor. \n \nIf you stop treatment with MVASI \n \nStopping your treatment with MVASI may stop the effect on tumour growth. Do not stop treatment \nwith MVASI unless you have discussed this with your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \nThe side effects listed below were seen when MVASI was given together with chemotherapy.

If you are considering having children \nyou should discuss this with your doctor before your treatment starts. \n \nMVASI has been developed and made to treat cancer by injecting it into the bloodstream. It has not \nbeen developed or made for injection into the eye. It is therefore not authorised to be used in this way. \nWhen bevacizumab is injected directly into the eye (unapproved use), the following side effects may \noccur: \n \n• Infection or inflammation of the eye globe, \n• Redness of the eye, small particles or spots in your vision (floaters), eye pain, \n• Seeing flashes of light with floaters, progressing to a loss of some of your vision, \n• Increased eye pressure, \n• Bleeding in the eye. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store MVASI \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the outer carton and on the vial label \nafter the abbreviation EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). \nDo not freeze. \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nInfusion solutions should be used immediately after dilution. If not used immediately, in-use storage \ntimes and conditions are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours \nat 2°C to 8°C, unless the infusion solutions have been prepared in a sterile environment.
