QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nVihuma 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 250 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), simoctocog alfa.  \nVihuma 250 IU contains approximately 100 IU/ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), \nsimoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nVihuma 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 500 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), simoctocog alfa.  \nVihuma 500 IU contains approximately 200 IU/ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), \nsimoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nVihuma 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 1000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), simoctocog alfa.  \nVihuma 1000 IU contains approximately 400 IU/ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), \nsimoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nVihuma 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 2000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), simoctocog alfa.  \nVihuma 2000 IU contains approximately 800 IU/ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), \nsimoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nVihuma 2500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 2500 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), simoctocog alfa.  \nVihuma 2500 IU contains approximately 1000 IU/ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), \nsimoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nVihuma 3000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 3000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), simoctocog alfa.  \nVihuma 3000 IU contains approximately 1200 IU/ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), \nsimoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nVihuma 4000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 4000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), simoctocog alfa.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\nVihuma 4000 IU contains approximately 1600 IU/ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), \nsimoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nThe potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic assay. The specific \nactivity of Vihuma is approximately 9500 IU/mg protein. \n \nSimoctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 1440 amino \nacids. The amino acid sequence is comparable to the 90 + 80 kDa form of human plasma factor VIII \n(i.e. B-domain deleted). Vihuma is produced by recombinant DNA technology in genetically modified \nhuman embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells. No animal or human derived materials are added during \nthe manufacturing process or to the final medicinal product. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \n7.35 mg sodium per ml reconstituted solution (18.4 mg sodium per vial). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection.  \n \nPowder: white to off-white friable powder. \n \nSolvent: a clear, colourless liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). \nVihuma can be used for all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. \n \nTreatment monitoring \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the \ndose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their \nresponse to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight \nmay require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical \ninterventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation \nanalysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable. \n \nWhen using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining \nfactor VIII activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can be significantly \naffected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. Also there can \nbe significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aPTT-based one stage clotting assay \nand the chromogenic assay according to Ph. Eur. This is of importance particularly when changing the \nlaboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. \n \nPosology \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nThe number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which is \nrelated to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in \nplasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in \nInternational Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to the quantity of factor VIII in one ml \nof normal human plasma.  \n \nOn-demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that \n1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by \napproximately 2% of normal activity or 2 IU/dl. The required dose is determined using the following \nformula:  \n \n\nRequired units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) (IU/dl) x 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dl) \n \n\nExpected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =   2 x administered IU \n   body weight (kg) \n\n \nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the \nclinical effectiveness in the individual case. \n \nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table can be \nused to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery. \n \n\nDegree of haemorrhage/  \nType of surgical procedure  \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (%) (IU/dL) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/ \nDuration of therapy (days)  \n\nHaemorrhage   \n\nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding  \n\n20–40 Repeat every 12 to 24 hours. At least \n1 day, until the bleeding episode as \nindicated by pain is resolved or healing \nis achieved.  \n\nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma  \n\n30–60 Repeat infusion every 12 to 24 hours \nfor 3 to 4 days or more until pain and \nacute disability are resolved.  \n\nLife threatening haemorrhages  60–100 Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours \nuntil threat is resolved.  \n\nSurgery   \n\nMinor surgery  \nincluding tooth extraction  \n\n30–60 Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until \nhealing is achieved.  \n\nMajor surgery  80–100 \n(pre- and \n\npostoperative) \n\nRepeat infusion every 8–24 hours until \nadequate wound healing, then therapy \nfor at least another 7 days to maintain a \nfactor VIII activity of 30% to \n60% (IU/dL).  \n\n \nProphylaxis \nFor long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are \n20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. The regimen may be adjusted \nbased on patient response. \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be \nnecessary. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe posology is the same in adults and children, however, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may \nbe necessary for children. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. \n \nMethod of administration \nVihuma is for intravenous use. \nIt is recommended that not more than 4 ml per minute be administered. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAs with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Vihuma \ncontains traces of human host cell proteins other than factor VIII. If symptoms of hypersensitivity \noccur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact \ntheir physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including \nhives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per \nml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of \nthe disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure \ndays. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.  \n \nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.  \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of \ninsufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.  \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n \nCardiovascular events  \nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FVIII may increase the \ncardiovascular risk. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nCatheter-related complications \nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Vihuma is administered to a patient, the name and \nbatch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch \nof the medicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. \n \nExcipient related considerations (sodium content) \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial. \nHowever depending on the body weight and posology, the patient could receive more than one vial. \nThis should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with Vihuma. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Vihuma.  \nBased on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII \nduring pregnancy and breast feeding is not available. Therefore, Vihuma should be used during \npregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated. There are no fertility data available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVihuma has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angiooedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, rash, restlessness, \ntachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, urticaria, including generalised urticaria, vomiting, \nwheezing) have rarely been observed with FVIII preparations and may in some cases progress to \nsevere anaphylaxis (including shock).  \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with Vihuma. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as \nan insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \ncentre be contacted. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nDuring clinical studies with Vihuma in previously treated paediatric (2 to 11 years, n = 58), adolescent \n(12 to 17 years, n = 3) and adult patients (n = 129) with severe haemophilia A, a total of 12 adverse \ndrug reactions (ADRs) (8 in adults, 4 in children) were reported in 8 patients (4 adults, 4 children).  \n \nTable 1 presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and Preferred \nTerm Level). \nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nTable 1.

The sample \nwas tested by the central laboratory at eight dilutions. The result was positive only at dilution factor 1 \nand the antibody titre was very low. Inhibitory activity, as measured by the modified Bethesda assay, \nwas not detected in this patient. Clinical efficacy and in-vivo recovery of Vihuma was not affected in \nthis patient. \n \nPaediatric population \nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are assumed to be the same as in adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo cases of overdose have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihaemorrhagics: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02. \n \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/document_listing/document_listing_000134.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac0580022c59\n\n\n8 \n\nfactor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a \ncofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. \nActivated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin \nand a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due \nto decreased levels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal \norgans, either spontaneously or as results of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the \nplasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby temporarily enabling a correction of the factor VIII \ndeficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. \n \nThe immunogenicity of Vihuma was evaluated in clinical trials in 190 previously treated patients with \nsevere haemophilia A (129 adult and 61 paediatric patients). None of the patients developed inhibitors. \n \nAdult and adolescent population 12 - 65 years of age \n \nProphylaxis: In a clinical study in 32 adult patients with severe haemophilia A, the median \nconsumption of Vihuma for prophylaxis was 468.7 IU/kg/month. \n \nTreatment of bleeding: The median dose to treat break-through bleeding episodes was 33.0 IU/kg in \nthese patients who were on prophylaxis. In another clinical study, 22 adult patients were treated on \ndemand.  In total 986 bleeding episodes were treated with a median dose of 30.9 IU/kg. In general, \nminor bleeds required slightly lower, and more severe bleeds required up to three-fold higher median \ndoses. \n \nIndividualised prophylaxis: Individualised PK-based prophylaxis was evaluated in 66 adult PTPs with \nsevere haemophilia A. Following a 1-3 month standard prophylaxis phase (every other day or 3 times \nweekly dosing), 44 (67%) patients were switched to a dosing regimen based on their PK assessment, \nand 40 completed the 6 months of prophylaxis according to the assigned dosing and treatment scheme. \nOf these patients, 34 (85%) were treated twice weekly or less. 33 (82.5%) patients did not experience \nany bleeds and 36 (90.0%) patients had no spontaneous bleeds. The mean ± SD annualised bleeding \nrate was 1.2 ± 3.9 and the mean ± SD dose were 52.2 ± 12.2 IU/kg per injection and 99.7 ± 25.6 \nIU/kg per week. \nOf note, annualised bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and \nbetween different clinical studies. \n \nPaediatric population \nData have been obtained in 29 previously treated children between 2 and 5 years of age, 31 children \nbetween 6 and 12 years of age and one adolescent of 14 years. The median dose per prophylactic \ninfusion was 37.8 IU/kg. Twenty patients used median doses of more than 45 IU/kg. The median \nconsumption of Vihuma for prophylaxis per month was 521.9 IU/kg. A higher median dose of Vihuma \nwas required to treat bleedings in children (43.9 IU/kg) than in adults (33.0 IU/kg), and a higher \nmedian dose was required to treat moderate to major than minor bleedings (78.2 IU/kg vs. 41.7 IU/kg). \nYounger children in general required higher median doses (6-12 years: 43.9 IU/kg; 2-5 years: \n52.6 IU/kg). These data were corroborated by a long-term follow-up of 49 of these children who were \ntreated for an additional median period of approximately 30 months (range from 9.5 to 52 months); \nduring this period 45% of children had no spontaneous bleeds \n \nA prospective open-label clinical study in PUPs with severe haemophilia A (<1% FVIII:C) is ongoing. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nVihuma in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of haemophilia A (congenital \nFactor VIII deficiency) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAdult population  \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 2.

Toxicology studies showed that local intravenous administration and systemic exposure \nwere well tolerated in laboratory animals (rats and cynomolgus monkeys). \n \nSpecific studies with long-term repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity, chronic toxicity, \nand carcinogenicity were not performed with Vihuma due to the immune response to heterologous \nproteins in all non-human mammalian species. \n \nNo studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of Vihuma.  \nEx vivo evaluations using a commercial assay kit to quantify T cell response to protein therapeutics \nindicate a low risk of immunogenicity. \n \n \n6.

If \nnot used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the \nuser. \nKeep the reconstituted solution at room temperature. Do not refrigerate after reconstitution. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C).  \nDo not freeze.  \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.  \n \nFor storage at room temperature and storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, \nsee section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nEach pack contains: \n\n- 1 powder vial with 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 2500, 3000 or 4000 IU simoctocog alfa in a type 1 \nglass vial, closed with coated bromobutyl stopper and sealed with aluminium flip-off cap \n\n- Solvent: 2.5 ml water for injections in a pre-filled borosilicate glass syringe  \n- 1 sterile vial adapter for reconstitution with 1 butterfly needle and 2 alcohol swabs  \n\n \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nThe powder should only be reconstituted with the supplied solvent (2.5 ml water for injections) using \nthe supplied injection set. The vial should be gently rotated until all powder is dissolved. After \nreconstitution, the solution should be drawn back into the syringe.  \n \nThe reconstituted medicinal product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and \ndiscoloration prior to administration. The reconstituted medicinal product is a clear, colourless \nsolution, free from foreign particles and has a pH of 6.5 to 7.5.  Do not use solutions that are cloudy or \nhave deposits. \n \nInstructions for preparation and administration \n \n\n1. Allow the solvent syringe (water for injections) and the powder in the closed vial to reach \nroom temperature. You can do this by holding them in your hands until they feel as warm as \nyour hands. Do not use any other way to heat the vial and pre-filled syringe. This temperature \nshould be maintained during reconstitution. \n\n2. Remove the plastic flip-top cap from the powder vial to expose the central portions of the \nrubber stopper. Do not remove the gray stopper or metal ring around the top of the vial.  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n3. Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. Allow the alcohol to dry.  \n4. Peel back the paper cover from the vial adapter package. Do not remove the adapter from the \n\npackage.  \n\n  \n5. Place the powder vial on an even surface and hold it. Take the adapter package and place the \n\nvial adapter over the centre of the rubber stopper of the powder vial. Press down firmly the \nadapter package until the adapter spike penetrates the rubber stopper. The adapter snaps to the \nvial when done. \n\n \n6. Peel back the paper cover from the pre-filled syringe package. Hold the plunger rod at the end \n\nand do not touch the shaft. Attach the threaded end of the plunger rod to the solvent syringe \nplunger. Turn the plunger rod clockwise until a slight resistance is felt. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n7. Break off the tamper-proof plastic tip from the solvent syringe by snapping the perforation of \n\nthe cap. Do not touch the inside of the cap or the syringe tip. In case the solution is not used \nimmediately close the filled syringe with the tamper-proof plastic tip for storage. \n\n \n8. Remove the adapter packaging and discard. \n9. Firmly connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by turning clockwise until resistance is \n\nfelt. \n\n \n10. Slowly inject all solvent into the powder vial by pressing down the plunger rod. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n11. Without removing the syringe, gently move or swirl the vial in circles a few times to dissolve \n\nthe powder. Do not shake. Wait until all the powder dissolves completely. \n12. Visually inspect the final solution for particles before administration. The solution should be \n\nclear and colourless, practically free from visible particles. Do not use solutions that are \ncloudy or have deposits. \n\n13. Turn the vial attached to the syringe upside down, and slowly draw the final solution into the \nsyringe. Make sure that the entire content of the vial is transferred to the syringe.  \n\n \n14. Detach the filled syringe from the vial adapter by turning counter clockwise and discard the \n\nempty vial. \n15. The solution is now prepared for immediate use. Do not refrigerate. \n16. Clean the chosen injection site with one of the provided alcohol swabs. \n17. Attach the provided infusion set to the syringe. \n\nInsert the needle of the infusion set into the chosen vein. If you have used a tourniquet to make \nthe vein easier to see, this tourniquet should be released before you start injecting the solution. \nNo blood must flow into the syringe due to the risk of formation of fibrin clots. \n\n18. Inject the solution into the vein at a slow speed, not faster than 4 ml per minute. \n \nIf you use more than one vial of powder for one treatment, you may use the same injection needle \nagain. The vial adapter and the syringe are for single use only. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.  \n \n \n7.

This will allow quick identification of new safety \ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to \nreport side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Vihuma is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Vihuma \n3. How to use Vihuma \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Vihuma  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Vihuma is and what it is used for \n \nVihuma contains the active substance human recombinant coagulation factor VIII (simoctocog alfa). \nFactor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleeding. In patients with haemophilia A \n(inborn factor VIII deficiency), factor VIII is missing or not working properly. \nVihuma replaces the missing factor VIII and is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients \nwith haemophilia A and can be used for all age groups.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Vihuma \n \nDo not use Vihuma: \n\n• if you are allergic to the active substance simoctocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of \nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n\nIf you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Vihuma. \n \nThere is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic \nreaction) to Vihuma. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions as they are listed in \nsection 4 “Allergic reactions”.  \nIf any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \nThe formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with \nall Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working \nproperly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If \nyou or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with Vihuma, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nCardiovascular events  \nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FVIII may increase the \ncardiovascular risk. \n \nCatheter-related complications \nIf you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Vihuma is administered, the name and batch number \nof the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between you and the batch of the medicinal \nproduct. \n \n \nOther medicines and Vihuma \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nVihuma has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines.  \n \nVihuma contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial. \nHowever depending on your body weight and your dose of Vihuma, you could receive more than one \nvial. This should be taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How to use Vihuma \n \nTreatment with Vihuma will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia A. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you. Check with \nyour doctor or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nVihuma is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or a nurse who are experienced \nin the care of patients with haemophilia A. You or someone else might also give your Vihuma \ninjection, but only after receiving adequate training. \n \nYour doctor will calculate your dose of Vihuma (in international units = IU) depending on your \ncondition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. How \noften you need an injection will depend on how well Vihuma is working for you. Usually, treatment \nfor haemophilia A is a life-long treatment. \n \nPrevention of bleeding \nThe usual dose of Vihuma is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, given every 2 to 3 days. However, in \nsome cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may be necessary. \n \nTreatment of bleeding \nThe dose of Vihuma is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be \nachieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding.  \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \nIf you have the impression that the effect of Vihuma is insufficient, talk to your doctor. Your doctor \nwill perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII levels. This \nis particularly important if you are having major surgery. \n \nPatients developing factor VIII inhibitors \nIf your plasma factor VIII fails to reach expected levels with Vihuma, or if bleeding is not adequately \ncontrolled, it could be due to the development of factor VIII inhibitors. This will be checked by your \ndoctor. You might need a higher dose of Vihuma or a different product to control bleedings. Do not \nincrease the total dose of Vihuma to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor. \n \nUse in children \nThe way Vihuma is used in children does not differ from the way it is used in adults. Because factor \nVIII products may have to be given more often in children, a central venous access device (CVAD, an \nexternal connector allowing access to the bloodstream through a catheter without injection through the \nskin) may need to be fitted. \n \nIf you use more Vihuma than you should \nNo symptoms of overdose have been reported. If you have injected more Vihuma than you should, \nplease inform your doctor. \n \nIf you forget to use Vihuma \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next dose immediately \nand continue as advised by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you stop using Vihuma \nDo not stop using Vihuma without consulting your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions \nYou should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions. If severe, sudden allergic reactions \n(anaphylactic) occur (very rare, up to 1 in 10,000), the injection must be stopped immediately. You \nmust contact your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following symptoms: \n \n- rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, \n- swelling of lips and tongue, \n- difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, \n- general feeling of being unwell, \n- dizziness and loss of consciousness. \n \nThese symptoms can be early symptoms of an anaphylactic shock.  If any of these symptoms occur, \nstop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe symptoms require prompt emergency \ntreatment. \n \nUncommon side effects may affect up to 1 in 100 people \nTingling or numbness (paraesthesia), headache, injection site inflammation, injection site pain, back \npain, vertigo, dry mouth, dizziness, a vague feeling of bodily discomfort, shortness of breath.  \n \nCommon side effects may affect up to 1 in 10 people \nHypersensitivity, fever. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nVery common side effects may affect more than 1 in 10 people \nFactor VIII inhibitors in previously untreated patients. \n \nFor children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) \nmay form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients); however patients who have received previous \ntreatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 \npatients). If this happens you or your child´s medicines may stop working properly and you or your \nchild may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n \nSide effects related to central venous access devices (CVAD): \nCatheter-related infection, general (systemic) infection and local blood clot at the catheter site. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Vihuma \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label after EXP. The expiry date \nrefers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect \nfrom light. \n \nBefore the Vihuma powder is reconstituted it may be kept at room temperature (up to 25°C) for a single \nperiod not exceeding 1 month. Please record the date from when you start to store Vihuma at room \ntemperature on the product carton. Do not store Vihuma in the refrigerator again after it has been stored \nat room temperature. \nUse the reconstituted solution immediately after reconstitution. \n \nDo not use the product in case you notice visible signs of deterioration of the tamper proof of \npackaging especially of the syringe and/or the vial. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

The following table can be \nused to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery. \n \n\nDegree of haemorrhage/  \nType of surgical procedure  \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (%) (IU/dL) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/ \nDuration of therapy (days)  \n\nHaemorrhage   \n\nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding  \n\n20–40 Repeat every 12 to 24 hours. At least 1 \nday, until the bleeding episode as \nindicated by pain is resolved or healing \nis achieved.  \n\nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma  \n\n30–60 Repeat infusion every 12 to 24 hours \nfor 3 to 4 days or more until pain and \nacute disability are resolved.  \n\nLife threatening haemorrhages  60–100 Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours \nuntil threat is resolved.  \n\nSurgery   \n\nMinor surgery  \nincluding tooth extraction  \n\n30–60 Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until \nhealing is achieved.  \n\nMajor surgery  80–100 \n(pre- and \n\npostoperative) \n\nRepeat infusion every 8–24 hours until \nadequate wound healing, then therapy \nfor at least another 7 days to maintain a \nFactor VIII activity of 30% to \n60% (IU/dL).  \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n50 \n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRATION \n \n\n1. Allow the solvent syringe (water for injections) and the powder in the closed vial to reach \nroom temperature. You can do this by holding them in your hands until they feel as warm as \nyour hands. Do not use any other way to heat the vial and pre-filled syringe. This temperature \nshould be maintained during reconstitution. \n\n2. Remove the plastic flip-top cap from the powder vial to expose the central portions of the \nrubber stopper. Do not remove the gray stopper or metal ring around the top of the vial.  \n\n \n3. Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. Allow the alcohol to dry.  \n4. Peel back the paper cover from the vial adapter package. Do not remove the adapter from the \n\npackage.  \n\n  \n5. Place the powder vial on an even surface and hold it. Take the adapter package and place the \n\nvial adapter over the centre of the rubber stopper of the powder vial. Press down firmly the \nadapter package until the adapter spike penetrates the rubber stopper. The adapter snaps to the \nvial when done. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n6. Peel back the paper cover from the pre-filled syringe package. Hold the plunger rod at the end \n\nand do not touch the shaft. Attach the threaded end of the plunger rod to the solvent syringe \nplunger. Turn the plunger rod clockwise until a slight resistance is felt. \n\n \n7. Break off the tamper-proof plastic tip from the solvent syringe by snapping the perforation of \n\nthe cap. Do not touch the inside of the cap or the syringe tip. In case the solution is not used \nimmediately close the filled syringe with the tamper-proof plastic tip for storage. \n\n \n8. Remove the adapter packaging and discard. \n9. Firmly connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by turning clockwise until resistance is \n\nfelt. \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n10. Slowly inject all solvent into the powder vial by pressing down the plunger rod. \n\n \n11. Without removing the syringe, gently move or swirl the vial in circles a few times to dissolve \n\nthe powder. Do not shake. Wait until all the powder dissolves completely. \n12. Visually inspect the final solution for particles before administration. The solution should be \n\nclear and colourless, practically free from visible particles. Do not use solutions that are \ncloudy or have deposits. \n\n13. Turn the vial attached to the syringe upside down, and slowly draw the final solution into the \nsyringe. Make sure that the entire content of the vial is transferred to the syringe.  \n\n \n14. Detach the filled syringe from the vial adapter by turning counter clockwise and discard the \n\nempty vial. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n15. The solution is now prepared for immediate use. Do not refrigerate. \n16. Clean the chosen injection site with one of the provided alcohol swabs. \n17. Attach the provided infusion set to the syringe. \n\nInsert the needle of the infusion set into the chosen vein. If you have used a tourniquet to make \nthe vein easier to see, this tourniquet should be released before you start injecting the solution. \nNo blood must flow into the syringe due to the risk of formation of fibrin clots. \n\n18. Inject the solution into the vein at a slow speed, not faster than 4 ml per minute. \n \nIf you use more than one vial of powder for one treatment, you may use the same injection needle \nagain. The vial adapter and the syringe are for single use only. \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
