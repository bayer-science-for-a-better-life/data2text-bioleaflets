NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nProtopy 0.03% ointment \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 g of Protopy 0.03% ointment contains 0.3 mg of tacrolimus as tacrolimus monohydrate (0.03%). \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOintment \n \nA white to slightly yellowish ointment. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are not adequately responsive to or \nare intolerant of conventional therapies such as topical corticosteroids. Treatment of moderate to \nsevere atopic dermatitis in children (2 years of age and above) who failed to respond adequately to \nconventional therapies such as topical corticosteroids. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nProtopy should be initiated by physicians with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of atopic \ndermatitis. \n \nTreatment should be intermittent and not continuous.  \n \nProtopy ointment should be applied as a thin layer to affected areas of the skin. Protopy ointment may \nbe used on any part of the body, including face, neck and flexure areas, except on mucous membranes. \nProtopy ointment should not be applied under occlusion (see section 4.4).  \n \nEach affected region of the skin should be treated with Protopy until clearance occurs and then \ntreatment should be discontinued. Generally, improvement is seen within one week of starting \ntreatment. If no signs of improvement are seen after two weeks of treatment, further treatment options \nshould be considered. Protopy can be used for short term and intermittent long term treatment. At the \nfirst signs of recurrence (flares) of the disease symptoms, treatment should be re-initiated. \n \nProtopy is not recommended for use in children below age of 2 years until further data are available. \n \nUse in children (2 years of age and above) \nTreatment should be started twice a day for up to three weeks. Afterwards the frequency of application \nshould be reduced to once a day until clearance of the lesion (see section 4.4). \n \nUse in adults (16 years of age and above) \nProtopy is available in two strengths, Protopy 0.03% and Protopy 0.1% ointment. Treatment should be \nstarted with Protopy 0.1% twice a day and treatment should be continued until clearance of the lesion. \nIf symptoms recur, twice daily treatment with Protopy 0.1% should be restarted. An attempt should be \nmade to reduce the frequency of application or to use the lower strength Protopy 0.03% ointment if the \nclinical condition allows. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n3 \n\n \nUse in elderly (65 years of age and above) \nSpecific studies have not been conducted in elderly patients. However, the clinical experience \navailable in this patient population has not shown the necessity for any dosage adjustment. \n \nAs clinical efficacy studies were performed with abrupt cessation of treatment, no information is \navailable on whether tapering of the dosage would reduce recurrence rate. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to macrolides in general, to tacrolimus or to any of the excipients. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nProtopy should not be used in patients with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies or in patients \non therapy that cause immunosuppression. \n \nThe effect of treatment with Protopy ointment on the developing immune system of children, \nespecially the young, has not yet been established and this should be taken into account when \nprescribing to this age group (see section 4.1). \n \nExposure of the skin to sunlight should be minimised and the use of ultraviolet (UV) light from a \nsolarium, therapy with UVB or UVA in combination with psoralens (PUVA) should be avoided \nduring use of Protopy ointment (see section 5.3). Physicians should advise patients on appropriate sun \nprotection methods, such as minimisation of the time in the sun, use of a sunscreen product and \ncovering of the skin with appropriate clothing. Protopy ointment should not be applied to lesions that \nare considered to be potentially malignant or pre-malignant. \n \nEmollients should not be applied to the same area within 2 hours of applying Protopy ointment. \nConcomitant use of other topical preparations has not been assessed. There is no experience with \nconcomitant use of systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.  \n \nProtopy ointment has not been evaluated for its efficacy and safety in the treatment of clinically \ninfected atopic dermatitis. Before commencing treatment with Protopy ointment, clinical infections at \ntreatment sites should be cleared. Patients with atopic dermatitis are predisposed to superficial skin \ninfections. Treatment with Protopy may be associated with an increased risk of herpes viral infections \n(herpes simplex dermatitis [eczema herpeticum], herpes simplex [cold sores], Kaposi\u2019s varicelliform \neruption). In the presence of these infections, the balance of risks and benefits associated with Protopy \nuse should be evaluated. \nThe potential for local immunosuppression (possibly resulting in infections or cutaneous \nmalignancies) in the long term (i.e. over a period of years) is unknown (see section 5.1). \n \nProtopy contains the active substance tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor. In transplant patients, \nprolonged systemic exposure to intense immunosuppression following systemic administration of \ncalcineurin inhibitors has been associated with an increased risk of developing lymphomas and skin \nmalignancies. In patients using tacrolimus ointment, cases of malignancies, including cutaneous and \nother types of lymphoma, and skin cancers have been reported (see section 4.8). Patients with atopic \ndermatitis treated with Protopy have not been found to have significant systemic tacrolimus levels.  \n \nLymphadenopathy was uncommonly (0.8%) reported in clinical trials. The majority of these cases \nrelated to infections (skin, respiratory tract, tooth) and resolved with appropriate antibiotic therapy. \nTransplant patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens (e.g. systemic tacrolimus) are at increased \nrisk for developing lymphoma; therefore patients who receive Protopy and who develop \nlymphadenopathy should be monitored to ensure that the lymphadenopathy resolves. \nLymphadenopathy present at initiation of therapy should be investigated and kept under review. In \ncase of persistent lymphadenopathy, the aetiology of the lymphadenopathy should be investigated. In \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n4 \n\nthe absence of a clear aetiology for the lymphadenopathy or in the presence of acute infectious \nmononucleosis, discontinuation of Protopy should be considered. \n \nCare should be taken to avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. If accidentally applied to \nthese areas, the ointment should be thoroughly wiped off and/or rinsed off with water.  \nThe use of Protopy ointment under occlusion has not been studied in patients. Occlusive dressings are \nnot recommended.  \nAs with any topical medicinal product, patients should wash their hands after application if the hands \nare not intended for treatment.  \n \nTacrolimus is extensively metabolised in the liver and although blood concentrations are low \nfollowing topical therapy, the ointment should be used with caution in patients with hepatic failure \n(see section 5.2).  \n \nThe use of Protopy ointment in patients with genetic epidermal barrier defects such as Netherton\u2019s \nsyndrome is not recommended due to the potential for permanently increased systemic absorption of \ntacrolimus. The safety of Protopy ointment has not been established in patients with generalised \nerythroderma. \n \nCare should be exercised if applying Protopy to patients with extensive skin involvement over an \nextended period of time, especially in children (see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFormal topical drug interaction studies with tacrolimus ointment have not been conducted. \n \nTacrolimus is not metabolised in human skin, indicating that there is no potential for percutaneous \ninteractions that could affect the metabolism of tacrolimus. \n \nSystemically available tacrolimus is metabolised via the hepatic Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). \nSystemic exposure from topical application of tacrolimus ointment is low (< 1.0 ng/ml) and is unlikely \nto be affected by concomitant use of substances known to be inhibitors of CYP3A4. However, the \npossibility of interactions cannot be ruled out and the concomitant systemic administration of known \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole and diltiazem) in patients with \nwidespread and/or erythrodermic disease should be done with caution. \n \nA potential interaction between vaccination and application of Protopy ointment has not been \ninvestigated. Because of the potential risk of vaccination failure, vaccination should be administered \nprior to commencement of treatment, or during a treatment-free interval with a period of 14 days \nbetween the last application of Protopy and the vaccination. In case of live attenuated vaccination, this \nperiod should be extended to 28 days or the use of alternative vaccines should be considered. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of tacrolimus ointment in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity following systemic administration (see section 5.3). The potential \nrisk for humans is unknown. \n \nProtopy ointment should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nHuman data demonstrate that, after systemic administration, tacrolimus is excreted into breast milk. \nAlthough clinical data have shown that systemic exposure from application of tacrolimus ointment is \nlow, breast-feeding during treatment with Protopy ointment is not recommended. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n5 \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Protopy \nointment is administered topically and is unlikely to have an effect on the ability to drive or use \nmachines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn clinical studies approximately 50% of patients experienced some type of skin irritation adverse \nreaction at the site of application. Burning sensation and pruritus were very common, usually mild to \nmoderate in severity and tended to resolve within one week of starting treatment. Erythema was a \ncommon skin irritation adverse reaction. Sensation of warmth, pain, paraesthesia and rash at the site of \napplication were also commonly observed. Alcohol intolerance (facial flushing or skin irritation after \nconsumption of an alcoholic beverage) was common. \nPatients may be at an increased risk of folliculitis, acne and herpes viral infections. \n \nAdverse reactions with suspected relationship to treatment are listed below by system organ class. \nFrequencies are defined as very common (> 1/10), common (> 1/100, < 1/10) and uncommon  \n(> 1/1,000, < 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Application site burning, application site pruritus \nCommon: Application site warmth, application site erythema, application site pain, \n\napplication site irritation, application site paraesthesia, application site rash \n \nInfections and infestations \nCommon: Herpes viral infections (herpes simplex dermatitis [eczema herpeticum], herpes \n\nsimplex [cold sores], Kaposi\u2019s varicelliform eruption) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Folliculitis, pruritus \nUncommon: Acne \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: Paraesthesias and dysaesthesias (hyperaesthesia, burning sensation) \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nCommon: Alcohol intolerance (facial flushing or skin irritation after consumption of an \n\nalcoholic beverage) \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during post-marketing experience: \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rosacea \n \nPost-marketing: cases of malignancies, including cutaneous and other types of lymphoma, and skin \ncancers, have been reported in patients using tacrolimus ointment (see section 4.4).  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdosage following topical administration is unlikely.  \nIf ingested, general supportive measures may be appropriate. These may include monitoring of vital \nsigns and observation of clinical status. Due to the nature of the ointment vehicle, induction of \nvomiting or gastric lavage is not recommended. \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n6 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other dermatologicals, ATC code: D11AX14 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nThe mechanism of action of tacrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not fully understood. While the \nfollowing have been observed, the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not \nknown. \nVia its binding to a specific cytoplasmic immunophilin (FKBP12), tacrolimus inhibits calcium-\ndependent signal transduction pathways in T cells, thereby preventing the transcription and synthesis \nof IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5 and other cytokines such as GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. \nIn vitro, in Langerhans cells isolated from normal human skin, tacrolimus reduced the stimulatory \nactivity towards T cells. Tacrolimus has also been shown to inhibit the release of inflammatory \nmediators from skin mast cells, basophils and eosinophils. \nIn animals, tacrolimus ointment suppressed inflammatory reactions in experimental and spontaneous \ndermatitis models that resemble human atopic dermatitis. Tacrolimus ointment did not reduce skin \nthickness and did not cause skin atrophy in animals. \nIn patients with atopic dermatitis, improvement of skin lesions during treatment with tacrolimus \nointment was associated with reduced Fc receptor expression on Langerhans cells and a reduction of \ntheir hyperstimulatory activity towards T cells. Tacrolimus ointment does not affect collagen synthesis \nin humans.  \n \nResults from clinical studies in patients \nThe efficacy and safety of Protopy was assessed in more than 13,500 patients treated with tacrolimus \nointment in Phase I to Phase III clinical trials. Data from four major trials are presented here. \nIn a six-month multicentre double-blind randomised trial, 0.1% tacrolimus ointment was administered \ntwice-a-day to adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and compared to a topical \ncorticosteroid based regimen (0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate on trunk and extremities, 1% \nhydrocortisone acetate on face and neck). The primary endpoint was the response rate at month 3 \ndefined as the proportion of patients with at least 60% improvement in the mEASI (modified Eczema \nArea and Severity Index) between baseline and month 3. The response rate in the 0.1% tacrolimus \ngroup (71.6%) was significantly higher than that in the topical corticosteroid based treatment group \n(50.8%; p<0.001; Table 1). The response rates at month 6 were comparable to the 3-month results.  \n \nTable 1 Efficacy at month 3  \n Topical corticosteroid \n\nregimen\u00a7 \n(N=485) \n\nTacrolimus 0.1% \n(N=487) \n\nResponse rate of \u2265 60% \nimprovement in mEASI (Primary \nEndpoint)\u00a7\u00a7 \n\n50.8% 71.6% \n\nImprovement \u2265 90% in Physician\u2019s \nGlobal Evaluation \n\n28.5% 47.7% \n\n\u00a7 Topical corticosteroid regimen = 0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate on trunk and extremities, 1% \nhydrocortisone acetate on face and neck \n\u00a7\u00a7 higher values = greater improvement \n \nThe incidence and nature of most adverse events were similar in the two treatment groups. Skin \nburning, herpes simplex, alcohol intolerance (facial flushing or skin sensitivity after alcohol intake), \nskin tingling, hyperaesthesia, acne and fungal dermatitis occurred more often in the tacrolimus \ntreatment group. There were no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory values or vital signs in \neither treatment group throughout the study. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n7 \n\nIn the second trial, children aged from 2 to 15 years with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis received \ntwice daily treatment for three weeks of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment, 0.1% tacrolimus ointment or 1% \nhydrocortisone acetate ointment. The primary endpoint was the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of the \nmEASI as a percentage of baseline averaged over the treatment period. The results of this multicentre, \ndouble-blind, randomised trial showed that tacrolimus ointment, 0.03% and 0.1%, is significantly \nmore effective (p<0.001 for both) than 1% hydrocortisone acetate ointment (Table 2). \n \nTable 2 Efficacy at week 3  \n \n \n\nHydrocortisone \nacetate 1% \n(N=185) \n\nTacrolimus 0.03% \n(N=189) \n\nTacrolimus 0.1% \n(N=186) \n\nMedian mEASI as Percentage of \nBaseline mean AUC (Primary \nEndpoint)\u00a7 \n\n64.0% 44.8% 39.8% \n\nImprovement \u2265 90% in Physician\u2019s \nGlobal Evaluation \n\n15.7% 38.5% 48.4% \n\n\u00a7 lower values = greater improvement \n \nThe incidence of local skin burning was higher in the tacrolimus treatment groups than in the \nhydrocortisone group. Pruritus decreased over time in the tacrolimus groups but not in the \nhydrocortisone group. There were no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory values or vital signs \nin either treatment group throughout the clinical trial. \n  \nThe purpose of the third multicentre, double-blind, randomised study was the assessment of efficacy \nand safety of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment applied once or twice a day relative to twice daily \nadministration of 1% hydrocortisone acetate ointment in children with moderate to severe atopic \ndermatitis. Treatment duration was for up to three weeks. \n \nTable 3 Efficacy at week 3  \n \n \n\nHydrocortisone \nacetate 1% \nTwice daily \n(N=207) \n\nTacrolimus 0.03% \nOnce daily (N=207) \n\nTacrolimus 0.03% \nTwice daily (N=210) \n\nMedian mEASI Percentage \nDecrease (Primary Endpoint)\u00a7 \n\n47.2% 70.0% 78.7% \n\nImprovement \u2265 90% in \nPhysician\u2019s Global Evaluation  \n\n13.6% 27.8% 36.7% \n\n\u00a7 higher values = greater improvement \n \nThe primary endpoint was defined as the percentage decrease in mEASI from the baseline to end of \ntreatment. A statistically significant better improvement was shown for once daily and twice daily \n0.03% tacrolimus ointment compared to twice daily hydrocortisone acetate ointment (p<0.001 for \nboth). Twice daily treatment with 0.03% tacrolimus ointment was more effective than once daily \nadministration (Table 3). The incidence of local skin burning was higher in the tacrolimus treatment \ngroups than in the hydrocortisone group. There were no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory \nvalues or vital signs in either treatment group throughout the study. \n \nIn the fourth trial, approximately 800 patients (aged \u2265 2 years) received 0.1% tacrolimus ointment \nintermittently or continuously in an open-label, long-term safety study for up to four years, with 300 \npatients receiving treatment for at least three years and 79 patients receiving treatment for a minimum \nof 42 months. Based on changes from baseline in EASI score and body surface area affected, patients \nregardless of age had improvement in their atopic dermatitis at all subsequent time points. In addition, \nthere was no evidence of loss of efficacy throughout the duration of the clinical trial. The overall \nincidence of adverse events tended to decrease as the study progressed for all patients independent of \nage. The three most common adverse events reported were flu-like symptoms (cold, common cold, \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n8 \n\ninfluenza, upper respiratory infection, etc.), pruritus and skin burning. No adverse events previously \nunreported in shorter duration and/or previous studies were observed in this long-term study. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nClinical data have shown that tacrolimus concentrations in systemic circulation after topical \nadministration are low and, when measurable, transient. \n \nAbsorption \nData from healthy human subjects indicate that there is little or no systemic exposure to tacrolimus \nfollowing single or repeated topical application of tacrolimus ointment. \nMost atopic dermatitis patients (adults and children) treated with single or repeated application of \ntacrolimus ointment (0.03 - 0.1%), and infants from age of 5 months treated with tacrolimus ointment \n(0.03%) had blood concentrations < 1.0 ng/ml. When observed, blood concentrations exceeding \n1.0 ng/ml were transient. Systemic exposure increases with increasing treatment areas. However, both \nthe extent and the rate of topical absorption of tacrolimus decrease as the skin heals. In both adults and \nchildren with an average of 50% body surface area treated, systemic exposure (i.e. AUC) of tacrolimus \nfrom Protopy is approximately 30-fold less than that seen with oral immunosuppressive doses in \nkidney and liver transplant patients. The lowest tacrolimus blood concentration at which systemic \neffects can be observed is not known.  \nThere was no evidence of systemic accumulation of tacrolimus in patients (adults and children) treated \nfor prolonged periods (up to one year) with tacrolimus ointment.  \n \nDistribution \nAs systemic exposure is low with tacrolimus ointment, the high binding of tacrolimus (> 98.8%) to \nplasma proteins is considered not to be clinically relevant. \nFollowing topical application of tacrolimus ointment, tacrolimus is selectively delivered to the skin \nwith minimal diffusion into the systemic circulation. \n \nMetabolism \nMetabolism of tacrolimus by human skin was not detectable. Systemically available tacrolimus is \nextensively metabolised in the liver via CYP3A4. \n \nElimination \nWhen administered intravenously, tacrolimus has been shown to have a low clearance rate. The \naverage total body clearance is approximately 2.25 l/h. The hepatic clearance of systemically available \ntacrolimus could be reduced in subjects with severe hepatic impairment, or in subjects who are co-\ntreated with drugs that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. \nFollowing repeated topical application of the ointment the average half-life of tacrolimus was \nestimated to be 75 hours for adults and 65 hours for children. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated dose toxicity and local tolerance \nRepeated topical administration of tacrolimus ointment or the ointment vehicle to rats, rabbits and \nmicropigs was associated with slight dermal changes such as erythema, oedema and papules.  \nLong-term topical treatment of rats with tacrolimus led to systemic toxicity including alterations of \nkidneys, pancreas, eyes and nervous system. The changes were caused by high systemic exposure of \nrodents resulting from high transdermal absorption of tacrolimus. Slightly lower body weight gain in \nfemales was the only systemic change observed in micropigs at high ointment concentrations (3%). \nRabbits were shown to be especially sensitive to intravenous administration of tacrolimus, reversible \ncardiotoxic effects being observed. \n \nMutagenicity \nIn vitro and in vivo tests did not indicate a genotoxic potential of tacrolimus. \n \nCarcinogenicity \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n9 \n\nSystemic carcinogenicity studies in mice (18 months) and rats (24 months) revealed no carcinogenic \npotential of tacrolimus.  \nIn a 24-month dermal carcinogenicity study performed in mice with 0.1% ointment, no skin tumours \nwere observed. In the same study an increased incidence of lymphoma was detected in association \nwith high systemic exposure. \nIn a photocarcinogenicity study, albino hairless mice were chronically treated with tacrolimus \nointment and UV radiation. Animals treated with tacrolimus ointment showed a statistically significant \nreduction in time to skin tumour (squamous cell carcinoma) development and an increase in the \nnumber of tumours. It is unclear whether the effect of tacrolimus is due to systemic \nimmunosuppression or a local effect. The risk for humans cannot be completely ruled out as the \npotential for local immunosuppression with the long-term use of tacrolimus ointment is unknown.  \n \nReproduction toxicity \nEmbryo/foetal toxicity was observed in rats and rabbits, but only at doses that caused significant \ntoxicity in maternal animals. Reduced sperm function was noted in male rats at high subcutaneous \ndoses of tacrolimus. \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 g of Protopy 0.1% ointment contains 1.0 mg of tacrolimus as tacrolimus monohydrate (0.1%). \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOintment \n \nA white to slightly yellowish ointment. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are not adequately responsive to or \nare intolerant of conventional therapies such as topical corticosteroids. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nProtopy should be initiated by physicians with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of atopic \ndermatitis. \n \nTreatment should be intermittent and not continuous.  \n \nProtopy ointment should be applied as a thin layer to affected areas of the skin. Protopy ointment may \nbe used on any part of the body, including face, neck and flexure areas, except on mucous membranes. \nProtopy ointment should not be applied under occlusion (see section 4.4).  \n \nEach affected region of the skin should be treated with Protopy until clearance occurs and then \ntreatment should be discontinued. Generally, improvement is seen within one week of starting \ntreatment. If no signs of improvement are seen after two weeks of treatment, further treatment options \nshould be considered. Protopy can be used for short term and intermittent long term treatment. At the \nfirst signs of recurrence (flares) of the disease symptoms, treatment should be reinitiated. \n \nProtopy is not recommended for use in children below age of 2 years until further data are available. \n \nUse in adults (16 years of age and above) \nProtopy is available in two strengths, Protopy 0.03% and Protopy 0.1% ointment. Treatment should be \nstarted with Protopy 0.1% twice a day and treatment should be continued until clearance of the lesion. \nIf symptoms recur, twice daily treatment with Protopy 0.1% should be restarted. An attempt should be \nmade to reduce the frequency of application or to use the lower strength Protopy 0.03% ointment if the \nclinical condition allows. \n \nUse in elderly (65 years of age and above) \nSpecific studies have not been conducted in elderly patients. However, the clinical experience \navailable in this patient population has not shown the necessity for any dosage adjustment. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n12 \n\nAs clinical efficacy studies were performed with abrupt cessation of treatment, no information is \navailable on whether tapering of the dosage would reduce recurrence rate. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to macrolides in general, to tacrolimus or to any of the excipients. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nProtopy should not be used in patients with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies or in patients \non therapy that cause immunosuppression. \n \nExposure of the skin to sunlight should be minimised and the use of ultraviolet (UV) light from a \nsolarium, therapy with UVB or UVA in combination with psoralens (PUVA) should be avoided \nduring use of Protopy ointment (see section 5.3). Physicians should advise patients on appropriate sun \nprotection methods, such as minimisation of the time in the sun, use of a sunscreen product and \ncovering of the skin with appropriate clothing. Protopy ointment should not be applied to lesions that \nare considered to be potentially malignant or pre-malignant. \n \nEmollients should not be applied to the same area within 2 hours of applying Protopy ointment. \nConcomitant use of other topical preparations has not been assessed. There is no experience with \nconcomitant use of systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.  \n \nProtopy ointment has not been evaluated for its efficacy and safety in the treatment of clinically \ninfected atopic dermatitis. Before commencing treatment with Protopy ointment, clinical infections at \ntreatment sites should be cleared. Patients with atopic dermatitis are predisposed to superficial skin \ninfections. Treatment with Protopy may be associated with an increased risk of herpes viral infections \n(herpes simplex dermatitis [eczema herpeticum], herpes simplex [cold sores], Kaposi\u2019s varicelliform \neruption). In the presence of these infections, the balance of risks and benefits associated with Protopy \nuse should be evaluated. \nThe potential for local immunosuppression (possibly resulting in infections or cutaneous \nmalignancies) in the long term (i.e. over a period of years) is unknown (see section 5.1). \n \nProtopy contains the active substance tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor. In transplant patients, \nprolonged systemic exposure to intense immunosuppression following systemic administration of \ncalcineurin inhibitors has been associated with an increased risk of developing lymphomas and skin \nmalignancies. In patients using tacrolimus ointment, cases of malignancies, including cutaneous and \nother types of lymphoma, and skin cancers have been reported (see section 4.8). Patients with atopic \ndermatitis treated with Protopy have not been found to have significant systemic tacrolimus levels.  \n \nLymphadenopathy was uncommonly (0.8%) reported in clinical trials. The majority of these cases \nrelated to infections (skin, respiratory tract, tooth) and resolved with appropriate antibiotic therapy. \nTransplant patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens (e.g. systemic tacrolimus) are at increased \nrisk for developing lymphoma; therefore patients who receive Protopy and who develop \nlymphadenopathy should be monitored to ensure that the lymphadenopathy resolves. \nLymphadenopathy present at initiation of therapy should be investigated and kept under review. In \ncase of persistent lymphadenopathy, the aetiology of the lymphadenopathy should be investigated. In \nthe absence of a clear aetiology for the lymphadenopathy or in the presence of acute infectious \nmononucleosis, discontinuation of Protopy should be considered. \n \nCare should be taken to avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. If accidentally applied to \nthese areas, the ointment should be thoroughly wiped off and/or rinsed off with water.  \nThe use of Protopy ointment under occlusion has not been studied in patients. Occlusive dressings are \nnot recommended.  \nAs with any topical medicinal product, patients should wash their hands after application if the hands \nare not intended for treatment.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n13 \n\nTacrolimus is extensively metabolised in the liver and although blood concentrations are low \nfollowing topical therapy, the ointment should be used with caution in patients with hepatic failure \n(see section 5.2).  \n \nThe use of Protopy ointment in patients with genetic epidermal barrier defects such as Netherton\u2019s \nsyndrome is not recommended due to the potential for permanently increased systemic absorption of \ntacrolimus. The safety of Protopy ointment has not been established in patients with generalised \nerythroderma. \n \nCare should be exercised if applying Protopy to patients with extensive skin involvement over an \nextended period of time, especially in children (see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFormal topical drug interaction studies with tacrolimus ointment have not been conducted. \n \nTacrolimus is not metabolised in human skin, indicating that there is no potential for percutaneous \ninteractions that could affect the metabolism of tacrolimus. \n \nSystemically available tacrolimus is metabolised via the hepatic Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). \nSystemic exposure from topical application of tacrolimus ointment is low (< 1.0 ng/ml) and is unlikely \nto be affected by concomitant use of substances known to be inhibitors of CYP3A4. However, the \npossibility of interactions cannot be ruled out and the concomitant systemic administration of known \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole and diltiazem) in patients with \nwidespread and/or erythrodermic disease should be done with caution. \n \nA potential interaction between vaccination and application of Protopy ointment has not been \ninvestigated. Because of the potential risk of vaccination failure, vaccination should be administered \nprior to commencement of treatment, or during a treatment-free interval with a period of 14 days \nbetween the last application of Protopy and the vaccination. In case of live attenuated vaccination, this \nperiod should be extended to 28 days or the use of alternative vaccines should be considered. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of tacrolimus ointment in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity following systemic administration (see section 5.3). The potential \nrisk for humans is unknown. \n \nProtopy ointment should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nHuman data demonstrate that, after systemic administration, tacrolimus is excreted into breast milk. \nAlthough clinical data have shown that systemic exposure from application of tacrolimus ointment is \nlow, breast-feeding during treatment with Protopy ointment is not recommended. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Protopy \nointment is administered topically and is unlikely to have an effect on the ability to drive or use \nmachines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn clinical studies approximately 50% of patients experienced some type of skin irritation adverse \nreaction at the site of application. Burning sensation and pruritus were very common, usually mild to \nmoderate in severity and tended to resolve within one week of starting treatment. Erythema was a \ncommon skin irritation adverse reaction. Sensation of warmth, pain, paraesthesia and rash at the site of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n14 \n\napplication were also commonly observed. Alcohol intolerance (facial flushing or skin irritation after \nconsumption of an alcoholic beverage) was common. \nPatients may be at an increased risk of folliculitis, acne and herpes viral infections. \n \nAdverse reactions with suspected relationship to treatment are listed below by system organ class. \nFrequencies are defined as very common (> 1/10), common (> 1/100, < 1/10) and uncommon  \n(> 1/1,000, < 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Application site burning, application site pruritus \nCommon: Application site warmth, application site erythema, application site pain, \n\napplication site irritation, application site paraesthesia, application site rash \n \nInfections and infestations \nCommon: Herpes viral infections (herpes simplex dermatitis [eczema herpeticum], herpes \n\nsimplex [cold sores], Kaposi\u2019s varicelliform eruption) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Folliculitis, pruritus \nUncommon: Acne \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: Paraesthesias and dysaesthesias (hyperaesthesia, burning sensation) \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nCommon: Alcohol intolerance (facial flushing or skin irritation after consumption of an \n\nalcoholic beverage) \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during post-marketing experience: \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rosacea \n \nPost-marketing: cases of malignancies, including cutaneous and other types of lymphoma, and skin \ncancers, have been reported in patients using tacrolimus ointment (see section 4.4).  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdosage following topical administration is unlikely.  \nIf ingested, general supportive measures may be appropriate. These may include monitoring of vital \nsigns and observation of clinical status. Due to the nature of the ointment vehicle, induction of \nvomiting or gastric lavage is not recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other dermatologicals, ATC code: D11AX14 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nThe mechanism of action of tacrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not fully understood. While the \nfollowing have been observed, the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not \nknown. \nVia its binding to a specific cytoplasmic immunophilin (FKBP12), tacrolimus inhibits calcium-\ndependent signal transduction pathways in T cells, thereby preventing the transcription and synthesis \nof IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5 and other cytokines such as GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n15 \n\nIn vitro, in Langerhans cells isolated from normal human skin, tacrolimus reduced the stimulatory \nactivity towards T cells. Tacrolimus has also been shown to inhibit the release of inflammatory \nmediators from skin mast cells, basophils and eosinophils. \nIn animals, tacrolimus ointment suppressed inflammatory reactions in experimental and spontaneous \ndermatitis models that resemble human atopic dermatitis. Tacrolimus ointment did not reduce skin \nthickness and did not cause skin atrophy in animals. \nIn patients with atopic dermatitis, improvement of skin lesions during treatment with tacrolimus \nointment was associated with reduced Fc receptor expression on Langerhans cells and a reduction of \ntheir hyperstimulatory activity towards T cells. Tacrolimus ointment does not affect collagen synthesis \nin humans.  \n \nResults from clinical studies in patients \nThe efficacy and safety of Protopy was assessed in more than 13,500 patients treated with tacrolimus \nointment in Phase I to Phase III clinical trials. Data from four major trials are presented here. \nIn a six-month multicentre double-blind randomised trial, 0.1% tacrolimus ointment was administered \ntwice-a-day to adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and compared to a topical \ncorticosteroid based regimen (0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate on trunk and extremities, 1% \nhydrocortisone acetate on face and neck). The primary endpoint was the response rate at month 3 \ndefined as the proportion of patients with at least 60% improvement in the mEASI (modified Eczema \nArea and Severity Index) between baseline and month 3. The response rate in the 0.1% tacrolimus \ngroup (71.6%) was significantly higher than that in the topical corticosteroid based treatment group \n(50.8%; p<0.001; Table 1). The response rates at month 6 were comparable to the 3-month results.  \n \nTable 1 Efficacy at month 3  \n Topical corticosteroid \n\nregimen\u00a7 \n(N=485) \n\nTacrolimus 0.1% \n(N=487) \n\nResponse rate of \u2265 60% \nimprovement in mEASI (Primary \nEndpoint)\u00a7\u00a7 \n\n50.8% 71.6% \n\nImprovement \u2265 90% in Physician\u2019s \nGlobal Evaluation \n\n28.5% 47.7% \n\n\u00a7 Topical corticosteroid regimen = 0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate on trunk and extremities, 1% \nhydrocortisone acetate on face and neck \n\u00a7\u00a7 higher values = greater improvement \n \nThe incidence and nature of most adverse events were similar in the two treatment groups. Skin \nburning, herpes simplex, alcohol intolerance (facial flushing or skin sensitivity after alcohol intake), \nskin tingling, hyperaesthesia, acne and fungal dermatitis occurred more often in the tacrolimus \ntreatment group. There were no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory values or vital signs in \neither treatment group throughout the study. \n \nIn the second trial, children aged from 2 to 15 years with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis received \ntwice daily treatment for three weeks of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment, 0.1% tacrolimus ointment or 1% \nhydrocortisone acetate ointment. The primary endpoint was the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of the \nmEASI as a percentage of baseline averaged over the treatment period. The results of this multicentre, \ndouble-blind, randomised trial showed that tacrolimus ointment, 0.03% and 0.1%, is significantly \nmore effective (p<0.001 for both) than 1% hydrocortisone acetate ointment (Table 2). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n16 \n\nTable 2 Efficacy at week 3  \n \n \n\nHydrocortisone \nacetate 1% \n(N=185) \n\nTacrolimus 0.03% \n(N=189) \n\nTacrolimus 0.1% \n(N=186) \n\nMedian mEASI as Percentage of \nBaseline mean AUC (Primary \nEndpoint)\u00a7 \n\n64.0% 44.8% 39.8% \n\nImprovement \u2265 90% in Physician\u2019s \nGlobal Evaluation \n\n15.7% 38.5% 48.4% \n\n\u00a7 lower values = greater improvement \n \nThe incidence of local skin burning was higher in the tacrolimus treatment groups than in the \nhydrocortisone group. Pruritus decreased over time in the tacrolimus groups but not in the \nhydrocortisone group. There were no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory values or vital signs \nin either treatment group throughout the clinical trial. \n  \nThe purpose of the third multicentre, double-blind, randomised study was the assessment of efficacy \nand safety of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment applied once or twice a day relative to twice daily \nadministration of 1% hydrocortisone acetate ointment in children with moderate to severe atopic \ndermatitis. Treatment duration was for up to three weeks. \n \nTable 3 Efficacy at week 3  \n \n \n\nHydrocortisone \nacetate 1% \nTwice daily \n(N=207) \n\nTacrolimus 0.03% \nOnce daily (N=207) \n\nTacrolimus 0.03% \nTwice daily (N=210) \n\nMedian mEASI Percentage \nDecrease (Primary Endpoint)\u00a7 \n\n47.2% 70.0% 78.7% \n\nImprovement \u2265 90% in \nPhysician\u2019s Global Evaluation  \n\n13.6% 27.8% 36.7% \n\n\u00a7 higher values = greater improvement \n \nThe primary endpoint was defined as the percentage decrease in mEASI from the baseline to end of \ntreatment. A statistically significant better improvement was shown for once daily and twice daily \n0.03% tacrolimus ointment compared to twice daily hydrocortisone acetate ointment (p<0.001 for \nboth). Twice daily treatment with 0.03% tacrolimus ointment was more effective than once daily \nadministration (Table 3). The incidence of local skin burning was higher in the tacrolimus treatment \ngroups than in the hydrocortisone group. There were no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory \nvalues or vital signs in either treatment group throughout the study. \n \nIn the fourth trial, approximately 800 patients (aged \u2265 2 years) received 0.1% tacrolimus ointment \nintermittently or continuously in an open-label, long-term safety study for up to four years, with 300 \npatients receiving treatment for at least three years and 79 patients receiving treatment for a minimum \nof 42 months. Based on changes from baseline in EASI score and body surface area affected, patients \nregardless of age had improvement in their atopic dermatitis at all subsequent time points. In addition, \nthere was no evidence of loss of efficacy throughout the duration of the clinical trial. The overall \nincidence of adverse events tended to decrease as the study progressed for all patients independent of \nage. The three most common adverse events reported were flu-like symptoms (cold, common cold, \ninfluenza, upper respiratory infection, etc.), pruritus and skin burning. No adverse events previously \nunreported in shorter duration and/or previous studies were observed in this long-term study. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nClinical data have shown that tacrolimus concentrations in systemic circulation after topical \nadministration are low and, when measurable, transient. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n17 \n\nAbsorption \nData from healthy human subjects indicate that there is little or no systemic exposure to tacrolimus \nfollowing single or repeated topical application of tacrolimus ointment. \nMost atopic dermatitis patients (adults and children) treated with single or repeated application of \ntacrolimus ointment (0.03 - 0.1%), and infants from age of 5 months treated with tacrolimus ointment \n(0.03%) had blood concentrations < 1.0 ng/ml. When observed, blood concentrations exceeding \n1.0 ng/ml were transient. Systemic exposure increases with increasing treatment areas. However, both \nthe extent and the rate of topical absorption of tacrolimus decrease as the skin heals. In both adults and \nchildren with an average of 50% body surface area treated, systemic exposure (i.e. AUC) of tacrolimus \nfrom Protopy is approximately 30-fold less than that seen with oral immunosuppressive doses in \nkidney and liver transplant patients. The lowest tacrolimus blood concentration at which systemic \neffects can be observed is not known.  \nThere was no evidence of systemic accumulation of tacrolimus in patients (adults and children) treated \nfor prolonged periods (up to one year) with tacrolimus ointment.  \n \nDistribution \nAs systemic exposure is low with tacrolimus ointment, the high binding of tacrolimus (> 98.8%) to \nplasma proteins is considered not to be clinically relevant. \nFollowing topical application of tacrolimus ointment, tacrolimus is selectively delivered to the skin \nwith minimal diffusion into the systemic circulation. \n \nMetabolism \nMetabolism of tacrolimus by human skin was not detectable. Systemically available tacrolimus is \nextensively metabolised in the liver via CYP3A4. \n \nElimination \nWhen administered intravenously, tacrolimus has been shown to have a low clearance rate. The \naverage total body clearance is approximately 2.25 l/h. The hepatic clearance of systemically available \ntacrolimus could be reduced in subjects with severe hepatic impairment, or in subjects who are co-\ntreated with drugs that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. \nFollowing repeated topical application of the ointment the average half-life of tacrolimus was \nestimated to be 75 hours for adults and 65 hours for children. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated dose toxicity and local tolerance \nRepeated topical administration of tacrolimus ointment or the ointment vehicle to rats, rabbits and \nmicropigs was associated with slight dermal changes such as erythema, oedema and papules.  \nLong-term topical treatment of rats with tacrolimus led to systemic toxicity including alterations of \nkidneys, pancreas, eyes and nervous system. The changes were caused by high systemic exposure of \nrodents resulting from high transdermal absorption of tacrolimus. Slightly lower body weight gain in \nfemales was the only systemic change observed in micropigs at high ointment concentrations (3%). \nRabbits were shown to be especially sensitive to intravenous administration of tacrolimus, reversible \ncardiotoxic effects being observed. \n \nMutagenicity \nIn vitro and in vivo tests did not indicate a genotoxic potential of tacrolimus. \n \nCarcinogenicity \nSystemic carcinogenicity studies in mice (18 months) and rats (24 months) revealed no carcinogenic \npotential of tacrolimus.  \nIn a 24-month dermal carcinogenicity study performed in mice with 0.1% ointment, no skin tumours \nwere observed. In the same study an increased incidence of lymphoma was detected in association \nwith high systemic exposure. \nIn a photocarcinogenicity study, albino hairless mice were chronically treated with tacrolimus \nointment and UV radiation. Animals treated with tacrolimus ointment showed a statistically significant \nreduction in time to skin tumour (squamous cell carcinoma) development and an increase in the \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n18 \n\nnumber of tumours. It is unclear whether the effect of tacrolimus is due to systemic \nimmunosuppression or a local effect. The risk for humans cannot be completely ruled out as the \npotential for local immunosuppression with the long-term use of tacrolimus ointment is unknown.  \n \nReproduction toxicity \nEmbryo/foetal toxicity was observed in rats and rabbits, but only at doses that caused significant \ntoxicity in maternal animals. Reduced sperm function was noted in male rats at high subcutaneous \ndoses of tacrolimus. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \nIn this leaflet: \n1. What Protopy is and what it is used for \n2. Before you use Protopy \n3. How to use Protopy \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Protopy \n6. Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT PROTOPY IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nThe active substance of Protopy, tacrolimus monohydrate, is an immunomodulating agent.  \n \nProtopy 0.03% ointment is used to treat moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults who \nare not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of conventional therapies such as topical \ncorticosteroids and in children (2 years of age and older) who failed to respond adequately to \nconventional therapies such as topical corticosteroids. In atopic dermatitis, an over-reaction of the \nskin\u2019s immune system causes skin inflammation (itchiness, redness, dryness). Protopy alters the \nabnormal immune response and relieves the skin inflammation and the itch. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE PROTOPY \n \nDo not use Protopy \n- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to tacrolimus or any of the other ingredients of Protopy or to \n\nmacrolide antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin). \n \nTake special care with Protopy \n- Protopy ointment is not approved for children younger than 2 years of age. Therefore it should \n\nnot be used in this age group. Please consult your doctor. \n- The effect of treatment with Protopy on the developing immune system in children, especially \n\nthe young, has not been established. \n- The safety of using Protopy for a long time is not known. A very small number of people who \n\nhave used Protopy ointment have had malignancies (for example, skin or lymphoma). However, \na link to Protopy ointment treatment has not been shown. \n\n- If you have infected lesions. Do not apply the ointment to infected lesions. \n- If you have liver failure. Talk to your doctor before using Protopy. \n- Also speak to your doctor before using Protopy if you have any skin malignancies (tumours) or \n\nif you have a weakened immune system (immuno-compromised) whatever the cause. \n- If you have an inherited skin barrier disease such as Netherton\u2019s syndrome or if you suffer from \n\ngeneralised erythroderma (inflammatory reddening and scaling of the entire skin). Talk to your \ndoctor before using Protopy. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n36 \n\n- You should inform your doctor if you have swollen lymph nodes at initiation of treatment. If \nyour lymph nodes become swollen during treatment with Protopy, consult your doctor. \n\n- Before receiving a vaccination tell your doctor that you are using Protopy. Vaccinations should \nnot be given during treatment and for a certain time after treatment with Protopy. For live \nattenuated vaccinations (e.g. measles, mumps, rubella or oral polio) the waiting time is 28 days, \nfor inactivated vaccines (e.g. tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis or influenza) 14 days. \n\n- Avoid exposing the skin to long periods of sunlight or artificial sunlight such as tanning beds. If \nyou spend time outdoors after applying Protopy, use a sunscreen and wear loose fitting clothing \nthat protects the skin from the sun. In addition, ask your doctor for advice on other appropriate \nsun protection methods. If you are prescribed light therapy, inform your doctor that you are \nusing Protopy as it is not recommended to use Protopy and light therapy at the same time. \n\n- Avoid contact with the eyes or mucous membranes (inside of your nose or mouth). \n \nTaking or using other medicines and cosmetics \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nYou may use moisturising creams and lotions during treatment with Protopy but these products should \nnot be used within two hours of applying Protopy. \n \nThe use of Protopy at the same time as other preparations to be used on the skin or while taking oral \ncorticosteroids (e.g. cortisone) or medicines which affect the immune system has not been studied. \n \nBefore receiving a vaccination tell your doctor that you are using Protopy (see Section \u201cTake special \ncare with Protopy\u201d). \n \nUsing Protopy with food and drink \nWhile using Protopy, drinking alcohol may cause the skin or face to become flushed or red and feel \nhot. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDon\u2019t use Protopy if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE PROTOPY \n \nAlways use Protopy exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nApply Protopy as a thin layer to affected areas of your skin. \n \nProtopy may be used on most parts of the body, including the face and neck and in the creases of your \nelbows and knees. \n \nAvoid using the ointment inside your nose or mouth or in your eyes. If the ointment gets on any of \nthese areas, it should be thoroughly wiped off and/or rinsed off with water. \n \nDo not cover the skin being treated with bandages or wraps. \n \nWash your hands after applying Protopy unless your hands are also being treated. \n \nBefore applying Protopy after a bath or shower, be sure your skin is completely dry. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n37 \n\nChildren (2 years of age and older) \nApply Protopy twice a day for up to three weeks, once in the morning and once in the evening. \nAfterwards the ointment should be used once a day on each affected region of the skin until the \neczema has gone away. \n \nAdults (16 years of age and older) \nTwo strengths of Protopy (Protopy 0.03% and Protopy 0.1% ointment) are available for adult patients. \nYour doctor will decide which strength is best for you. Usually, treatment is started with Protopy 0.1% \nointment twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, until the eczema has cleared. If \nsymptoms reappear, treatment with Protopy 0.1% twice a day should be restarted. Depending on the \nresponse of your eczema your doctor will decide if the frequency of application can be reduced or the \nlower strength, Protopy 0.03% ointment, can be used. \n \nTreat each affected region of your skin until the eczema has gone away. Improvement is usually seen \nwithin one week. If you do not see any improvement after two weeks, see your doctor about other \npossible treatments. Treatment with Protopy may be repeated if symptoms reappear. \n \nIf you accidentally swallow some ointment \nIf you accidentally swallow the ointment, consult your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. Do \nnot try to induce vomiting. \n \nIf you forget to use Protopy \nIf you forget to apply the ointment at the scheduled time, do it as soon as you remember and then \ncontinue as before. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Protopy can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nApproximately half of the patients who use Protopy have some type of skin irritation where they have \napplied the ointment. Burning sensation and itching are very common (> 10%). These symptoms are \nusually mild to moderate and generally go away within one week of using Protopy. Other common \n(> 1%) side effects are redness, feeling of warmth, pain, increased skin sensitivity (especially to hot \nand cold), skin tingling, rash, folliculitis (inflamed or infected hair follicles) and herpes viral infections \n(e.g. cold sores, generalised herpes simplex infections). Facial flushing or skin irritation after drinking \nalcohol is also common. Acne is an uncommon side effect. Rosacea and rosacea-like dermatitis have \nalso been reported. \nSince commercial availability a very small number of people who have used Protopy ointment have \nhad malignancies (for example, skin or lymphoma). However, a link to Protopy ointment treatment has \nnot been confirmed or refuted on the available evidence so far. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE PROTOPY \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use Protopy after the expiry date which is stated on the tube and carton after EXP. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month. \nDo not store above 25\u00baC. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n38 \n\nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \nIn this leaflet: \n1. What Protopy is and what it is used for \n2. Before you use Protopy \n3. How to use Protopy \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Protopy \n6. Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT PROTOPY IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nThe active substance of Protopy, tacrolimus monohydrate, is an immunomodulating agent.  \n \nProtopy 0.1% ointment is used to treat moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults who are \nnot adequately responsive to or are intolerant of conventional therapies such as topical corticosteroids. \nIn atopic dermatitis, an over-reaction of the skin\u2019s immune system causes skin inflammation \n(itchiness, redness, dryness). Protopy alters the abnormal immune response and relieves the skin \ninflammation and the itch. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE PROTOPY \n \nDo not use Protopy \n- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to tacrolimus or any of the other ingredients of Protopy or to \n\nmacrolide antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin). \n \nTake special care with Protopy \n- Protopy ointment is not approved for children younger than 2 years of age. Therefore it should \n\nnot be used in this age group. Please consult your doctor. \n- The safety of using Protopy for a long time is not known. A very small number of people who \n\nhave used Protopy ointment have had malignancies (for example, skin or lymphoma). However, \na link to Protopy ointment treatment has not been shown. \n\n- If you have infected lesions. Do not apply the ointment to infected lesions. \n- Also speak to your doctor before using Protopy if you have any skin malignancies (tumours) or \n\nif you have a weakened immune system (immuno-compromised) whatever the cause. \n- If you have liver failure. Talk to your doctor before using Protopy. \n- If you have an inherited skin barrier disease such as Netherton\u2019s syndrome or if you suffer from \n\ngeneralised erythroderma (inflammatory reddening and scaling of the entire skin). Talk to your \ndoctor before using Protopy. \n\n- You should inform your doctor if you have swollen lymph nodes at initiation of treatment. If \nyour lymph nodes become swollen during treatment with Protopy, consult your doctor. \n\n- Before receiving a vaccination tell your doctor that you are using Protopy. Vaccinations should \nnot be given during treatment and for a certain time after treatment with Protopy. For live \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n43 \n\nattenuated vaccinations (e.g. measles, mumps, rubella or oral polio) the waiting time is 28 days, \nfor inactivated vaccines (e.g. tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis or influenza) 14 days. \n\n- Avoid exposing the skin to long periods of sunlight or artificial sunlight such as tanning beds. If \nyou spend time outdoors after applying Protopy, use a sunscreen and wear loose fitting clothing \nthat protects the skin from the sun. In addition, ask your doctor for advice on other appropriate \nsun protection methods. If you are prescribed light therapy, inform your doctor that you are \nusing Protopy as it is not recommended to use Protopy and light therapy at the same time. \n\n- Avoid contact with the eyes or mucous membranes (inside of your nose or mouth). \n \nTaking or using other medicines and cosmetics \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nYou may use moisturising creams and lotions during treatment with Protopy but these products should \nnot be used within two hours of applying Protopy. \n \nThe use of Protopy at the same time as other preparations to be used on the skin or while taking oral \ncorticosteroids (e.g. cortisone) or medicines which affect the immune system has not been studied. \n \nBefore receiving a vaccination tell your doctor that you are using Protopy (see Section \u201cTake special \ncare with Protopy\u201d). \n \nUsing Protopy with food and drink \nWhile using Protopy, drinking alcohol may cause the skin or face to become flushed or red and feel \nhot. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDon\u2019t use Protopy if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE PROTOPY \n \nAlways use Protopy exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nApply Protopy as a thin layer to affected areas of your skin. \n \nProtopy may be used on most parts of the body, including the face and neck and in the creases of your \nelbows and knees. \n \nAvoid using the ointment inside your nose or mouth or in your eyes. If the ointment gets on any of \nthese areas, it should be thoroughly wiped off and/or rinsed off with water. \n \nDo not cover the skin being treated with bandages or wraps. \n \nWash your hands after applying Protopy unless your hands are also being treated. \n \nBefore applying Protopy after a bath or shower, be sure your skin is completely dry. \n \nTwo strengths of Protopy (Protopy 0.03% and Protopy 0.1% ointment) are available for adult patients \n(16 years of age and older). Your doctor will decide which strength is best for you. Usually, treatment \nis started with Protopy 0.1% ointment twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, until \nthe eczema has cleared. If symptoms reappear, treatment with Protopy 0.1% twice a day should be \nrestarted. Depending on the response of your eczema your doctor will decide if the frequency of \napplication can be reduced or the lower strength, Protopy 0.03% ointment, can be used. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n44 \n\nTreat each affected region of your skin until the eczema has gone away. Improvement is usually seen \nwithin one week. If you do not see any improvement after two weeks, see your doctor about other \npossible treatments. Treatment with Protopy may be repeated if symptoms reappear. \n \nIf you accidentally swallow some ointment \nIf you accidentally swallow the ointment, consult your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. Do \nnot try to induce vomiting. \n \nIf you forget to use Protopy \nIf you forget to apply the ointment at the scheduled time, do it as soon as you remember and then \ncontinue as before. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Protopy can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nApproximately half of the patients who use Protopy have some type of skin irritation where they have \napplied the ointment. Burning sensation and itching are very common (> 10%). These symptoms are \nusually mild to moderate and generally go away within one week of using Protopy. Other common \n(> 1%) side effects are redness, feeling of warmth, pain, increased skin sensitivity (especially to hot \nand cold), skin tingling, rash, folliculitis (inflamed or infected hair follicles) and herpes viral infections \n(e.g. cold sores, generalised herpes simplex infections). Facial flushing or skin irritation after drinking \nalcohol is also common. Acne is an uncommon side effect. Rosacea and rosacea-like dermatitis have \nalso been reported. \nSince commercial availability a very small number of people who have used Protopy ointment have \nhad malignancies (for example, skin or lymphoma). However, a link to Protopy ointment treatment has \nnot been confirmed or refuted on the available evidence so far. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE PROTOPY \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use Protopy after the expiry date which is stated on the tube and carton after EXP. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month. \nDo not store above 25\u00baC. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n45 \n\n6.

substance of protopy, tacrolimus monohydrate, is an immunomodulating agent. protopy 0.03% ointment is used to treat moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults who are not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of conventional therapies such as topical corticosteroids and in children (2 years of age and older) who failed to respond adequately to conventional therapies such as topical corticosteroids. in atopic dermatitis, an over-reaction of the skin's immune system causes skin inflammation (itchiness, redness, dryness). protopy alters the abnormal immune response and

use protopy - if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to tacrolimus or any of the other ingredients of protopy or to macrolide antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin). take special care with protopy - protopy ointment is not approved for children younger than 2 years of age. therefore it should not be used in this age group. please consult your doctor. - the effect of treatment with protopy on the developing immune system in children, especially the young, has not been established. - the safety of using protopy for a long time is not known. a very small number of people who have used protopy ointment have had malignancies (for example, skin or lymphoma). however, a link to protopy ointment treatment has not been shown. - if you have infected lesions. do not apply the ointment to infected lesions. - if you have liver failure. talk to your doctor before using protopy. - also speak to your doctor before using protopy if you have any skin malignancies (tumours) or if you have a weakened immune system (immuno-compromised) whatever the cause. - if you have an inherited skin barrier disease such as netherton's syndrome or if you suffer from generalised erythroderma (inflammatory reddening and scaling of the entire skin). talk to your doctor before using protopy. - you should inform your doctor if you have swollen lymph nodes at initiation of treatment. if your lymph nodes become swollen during treatment with protopy, consult your doctor. - before receiving a vaccination tell your doctor that you are using protopy. vaccinations should not be given during treatment and for a certain time after treatment with protopy. for live attenuated vaccinations (e.g. measles, mumps, rubella or oral polio) the waiting time is 28 days, for inactivated vaccines (e.g. tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis or influenza) 14 days. - avoid exposing the skin to long periods of sunlight or artificial sunlight such as tanning beds. if you spend time outdoors after applying protopy, use a sunscreen and wear loose fitting clothing that protects the skin from the sun. in addition, ask your doctor for advice on other appropriate sun protection methods. if you are prescribed light therapy, inform your doctor that you are using protopy as it is not recommended to use protopy and light therapy at the same time. - avoid contact with the eyes or mucous membranes (inside of your nose or mouth). taking or using other medicines and cosmetics please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. you may use moisturising creams and lotions during treatment with protopy but these products should not be used within two hours of applying protopy. the use of protopy at the same time as other preparations to be used on the skin or while taking oral corticosteroids (e.g. cortisone) or medicines which affect the immune system has not been studied. before receiving a vaccination tell your doctor that you are using protopy (see section \"take special care with protopy\"). using protopy with food and drink while using protopy, drinking alcohol may cause the skin or face to become flushed or red and feel hot. pregnancy and breast-feeding don't use protopy if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.",

protopy as a thin layer to affected areas of your skin. protopy may be used on most parts of the body, including the face and neck and in the creases of your elbows and knees. avoid using the ointment inside your nose or mouth or in your eyes. if the ointment gets on any of these areas, it should be thoroughly wiped off and/or rinsed off with water. do not cover the skin being treated with bandages or wraps. wash your hands after applying protopy unless your hands are also being treated. before applying protopy after a bath or shower, be sure your skin is completely dry. children (2 years of age and older) apply protopy twice a day for up to three weeks, once in the morning and once in the evening. afterwards the ointment should be used once a day on each affected region of the skin until the eczema has gone away. adults (16 years of age and older) two strengths of protopy (protopy 0.03% and protopy 0.1% ointment) are available for adult patients. your doctor will decide which strength is best for you. usually, treatment is started with protopy 0.1% ointment twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, until the eczema has cleared. if symptoms reappear, treatment with protopy 0.1% twice a day should be restarted. depending on the response of your eczema your doctor will decide if the frequency of application can be reduced or the lower strength, protopy 0.03% ointment, can be used. treat each affected region of your skin until the eczema has gone away. improvement is usually seen within one week. if you do not see any improvement after two weeks, see your doctor about other possible treatments. treatment with protopy may be repeated if symptoms reappear. if you accidentally swallow some ointment if you accidentally swallow the ointment, consult your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. do not try to induce vomiting. if you forget to use protopy if you forget to apply the ointment at the scheduled time, do it as soon as you remember and then continue as before. if you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "protopy", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,

within one week of using protopy. other common (> 1%) side effects are redness, feeling of warmth, pain, increased skin sensitivity (especially to hot and cold), skin tingling, rash, folliculitis (inflamed or infected hair follicles) and herpes viral infections (e.g. cold sores, generalised herpes simplex infections). facial flushing or skin irritation after drinking alcohol is also common. acne is an uncommon side effect. rosacea and rosacea-like dermatitis have also been reported. since commercial availability a very small number of people who have used protopy ointment have had malignancies (for example, skin or lymphoma). however, a link to protopy ointment treatment has not been confirmed or refuted on the available evidence so far. if any of the side effects gets serious,
