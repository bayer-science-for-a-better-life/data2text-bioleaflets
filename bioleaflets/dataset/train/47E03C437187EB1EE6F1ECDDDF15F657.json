CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n\n \nOgivri is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer \n(MBC): \n \n- as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy \n\nregimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an \n\n\n\n3 \n\nanthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor \npositive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these \ntreatments \n\n \n- in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received \n\nchemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable \n \n- in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received \n\nchemotherapy for their metastatic disease \n \n- in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with \n\nhormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab. \n \n\nEarly breast cancer \n\n \nOgivri is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer (EBC): \n \n- following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) (see \n\nsection 5.1) \n \n- following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with \n\npaclitaxel or docetaxel \n \n- in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. \n \n- in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant Ogivri therapy, for locally \n\nadvanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1). \n\n \nOgivri should only be used in patients with metastatic or EBC whose tumours have either HER2 \noverexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nMetastatic gastric cancer \n \nOgivri in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with HER2 positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal \njunction who have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease. \n \nOgivri should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) whose tumours have \nHER2 overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC 3+ \nresult. Accurate and validated assay methods should be used (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nHER2 testing is mandatory prior to initiation of therapy (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Trastuzumab \ntreatment should only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy (see section 4.4), and should be administered by a healthcare professional only. \n \nOgivri intravenous formulation is not intended for subcutaneous administration and should be \nadministered via an intravenous infusion only. \n \nIf an alternate route of administration is required, other trastuzumab products offering such an option \nshould be used. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIn order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the \nmedicinal product being prepared and administered is trastuzumab and not trastuzumab emtansine. \n \nPosology \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n\n \n\nThree-weekly schedule \n\nThe recommended initial loading dose is 8 mg/kg body weight. The recommended maintenance dose \nat three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body weight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. \n \n\nWeekly schedule \n\nThe recommended initial loading dose of trastuzumab is 4 mg/kg body weight. The recommended \nweekly maintenance dose of trastuzumab is 2 mg/kg body weight, beginning one week after the \nloading dose. \n \nAdministration in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel \n\nIn the pivotal trials (H0648g, M77001), paclitaxel or docetaxel was administered the day following the \nfirst dose of trastuzumab (for dose, see the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for paclitaxel \nor docetaxel) and immediately after the subsequent doses of trastuzumab if the preceding dose of \ntrastuzumab was well tolerated. \n \n\nAdministration in combination with an aromatase inhibitor \n\nIn the pivotal trial (BO16216) trastuzumab and anastrozole were administered from day 1. There were \nno restrictions on the relative timing of trastuzumab and anastrozole at administration (for dose, see \nthe SmPC for anastrozole or other aromatase inhibitors). \n \n\nEarly breast cancer \n\n \n\nThree-weekly and weekly schedule \n\nAs a three-weekly regimen the recommended initial loading dose of trastuzumab is 8 mg/kg body \nweight. The recommended maintenance dose of trastuzumab at three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body \nweight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. \nAs a weekly regimen (initial loading dose of 4 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg every week) concomitantly \nwith paclitaxel following chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n \nSee section 5.1 for chemotherapy combination dosing. \n \n\nMetastatic gastric cancer \n\n \n\nThree-weekly schedule \n\nThe recommended initial loading dose is 8 mg/kg body weight. The recommended maintenance dose \nat three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body weight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. \n \nBreast cancer and gastric cancer \n \n\nDuration of treatment \n\nPatients with MBC or MGC should be treated with trastuzumab until progression of disease. \nPatients with EBC should be treated with trastuzumab for 1 year or until disease recurrence, whichever \noccurs first; extending treatment in EBC beyond one year is not recommended (see section 5.1). \n \n\nDose reduction \n\nNo reductions in the dose of trastuzumab were made during clinical trials. Patients may continue \ntherapy during periods of reversible, chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression but they should be \n\n\n\n5 \n\nmonitored carefully for complications of neutropenia during this time. Refer to the SmPC for \npaclitaxel, docetaxel or aromatase inhibitor for information on dose reduction or delays. \n \nIf left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) percentage drops \u2265 10 points from baseline AND to below \n50 %, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within approximately \n3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or has declined further, or if symptomatic congestive heart failure \n(CHF) has developed, discontinuation of trastuzumab should be strongly considered, unless the \nbenefits for the individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be \nreferred for assessment by a cardiologist and followed up. \n \n\nMissed doses \n\nIf the patient has missed a dose of trastuzumab by one week or less, then the usual maintenance dose \n(weekly regimen: 2 mg/kg; three-weekly regimen: 6 mg/kg) should be administered as soon as \npossible. Do not wait until the next planned cycle. Subsequent maintenance doses should be \nadministered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or three-weekly schedules, respectively. \n \nIf the patient has missed a dose of trastuzumab by more than one week, a re-loading dose of \ntrastuzumab should be administered over approximately 90 minutes (weekly regimen: 4 mg/kg; three-\nweekly regimen: 8 mg/kg) as soon as possible. Subsequent trastuzumab maintenance doses (weekly \nregimen: 2 mg/kg; three-weekly regimen 6 mg/kg respectively) should be administered 7 days or 21 \ndays later according to the weekly or three-weekly schedules respectively. \n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nDedicated pharmacokinetic studies in the elderly and those with renal or hepatic impairment have not \nbeen carried out. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age and renal impairment were not shown \nto affect trastuzumab disposition. \n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of trastuzumab in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTrastuzumab loading dose should be administered as a 90-minute intravenous infusion. Do not \nadminister as an intravenous push or bolus. Trastuzumab intravenous infusion should be administered \nby a healthcare provider prepared to manage anaphylaxis and an emergency kit should be available. \nPatients should be observed for at least six hours after the start of the first infusion and for two hours \nafter the start of the subsequent infusions for symptoms like fever and chills or other infusion-related \nsymptoms (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Interruption or slowing the rate of the infusion may help control \nsuch symptoms. The infusion may be resumed when symptoms abate. \n \nIf the initial loading dose was well tolerated, the subsequent doses can be administered as a 30-minute \ninfusion. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance, murine proteins, or to any of the excipients listed \n\nin section 6.1. \n\u2022 Severe dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring \n\nsupplementary oxygen therapy. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHER2 testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory which can ensure adequate validation of \nthe testing procedures (see section 5.1). \n \nCurrently no data from clinical trials are available on re-treatment of patients with previous exposure \nto trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting. \n \nCardiac dysfunction \n \nGeneral considerations \n\n \n\nPatients treated with trastuzumab are at increased risk for developing CHF (New York Heart \nAssociation [NYHA] Class II-IV) or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. These events have been \nobserved in patients receiving trastuzumab therapy alone or in combination with paclitaxel or \ndocetaxel, particularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) containing chemotherapy. \nThese may be moderate to severe and have been associated with death (see section 4.8). In addition, \ncaution should be exercised in treating patients with increased cardiac risk, e.g. hypertension, \ndocumented coronary artery disease, CHF, LVEF of < 55%, older age. \n \nAll candidates for treatment with trastuzumab, but especially those with prior anthracycline and \ncyclophosphamide (AC) exposure, should undergo baseline cardiac assessment including history and \nphysical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and/or multigated acquisition \n(MUGA) scan or magnetic resonance imaging. Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop \ncardiac dysfunction. Cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every 3 months \nduring treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 months from the \nlast administration of trastuzumab. A careful risk-benefit assessment should be made before deciding \nto treat with trastuzumab. \n \nTrastuzumab may persist in the circulation for up to 7 months after stopping Ogivri treatment based on \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of all available data (see section 5.2). Patients who receive \nanthracyclines after stopping trastuzumab may possibly be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. If \npossible, physicians should avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months after stopping \ntrastuzumab. If anthracyclines are used, the patient\u2019s cardiac function should be monitored carefully. \n \nFormal cardiological assessment should be considered in patients in whom there are cardiovascular \nconcerns following baseline screening. In all patients cardiac function should be monitored during \ntreatment (e.g. every 12 weeks). Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop cardiac \ndysfunction. Patients who develop asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction may benefit from more frequent \nmonitoring (e.g. every 6 - 8 weeks). If patients have a continued decrease in left ventricular function, \nbut remain asymptomatic, the physician should consider discontinuing therapy if no clinical benefit of \ntrastuzumab therapy has been seen. \n \nThe safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab in patients who experience cardiac \ndysfunction has not been prospectively studied. If LVEF percentage drops \u2265 10 points from baseline \nAND to below 50%, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within \napproximately 3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or declined further, or symptomatic CHF has \ndeveloped, discontinuation of trastuzumab should be strongly considered, unless the benefits for the \n\n\n\n7 \n\nindividual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be referred for \nassessment by a cardiologist and followed up. \n \nIf symptomatic cardiac failure develops during trastuzumab therapy, it should be treated with standard \nmedicinal products for CHF. Most patients who developed CHF or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction \nin pivotal trials improved with standard CHF treatment consisting of an angiotensin-converting \nenzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a beta-blocker. The majority of \npatients with cardiac symptoms and evidence of a clinical benefit of trastuzumab treatment continued \non therapy without additional clinical cardiac events. \n \n\nMetastatic breast cancer \n\n \n\nTrastuzumab and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the MBC setting. \n \nPatients with MBC who have previously received anthracyclines are also at risk of cardiac dysfunction \nwith trastuzumab treatment, although the risk is lower than with concurrent use of trastuzumab and \nanthracyclines. \n \nEarly breast cancer \n\n \n\nFor patients with EBC, cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every 3 \nmonths during treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 months \nfrom the last administration of trastuzumab. In patients who receive anthracycline-containing \nchemotherapy further monitoring is recommended, and should occur yearly up to 5 years from the last \nadministration of trastuzumab, or longer if a continuous decrease of LVEF is observed. \n \nPatients with history of myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris requiring medical treatment, \nhistory of or existing CHF (NYHA Class II \u2013IV), LVEF of < 55%, other cardiomyopathy, cardiac \narrhythmia requiring medical treatment, clinically significant cardiac valvular disease, poorly \ncontrolled hypertension (hypertension controlled by standard medical treatment eligible), and \nhemodynamic effective pericardial effusion were excluded from adjuvant and neoadjuvant EBC \npivotal trials with trastuzumab and therefore treatment cannot be recommended in such patients. \n \nAdjuvant treatment \n\n \n\nTrastuzumab and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the adjuvant \ntreatment setting. \n \nIn patients with EBC an increase in the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac events \nwas observed when trastuzumab was administered after anthracycline-containing chemotherapy \ncompared to administration with a non-anthracycline regimen of docetaxel and carboplatin and was \nmore marked when trastuzumab was administered concurrently with taxanes than when administered \nsequentially to taxanes. Regardless of the regimen used, most symptomatic cardiac events occurred \nwithin the first 18 months. In one of the 3 pivotal studies conducted in which a median follow-up of \n5.5 years was available (BCIRG006) a continuous increase in the cumulative rate of symptomatic \ncardiac or LVEF events was observed in patients who were administered trastuzumab concurrently \nwith a taxane following anthracycline therapy up to 2.37 % compared to approximately 1 % in the two \ncomparator arms (anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide followed by taxane and taxane, carboplatin \nand trastuzumab). \n \nRisk factors for a cardiac event identified in four large adjuvant studies included advanced age \n(> 50 years), low LVEF (< 55 %) at baseline, prior to or following the initiation of paclitaxel \n\n\n\n8 \n\ntreatment, decline in LVEF by 10-15 points, and prior or concurrent use of anti-hypertensive \nmedicinal products. \nIn patients receiving trastuzumab after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, the risk of cardiac \ndysfunction was associated with a higher cumulative dose of anthracycline given prior to initiation of \ntrastuzumab and a body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2. \n \nNeoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment \n\n \n\nIn patients with EBC eligible for neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment, trastuzumab should be used \nconcurrently with anthracyclines only in chemotherapy-naive patients and only with low-dose \nanthracycline regimens i.e. maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin 180 mg/m2 or epirubicin \n360 mg/m2. \n \nIf patients have been treated concurrently with a full course of low-dose anthracyclines and \ntrastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting, no additional cytotoxic chemotherapy should be given after \nsurgery. In other situations, the decision on the need for additional cytotoxic chemotherapy is \ndetermined based on individual factors. \n \nExperience of concurrent administration of trastuzumab with low dose anthracycline regimens is \ncurrently limited to the trial MO16432. \n \nIn the pivotal trial MO16432, trastuzumab was administered concurrently with neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy containing three cycles of doxorubicin (cumulative dose 180 mg/m2). \n \nThe incidence of symptomatic cardiac dysfunction was 1.7 % in the trastuzumab arm. \n \nClinical experience is limited in patients above 65 years of age. \n \nInfusion-related reactions (IRRs) and hypersensitivity \n \nSerious IRRs to trastuzumab infusion including dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, hypertension, \nbronchospasm, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, reduced oxygen saturation, anaphylaxis, respiratory \ndistress, urticaria and angioedema have been reported (see section 4.8). Pre-medication may be used to \nreduce risk of occurrence of these events. The majority of these events occur during or within 2.5 \nhours of the start of the first infusion. Should an infusion reaction occur the infusion should be \ndiscontinued or the rate of infusion slowed and the patient should be monitored until resolution of all \nobserved symptoms (see section 4.2). These symptoms can be treated with an analgesic/antipyretic \nsuch as meperidine or paracetamol, or an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine. The majority of \npatients experienced resolution of symptoms and subsequently received further infusions of \ntrastuzumab. Serious reactions have been treated successfully with supportive therapy such as oxygen, \nbeta agonists, and corticosteroids. In rare cases, these reactions are associated with a clinical course \nculminating in a fatal outcome. Patients experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of \nadvanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a fatal infusion reaction. \nTherefore, these patients should not be treated with trastuzumab (see section 4.3). \n \nInitial improvement followed by clinical deterioration and delayed reactions with rapid clinical \ndeterioration have also been reported. Fatalities have occurred within hours and up to one week \nfollowing infusion. On very rare occasions, patients have experienced the onset of infusion symptoms \nand pulmonary symptoms more than six hours after the start of the trastuzumab infusion. Patients \nshould be warned of the possibility of such a late onset and should be instructed to contact their \nphysician if these symptoms occur. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nPulmonary events \n \nSevere pulmonary events have been reported with the use of trastuzumab in the post-marketing setting \n(see section 4.8). These events have occasionally been fatal. In addition, cases of interstitial lung \ndisease including lung infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, \npleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute pulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency have been \nreported. Risk factors associated with interstitial lung disease include prior or concomitant therapy \nwith other anti-neoplastic therapies known to be associated with it such as taxanes, gemcitabine, \nvinorelbine and radiation therapy. These events may occur as part of an infusion-related reaction or \nwith a delayed onset. Patients experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced \nmalignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of pulmonary events. Therefore, these patients \nshould not be treated with trastuzumab (see section 4.3). Caution should be exercised for pneumonitis, \nespecially in patients being treated concomitantly with taxanes. \n \nSorbitol content \n \nOgivri 150 mg contains 115.2 mg sorbitol in each vial.  \nOgivri 420 mg contains 322.6 mg sorbitol in each vial. \nPatients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) must not be given this medicine unless strictly \nnecessary. \nA detailed history with regards to HFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to being given \nthis medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. Clinically significant interactions between trastuzumab \nand the concomitant medicinal products used in clinical trials have not been observed. \n \nEffect of trastuzumab on the pharmacokinetics of other antineoplastic agents \n \n\nPharmacokinetic data from studies BO15935 and M77004 in women with HER2-positive MBC \nsuggested that exposure to paclitaxel and doxorubicin (and their major metabolites 6-\u03b1 hydroxyl-\npaclitaxel, POH, and doxorubicinol, DOL) was not altered in the presence of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg or \n4 mg/kg intravenous loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg q3w or 2 mg/kg q1w intravenous, \nrespectively). \nHowever, trastuzumab may elevate the overall exposure of one doxorubicin metabolite, (7-deoxy-13 \ndihydro-doxorubicinone, D7D). The bioactivity of D7D and the clinical impact of the elevation of this \nmetabolite were unclear. \n \nData from study JP16003, a single-arm study of trastuzumab (4 mg/kg intravenous loading dose and \n2 mg/kg intravenous weekly) and docetaxel (60 mg/m2 intravenous) in Japanese women with HER2- \npositive MBC, suggested that concomitant administration of trastuzumab had no effect on the single \ndose pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. Study JP19959 was a sub study of BO18255 (ToGA) performed \nin male and female Japanese patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) to study the \npharmacokinetics of capecitabine and cisplatin when used with or without trastuzumab. The results of \nthis sub study suggested that the exposure to the bioactive metabolites (e.g. 5-FU) of capecitabine was \nnot affected by concurrent use of cisplatin or by concurrent use of cisplatin plus trastuzumab. \nHowever, capecitabine itself showed higher concentrations and a longer half-life when combined with \ntrastuzumab. The data also suggested that the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin were not affected by \nconcurrent use of capecitabine or by concurrent use of capecitabine plus trastuzumab. \n \nPharmacokinetic data from Study H4613g/GO01305 in patients with metastatic or locally advanced \ninoperable HER2-positive cancer suggested that trastuzumab had no impact on the PK of carboplatin. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nEffect of antineoplastic agents on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics  \n \nBy comparison of simulated serum trastuzumab concentrations after trastuzumab monotherapy \n(4 mg/kg loading/2 mg/kg q1w intravenous) and observed serum concentrations in Japanese women \nwith HER2- positive MBC (study JP16003) no evidence of a PK effect of concurrent administration of \ndocetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was found. \n \nComparison of PK results from two phase II studies (BO15935 and M77004) and one phase III study \n(H0648g) in which patients were treated concomitantly with trastuzumab and paclitaxel and two phase \nII studies in which trastuzumab was administered as monotherapy (W016229 and MO16982), in \nwomen with HER2-positive MBC indicates that individual and mean trastuzumab trough serum \nconcentrations varied within and across studies but there was no clear effect of the concomitant \nadministration of paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. Comparison of trastuzumab PK \ndata from Study M77004 in which women with HER2-positive MBC were treated concomitantly with \ntrastuzumab, paclitaxel and doxorubicin to trastuzumab PK data in studies where trastuzumab was \nadministered as monotherapy (H0649g) or in combination with anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide \nor paclitaxel (Study H0648g), suggested no effect of doxorubicin and paclitaxel on the \npharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. \n \nPharmacokinetic data from Study H4613g/GO01305 suggested that carboplatin had no impact on the \nPK of trastuzumab. \n \nThe administration of concomitant anastrozole did not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of \ntrastuzumab. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment \nwith trastuzumab and for 7 months after treatment has concluded (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy \n \nReproduction studies have been conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 25 times that of the \nweekly human maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg trastuzumab intravenous formulation and have revealed \nno evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus. Placental transfer of trastuzumab during the \nearly (days 20\u201350 of gestation) and late (days 120\u2013150 of gestation) foetal development period was \nobserved. It is not known whether trastuzumab can affect reproductive capacity. As animal \nreproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, trastuzumab should be avoided \nduring pregnancy unless the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting, cases of foetal renal growth and/or function impairment in association \nwith oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia of the foetus, have been \nreported in pregnant women receiving trastuzumab. Women who become pregnant should be advised \nof the possibility of harm to the foetus. If a pregnant woman is treated with trastuzumab, or if a patient \nbecomes pregnant while receiving trastuzumab or within 7 months following the last dose of \ntrastuzumab, close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team is desirable. \n \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nA study conducted in lactating Cynomolgus monkeys at doses 25 times that of the weekly human \nmaintenance dose of 2 mg/kg trastuzumab intravenous formulation demonstrated that trastuzumab is \nsecreted in the milk. The presence of trastuzumab in the serum of infant monkeys was not associated \nwith any adverse effects on their growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. It is not known \n\n\n\n11 \n\nwhether trastuzumab is secreted in human milk. As human IgG1 is secreted into human milk, and the \npotential for harm to the infant is unknown, women should not breast-feed during trastuzumab therapy \nand for 7 months after the last dose. \n \n\nFertility \n \nThere is no fertility data available. \n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOgivri may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8). Patients \nexperiencing infusion-related symptoms (see section 4.4) should be advised not to drive and use \nmachines until symptoms abate.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAmongst the most serious and/or common adverse reactions reported in trastuzumab usage \n(intravenous and subcutaneous formulations) to date are cardiac dysfunction, infusion-related \nreactions, haematotoxicity (in particular neutropenia), infections and pulmonary adverse reactions. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn this section, the following categories of frequency have been used: very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare \n(< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nPresented in Table 1 are adverse reactions that have been reported in association with the use of \nintravenous trastuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy in pivotal clinical trials and in the \npost-marketing setting. \n \nAll the terms included are based on the highest percentage seen in pivotal clinical trials. In addition, \nterms reported in the post marketing setting are included in Table 1. \n \nTable 1 Undesirable effects reported with intravenous trastuzumab monotherapy or in combination \nwith

Specific \npercentages for these are not available. \n* Observed with combination therapy following anthracyclines and combined with taxanes \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \n\nCardiac dysfunction \n\nCongestive heart failure (NYHA Class II \u2013 IV) is a common adverse reaction associated with the use \nof trastuzumab and has been associated with a fatal outcome (see section 4.4). Signs and symptoms of \ncardiac dysfunction such as dyspnoea, orthopnoea, increased cough, pulmonary oedema, S3 gallop, or \nreduced ventricular ejection fraction, have been observed in patients treated with trastuzumab (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn 3 pivotal clinical trials of adjuvant trastuzumab given in combination with chemotherapy, the \nincidence of grade 3/4 cardiac dysfunction (specifically symptomatic Congestive Heart Failure) was \nsimilar in patients who were administered chemotherapy alone (i.e. did not receive trastuzumab) and \nin patients who were administered trastuzumab sequentially after a taxane (0.3-0.4 %). The rate was \nhighest in patients who were administered trastuzumab concurrently with a taxane (2.0 %). In the \nneoadjuvant setting, the experience of concurrent administration of trastuzumab and low dose \nanthracycline regimen is limited (see section 4.4). \n \nWhen trastuzumab was administered after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy NYHA Class III - IV \nheart failure was observed in 0.6 % of patients in the one-year arm after a median follow-up of 12 \nmonths. In study BO16348, after a median follow-up of 8 years the incidence of severe CHF (NYHA \nClass III & IV) in the trastuzumab 1 year treatment arm was 0.8 %, and the rate of mild symptomatic \nand asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was 4.6 %. \n \nReversibility of severe CHF (defined as a sequence of at least two consecutive LVEF values \u2265 50 % \nafter the event) was evident for 71.4 % of trastuzumab-treated patients. Reversibility of mild \nsymptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was demonstrated for 79.5 % of patients. \nApproximately 17 % of cardiac dysfunction related events occurred after completion of trastuzumab. \n \nIn the pivotal metastatic trials of intravenous trastuzumab, the incidence of cardiac dysfunction varied \nbetween 9 % and 12 % when it was combined with paclitaxel compared with 1 % \u2013 4 % for paclitaxel \nalone. For monotherapy, the rate was 6 % \u2013 9 %. The highest rate of cardiac dysfunction was seen in \npatients receiving trastuzumab concurrently with anthracycline/cyclophosphamide (27 %), and was \nsignificantly higher than for anthracycline/cyclophosphamide alone (7 % \u2013 10 %). In a subsequent trial \nwith prospective monitoring of cardiac function, the incidence of symptomatic CHF was 2.2 % in \npatients receiving trastuzumab and docetaxel, compared with 0 % in patients receiving docetaxel \nalone. Most of the patients (79 %) who developed cardiac dysfunction in these trials experienced an \nimprovement after receiving standard treatment for CHF. \n \nInfusion reactions, allergic-like reactions and hypersensitivity \n\nIt is estimated that approximately 40 % of patients who are treated with trastuzumab will experience \nsome form of infusion-related reaction. However, the majority of infusion-related reactions are mild to \nmoderate in intensity (NCI-CTC grading system) and tend to occur earlier in treatment, i.e. during \ninfusions one, two and three and lessen in frequency in subsequent infusions. Reactions include chills, \nfever, dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, \nrespiratory distress, rash, nausea, vomiting and headache (see section 4.4). The rate of infusion-related \nreactions of all grades varied between studies depending on the indication, the data collection \nmethodology, and whether trastuzumab was given concurrently with chemotherapy or as \nmonotherapy. \n \nSevere anaphylactic reactions requiring immediate additional intervention can occur usually during \neither the first or second infusion of trastuzumab (see section 4.4) and have been associated with a \nfatal outcome. \n \nAnaphylactoid reactions have been observed in isolated cases. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nHaematotoxicity \n\nFebrile neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred very \ncommonly. The frequency of occurrence of hypoprothrombinemia is not known. The risk of \nneutropenia may be slightly increased when trastuzumab is administered with docetaxel following \nanthracycline therapy. \n \n\nPulmonary events \n\nSevere pulmonary adverse reactions occur in association with the use of trastuzumab and have been \nassociated with a fatal outcome. These include, but are not limited to, pulmonary infiltrates, acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute \npulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency (see section 4.4). \n \nDetails of risk minimisation measures that are consistent with the EU Risk Management Plan are \npresented in (section 4.4) Warnings and Precautions. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nIn the neoadjuvant-adjuvant EBC study (BO22227), at a median follow-up exceeding 70 months, \n10.1 % (30/296) of patients treated with trastuzumab intravenous developed antibodies against \ntrastuzumab. \nNeutralizing anti-trastuzumab antibodies were detected in post-baseline samples in 2 of 30 patients in \nthe trastuzumab intravenous arm. \n \nThe clinical relevance of these antibodies is not known. The presence of anti-trastuzumab antibodies \nhad no impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy (determined by pathological Complete Response [pCR] \nand event free survival [EFS]) and safety determined by occurrence of administration related reactions \n(ARRs) of trastuzumab intravenous. \n \nThere are no immunogenicity data available for trastuzumab in gastric cancer. \n \nSwitching treatment between trastuzumab intravenous and trastuzumab subcutaneous formulation and \nvice versa. \n \nStudy MO22982 investigated switching between the trastuzumab intravenous and trastuzumab \nsubcutaneous formulation with a primary objective to evaluate patient preference for either \nintravenous or the subcutaneous route of trastuzumab administration. In this trial, 2 cohorts (one using \nsubcutaneous formulation in vial and one using subcutaneous formulation in administration system) \nwere investigated using a 2-arm, cross-over design with 488 patients being randomized to one of two \ndifferent three-weekly Trastuzumab treatment sequences (intravenous [Cycles 1-4]\u2192 subcutaneous \n[Cycles 5-8], or subcutaneous [Cycles 1-4]\u2192 intravenous [Cycles 5-8]). Patients were either na\u00efve to \ntrastuzumab intravenous treatment (20.3 %) or pre-exposed to trastuzumab intravenous (79.7 %). For \nthe sequence intravenous \u2192 subcutaneous (subcutaneous vial and subcutaneous formulation in \nadministration system cohorts combined), adverse event rates (all grades) were described pre-\nswitching (Cycles 1-4) and post-switching (Cycles 5-8) as 53.8 % vs. 56.4 %, respectively; for the \nsequence subcutaneous \u2192 intravenous (subcutaneous vial and subcutaneous formulation in \nadministration system cohorts combined), adverse event rates (all grades) were described pre- and \npost-switching as 65.4 % vs. 48.7 %, respectively. \nPre-switching rates (Cycles 1-4) for serious adverse events, grade 3 adverse events and treatment \ndiscontinuations due to adverse events were low (< 5 %) and similar to post-switching rates (Cycles 5-\n8). No grade 4 or grade 5 adverse events were reported. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n17 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with overdose in human clinical trials. Single doses of trastuzumab alone \ngreater than 10 mg/kg have not been administered in the clinical trials; a maintenance dose of \n10 mg/kg q3w following a loading dose of 8 mg/kg has been studied in a clinical trial with metastatic \ngastric cancer patients. Doses up to this level were well tolerated. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC03 \n \nOgivri is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nTrastuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal \ngrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Overexpression of HER2 is observed in 20 %-30 % of primary \nbreast cancers. Studies of HER2-positivity rates in gastric cancer (GC) using immunohistochemistry \n(IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) have \nshown that there is a broad variation of HER2-positivity ranging from 6.8 % to 34.0 % for IHC and \n7.1 % to 42.6 % for FISH. Studies indicate that breast cancer patients whose tumours overexpress \nHER2 have a shortened disease-free survival compared to patients whose tumours do not overexpress \nHER2. The extracellular domain of the receptor (ECD, p105) can be shed into the blood stream and \nmeasured in serum samples. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTrastuzumab binds with high affinity and specificity to sub-domain IV, a juxta-membrane region of \nHER2\u2019s extracellular domain. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 inhibits ligand-independent HER2 \nsignalling and prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain, an activation mechanism \nof HER2. As a result, trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit \nthe proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress HER2. Additionally, trastuzumab is a potent \nmediator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, trastuzumab-mediated \nADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared \nwith cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. \n \nDetection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification \n \nDetection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in breast cancer \n\nTrastuzumab should only be used in patients whose tumours have HER2 overexpression or HER2 \ngene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay. HER2 overexpression should be \ndetected using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assessment of fixed tumour blocks (see \nsection 4.4). HER2 gene amplification should be detected using fluorescence in situ hybridisation \n(FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) of fixed tumour blocks. Patients are eligible for \nOgivri treatment if they show strong HER2 overexpression as described by a 3+ score by IHC or a \npositive FISH or CISH result. \n \nTo ensure accurate and reproducible results, the testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory, \nwhich can ensure validation of the testing procedures. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n18 \n\nThe recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns is as stated in Table 2: \n \nTable 2 Recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns in breast cancer \n \nScore Staining pattern HER2 overexpression \n\nassessment \n0 No staining is observed or membrane staining is \n\nobserved in < 10 % of the tumour cells \nNegative \n\n1+ A faint/barely perceptible membrane staining is \ndetected in > 10 % of the tumour cells.

Official recommendations on HER2 testing may also apply. \n \nFor any other method that may be used for the assessment of HER2 protein or gene expression, the \nanalyses should only be performed by laboratories that provide adequate state-of-the-art performance \nof validated methods. Such methods must clearly be precise and accurate enough to demonstrate \noverexpression of HER2 and must be able to distinguish between moderate (congruent with 2+) and \nstrong (congruent with 3+) overexpression of HER2. \n \n\nDetection of HER2 over expression or HER2 gene amplification in gastric cancer \n\nOnly an accurate and validated assay should be used to detect HER2 over expression or HER2 gene \namplification. IHC is recommended as the first testing modality and in cases where HER2 gene \namplification status is also required, either a silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH) or a FISH \ntechnique must be applied. SISH technology is however, recommended to allow for the parallel \nevaluation of tumour histology and morphology. To ensure validation of testing procedures and the \ngeneration of accurate and reproducible results, HER2 testing must be performed in a laboratory \nstaffed by trained personnel. Full instructions on assay performance and results interpretation should \nbe taken from the product information leaflet provided with the HER2 testing assays used. \n \nIn the ToGA (BO18255) trial, patients whose tumours were either IHC3+ or FISH positive were \ndefined as HER2 positive and thus included in the trial. Based on the clinical trial results, the \nbeneficial effects were limited to patients with the highest level of HER2 protein overexpression, \ndefined by a 3+ score by IHC, or a 2+ score by IHC and a positive FISH result. \n \nIn a method comparison study (study D008548) a high degree of concordance (>95 %) was observed \nfor SISH and FISH techniques for the detection of HER2 gene amplification in gastric cancer patients. \nHER2 over expression should be detected using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assessment of \nfixed tumour blocks; HER2 gene amplification should be detected using in situ hybridisation using \neither SISH or FISH on fixed tumour blocks. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nThe recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns is as stated in Table 3: \n \nTable 3 Recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns in gastric cancer \n \nScore Surgical specimen - staining \n\npattern \nBiopsy specimen \u2013 \nstaining pattern \n\nHER2 \noverexpression \nassessment \n\n \n0 \n\nNo reactivity or membranous \nreactivity in < 10 % of tumour \ncells \n\nNo reactivity or membranous \nreactivity in any tumour cell \n\n \nNegative \n\n \n1+ \n\nFaint \u2044 barely perceptible \nmembranous reactivity in \n\u2265 10 % of tumour cells; cells \nare reactive only in part of their \nmembrane \n\nTumour cell cluster with a faint \u2044 \nbarely perceptible membranous \nreactivity irrespective of \npercentage of tumour cells stained \n\n \nNegative \n\n \n2+ \n\nWeak to moderate complete, \nbasolateral or lateral \nmembranous reactivity in \n\u2265 10 % of tumour cells \n\nTumour cell cluster with a weak \nto moderate complete, basolateral \nor lateral membranous reactivity \nirrespective of percentage of \ntumour cells stained \n\n \nEquivocal \n\n \n3+ \n\nStrong complete, basolateral or \nlateral membranous reactivity in \n\u2265 10 % of tumour cells \n\nTumour cell cluster with a strong \ncomplete, basolateral or lateral \nmembranous reactivity \nirrespective of percentage of \ntumour cells stained \n\n \nPositive \n\n \nIn general, SISH or FISH is considered positive if the ratio of the HER2 gene copy number per tumour \ncell to the chromosome 17 copy number is greater than or equal to 2. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \n\nMetastatic breast cancer \n\n \n\nTrastuzumab has been used in clinical trials as monotherapy for patients with MBC who have tumours \nthat overexpress HER2 and who have failed one or more chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic \ndisease (trastuzumab alone). \n \nTrastuzumab has also been used in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel for the treatment of \npatients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. Patients who had previously \nreceived anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy were treated with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 infused \nover 3 hours) with or without trastuzumab. In the pivotal trial of docetaxel (100 mg/m2 infused over \n1 hour) with or without trastuzumab, 60 % of the patients had received prior anthracycline-based \nadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were treated with trastuzumab until progression of disease. \n \nThe efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients who did not receive prior \nadjuvant anthracyclines has not been studied. However, trastuzumab plus docetaxel was efficacious in \npatients whether or not they had received prior adjuvant anthracyclines. \n \nThe test method for HER2 overexpression used to determine eligibility of patients in the pivotal \ntrastuzumab monotherapy and trastuzumab plus paclitaxel clinical trials employed \nimmunohistochemical staining for HER2 of fixed material from breast tumours using the murine \nmonoclonal antibodies CB11 and 4D5. These tissues were fixed in formalin or Bouin\u2019s fixative. This \ninvestigative clinical trial assay performed in a central laboratory utilised a 0 to 3+ scale. Patients \n\n\n\n20 \n\nclassified as staining 2+ or 3+ were included, while those staining 0 or 1+ were excluded. Greater than \n70 % of patients enrolled exhibited 3+ overexpression. The data suggest that beneficial effects were \ngreater among those patients with higher levels of overexpression of HER2 (3+). \n \nThe main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in the pivotal trial of docetaxel, with or \nwithout trastuzumab, was immunohistochemistry. A minority of patients was tested using fluorescence \nin-situ hybridisation (FISH). In this trial, 87 % of patients entered had disease that was IHC3+, and \n95 % of patients entered had disease that was IHC3+ and/or FISH-positive. \n \nWeekly dosing in metastatic breast cancer \nThe efficacy results from the monotherapy and combination therapy studies are summarised in \nTable 4:  \n \nTable 4 Efficacy results from the monotherapy and combination therapy studies \n \nParameter Monotherapy Combination Therapy \n\n Trastuzumab1 \n \n\nN = 172 \n\nTrastuzumab \nplus \n\npaclitaxel2 \nN = 68 \n\nPaclitaxel2 \n \n\nN = 77 \n\nTrastuzumab \nplus \n\ndocetaxel3 \nN = 92 \n\nDocetaxel3 \n \n\nN = 94 \n\nResponse rate \n(95 %CI) \n\n18 % \n(13 - 25) \n\n49 % \n(36 - 61) \n\n17 % \n(9 - 27) \n\n61 % \n(50-71) \n\n34 % \n(25-45) \n\nMedian duration of \nresponse (months) \n(95 %CI) \n\n9.1 \n(5.6-10.3) \n\n8.3 \n(7.3-8.8) \n\n4.6 \n(3.7-7.4) \n\n11.7 \n \n\n(9.3 \u2013 15.0) \n\n5.7 \n(4.6-7.6) \n\nMedian TTP \n(months) (95 %CI) \n\n3.2 \n(2.6-3.5) \n\n7.1 \n(6.2-12.0) \n\n3.0 \n(2.0-4.4) \n\n11.7 \n(9.2-13.5) \n\n6.1 \n(5.4-7.2) \n\nMedian Survival \n(months) (95 %CI) \n\n16.4 \n(12.3-ne) \n\n24.8 \n(18.6-33.7) \n\n17.9 \n(11.2-23.8) \n\n31.2 \n(27.3-40.8) \n\n22.74 \n(19.1-30.8) \n\nTTP = time to progression; \"ne\" indicates that it could not be estimated or it was not yet reached. \n1.

Patients \nassigned to receive trastuzumab were given an initial loading dose of 8 mg/kg, followed by \n6 mg/kg every three weeks for either one or two years. \n\n- The NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies that comprise the joint analysis were designed to \ninvestigate the clinical utility of combining trastuzumab treatment with paclitaxel following AC \nchemotherapy; additionally, the NCCTG N9831 study also investigated adding trastuzumab \nsequentially to AC\u2192P chemotherapy in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery. \n\n- The BCIRG 006 study was designed to investigate combining trastuzumab treatment with \ndocetaxel either following AC chemotherapy or in combination with docetaxel and carboplatin \nin patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nEBC in the HERA trial was limited to operable, primary, invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast, with \naxillary nodes positive or axillary nodes negative if tumours at least 1 cm in diameter. \n \nIn the joint analysis of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies, EBC was limited to women with \noperable breast cancer at high risk, defined as HER2-positive and axillary lymph node positive or \nHER2 positive and lymph node negative with high risk features (tumour size > 1 cm and ER negative \nor tumour size > 2 cm, regardless of hormonal status). \n \nIn the BCIRG 006 study HER2 positive, EBC was defined as either lymph node positive or high risk \nnode negative patients with no (pN0) lymph node involvement, and at least 1 of the following factors: \ntumour size greater than 2 cm, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negative, histological \nand/or nuclear grade 2-3, or age < 35 years). \n \nThe efficacy results from the BO16348 trial following 12 months* and 8 years** median follow-up \nare summarized in Table 6: \n \nTable 6 Efficacy results from study BO16348 \n \n Median follow-up \n\n12 months* \nMedian follow-up \n\n8 years** \nParameter Observation \n\nN = 1693 \nTrastuzumab \n\n1 Year \nN = 1693 \n\nObservation \nN = 1697*** \n\nTrastuzumab \n1 Year \n\nN = 1702*** \nDisease-free survival \n- No. patients with event \n- No. patients without event  \nP-value versus Observation  \nHazard Ratio versus Observation \n\n \n219 (12.9 %)        127 (7.5 %) \n\n1474 (87.1 %)     1566 (92.5 %) \n< 0.0001 \n\n0.54 \n\n \n570 (33.6 %)       471 (27.7 %) \n1127 (66.4 %)     1231 (72.3 %) \n\n< 0.0001 \n0.76 \n\nRecurrence-free survival \n- No. patients with event \n- No. patients without event  \nP-value versus Observation  \nHazard Ratio versus Observation \n\n \n208 (12.3 %)        113 (6.7 %) \n\n1485 (87.7 %)     1580 (93.3 %) \n< 0.0001 \n\n0.51 \n\n \n506 (29.8 %)       399 (23.4 %) \n1191 (70.2 %)     1303 (76.6 %) \n\n< 0.0001 \n0.73 \n\nDistant disease-free survival \n- No. patients with event \n- No. patients without event  \nP-value versus Observation  \nHazard Ratio versus Observation \n\n \n184 (10.9 %)         99 (5.8 %) \n\n1508 (89.1 %)     1594 (94.6 %) \n< 0.0001 \n\n0.50 \n\n \n488 (28.8 %)       399 (23.4 %) \n1209 (71.2 %)     1303 (76.6 %) \n\n< 0.0001 \n0.76 \n\nOverall survival (death) \n- No. patients with event \n- No. patients without event  \nP-value versus Observation  \nHazard Ratio versus Observation \n\n \n40 (2.4 %)           31 (1.8 %) \n\n1653 (97.6 %)     1662 (98.2 %) \n0.24 \n0.75 \n\n \n350 (20.6 %)       278 (16.3 %) \n1347 (79.4 %)     1424 (83.7 %) \n\n0.0005 \n0.76 \n\n*Co-primary endpoint of DFS of 1 year versus observation met the pre-defined statistical boundary \n**Final analysis (including crossover of 52 % of patients from the observation arm to trastuzumab) \n*** There is a discrepancy in the overall sample size due to a small number of patients who were randomised \nafter the cut-off date for the 12-month median follow-up analysis \n \nThe efficacy results from the interim efficacy analysis crossed the protocol pre-specified statistical \nboundary for the comparison of 1-year of trastuzumab versus observation.

For overall survival, the HR was 0.75 (95 % CI 0.51-1.11) in the \nIHC 2+/FISH+ group and the HR was 0.58 (95 % CI 0.41-0.81) in the IHC 3+/FISH+ group. \n \nIn an exploratory subgroup analysis performed in the TOGA (BO18255) trial there was no apparent \nbenefit on overall survival with the addition of trastuzumab in patients with ECOG PS 2 at baseline \n[HR 0.96 (95 % CI 0.51-1.79)], non-measurable [HR 1.78 (95 % CI 0.87-3.66)] and locally advanced \ndisease [HR 1.20 (95 % CI 0.29-4.97)]. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing trastuzumab in all subsets of the paediatric population for \nbreast and gastric cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab were evaluated in a population pharmacokinetic model analysis \nusing pooled data from 1,582 subjects, including patients with HER2 positive MBC, EBC, AGC or \nother tumour types, and healthy volunteers, in 18 Phase I, II and III trials receiving trastuzumab IV. A \ntwo-compartment model with parallel linear and non-linear elimination from the central compartment \ndescribed the trastuzumab concentration-time profile. Due to non-linear elimination, total clearance \nincreased with decreasing concentration. Therefore, no constant value for half-life of trastuzumab can \nbe deduced. The t1/2 decreases with decreasing concentrations within a dosing interval (see Table 16). \nMBC and EBC patients had similar PK parameters (e.g. clearance (CL), the central compartment \nvolume (Vc)) and population-predicted steady-state exposures (Cmin, Cmax and AUC). Linear clearance \nwas 0.136 L/day for MBC, 0.112 L/day for EBC and 0.176 L/day for AGC. The non-linear elimination \n\n\n\n29 \n\nparameter values were 8.81 mg/day for the maximum elimination rate (Vmax) and 8.92 mcg/mL for the \nMichaelis-Menten constant (Km) for the MBC, EBC, and AGC patients. The central compartment \nvolume was 2.62 L for patients with MBC and EBC and 3.63 L for patients with AGC. In the final \npopulation PK model, in addition to primary tumour type, body-weight, serum aspartate \naminotransferase and albumin were identified as a statistically significant covariates affecting the \nexposure of trastuzumab. However, the magnitude of effect of these covariates on trastuzumab \nexposure suggests that these covariates are unlikely to have a clinically meaningful effect on \ntrastuzumab concentrations. \n \nThe population predicted PK exposure values (median with 5th - 95th Percentiles) and PK parameter \nvalues at clinically relevant concentrations (Cmax and Cmin) for MBC, EBC and AGC patients treated \nwith the approved q1w and q3w dosing regimens are shown in Table 14 (cycle 1), Table 15 (steady- \nstate), and Table 16 (PK parameters). \n \nTable 14 Population predicted cycle 1 PK exposure values (median with 5th - 95th percentiles) \nfortrastuzumab intravenous dosing regimens in MBC, EBC and AGC patients \n \n\nRegimen Primary tumour type N \nCmin \n\n(mcg/mL) \nCmax \n\n(mcg/mL) \nAUC0-21days \n\n(mcg.day/mL) \n \n\n8 mg/kg + \n6 mg/kg q3w \n\n \nMBC \n\n \n805 \n\n \n28.7 \n\n(2.9 - 46.3) \n\n \n182 \n\n(134 - 280) \n\n \n1376 \n\n(728 - 1998) \n \n\nEBC \n \n\n390 \n30.9 \n\n(18.7 - 45.5) \n176 \n\n(127 - 227) \n1390 \n\n(1039 - 1895) \n\n \nAGC \n\n \n274 \n\n23.1 \n(6.1 - 50.3) \n\n132 \n(84.2 \u2013 225) \n\n1109 \n(588 \u2013 1938) \n\n \n4 mg/kg + \n\n2 mg/kg qw \n\n \nMBC \n\n \n805 \n\n37.4 \n(8.7 - 58.9) \n\n76.5 \n(49.4 - 114) \n\n1073 \n(597 \u2013 1584) \n\n \nEBC \n\n \n390 \n\n38.9 \n(25.3 - 58.8) \n\n76.0 \n(54.7 - 104) \n\n1074 \n(783 - 1502) \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nTable 15 Population predicted steady state PK exposure values (median with 5th - 95th percentiles)for \ntrastuzumab intravenous dosing regimens in MBC, EBC and AGC patients \n \n \nRegimen \n\n \nPrimary \n\ntumour type \n\n \nN \n\n \nCmin,ss* \n\n(mcg/mL) \n\n \nCmax,ss** \n\n(mcg/mL) \n\n \nAUCss, 0-21days \n\n(mcg.day/mL) \n\nTime to \nsteady- \nstate*** \n(week) \n\n \n8 mg/kg + \n\n6 mg/kg q3w \n\n \nMBC \n\n \n805 \n\n44.2 \n (1.8 - 85.4) \n\n179  \n(123 - 266) \n\n1736  \n(618 - 2756) \n\n \n12 \n\n \nEBC \n\n \n390 \n\n53.8  \n(28.7 - 85.8) \n\n184  \n(134 - 247) \n\n1927  \n(1332 -2771) \n\n \n15 \n\n \nAGC \n\n \n274 \n\n32.9 \n(6.1 \u2013 88.9) \n\n131  \n(72.5 -251) \n\n1338  \n(557 - 2875) \n\n \n9 \n\n \n4 mg/kg + \n\n2 mg/kg qw \n\n \nMBC \n\n \n805 \n\n63.1  \n(11.7 - 107) \n\n107 \n (54.2 - 164) \n\n1710  \n(581 - 2715) \n\n \n12 \n\n \nEBC \n\n \n390 \n\n72.6  \n(46 - 109) \n\n115  \n(82.6 - 160) \n\n1893  \n(1309 -2734) \n\n \n14 \n\n*Cmin,ss \u2013 Cmin at steady state \n**Cmax,ss = Cmax at steady state \n*** time to 90% of steady-state \n \nTable 16 Population predicted PK parameter values at steady state for trastuzumab intravenous dosing \nregimens in MBC, EBC and AGC patients \n \n\n \nRegimen \n\n \nPrimary \n\ntumour type \n\n \nN \n\nTotal CL range \nfrom Cmax,ss \n\nto Cmin,ss \n(L/day) \n\n \nt1/2 range from Cmax,ss to \n\nCmin,ss \n(day) \n\n8 mg/kg + \n6 mg/kg q3w \n\nMBC 805 0.183 - 0.302 15.1 - 23.3 \n\nEBC 390 0.158 - 0.253 17.5 \u2013 26.6 \n\nAGC 274 0.189 - 0.337 12.6 - 20.6 \n\n4 mg/kg + \n2 mg/kg qw \n\nMBC 805 0.213 - 0.259 17.2 - 20.4 \n\nEBC 390 0.184 - 0.221 19.7 - 23.2 \n \nTrastuzumab washout \nTrastuzumab washout period was assessed following q1w or q3w intravenous administration using the \npopulation PK model.

Trastuzumab is not genotoxic.  \n \nNo long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of \ntrastuzumab, or to determine its effects on fertility in males. \n \n \n6.

Any remaining reconstituted solution should be \ndiscarded. \n \nSolutions of Ogivri for intravenous infusion are physically and chemically stable in polyvinylchloride, \npolyethylene or polypropylene bags containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for \ninjection for 24 hours at temperatures not exceeding 30\u00b0C. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution and Ogivri infusion solution should \nbe used immediately. The product is not intended to be stored after reconstitution and dilution unless \nthis has taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions. If not used immediately, in-use \nstorage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see sections 6.3 and 6.6. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nOgivri 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n15 mL clear glass type I vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film containing \n150 mg of trastuzumab. \n \nEach carton contains one vial. \n \nOgivri 420 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n50 mL clear glass type I vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film containing \n420 mg of trastuzumab. \n \nEach carton contains one vial. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nOgivri should be carefully handled during reconstitution. Causing excessive foaming during \nreconstitution or shaking the reconstituted solution may result in problems with the amount of Ogivri \nthat can be withdrawn from the vial. \n \nThe reconstituted solution should not be frozen.  \n \nOgivri 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \nAppropriate aseptic technique should be used. Each 150 mg vial of Ogivri is reconstituted with 7.2 mL \nof sterile water for injections (not supplied). Use of other reconstitution solvents should be avoided. \nThis yields a 7.4 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab, at \na pH of approximately 6.0. A volume overage of 4 % ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be \nwithdrawn from each vial. \n \nOgivri 420 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \nEach 420 mg vial of Ogivri is reconstituted with 20 mL of sterile water for injections (not supplied). \nUse of other reconstitution solvents should be avoided. This yields a 21 mL solution for single-dose \nuse, containing approximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab, at a pH of approximately 6.0. A volume \noverage of 4.8 % ensures that the labelled dose of 420 mg can be withdrawn from each vial. \n \n\nOgivri vial  Volume of sterile water for \ninjections \n\n Final concentration \n\n150 mg vial + 7.2 mL = 21 mg/mL \n420 mg vial + 20 mL = 21 mg/mL \n\n \nInstructions for reconstitution \n \n1) Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the appropriate volume (as noted above) of sterile water for \ninjections in the vial containing the lyophilised Ogivri, directing the stream into the lyophilised cake. \n \n2) Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE! \n \nSlight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed \nfor approximately 5 minutes. The reconstituted Ogivri results in a colourless to pale yellow transparent \nsolution and should be essentially free of visible particulates. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nDetermine the volume of the solution required: \n \n\u2022    based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly dose of 2 mg \ntrastuzumab/kg body weight: \n \n\nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/kg for loading or 2 mg/kg for maintenance) \n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n\n \n\u2022    based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly dose of \n6 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n \n\nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (8 mg/kg for loading or 6 mg/kg for maintenance) \n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n\n \nThe appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial and added to an infusion bag \ncontaining 250 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection. Do not use with \nglucose-containing solutions (see section 6.2). The bag should be gently inverted to mix the solution in \norder to avoid foaming. Once the infusion is prepared it should be administered immediately. If diluted \naseptically, it may be stored for 24 hours (do not store above 30\u00b0C). \n \nParenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration \nprior to administration. \n \nOgivri is for single-use only, as the product contains no preservatives.  \n \nNo incompatibilities between Ogivri and polyvinylchloride, polyethylene or polypropylene bags have \nbeen observed. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Ogivri is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are given Ogivri  \n3. How Ogivri is given \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Ogivri \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ogivri is and what it is used for \n \nOgivri contains the active substance trastuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal \nantibodies attach to specific proteins or antigens. Trastuzumab is designed to bind selectively to an \nantigen called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 is found in large amounts on \nthe surface of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth. When Ogivri binds to HER2 it stops \nthe growth of such cells and causes them to die. \n \nYour doctor may prescribe Ogivri for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer when: \n\u2022 You have early breast cancer, with high levels of a protein called HER2. \n\u2022 You have metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumour) \n\nwith high levels of HER2. Ogivri may be prescribed in combination with the chemotherapy \nmedicine paclitaxel or docetaxel as first treatment for metastatic breast cancer or it may be \nprescribed alone if other treatments have proved unsuccessful. It is also used in combination \nwith medicines called aromatase inhibitors with patients with high levels of HER2 and hormone \nreceptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (cancer that is sensitive to the presence of female sex \nhormones). \n\n\u2022 You have metastatic gastric cancer with high levels of HER2, when it is in combination with \nthe other cancer medicines capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Ogivri  \n \n\nDo not use Ogivri: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to trastuzumab, murine (mouse) proteins, or any of the other ingredients \n\nof this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n\n\n48 \n\n\u2022 if you have severe breathing problems at rest due to your cancer or if you need oxygen \ntreatment. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nYour doctor will closely supervise your therapy. \n \nHeart checks \nTreatment with Ogivri alone or with a taxane may affect the heart, especially if you have ever used an \nanthracycline (taxanes and anthracyclines are two other kinds of medicine used to treat cancer). \nThe effects may be moderate to severe and could cause death. Therefore, your heart function will be \nchecked before, during (every three months) and after (up to two to five years) treatment with Ogivri. \nIf you develop any signs of heart failure (inadequate pumping of blood by the heart), your heart \nfunction may be checked more frequently (every six to eight weeks), you may receive treatment for \nheart failure or you may have to stop Ogivri treatment. \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Ogivri if: \n \n\u2022 you have had heart failure, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease (heart murmurs), high \n\nblood pressure, taken any high blood pressure medicine or are currently taking any high blood \npressure medicine. \n\n \n\u2022 you have ever had or are currently using a medicine called doxorubicin or epirubicin (medicines \n\nused to treat cancer). These medicines (or any other anthracyclines) can damage heart muscle \nand increase the risk of heart problems with Ogivri. \n\n \n\u2022 you suffer from breathlessness, especially if you are currently using a taxane. Ogivri can cause \n\nbreathing difficulties, especially when it is first given. This could be more serious if you are \nalready breathless. Very rarely, patients with severe breathing difficulties before treatment \nhave died when they were given Ogivri. \n\n \n\u2022 you have ever had any other treatment for cancer. \n \nIf you receive Ogivri with any other medicine to treat cancer, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, an \naromatase inhibitor, capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil, or cisplatin you should also read the patient \ninformation leaflets for these products. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nOgivri is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Ogivri \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any \nother medicines. \n \nIt may take up to 7 months for Ogivri to be removed from the body. Therefore, you should tell your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse that you have had Ogivri if you start any new medicine in the 7 months after \nstopping treatment. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nPregnancy \n \n\u2022 You should use effective contraception during treatment with Ogivri and for at least 7 \n\nmonths after treatment has ended. \n\u2022 Your doctor will advise you of the risks and benefits of taking Ogivri during pregnancy. In \n\nrare cases, a reduction in the amount of (amniotic) fluid that surrounds the developing baby \nwithin the womb has been observed in pregnant women receiving trastuzumab. This \ncondition may be harmful to your baby in the womb and has been associated with the lungs \nnot developing fully resulting in foetal death. \n\n \nBreast-feeding \n \nDo not breast-feed your baby during Ogivri therapy and for 7 months after the last dose of Ogivri as \nthis medicine may pass to your baby through your breast milk. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for \nadvice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nOgivri may affect your ability to drive a car or operate machines. If during treatment you experience \nsymptoms, such as chills or fever, you should not drive or use machines until these symptoms \ndisappear. \n \nOgivri contains sorbitol (E420) \nOgivri 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \nThis medicine contains 115.2 mg sorbitol in each vial.  \n \nOgivri 420 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \nThis medicine contains 322.6 mg sorbitol in each vial.  \n \nSorbitol is a source of fructose. If you have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic \ndisorder, you must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose, which \nmay cause serious side effects.  \nYou must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you have HFI or if you can no longer take \nsweet foods or drinks because you feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects such as bloating, stomach \ncramps or diarrhoea. \n \n \n3. How Ogivri is given \n \nBefore starting the treatment your doctor will determine the amount of HER2 in your tumour. Only \npatients with a large amount of HER2 will be treated with Ogivri. Ogivri should only be given by a \ndoctor or nurse. Your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. The \ndose of Ogivri depends on your body weight. \n \nThe first dose of your treatment is given over 90 minutes and you will be observed by a health \nprofessional while it is being given in case you have any side effects. If the first dose is well tolerated \nthe next doses may be given over 30 minutes (see section 2 under \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). The \nnumber of infusions you receive will depend on how you respond to the treatment. Your doctor will \ndiscuss this with you. \n  \nOgivri is given as an infusion into a vein (intravenous infusion, drip), this intravenous formulation is \nnot for subcutaneous use and should be given as an intravenous infusion only. \n \nFor early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer, Ogivri is given every 3 \nweeks. Ogivri may also be given once a week for metastatic breast cancer. \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nIn order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the medicine \nbeing prepared and given is Ogivri (trastuzumab) and not trastuzumab emtansine. \n \nIf you stop using Ogivri \nDo not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor first. All doses should be taken at the \nright time every week or every three weeks (depending on your dosing schedule). This helps your \nmedicine work as well as it can. \n \nIt may take up to 7 months for Ogivri to be removed from your body. Therefore, your doctor may \ndecide to continue to check your heart functions, even after you finish treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nSome of these side effects may be serious and may lead to hospitalisation. \n \nDuring an Ogivri infusion, chills, fever and other flu like symptoms may occur. These are very \ncommon (may affect more than 1 in 10 people).  \nOther infusion-related symptoms are: feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, pain, increased muscle \ntension and shaking, headache, dizziness, breathing difficulties, wheezing, high or low blood \npressure, heart rhythm disturbances (palpitations, heart fluttering or irregular heart beat), swelling \nof the face and lips, rash and feeling tired.  \nSome of these symptoms can be serious and some patients have died (see section 2 under \n\u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nThese effects mainly occur with the first intravenous infusion (\u201cdrip\u201d into your vein) and during the \nfirst few hours after the start of the infusion. They are usually temporary. You will be observed by a \nhealth care professional during the infusion and for at least six hours after the start of the first infusion \nand for two hours after the start of other infusions. If you develop a reaction, they will slow down or \nstop the infusion and may give you treatment to counteract the side effects. The infusion may be \ncontinued after the symptoms improve. \n \nOccasionally, symptoms start later than six hours after the infusion begins. If this happens to you, \ncontact your doctor immediately. Sometimes, symptoms may improve and then get worse later. \n \nSerious side effects \nOther side effects can occur at any time during treatment with Ogivri, not just related to an infusion. \nTell a doctor or nurse straight away, if you notice any of the following side effects:  \n\u2022 Heart problems can sometimes occur during treatment and occasionally after treatment has \n\nstopped and can be serious. They include weakening of the heart muscle possibly leading to heart \nfailure, inflammation of the lining around the heart and heart rhythm disturbances. This can lead \nto symptoms such as breathlessness (including breathlessness at night), cough, fluid retention \n(swelling) in the legs or arms, palpitations (heart fluttering or irregular heart beat) (see 2. Heart \nchecks). \n\n \nYour doctor will monitor your heart regularly during and after treatment but you should tell your \ndoctor immediately if you notice any of the above symptoms. \n\u2022 Tumour lysis syndrome (a group of metabolic complications occurring after cancer treatment \n\ncharacterised by high blood levels of potassium and phosphate, and low blood levels of \ncalcium). Symptoms may include kidney problems (weakness, shortness of breath, fatigue and \n\n\n\n51 \n\nconfusion), heart problems (fluttering of the heart or a faster or slower heartbeat), seizures, \nvomiting or diarrhoea and tingling in the mouth, hands or feet. \n\n \nIf you experience any of the above symptoms when your treatment with Ogivri has finished, you \nshould see your doctor and tell them that you have previously been treated with Ogivri. \n \nVery common side effects: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\u2022 infections \n\u2022 diarrhoea \n\u2022 constipation \n\u2022 heartburn (dyspepsia) \n\u2022 fatigue \n\u2022 skin rashes \n\u2022 chest pain \n\u2022 abdominal (stomach) pain \n\u2022 joint pain \n\u2022 low counts of red blood cells and white blood cells (which help fight infection) sometimes with \n\nfever \n\u2022 muscle pain \n\u2022 conjunctivitis (discharge with itching of the eyes and crusty eyelids) \n\u2022 watery eyes \n\u2022 nose bleeds \n\u2022 runny nose \n\u2022 hair loss \n\u2022 tremor \n\u2022 hot flush \n\u2022 dizziness \n\u2022 nail disorders \n\u2022 weight loss \n\u2022 loss of appetite \n\u2022 inability to sleep (insomnia) \n\u2022 altered taste \n\u2022 low platelet count \n\u2022 bruising \n\u2022 numbness or tingling of the fingers and toes \n\u2022 redness, swelling or sores in your mouth and/or throat \n\u2022 pain, swelling, redness or tingling of hands and/or feet \n\u2022 breathlessness \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 cough \n\u2022 vomiting \n\u2022 nausea (feeling sick) \n \nCommon side effects: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\u2022 allergic reactions  \n\u2022 dry mouth and skin \n\u2022 throat infections  \n\u2022 dry eyes \n\u2022 bladder and skin infections  \n\u2022 sweating \n\u2022 shingles  \n\u2022 feeling weak and unwell \n\n\n\n52 \n\n\u2022 inflammation of the breast  \n\u2022 anxiety \n\u2022 inflammation of the liver  \n\u2022 depression \n\u2022 kidney disorders  \n\u2022 abnormal thinking \n\u2022 increased muscle tone or tension (hypertonia)  \n\u2022 asthma \n\u2022 infection of lungs \n\u2022 pain in the arms and/or legs  \n\u2022 lung disorders \n\u2022 itchy rash  \n\u2022 back pain \n\u2022 sleepiness (somnolence)  \n\u2022 neck pain \n\u2022 haemorrhoids (swelling of blood vessels around the back passage)  \n\u2022 bone pain \n\u2022 itchiness  \n\u2022 acne \n\u2022 leg cramps \n \nUncommon side effects: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\u2022 deafness \n\u2022 bumpy rash \n\u2022 blood infection \n \nRare side effects: may affect up to 1 in 1000 people \n\u2022 muscle weakness \n\u2022 jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes) \n\u2022 inflammation or scarring of the lungs \n \nSide effects of not known frequency: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data \n\u2022 abnormal or impaired blood clotting \n\u2022 anaphylactic reactions (serious sudden allergic reaction with symptoms such as rash, itchy skin, \n\ndifficulty breathing or feeling dizzy or faint) \n\u2022 high potassium levels \n\u2022 swelling of the brain \n\u2022 swelling or bleeding at the back of the eyes \n\u2022 shock (a dangerous decrease of blood pressure causing symptoms like rapid, shallow breathing, \n\ncold, clammy skin, a rapid, weak pulse, dizziness, weakness and fainting) \n\u2022 swelling of the lining of the heart \n\u2022 slow heart rate \n\u2022 abnormal heart rhythm \n\u2022 respiratory distress \n\u2022 respiratory failure \n\u2022 acute accumulation of fluid in the lungs \n\u2022 acute narrowing of the airways \n\u2022 abnormally low oxygen levels in the blood \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing when lying flat \n\u2022 liver damage/failure \n\u2022 swelling of the face, lips and throat \n\u2022 kidney failure \n\n\n\n53 \n\n\u2022 abnormally low levels of fluid around baby in womb \n\u2022 failure of lungs to develop in the womb \n\u2022 abnormal kidney development in the womb \n \nSome of the side effects you experience may be due to your underlying breast cancer.

Causing excessive foaming during \nreconstitution or shaking the reconstituted Ogivri may result in problems with the amount of \nOgivri that can be withdrawn from the vial. \n \nOgivri 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nAppropriate aseptic technique should be used. Each 150 mg vial of Ogivri is reconstituted with \n7.2 mL of sterile water for injections (not supplied). Use of other reconstitution solvents should be \navoided. This yields a 7.4 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL \ntrastuzumab. A volume overage of 4 % ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be withdrawn \nfrom each vial. \n \nOgivri 420 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nAppropriate aseptic technique should be used. Each 420 mg vial of Ogivri is reconstituted with 20 mL \nof sterile water for injections (not supplied). Use of other reconstitution solvents should be avoided. \nThis yields a 21 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab. A \nvolume overage of 4.8 % ensures that the labelled dose of 420 mg can be withdrawn from each vial. \n \n\nOgivri vial  Volume of sterile water for \ninjections \n\n Final concentration \n\n150 mg vial + 7.2 mL = 21 mg/mL \n420 mg vial + 20 mL = 21 mg/mL \n\n \nInstructions for reconstitution \n \n1) Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the appropriate volume (as noted above) of water for \ninjections in the vial containing the lyophilised Ogivri, directing the stream into the lyophilised \ncake. \n \n2) Swirl vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE! \n \nSlight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed \nfor approximately 5 minutes. The reconstituted Ogivri results in a colourless to pale yellow \ntransparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates. \n \nDetermine the volume of the solution required: \n\u2022 based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly dose of \n2 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n \nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/kg for loading or 2 mg/kg for maintenance) \n\n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n \n\u2022 based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly dose of \n6 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n \n \nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (8 mg/kg for loading or 6 mg/kg for maintenance) \n\n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n \n\n\n\n57 \n\nThe appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial and added to a \npolyvinylchloride, polyethylene or polypropylene infusion bag containing 250 mL of sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Do not use with glucose-containing solutions. The \nbag should be gently inverted to mix the solution in order to avoid foaming. Parenteral solutions \nshould be inspected visually for particulates and discoloration prior to administration. Once the \ninfusion is prepared it should be administered immediately. If diluted aseptically, it may be stored \nfor 24 hours (do not store above 30\u00b0C). \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

function will be checked before, during (every three months) and after (up to two to five years) treatment with ogivri. if you develop any signs of heart failure (inadequate pumping of blood by the heart), your heart function may be checked more frequently (every six to eight weeks), you may receive treatment for heart failure or you may have to stop ogivri treatment. talk to your doctor,

medicines (or any other anthracyclines) can damage heart muscle and increase the risk of heart problems with ogivri. you suffer from breathlessness, especially if you are currently using a taxane. ogivri can cause breathing difficulties, especially when it is first given. this could be more serious if you are already breathless. very rarely, patients with severe breathing difficulties before treatment have died when they were given ogivri. you have ever had any other treatment for cancer. if you receive ogivri with any other medicine to treat cancer, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, an

{"Title": "3. how ogivri is given", "Section_Content": "before starting the treatment your doctor will determine the amount of her2 in your tumour. only patients with a large amount of her2 will be treated with ogivri. ogivri should only be given by a doctor or nurse. your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. the dose of ogivri depends on your body weight. the first dose of your treatment is given over 90 minutes and you will be observed by a health professional while it is being given in case you have any side effects. if the first dose is well tolerated the next doses may be given over 30 minutes (see section 2 under \"warnings and precautions\"). the number of infusions you receive will depend on how you respond to the treatment. your doctor will discuss this with you. ogivri is given as an infusion into a vein (intravenous infusion, drip), this intravenous formulation is not for subcutaneous use and should be given as an intravenous infusion only. for early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer, ogivri is given every 3 weeks. ogivri may also be given once a week for metastatic breast cancer. in order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the medicine being prepared and given is ogivri (trastuzumab) and not trastuzumab emtansine. if you stop using ogivri do not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor first. all doses should be taken at the right time every week or every three weeks (depending on your dosing schedule). this helps your medicine work as well as it can. it may take up to 7 months for ogivri to be removed from your body. therefore, your doctor may decide to continue to check your heart functions, even after you finish treatment. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "ogivri", "Type":

effects", "Section_Content": "like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. some of these side effects may be serious and may lead to hospitalisation. during an ogivri infusion, chills, fever and other flu like symptoms may occur. these are very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). other infusion-related symptoms are: feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, pain, increased muscle tension and shaking, headache, dizziness, breathing difficulties, wheezing, high or low blood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances (palpitations, heart fluttering or irregular heart beat), swelling of the face and lips, rash and feeling tired. some of these symptoms can be serious and some patients have died (see section 2 under \"warnings and precautions\"). these effects mainly occur with the first intravenous infusion (\"drip\" into your vein) and during the first few hours after the start of the infusion. they are usually temporary. you will be observed by a health care professional during the infusion and for at least six hours after the start of the first infusion and for two hours after the start of other infusions. if you develop a reaction, they will slow down or stop the infusion and may give you treatment to counteract the side effects. the infusion may be continued after the symptoms improve. occasionally, symptoms start later than six hours after the infusion begins. if this happens to you, contact your doctor immediately. sometimes, symptoms may improve and then get worse later. serious side effects other side effects can occur at any time during treatment with ogivri, not just related to an infusion. tell a doctor or nurse straight away, if you notice any of the following side effects: heart problems can sometimes occur during treatment and occasionally after treatment has stopped and can be serious. they include weakening of the heart muscle possibly leading to heart failure, inflammation of the lining around the heart and heart rhythm disturbances. this can lead to symptoms such as breathlessness (including breathlessness at night), cough, fluid retention (swelling) in the legs or arms, palpitations (heart fluttering or irregular heart beat) (see 2. heart checks). your doctor will monitor your heart regularly during and after treatment but you should tell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the above symptoms. tumour lysis syndrome (a group of metabolic complications occurring after cancer treatment characterised by high blood levels of potassium and phosphate, and low blood levels of calcium). symptoms may include kidney problems (weakness, shortness of breath, fatigue and 51 confusion), heart problems (fluttering of the heart or a faster or slower heartbeat), seizures, vomiting or diarrhoea and tingling in the mouth, hands or feet. if you experience any of the above symptoms when your treatment with ogivri has finished, you should see your doctor and tell them that you have previously been treated with ogivri. very common side effects: may affect more than 1 in 10 people infections diarrhoea constipation heartburn (dyspepsia) fatigue skin rashes chest pain abdominal (stomach) pain joint pain low counts of red blood cells and white blood cells (which help fight infection) sometimes with fever muscle pain conjunctivitis (discharge with itching of the

anaphylactic reactions (serious sudden allergic reaction with symptoms such as rash, itchy skin, difficulty breathing or feeling dizzy or faint) high potassium levels swelling of the brain swelling or bleeding at the back of the eyes shock (a dangerous decrease of blood pressure causing symptoms like rapid, shallow breathing, cold, clammy skin, a rapid, weak pulse, dizziness, weakness and fainting)
