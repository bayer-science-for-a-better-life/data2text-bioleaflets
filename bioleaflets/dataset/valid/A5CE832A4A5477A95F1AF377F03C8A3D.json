This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nGIAPREZA 2.5 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach ml of concentrate contains angiotensin II acetate equivalent to 2.5 mg angiotensin II. \n\nOne vial of 1 ml concentrate for solution for infusion contains 2.5 mg of angiotensin II. \n\nOne vial of 2 ml concentrate for solution for infusion contains 5 mg of angiotensin II. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \nClear and colourless solution.  \npH: 5.0 to 6.0 \nOsmolarity: 130 to 170 mOsm/kg  \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nGIAPREZA is indicated for the treatment of refractory hypotension in adults with septic or other \ndistributive shock who remain hypotensive despite adequate volume restitution and application of \ncatecholamines and other available vasopressor therapies (see section 5.1).  \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nGIAPREZA should be prescribed by a physician experienced in the treatment of shock and is intended \nfor use in an acute and hospital setting. \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended starting dosage of GIAPREZA is 20 nanograms (ng)/kg per minute via continuous \nintravenous infusion. \n\n must be diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection prior to use. One or two \nmillilitres of GIAPREZA must be diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to \nachieve a final concentration of 5,000 ng/mL or 10,000 ng/mL (see Table 1).  \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTable 1: Preparation of diluted solution \n\nFluid \nRestricted? \n\nVial \nstrength \n\nWithdraw \namount \n(mL) \n\nInfusion \nbag size \n(mL) \n\nFinal \nconcentration \n(ng/mL) \n\nNo 2.5 mg/mL 1 500 5,000 \n\nYes \n2.5 mg/mL 1 250 10,000 \n\n5 mg/2 mL 2 500 10,000 \n\nWhen initiating GIAPREZA, it is important to closely monitor blood pressure response and adjust \ndose accordingly. \n\nOnce an infusion has been established, the dose may be titrated as frequently as every 5 minutes in \nsteps of up to 15 ng/kg per minute, as needed, depending on the patient\u2019s condition and target mean \narterial pressure. Approximately one in every four patients experienced transient hypertension with the \nangiotensin II 20 ng/kg per minute starting dose in clinical trials (see section 4.8), thus needing dose \ndown-titration. For critically ill patients, the usual target mean arterial pressure is 65 \u2013 75 mmHg.  Do \nnot exceed 80 ng/kg per minute during the first 3 hours of treatment.  Maintenance doses should not \nexceed 40 ng/kg per minute.  Doses as low as 1.25 ng/kg per minute may be used.  \n\nIt is important to administer GIAPREZA at the lowest compatible dose to achieve or maintain \nadequate arterial blood pressure and tissue perfusion (see section 4.4). The median duration of \ntreatment in clinical trials was 48 hours (range: 3.5 to 168 hours). \n\nIn order to minimise the risk of adverse events derived from prolonged vasoconstriction, treatment \nwith GIAPREZA should be withdrawn once underlying shock is sufficiently improved (see section 4.4 \nand 4.8). Down-titrate by gradual decrements of up to 15 ng/kg per minute, as needed, based on blood \npressure, in order to avoid hypotension due to abrupt withdrawal (see section 4.4). \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \nThere are limited efficacy and safety data of GIAPREZA in patients > 75 years. No special dose \nadjustment is required in patients over 75 years. As for other age groups, it is important to closely \nmonitor blood pressure response and adjust dose accordingly. \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment \nNo special dose adjustment is required in patients with renal insufficiency or those with hepatic \nimpairment (see section 5.2). As for other patient populations, it is important to closely monitor blood \npressure response and adjust dose accordingly. \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of GIAPREZA in children less than 18 years old has not yet been established. \nNo data are available. \n\nMethod of administration \n\nGIAPREZA should only be administered by continuous intravenous infusion under close monitoring \nof haemodynamics and end-organ perfusion. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nFor intravenous use only after dilution. GIAPREZA is recommended to be administered via a central \nvenous line.  \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe clinical experience with GIAPREZA is limited to septic or other distributive shock. The use of \nGIAPREZA is not recommended in other types of shock (e.g.: cardiogenic shock, etc) as patients with \nnon-distributive shocks were excluded from clinical trials (see section 5.1). \n \nThromboembolic events \n \nThromboembolic events have been reported with the use of angiotensin II in clinical trials. The major \nimbalance compared to placebo was in venous thromboembolism (6.1% vs 0%) (see section 4.8). \nConcurrent venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (VTE) should be used unless contraindicated during \ntreatment with GIAPREZA. Non-pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis may be considered where \npharmacologic prophylaxis is contraindicated. \n \nPeripheral ischaemia \n \nPeripheral ischaemia has been reported with the use of angiotensin II (see section 4.8). It is important \nto administer GIAPREZA at the lowest compatible dose to achieve or maintain adequate mean arterial \npressure and tissue perfusion. \n \nWithdrawal of therapy \n \nGIAPREZA should be gradually decreased since patients may experience hypotension or worsening of \nthe underlying diagnosis of shock on abrupt withdrawal or premature discontinuation. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 2.5 mg/ml, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. No in vitro metabolism studies have been performed with \nGIAPREZA. \n \nConcomitant administration of GIAPREZA and other vasopressors may have an additive effect on \nmean arterial pressure (MAP). The addition of GIAPREZA may require a reduction in doses of other \nvasopressors. \n \nPatients who have recently received angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be more \nsensitive to GIAPREZA\u2019s action with an increased response. Patients who have recently received \nangiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may be less sensitive to GIAPREZA\u2019s actions with a reduced \nresponse. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of angiotensin II in pregnant women. Animal studies \nare insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity. Use during pregnancy should be avoided if \npossible and the potential benefit to the patient weighed against any possible risk to the foetus. \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether angiotensin II or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nsuckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with \nGIAPREZA. \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no data available on the potential effects on fertility in humans. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nNot relevant. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe adverse reactions described in this section were identified in the pivotal clinical study (N = 163 \ntreated with GIAPREZA).  The most frequent adverse reactions reported more often in the \nGIAPREZA arm are thromboembolic events (12.9% vs 5.1%) and transient hypertension. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nTable 2 lists the adverse reactions recorded in clinical studies in the total safety population treated with \nGIAPREZA by MedDRA system organ class and frequency. Frequency categories are defined as: very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 \nto < 1/1,000), and very rare (< 1/10,000). \n\nTable 2: Frequency of adverse reactions \nMedDRA System Organ Class Very common Common \n\nCardiac disorders Tachycardia \nVascular disorders Thromboembolic eventsa \n\nTransient hypertensionb\nPeripheral ischaemia \n\na  Grouped term to include arterial and venous thrombotic events \nb Defined as an increase in mean arterial pressure > 100 mmHg  \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nTransient hypertension \n\nA total of 37 patients (23%) experienced transient hypertension with the angiotensin II 20 ng/kg/min \nstarting dose. Transient hypertension may be promptly mitigated by dose down-titration (see \nsection 4.2). \n\n\n\n6 \n\nThromboembolic events \n \nMore patients experienced venous and arterial thromboembolic events in the GIAPREZA arm \ncompared to placebo arm in the Phase 3 (ATHOS-3) study (21 [12.9%] vs 8 [5.1%]). The major \nimbalance corresponded to venous thromboembolism (10 [6.1%] vs 0 [0%] respectively). Of these, \n7 cases corresponded to deep vein thrombosis. Two (1.2%) patients in the GIAPREZA arm \nexperienced a fatal thromboembolic event compared with no patients in the placebo arm. Concurrent \nvenous thromboembolism prophylaxis should be used unless contraindicated during treatment with \nGIAPREZA (see section 4.4).  \n \nPeripheral ischaemia \n \nMore patients experienced peripheral ischaemia in the GIAPREZA arm compared to the placebo arm \n(7 [4.3%] vs 4 [2.5%]).  Of them, 5 cases (3.1%) in the GIAPREZA arm and 3 (1.9%) cases in the \nplacebo arm were considered serious.  One patient in each arm discontinued treatment as a result.  \nPeripheral ischaemia may be a consequence of the mechanism of action of GIAPREZA. It is important \nto administer GIAPREZA at the lowest compatible dose to achieve or maintain adequate mean arterial \npressure and tissue perfusion. In order to minimise adverse events derived from prolonged \nvasoconstriction, treatment should be withdrawn as soon as the underlying shock is sufficiently \nimproved (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose may result in severe hypertension. Down-titration of therapy, careful observation, and \ninitiation of appropriate supportive measures are the indicated treatment of overdose of angiotensin II.   \nHypertensive effects are expected to be brief because the half-life of angiotensin II is less than one \nminute. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Cardiac therapy, other cardiac stimulants, ATC code: C01CX09 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nAngiotensin II raises blood pressure by vasoconstriction; increased aldosterone release via direct \naction of angiotensin II on the vessel wall is mediated by binding to the G-protein-coupled \nangiotensin II receptor type 1 on vascular smooth muscle cells which stimulates Ca2+/calmodulin-\ndependent phosphorylation of myosin and causes smooth muscle contraction. \n \nGIAPREZA is titrated to effect for each individual patient. In the ATHOS-3 trial, the median time to \nincrease blood pressure was approximately 5 minutes. The effect on blood pressure is sustained for at \nleast the first three hours of continuous intravenous infusion.  Due to the short half-life of GIAPREZA \n(less than one minute), an abrupt withdrawal of angiotensin may lead to rebound hypotension (see \nsection 4.4). Therefore, once underlying shock is sufficiently improved, a slow down-titration is \nrecommended by gradual decrements of up to 15 ng/kg per minute, as needed, based on blood pressure \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe Angiotensin II for the Treatment of High-Output Shock (ATHOS-3) was a Phase 3 randomised, \nplacebo-controlled, double-blind, international, multi-centre safety and efficacy study in which \n321 adults with septic or other distributive shock who remained hypotensive despite fluid and \nvasopressor therapy were randomised 1:1 to GIAPREZA or placebo.  Doses of GIAPREZA or placebo \nwere titrated to a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of \u2265 75 mmHg during the first 3 hours of \ntreatment while doses of other vasopressors were maintained. From Hour 3 to Hour 48, GIAPREZA or \nplacebo were titrated to maintain MAP between 65 and 70 mmHg while reducing doses of other \nvasopressors.  \n\nFor their inclusion in the study, patients had to have clinical features of high-output shock defined as a \ncardiac index > 2.3 L/min/m2 or the sum of central venous oxygen saturation > 70% with central \nvenous pressure (CVP) > 8 mmHg. Patients also had to have catecholamine refractory hypotension \n(CRH) defined as requiring a total sum vasopressor dose of > 0.2 mcg/kg/min for 6 to 48 hours, to \nmaintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 55-70 mmHg and receiving at least 25 mL/kg of \ncrystalloid or colloid equivalent over the previous 24-hour period and be adequately volume \nresuscitated in the opinion of the treating investigator. \n\nOf the 321 patients treated in the Phase 3 study, 195 patients were male (60.7%), 257 (80%) patients \nwere White, 33 (10%) were Black, and 31 (10%) were Other.  Median age was 64 years (range: \n22-89 years). Patients requiring high doses of steroids, patients with a history of asthma or \nbronchospasm who were not mechanically ventilated, and patients with Raynaud\u2019s syndrome were \nexcluded. Patients with active bleeding, mesenteric ischaemia, liver failure and MELD score of \u2265 30, \nCV SOFA score \u2264 3 and patients with extensive burns were also excluded. 91% of subjects had septic \nshock; the remaining subjects had other forms of distributive shock such as neurogenic shock. Patients \nwith cardiogenic shock were excluded (see section 4.4). \n\nAt the time of study drug administration, 97% of subjects were receiving norepinephrine, \n67% vasopressin, 15% phenylephrine, 13% epinephrine, and 2% dopamine. 83% of subjects had \nreceived two or more vasopressors and 47% three or more vasopressors prior to study drug \nadministration. Patients were not necessarily on maximum doses of other vasopressors at the time of \nrandomisation. Of the 321 patients, 227 (71%) were receiving a baseline norepinephrine equivalent \ndose (NED) < 0.5 mcg/kg/min, 73 patients (23%) were receiving baseline NED \u2265 0.5 to \n< 1 mcg/kg/min and 21 (6%) patients were receiving high doses of vasopressors \n(NED \u2265 1.0 mcg/kg/min). The effect of GIAPREZA when added to maximum doses of other \nvasopressors is unknown. \n\nThe primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects who achieved either a MAP \u2265 75 mmHg or a \n\u2265 10 mmHg increase in MAP without an increase in baseline vasopressor therapy at 3 hours. \n\nThe primary endpoint was achieved by 70% of patients randomised to GIAPREZA compared to \n23% of placebo subjects; p < 0.0001 (a treatment effect of 47%). The treatment effect was consistent \nin high risk subsets of patients with low baseline MAP or high APACHE II score, which were \nstratification variables (Table 3).   \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 3: Primary efficacy endpoints:  MAP response at hour 3 (mITT population and \nsubgroups) \n\nSubgroup Placebo response rate \nGIAPREZA  \nresponse rate \n\nAll patients 37/158 patients 23% \n114/163 patients \n\n70% \n\nBaseline MAP < 65 mmHg 10/50 patients 20% \n28/52 patients \n\n54% \n\nBaseline APACHE II > 30 17/65 patients 26% \n38/58 patients \n\n66% \nmITT=modified intent-to-treat population \n\nIn the GIAPREZA-treated group, the median time to reach the target MAP endpoint was 5 minutes.  \nThe effect on MAP was sustained for at least the first three hours of treatment. The median dose of \nGIAPREZA was 10 ng/kg/min at 30 minutes. Of the 114 responders at Hour 3, only 2 (1.8%) received \nmore than 80 ng/kg/min. \n\nMortality through day 28 was 46% on GIAPREZA and 54% on placebo (hazard ratio 0.78; 95% \nconfidence interval 0.57-1.07). \n\nThe effect of GIAPREZA on morbidity and mortality has not been determined in appropriate studies. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nGIAPREZA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of hypotension in \nchildren who remain hypotensive despite fluid and vasopressor therapy. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nGIAPREZA is titrated to effect for each individual patient. Plasma levels of angiotensin II were \nevaluated at baseline and hour 3 of infusion in the phase 3 pivotal study.   \n\nDistribution \n\nNo specific studies have been conducted to investigate the distribution of GIAPREZA. \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nNo specific studies have been conducted to investigate the metabolism and excretion of GIAPREZA.  \nThe plasma half-life of angiotensin II administered intravenously is less than one minute. It is \nmetabolised by end terminal cleavage (at both the amino and carboxy termini) in a variety of tissues \nincluding erythrocytes, plasma and many of the major organs (ie, intestine, kidney, liver and lung). \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo trials have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of angiotensin II in renally impaired \npatients since the kidneys are not a major organ for angiotensin II metabolism or excretion.   \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo trials have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of angiotensin II in patients with \nhepatic impairment since the liver is not a major organ for angiotensin II metabolism or excretion.   \n\n\n\n9 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nIn a cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in normotensive dogs, GIAPREZA elicited increased \nheart rate, systemic vascular resistance, left ventricular systolic pressure and left ventricular diastolic \npressure, and PR interval prolongation.  \n\nIn a 48-hour continuous intravenous administration of angiotensin II in neonatal lambs, the nominal \ndose rates of 4, 12 and 40 ng/kg/min were well tolerated. No treatment related adverse effects were \nobserved.  \n\n6.

What GIAPREZA is and what it is used for \n \nGIAPREZA contains the active substance angiotensin II, a compound normally produced by the body. \nIt makes the blood vessels tighten and become narrower, thus increasing blood pressure.  \n \nGIAPREZA is used in an emergency setting to increase blood pressure to normal levels in adult \npatients with seriously low blood pressure who do not respond to fluids or other medicines that raise \nblood pressure.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given GIAPREZA  \n \nYou must not be given GIAPREZA: \n- if you are allergic to angiotensin II or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nYour doctor or nurse should be told if any of the above applies to you before this medicine is used. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nGIAPREZA has only been tested in people with septic and distributive shock. It has not been tested in \nother types of shock. \n \nYour doctor or nurse should be told before GIAPREZA is used if you or someone else in your family \nhave a history of blood clots, as this medicine has been associated with the formation of blood clots. \nAs a part of your treatment, you may be given medicine to prevent the formation of blood clots. \n \nWhen you are first given GIAPREZA, it is expected that your blood pressure will increase. You will \nbe monitored closely to make sure that your blood pressure is at the right level. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nTell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience a change of colour (redness or paleness), pain, \nnumbness in any of your limbs, or if any of your limbs are cold to the touch, as these could be signs \nthat a blood clot has blocked blood flow to a part of the body. \n \nElderly \nGIAPREZA was tested in a small amount of patients more than 75 years of age. There are no dose \nadjustments needed for patients more than 75 years of age. Your doctor will monitor your blood \npressure and adjust your dose as needed. \n \nImpairment of liver or kidneys \nThere are no dose adjustments needed for patients with impairment of the function of the liver or \nkidneys. Your doctor will monitor your blood pressure and adjust your dose as needed. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nGIAPREZA should not be used in children or adolescents under 18 years of age as it has not been \nstudied in these age groups.  \n \nOther medicines and GIAPREZA \n \nYour doctor should be told if you are using, have recently used, or might use any other medicines. \n \nA number of medicines may affect the way GIAPREZA works, such as: \n- Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (medicines used to lower blood pressure, with \n\nactive substances whose name usually end in -pril). ACE inhibitors may increase to the effect of \nGIAPREZA. \n\n- Angiotensin II receptor blockers (medicines used to lower blood pressure, with active substances \nwhose names usually end in -sartan) may lessen the effect of GIAPREZA. \n\n \nYour doctor may already be giving you other medicines used to increase your blood pressure. Adding \nGIAPREZA to these medicines may require that the doses of the other medicines be lowered. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nYour doctor should be told if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are \nplanning to have a baby before this medicine is given. \n \nThere is limited information about the effects of GIAPREZA during pregnancy. Use of this medicine \nduring pregnancy should be avoided if possible. You will only be given this medicine if the possible \nbenefit is greater than the possible risks. \n \nIt is not known whether GIAPREZA can pass into breast milk. Your doctor should be told if you are \nbreast-feeding before this medicine is given. \n \nIt is not known whether GIAPREZA can affect fertility. \n \nSodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 2.5 mg/1 ml, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How GIAPREZA is used \n \nGIAPREZA will be given to you in a hospital by a doctor or a nurse. It is first diluted and then given \nas a drip (infusion) into a vein, supplying a specified dose each minute. \n  \nThe dose depends on your body weight. The recommended starting rate of GIAPREZA is \n20 nanograms (ng) per kilogram of your body weight per minute. After the initial dose, your doctor \nwill adjust the rate as often as every 5 minutes until you achieve your target blood pressure. Your \n\n\n\n22 \n\ndoctor will continue to assess your response and will adjust the dose accordingly up to a maximum of \n80 ng per kilogram each minute during the first 3 hours of treatment. The maximum dose after the first \n3 hours will be 40 ng per kilogram each minute. \n \nGIAPREZA will be given to you at the lowest dose that helps you to achieve or maintain your blood \npressure. In order to minimise the risk of side effects to this medicine, GIAPREZA will be withdrawn \nas soon as your condition improves. \n \nIf you are given more GIAPREZA than you should \nGIAPREZA will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse, so it is unlikely you will be given the wrong \ndose. However, if you have side effects or think you have been given too much GIAPREZA, tell your \ndoctor or nurse straight away. If you have too much GIAPREZA, you may experience high blood \npressure. If this occurs, hospital staff will monitor your vital signs and you will be provided with \nsupportive care.  \n \nStopping GIAPREZA treatment \nYour doctor will gradually decrease the amount of GIAPREZA you are given over time once your \nblood pressure has increased to appropriate levels. If GIAPREZA is stopped suddenly or stopped too \nearly, you may experience a decrease in your blood pressure or your condition may worsen.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you experience: \n- Pain, redness or pale colour, swelling or coolness to the touch of the skin or limbs, as these may \n\nbe symptoms of a blood clot in one of your veins. These clots may travel through blood vessels \nto the lungs causing chest pain and difficulty breathing.  If you notice any of these symptoms, \nseek medical advice immediately. These types of symptoms occur in greater than 1 out of every \n10 patients. While not all of these symptoms lead to life-threatening complications, your doctor \nshould be told about them immediately. \n\n \nOther side effects are: \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are: \n- Too high blood pressure \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) are:    \n- Rapid heartbeat \n- Poor circulation to your hands, feet, or other bodily areas which can be severe and cause tissue \n\ndamage. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store GIAPREZA \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and vial after \u201cEXP\u201d.

Meath \nIreland \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in MM/YYYY. \n \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web \nsite: http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n \n<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> \n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n \nPosology and method of administration \n \nGIAPREZA should be prescribed by a physician experienced in the treatment of shock and is intended \nfor use in an acute and hospital setting. \n \nGIAPREZA should only be administered by continuous intravenous infusion under close monitoring \nof haemodynamics and end-organ perfusion. \n\n\n\n24 \n\nInstructions for dilution \n \n1. Inspect each vial for particulate matter prior to dilution.   \n2. Dilute 1 or 2 ml of GIAPREZA in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to \n\nachieve a final concentration of 5,000 ng/ml or 10,000 ng/ml.  \n3. Diluted solution should be clear and colourless. \n4.    Discard the vial and any unused portion of the medicinal product after use. \nDiluted solution may be stored at room temperature or under refrigeration. Discard prepared solution \nafter 24 hours at room temperature or under refrigeration. \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \nAdministration \n \nWhen initiating GIAPREZA, it is important to closely monitor blood pressure response and adjust \ndose accordingly. \nOnce an infusion has been established, the dose may be titrated as frequently as every 5 minutes in \nsteps of up to 15 ng/kg per minute, as needed, depending on the patient\u2019s condition and target mean \narterial pressure. Approximately one in every four patients experienced transient hypertension with the \nangiotensin II 20 ng/kg/min starting dose in clinical trials (see section 4.8), thus needing dose down-\ntitration. For critically ill patients, the usual target mean arterial pressure is 65 \u2013 75 mmHg.  Do not \nexceed 80 ng/kg per minute during the first 3 hours of treatment.  Maintenance doses should not \nexceed 40 ng/kg per minute.  Doses as low as 1.25 ng/kg per minute may be used.  \nIt is important to administer GIAPREZA at the lowest compatible dose to achieve or maintain \nadequate arterial blood pressure and tissue perfusion (see section 4.4). The median duration of \ntreatment in clinical trials was 48 hours (range: 3.5 to 168 hours). \nIn order to minimise the risk of adverse events derived from prolonged vasoconstriction, treatment \nwith GIAPREZA should be withdrawn once underlying shock is sufficiently improved (see section 4.4 \nand 4.8). Down-titrate by gradual decrements of up to 15 ng/kg per minute, as needed, based on blood \npressure in order to avoid hypotension due to abrupt withdrawal (see section 4.4). \n \nStorage conditions \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2-8 \u00b0C). Dilute before use. Administer as a diluted solution.  \n\n\n\tANNEX I\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tMANUFACTURER(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tCONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE

giapreza is 20 nanograms (ng) per kilogram of your body weight per minute. after the initial dose, your doctor will adjust the rate as often as every 5 minutes until you achieve your target blood pressure. your 22 doctor will continue to assess your response and will adjust the dose accordingly up to a maximum of 80 ng per kilogram each minute during the first 3 hours of treatment. the maximum dose after the first 3 hours will be 40 ng per kilogram each minute. giapreza will be given to you at the lowest dose that helps you to achieve or maintain your blood pressure. in order to minimise the risk of side effects to this medicine, giapreza will be withdrawn as soon as your condition improves. if you are given more giapreza than you should giapreza will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse, so it is unlikely you will be given the wrong dose. however, if you have side effects or think you have been given too much giapreza, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. if you have too much giapreza, you may experience high blood pressure. if this occurs, hospital staff will monitor your vital signs and you will be provided with supportive care. stopping giapreza treatment your doctor will gradually decrease the amount of giapreza you are given over time once your blood pressure has increased to appropriate levels. if giapreza is stopped suddenly or stopped too early, you may experience a decrease in your blood pressure or your condition may worsen. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition":
