NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal 2 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nOne ml of Caelyx pegylated liposomal contains 2 mg doxorubicin hydrochloride in a pegylated \nliposomal formulation.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal, a liposome formulation, is doxorubicin hydrochloride encapsulated in \nliposomes with surface-bound methoxypolyethylene glycol (MPEG). This process is known as \npegylation and protects liposomes from detection by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), which \nincreases blood circulation time.\n\nExcipients with known effect\nContains fully hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (from soyabean) – see section 4.3\nContains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and is essentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion\n\nThe suspension is sterile, translucent and red.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is indicated:\n- As monotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer, where there is an increased cardiac \n\nrisk.\n- For treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in women who have failed a first-line platinum-based \n\nchemotherapy regimen.\n- In combination with bortezomib for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in patients \n\nwho have received at least one prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable \nfor bone marrow transplant.\n\n- For treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) in patients with low CD4 counts \n(< 200 CD4 lymphocytes/mm3) and extensive mucocutaneous or visceral disease.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal may be used as first-line systemic chemotherapy, or as second line \nchemotherapy in AIDS-KS patients with disease that has progressed with, or in patients intolerant to, \nprior combination systemic chemotherapy comprising at least two of the following agents: a vinca \nalkaloid, bleomycin and standard doxorubicin (or other anthracycline).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified \noncologist specialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal exhibits unique pharmacokinetic properties and must not be used \ninterchangeably with other formulations of doxorubicin hydrochloride.\n\n\n\n3\n\nPosology\nBreast cancer/Ovarian cancer\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is administered intravenously at a dose of 50 mg/m2 once every 4 weeks \nfor as long as the disease does not progress and the patient continues to tolerate treatment.\n\nMultiple myeloma\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is administered at 30 mg/m² on day 4 of the bortezomib 3 week regimen \nas a 1 hour infusion administered immediately after the bortezomib infusion. The bortezomib regimen \nconsists of 1.3 mg/m² on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 3 weeks. The dose should be repeated as long as \npatients respond satisfactorily and tolerate treatment. Day 4 dosing of both medicinal products may be \ndelayed up to 48 hours as medically necessary. Doses of bortezomib should be at least 72 hours apart.\n\nAIDS-related KS\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is administered intravenously at 20 mg/m2 every two-to-three weeks. \nAvoid intervals shorter than 10 days as medicinal product accumulation and increased toxicity cannot \nbe ruled out. Treatment of patients for two-to-three months is recommended to achieve a therapeutic \nresponse. Continue treatment as needed to maintain a therapeutic response.\n\nFor all patients\nIf the patient experiences early symptoms or signs of infusion reaction (see sections 4.4 and 4.8), \nimmediately discontinue the infusion, give appropriate premedications (antihistamine and/or short \nacting corticosteroid) and restart at a slower rate.\n\nGuidelines for Caelyx pegylated liposomal dose modification\nTo manage adverse events such as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), stomatitis or \nhaematological toxicity, the dose may be reduced or delayed. Guidelines for Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal dose modification secondary to these adverse effects are provided in the tables below. The \ntoxicity grading in these tables is based on the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria \n(NCI-CTC).\n\nThe tables for PPE (Table 1) and stomatitis (Table 2) provide the schedule followed for dose \nmodification in clinical trials in the treatment of breast or ovarian cancer (modification of the \nrecommended 4 week treatment cycle): if these toxicities occur in patients with AIDS-related KS, the \nrecommended 2 to 3 week treatment cycle can be modified in a similar manner.\n\nThe table for haematological toxicity (Table 3) provides the schedule followed for dose modification \nin clinical trials in the treatment of patients with breast or ovarian cancer only. Dose modification in \npatients with AIDS-KS is addressed in section 4.8.\n\nTable 1.

See the SPC for bortezomib.\n\n* for more information on bortezomib dosing and dosage adjustment, see the SPC for bortezomib\n\nHepatic Impairment\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal pharmacokinetics determined in a small number of patients with elevated \ntotal bilirubin levels do not differ from patients with normal total bilirubin; however, until further \nexperience is gained, the Caelyx pegylated liposomal dosage in patients with impaired hepatic \nfunction should be reduced based on the experience from the breast and ovarian clinical trial programs \nas follows: at initiation of therapy, if the bilirubin is between 1.2-3.0 mg/dl, the first dose is reduced by \n25%. If the bilirubin is > 3.0 mg/dl, the first dose is reduced by 50%. If the patient tolerates the first \ndose without an increase in serum bilirubin or liver enzymes, the dose for cycle 2 can be increased to \nthe next dose level, i.e., if reduced by 25% for the first dose, increase to full dose for cycle 2; if \nreduced by 50% for the first dose, increase to 75% of full dose for cycle 2. The dosage can be \nincreased to full dose for subsequent cycles if tolerated. Caelyx pegylated liposomal can be \nadministered to patients with liver metastases with concurrent elevation of bilirubin and liver enzymes \nup to 4 x the upper limit of the normal range. Prior to Caelyx pegylated liposomal administration, \nevaluate hepatic function using conventional clinical laboratory tests such as ALT/AST, alkaline \nphosphatase, and bilirubin.\n\nRenal Impairment\nAs doxorubicin is metabolised by the liver and excreted in the bile, dose modification should not be \nrequired. Population pharmacokinetic data (in the range of creatinine clearance tested of \n30-156 ml/min) demonstrate that Caelyx pegylated liposomal clearance is not influenced by renal \nfunction. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with creatinine clearance of less than \n30 ml/min.\n\nAIDS-related KS patients with splenectomy\nAs there is no experience with Caelyx pegylated liposomal in patients who have had splenectomy, \ntreatment with Caelyx pegylated liposomal is not recommended.\n\n\n\n6\n\nPaediatric population\nThe experience in children is limited. Caelyx pegylated liposomal is not recommended in patients \nbelow 18 years of age.\n\nElderly\nPopulation based analysis demonstrates that age across the range tested (21–75 years) does not \nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of Caelyx pegylated liposomal.\n\nMethod of administration\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is administered as an intravenous infusion. For further instructions on \npreparation and special precautions for handling see section 6.6.\n\nDo not administer Caelyx pegylated liposomal as a bolus injection or undiluted solution. It is \nrecommended that the Caelyx pegylated liposomal infusion line be connected through the side port of \nan intravenous infusion of 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose to achieve further dilution and minimise the risk of \nthrombosis and extravasation. The infusion may be given through a peripheral vein. Do not use with \nin-line filters. Caelyx pegylated liposomal must not be given by the intramuscular or subcutaneous \nroute (see section 6.6).\n\nFor doses < 90 mg: dilute Caelyx pegylated liposomal in 250 ml 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose solution for \ninfusion.\nFor doses  90 mg: dilute Caelyx pegylated liposomal in 500 ml 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose solution for \ninfusion.\n\nBreast cancer/Ovarian cancer/Multiple myeloma\nTo minimise the risk of infusion reactions, the initial dose is administered at a rate no greater than \n1 mg/minute. If no infusion reaction is observed, subsequent Caelyx pegylated liposomal infusions \nmay be administered over a 60-minute period.\n\nIn those patients who experience an infusion reaction, the method of infusion should be modified as \nfollows:\n5% of the total dose should be infused slowly over the first 15 minutes. If tolerated without reaction, \nthe infusion rate may then be doubled for the next 15 minutes. If tolerated, the infusion may then be \ncompleted over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes.\n\nAIDS-related KS\nThe dose of Caelyx pegylated liposomal is diluted in 250 ml 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose solution for \ninfusion and administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, peanut or soya, or to any of the excipients listed in section \n6.1.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal must not be used to treat AIDS-KS that may be treated effectively with\nlocal therapy or systemic alfa-interferon.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGiven the difference in pharmacokinetic profiles and dosing schedules, Caelyx pegylated liposomal\nshould not be used interchangeably with other formulations of doxorubicin hydrochloride.\n\nCardiac toxicity\nIt is recommended that all patients receiving Caelyx pegylated liposomal routinely undergo frequent \nECG monitoring. Transient ECG changes such as T-wave flattening, S-T segment depression and \nbenign arrhythmias are not considered mandatory indications for the suspension of Caelyx pegylated \n\n\n\n7\n\nliposomal therapy. However, reduction of the QRS complex is considered more indicative of cardiac \ntoxicity. If this change occurs, the most definitive test for anthracycline myocardial injury, i.e., \nendomyocardial biopsy, must be considered.\n\nMore specific methods for the evaluation and monitoring of cardiac functions as compared to ECG are \na measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction by echocardiography or preferably by Multigated \nAngiography (MUGA). These methods must be applied routinely before the initiation of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal therapy and repeated periodically during treatment. The evaluation of left \nventricular function is considered to be mandatory before each additional administration of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal that exceeds a lifetime cumulative anthracycline dose of 450 mg/m2.\n\nThe evaluation tests and methods mentioned above concerning the monitoring of cardiac performance \nduring anthracycline therapy are to be employed in the following order: ECG monitoring, \nmeasurement of left ventricular ejection fraction, endomyocardial biopsy. If a test result indicates \npossible cardiac injury associated with Caelyx pegylated liposomal therapy, the benefit of continued \ntherapy must be carefully weighed against the risk of myocardial injury.\n\nIn patients with cardiac disease requiring treatment, administer Caelyx pegylated liposomal only when\nthe benefit outweighs the risk to the patient.\n\nExercise caution in patients with impaired cardiac function who receive Caelyx pegylated liposomal.\n\nWhenever cardiomyopathy is suspected, i.e., the left ventricular ejection fraction has substantially \ndecreased relative to pre-treatment values and/or left ventricular ejection fraction is lower than a \nprognostically relevant value (e.g., < 45%), endomyocardial biopsy may be considered and the benefit \nof continued therapy must be carefully evaluated against the risk of developing irreversible cardiac \ndamage.\n\nCongestive heart failure due to cardiomyopathy may occur suddenly, without prior ECG changes and \nmay also be encountered several weeks after discontinuation of therapy.\n\nCaution must be observed in patients who have received other anthracyclines. The total dose of \ndoxorubicin hydrochloride must also take into account any previous (or concomitant) therapy with \ncardiotoxic compounds such as other anthracyclines/anthraquinones or e.g., 5-fluorouracil. Cardiac \ntoxicity also may occur at cumulative anthracycline doses lower than 450 mg/m2 in patients with prior \nmediastinal irradiation or in those receiving concurrent cyclophosphamide therapy.\n\nThe cardiac safety profile for the dosing schedule recommended for both breast and ovarian cancer \n(50 mg/m2) is similar to the 20 mg/m2 profile in patients with AIDS-KS (see section 4.8).\n\nMyelosuppression\nMany patients treated with Caelyx pegylated liposomal have baseline myelosuppression due to such \nfactors as their pre-existing HIV disease or numerous concomitant or previous medications, or \ntumours involving bone marrow. In the pivotal trial in patients with ovarian cancer treated at a dose of \n50 mg/m2, myelosuppression was generally mild to moderate, reversible, and was not associated with \nepisodes of neutropaenic infection or sepsis. Moreover, in a controlled clinical trial of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal vs. topotecan, the incidence of treatment related sepsis was substantially less in \nthe Caelyx pegylated liposomal-treated ovarian cancer patients as compared to the topotecan treatment \ngroup. A similar low incidence of myelosuppression was seen in patients with metastatic breast cancer \nreceiving Caelyx pegylated liposomal in a first-line clinical trial. In contrast to the experience in \npatients with breast cancer or ovarian cancer, myelosuppression appears to be the dose-limiting \nadverse event in patients with AIDS-KS (see section 4.8). Because of the potential for bone marrow \nsuppression, periodic blood counts must be performed frequently during the course of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal therapy, and at a minimum, prior to each dose of Caelyx pegylated liposomal.\n\nPersistent severe myelosuppression, may result in superinfection or haemorrhage.\n\n\n\n8\n\nIn controlled clinical studies in patients with AIDS-KS against a bleomycin/vincristine regimen, \nopportunistic infections were apparently more frequent during treatment with Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal. Patients and doctors must be aware of this higher incidence and take action as appropriate.\n\nSecondary haematological malignancies\nAs with other DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents, secondary acute myeloid leukemias and \nmyelodysplasias have been reported in patients having received combined treatment with doxorubicin. \nTherefore, any patient treated with doxorubicin should be kept under haematological supervision.\n\nSecondary oral neoplasms\nVery rare cases of secondary oral cancer have been reported in patients with long-term (more than one \nyear) exposure to Caelyx pegylated liposomal or those receiving a cumulative Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal dose greater than 720 mg/m2. Cases of secondary oral cancer were diagnosed both, during \ntreatment with Caelyx pegylated liposomal, and up to 6 years after the last dose. Patients should be \nexamined at regular intervals for the presence of oral ulceration or any oral discomfort that may be \nindicative of secondary oral cancer.\n\nInfusion-associated reactions\nSerious and sometimes life-threatening infusion reactions, which are characterised by allergic-like or \nanaphylactoid-like reactions, with symptoms including asthma, flushing, urticarial rash, chest pain, \nfever, hypertension, tachycardia, pruritus, sweating, shortness of breath, facial oedema, chills, back \npain, tightness in the chest and throat and/or hypotension may occur within minutes of starting the \ninfusion of Caelyx pegylated liposomal. Very rarely, convulsions also have been observed in relation \nto infusion reactions (see section 4.8). Temporarily stopping the infusion usually resolves these \nsymptoms without further therapy. However, medications to treat these symptoms (e.g., \nantihistamines, corticosteroids, adrenaline, and anticonvulsants), as well as emergency equipment \nshould be available for immediate use. In most patients treatment can be resumed after all symptoms \nhave resolved, without recurrence. Infusion reactions rarely recur after the first treatment cycle. To \nminimise the risk of infusion reactions, the initial dose should be administered at a rate no greater than \n1 mg/minute (see section 4.2).\n\nDiabetic patients\nPlease note that each vial of Caelyx pegylated liposomal contains sucrose and the dose is administered \nin 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose solution for infusion.\n\nFor common adverse events which required dose modification or discontinuation see section 4.8.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo formal medicinal product interaction studies have been performed with Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal, although phase II combination trials with conventional chemotherapy agents have been \nconducted in patients with gynaecological malignancies. Exercise caution in the concomitant use of \nmedicinal products known to interact with standard doxorubicin hydrochloride. Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal, like other doxorubicin hydrochloride preparations, may potentiate the toxicity of other \nanti-cancer therapies. During clinical trials in patients with solid tumours (including breast and ovarian \ncancer) who have received concomitant cyclophosphamide or taxanes, no new additive toxicities were \nnoted. In patients with AIDS, exacerbation of cyclophosphamide-induced haemorrhagic cystitis and \nenhancement of the hepatotoxicity of 6-mercaptopurine have been reported with standard doxorubicin \nhydrochloride. Caution must be exercised when giving any other cytotoxic agents, especially \nmyelotoxic agents, at the same time.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nDoxorubicin hydrochloride is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during \npregnancy. Therefore, Caelyx pegylated liposomal should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \nnecessary.\n\n\n\n9\n\nWomen of child-bearing potential\nWomen of child-bearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while they or their male partner \nare receiving Caelyx pegylated liposomal and in the six months following discontinuation of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal therapy (see section 5.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether Caelyx pegylated liposomal is excreted in human milk. Because many \nmedicinal products, including anthracyclines, are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential \nfor serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, therefore mothers must discontinue nursing prior to \nbeginning Caelyx pegylated liposomal treatment. Health experts recommend that HIV infected women\ndo not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.\n\nFertility\nThe effect of doxorubicin hydrochloride on human fertility has not been evaluated (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nHowever, in clinical studies to date, dizziness and somnolence were associated infrequently (< 5%) \nwith the administration of Caelyx pegylated liposomal. Patients who suffer from these effects must \navoid driving and operating machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most common undesirable effect reported in breast/ovarian clinical trials (50 mg/m2 every \n4 weeks) was palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE). The overall incidence of PPE reported was \n44.0%-46.1%. These effects were mostly mild, with severe (grade 3) cases reported in 17%-19.5%.\nThe reported incidence of life-threatening (grade 4) cases was < 1%. PPE infrequently resulted in \npermanent treatment discontinuation (3.7%-7.0%). PPE is characterised by painful, macular reddening\nskin eruptions. In patients experiencing this event, it is generally seen after two or three cycles of \ntreatment. Improvement usually occurs in one - two weeks, and in some cases, may take up to 4 weeks \nor longer for complete resolution. Pyridoxine at a dose of 50-150 mg per day and corticosteroids have \nbeen used for the prophylaxis and treatment of PPE, however, these therapies have not been evaluated \nin phase III trials. Other strategies to prevent and treat PPE include keeping hands and feet cool, by \nexposing them to cool water (soaks, baths, or swimming), avoiding excessive heat/hot water and \nkeeping them unrestricted (no socks, gloves, or shoes that are tight fitting). PPE appears to be \nprimarily related to the dose schedule and can be reduced by extending the dose interval 1-2 weeks \n(see section 4.2). However, this reaction can be severe and debilitating in some patients and may \nrequire discontinuation of treatment. Stomatitis/mucositis and nausea were also commonly reported in \nbreast/ovarian cancer patient populations, whereas the AIDS-KS Program (20 mg/m2 every 2 weeks), \nmyelosuppression (mostly leukopaenia) was the most common side effect (see AIDS-KS). PPE was \nreported in 16% of multiple myeloma patients treated with Caelyx pegylated liposomal plus \nbortezomib combination therapy. Grade 3 PPE was reported in 5% of patients. No grade 4 PPE was \nreported. The most frequently reported (medicine-related treatment-emergent) adverse events in \ncombination therapy (Caelyx pegylated liposomal + bortezomib) were nausea (40%), diarrhoea (35%), \nneutropaenia (33%), thrombocytopaenia (29%), vomiting (28%), fatigue (27%), and constipation \n(22%).\n\nBreast cancer program\n509 patients with advanced breast cancer who had not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic \ndisease were treated with Caelyx pegylated liposomal (n=254) at a dose of 50 mg/m2 every 4 weeks, \nor doxorubicin (n=255) at a dose of 60 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, in a phase III clinical trial (I97-328). \nThe following common adverse events were reported more often with doxorubicin than with Caelyx \npegylated liposomal: nausea (53% vs. 37%; grade 3/4 5% vs. 3%), vomiting (31% vs. 19%; grade 3/4\n\n\n\n10\n\n4% vs. less than 1%), any alopecia (66% vs. 20%), pronounced alopecia (54% vs.7%), and \nneutropaenia (10% vs. 4%; grade 3/4 8% vs. 2%).\n\nMucositis (23% vs. 13%; grade 3/4 4% vs. 2%), and stomatitis (22% vs. 15%; grade 3/4 5% vs. 2%) \nwere reported more commonly with Caelyx pegylated liposomal than with doxorubicin. The average \nduration of the most common severe (grade 3/4) events for both groups was 30 days or less. See \nTable 5 for complete listing of undesirable effects reported in Caelyx pegylated liposomal-treated \npatients.\n\nThe incidence of life threatening (grade 4) haematologic effects was < 1.0% and sepsis was reported in \n1% of patients. Growth factor support or transfusion support was necessary in 5.1% and 5.5% of \npatients, respectively (see section 4.2).\n\nClinically significant laboratory abnormalities (grades 3 and 4) in this group was low with elevated \ntotal bilirubin, AST and ALT reported in 2.4%, 1.6% and < 1% of patients respectively. No clinically \nsignificant increases in serum creatinine were reported.\n\nTable 5.

Sepsis related to leukopaenia was \nobserved infrequently (< 1%). Growth factor support was required infrequently (< 5%) and transfusion \nsupport was required in approximately 15% of patients (see section 4.2).\n\nIn a subset of 410 patients with ovarian cancer, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities \noccurring in clinical trials with Caelyx pegylated liposomal included increases in total bilirubin \n(usually in patients with liver metastases) (5%) and serum creatinine levels (5%). Increases in AST \nwere less frequently (< 1%) reported.\n\nSolid tumour patients: in a larger cohort of 929 patients with solid tumours (including breast cancer \nand ovarian cancer) predominantly treated at a dose of 50 mg/m2 every 4 weeks, the safety profile and \nincidence of adverse effects are comparable to those of the patients treated in the pivotal breast cancer \nand ovarian cancer trials.\n\nMultiple myeloma program\nOf 646 patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy, 318 patients were \ntreated with combination therapy of Caelyx pegylated liposomal 30 mg/m2 as a one hour intravenous \ninfusion administered on day 4 following bortezomib which is administered at 1.3 mg/m² on days 1, 4, \n\n\n\n14\n\n8, and 11, every three weeks or with bortezomib monotherapy in a phase III clinical trial. See Table 7\nfor adverse effects reported in ≥ 5% patients treated with combination therapy of Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal plus bortezomib.\n\nNeutropaenia, thrombocytopaenia, and anaemia were the most frequently reported haematologic \nevents reported with both combination therapy of Caelyx pegylated liposomal plus bortezomib and \nbortezomib monotherapy. The incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropaenia was higher in the combination \ntherapy group than in the monotherapy group (28% vs. 14%). The incidence of grade 3 and 4 \nthrombocytopaenia was higher in the combination therapy group than in the monotherapy group (22%\nvs. 14%). The incidence of anaemia was similar in both treatment groups (7% vs. 5%).\n\nStomatitis was reported more frequently in the combination therapy group (16%) than in the \nmonotherapy group (3%), and most cases were grade 2 or less in severity. Grade 3 stomatitis was \nreported in 2% of patients in the combination therapy group. No grade 4 stomatitis was reported.\n\nNausea and vomiting were reported more frequently in the combination therapy group (40% and 28%) \nthan in the monotherapy group (32% and 15%) and were mostly grade 1 and 2 in severity.\n\nTreatment discontinuation of one or both agents due to adverse events was seen in 38% of patients. \nCommon adverse events which led to treatment discontinuation of bortezomib and Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal included PPE, neuralgia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy, \nthrombocytopaenia, decreased ejection fraction, and fatigue.\n\nTable 7.

These effects may \noccur early on in treatment. Haematological toxicity may require dose reduction or suspension or \ndelay of therapy. Temporarily suspend Caelyx pegylated liposomal treatment in patients when the \nANC count is < 1,000/mm3 and/or the platelet count is < 50,000/mm3. G-CSF (or GM-CSF) may be \ngiven as concomitant therapy to support the blood count when the ANC count is < 1,000/mm3 in \nsubsequent cycles. The haematological toxicity for ovarian cancer patients is less severe than in the \nAIDS-KS setting (see section for ovarian cancer patients above).\n\nRespiratory undesirable effects commonly occurred in clinical studies of Caelyx pegylated liposomal\nand may be related to opportunistic infections (OI’s) in the AIDS population. Opportunistic infections \nare observed in KS patients after administration with Caelyx pegylated liposomal, and are frequently \nobserved in patients with HIV-induced immunodeficiency. The most frequently observed OI’s in \nclinical studies were candidiasis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, \nand mycobacterium avium complex.\n\n\n\n17\n\nTable 8.

Reduction in haemoglobin and platelets were less frequently \n(< 5%) reported. Sepsis related to leukopaenia was rarely (< 1%) observed. Some of these \nabnormalities may have been related to the underlying HIV infection and not Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal.\n\nAll patients\n100 out of 929 patients (10.8%) with solid tumours were described as having an infusion-associated \nreaction during treatment with Caelyx pegylated liposomal as defined by the following Costart terms: \nallergic reaction, anaphylactoid reaction, asthma, face oedema, hypotension, vasodilatation, urticaria, \nback pain, chest pain, chills, fever, hypertension, tachycardia, dyspepsia, nausea, dizziness, dyspnoea, \npharyngitis, rash, pruritus, sweating, injection site reaction and medicinal product interaction. \n\n\n\n18\n\nPermanent treatment discontinuation was infrequently reported at 2%. A similar incidence of infusion \nreactions (12.4%) and treatment discontinuation (1.5%) was observed in the breast cancer program. In \npatients with multiple myeloma receiving Caelyx pegylated liposomal plus bortezomib, \ninfusion-associated reactions have been reported at a rate of 3%. In patients with AIDS-KS, \ninfusion-associated reactions, were characterised by flushing, shortness of breath, facial oedema, \nheadache, chills, back pain, tightness in the chest and throat and/or hypotension and can be expected at \nthe rate of 5% to 10%. Very rarely, convulsions have been observed in relation to infusion reactions. \nIn all patients, infusion-associated reactions occurred primarily during the first infusion. Temporarily \nstopping the infusion usually resolves these symptoms without further therapy. In nearly all patients, \nCaelyx pegylated liposomal treatment can be resumed after all symptoms have resolved without \nrecurrence. Infusion reactions rarely recur after the first treatment cycle with Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal (see section 4.2).\n\nMyelosuppression associated with anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, leukopaenia, and rarely febrile \nneutropaenia, has been reported in Caelyx pegylated liposomal-treated patients.\n\nStomatitis has been reported in patients receiving continuous infusions of conventional doxorubicin \nhydrochloride and was frequently reported in patients receiving Caelyx pegylated liposomal. It did not \ninterfere with patients completing therapy and no dosage adjustments are generally required, unless \nstomatitis is affecting a patient’s ability to eat. In this case, the dose interval may be extended by \n1-2 weeks or the dose reduced (see section 4.2).\n\nAn increased incidence of congestive heart failure is associated with doxorubicin therapy at \ncumulative lifetime doses > 450 mg/m2 or at lower doses for patients with cardiac risk factors. \nEndomyocardial biopsies on nine of ten AIDS-KS patients receiving cumulative doses of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal greater than 460 mg/m2 indicate no evidence of anthracycline-induced \ncardiomyopathy. The recommended dose of Caelyx pegylated liposomal for AIDS-KS patients is \n20 mg/m2 every two-to-three weeks. The cumulative dose at which cardiotoxicity would become a \nconcern for these AIDS-KS patients (> 400 mg/m2) would require more than 20 courses of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal therapy over 40 to 60 weeks.\n\nIn addition, endomyocardial biopsies were performed in 8 solid tumour patients with cumulative \nanthracycline doses of 509 mg/m2–1,680 mg/m2. The range of Billingham cardiotoxicity scores was \ngrades 0-1.5. These grading scores are consistent with no or mild cardiac toxicity.\n\nIn the pivotal phase III trial versus doxorubicin, 58/509 (11.4%) randomised subjects (10 treated with \nCaelyx pegylated liposomal at a dose of 50 mg/m2/every 4 weeks versus 48 treated with doxorubicin \nat a dose of 60 mg/m2/every 3 weeks) met the protocol-defined criteria for cardiac toxicity during\ntreatment and/or follow-up. Cardiac toxicity was defined as a decrease of 20 points or greater from \nbaseline if the resting LVEF remained in the normal range or a decrease of 10 points or greater if the \nLVEF became abnormal (less than the lower limit for normal). None of the 10 Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal subjects who had cardiac toxicity by LVEF criteria developed signs and symptoms of CHF. \nIn contrast, 10 of 48 doxorubicin subjects who had cardiac toxicity by LVEF criteria also developed \nsigns and symptoms of CHF.\n\nIn patients with solid tumours, including a subset of patients with breast and ovarian cancers, treated at \na dose of 50 mg/m2/cycle with lifetime cumulative anthracycline doses up to 1,532 mg/m2, the \nincidence of clinically significant cardiac dysfunction was low. Of the 418 patients treated with \nCaelyx pegylated liposomal 50 mg/m2/cycle, and having a baseline measurement of left ventricular \nejection fraction (LVEF) and at least one follow-up measurement assessed by MUGA scan, \n88 patients had a cumulative anthracycline dose of > 400 mg/m2, an exposure level associated with an \nincreased risk of cardiovascular toxicity with conventional doxorubicin. Only 13 of these 88 patients \n(15%) had at least one clinically significant change in their LVEF, defined as an LVEF value less than \n45% or a decrease of at least 20 points from baseline. Furthermore, only 1 patient (cumulative \nanthracycline dose of 944 mg/m2), discontinued study treatment because of clinical symptoms of \ncongestive heart failure.\n\n\n\n19\n\nIn a pooled analysis of 4,231 patients receiving Caelyx pegylated liposomal for breast cancer, ovarian \ncancer, multiple myeloma, or AIDS-related KS, ventricular arrythmia, palpitations, cardiac failure, \ncardiac arrest, bundle branch block right, and ejection fraction decreased were reported uncommonly, \nand atrioventricular block, cyanosis, and conduction disorder were reported rarely.\n\nAs with other DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents, secondary acute myeloid leukemias and \nmyelodysplasias have been reported in patients having received combined treatment with doxorubicin. \nTherefore, any patient treated with doxorubicin should be kept under haematological supervision.\n\nAlthough local necrosis following extravasation has been reported very rarely, Caelyx pegylated\nliposomal is considered to be an irritant. Animal studies indicate that administration of doxorubicin \nhydrochloride as a liposomal formulation reduces the potential for extravasation injury. If any signs or \nsymptoms of extravasation occur (e.g., stinging, erythema) terminate the infusion immediately and \nrestart in another vein. The application of ice over the site of extravasation for approximately \n30 minutes may be helpful in alleviating the local reaction. Caelyx pegylated liposomal must not be \ngiven by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route.\n\nRecall of skin reaction due to prior radiotherapy has rarely occurred with Caelyx pegylated liposomal\nadministration.\n\nPost-marketing experience\nAdverse drug reactions identified during the post-marketing experience with Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal are described in Table 9. The frequencies are provided according to the following \nconvention:\n\nVery common  1/10\nCommon  1/100 and < 1/10\nUncommon  1/1,000 and < 1/100\nRare  1/10,000, < 1/1,000\nVery rare < 1/10,000 including isolated reports\n\nTable 9. Adverse drug reactions identified during the post-marketing experience with\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal\n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps)\nvery rare secondary oral neoplasms1\n\nVascular disorders\nuncommon venous thromboembolism, including \n\nthrombophlebitis, venous thrombosis and \npulmonary embolism\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nrare lichenoid keratosis\nvery rare erythema multiforme, Stevens Johnson \n\nsyndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis\n1\n\nCases of secondary oral cancer have been reported in patients with long-term (more than one year) exposure to Caelyx \npegylated liposomal or those receiving a cumulative Caelyx pegylated liposomal dose greater than 720 mg/m2 (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nAcute overdosing with doxorubicin hydrochloride worsens the toxic effects of mucositis, leukopaenia \nand thrombocytopaenia. Treatment of acute overdose of the severely myelosuppressed patient consists \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n20\n\nof hospitalisation, antibiotics, platelet and granulocyte transfusions and symptomatic treatment of \nmucositis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Cytotoxic agents (anthracyclines and related substances), ATC code: \nL01DB01.\n\nMechanism of action\nThe active ingredient of Caelyx pegylated liposomal is doxorubicin hydrochloride, a cytotoxic \nanthracycline antibiotic obtained from Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius. The exact mechanism of \nthe antitumour activity of doxorubicin is not known. It is generally believed that inhibition of DNA, \nRNA and protein synthesis is responsible for the majority of the cytotoxic effects. This is probably the \nresult of intercalation of the anthracycline between adjacent base pairs of the DNA double helix thus \npreventing their unwinding for replication.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nA phase III randomised study of Caelyx pegylated liposomal versus doxorubicin in patients with \nmetastatic breast cancer was completed in 509 patients. The protocol-specified objective of \ndemonstrating non-inferiority between Caelyx pegylated liposomal and doxorubicin was met, the \nhazard ratio (HR) for progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.00 (95% CI for HR=0.82-1.22). The\ntreatment HR for PFS when adjusted for prognostic variables was consistent with PFS for the ITT \npopulation.\n\nThe primary analysis of cardiac toxicity showed the risk of developing a cardiac event as a function of \ncumulative anthracycline dose was significantly lower with Caelyx pegylated liposomal than with \ndoxorubicin (HR=3.16, p < 0.001). At cumulative doses greater than 450 mg/m2 there were no cardiac \nevents with Caelyx pegylated liposomal.\n\nA phase III comparative study of Caelyx pegylated liposomal versus topotecan in patients with \nepithelial ovarian cancer following the failure of first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy was \ncompleted in 474 patients. There was a benefit in overall survival (OS) for Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal-treated patients over topotecan-treated patients as indicated by a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.216 \n(95% CI: 1.000; 1.478), p=0.050. The survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 56.3%, 34.7% and 20.2%\nrespectively on Caelyx pegylated liposomal, compared to 54.0%, 23.6% and 13.2% on topotecan.\n\nFor the sub-group of patients with platinum-sensitive disease the difference was greater: HR of 1.432 \n(95% CI: 1.066; 1.923), p=0.017. The survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 74.1%, 51.2% and 28.4%\nrespectively on Caelyx pegylated liposomal, compared to 66.2%, 31.0% and 17.5% on topotecan.\n\nThe treatments were similar in the sub-group of patients with platinum-refractory disease: HR of 1.069 \n(95% CI: 0.823; 1.387), p=0.618. The survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 41.5%, 21.1% and 13.8%\nrespectively on Caelyx pegylated liposomal, compared to 43.2%, 17.2% and 9.5% on topotecan.\n\nA phase III randomised, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre study comparing the safety and \nefficacy of Caelyx pegylated liposomal plus bortezomib combination therapy with bortezomib \nmonotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who \ndid not progress while receiving anthracycline-based therapy, was conducted in 646 patients. There \nwas a significant improvement in the primary endpoint of time to progression (TTP) for patients \ntreated with combination therapy of Caelyx pegylated liposomal plus bortezomib compared to patients \ntreated with bortezomib monotherapy as indicated by a risk reduction (RR) of 35% (95% CI: 21-47%), \np < 0.0001, based on 407 TTP events. The median TTP was 6.9 months for the bortezomib \nmonotherapy patients compared with 8.9 months for the Caelyx pegylated liposomal plus bortezomib \ncombination therapy patients. A protocol-defined interim analysis (based on 249 TTP events) \n\n\n\n21\n\ntriggered early study termination for efficacy. This interim analysis showed a TTP risk reduction of \n45% (95% CI: 29-57%), p < 0.0001. The median TTP was 6.5 months for the bortezomib \nmonotherapy patients compared with 9.3 months for the Caelyx pegylated liposomal plus bortezomib \ncombination therapy patients. These results, though not mature, constituted the protocol defined final \nanalysis. The final analysis for overall survival (OS) performed after a median follow-up of 8.6 years \nshowed no significant difference in OS between the two treatment arms. The median OS was \n30.8 months (95% CI; 25.2-36.5 months) for the bortezomib monotherapy patients and 33.0 months \n(95% CI; 28.9-37.1 months) for the Caelyx pegylated liposomal plus bortezomib combination therapy \npatients.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is a long-circulating pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin \nhydrochloride. Pegylated liposomes contain surface-grafted segments of the hydrophilic polymer \nmethoxypolyethylene glycol (MPEG). These linear MPEG groups extend from the liposome surface \ncreating a protective coating that reduces interactions between the lipid bilayer membrane and the \nplasma components. This allows the Caelyx pegylated liposomal liposomes to circulate for prolonged \nperiods in the blood stream. Pegylated liposomes are small enough (average diameter of \napproximately 100 nm) to pass intact (extravasate) through defective blood vessels supplying tumours. \nEvidence of penetration of pegylated liposomes from blood vessels and their entry and accumulation \nin tumours has been seen in mice with C-26 colon carcinoma tumours and in transgenic mice with \nKS-like lesions. The pegylated liposomes also have a low permeability lipid matrix and internal \naqueous buffer system that combine to keep doxorubicin hydrochloride encapsulated during liposome \nresidence time in circulation.\n\nThe plasma pharmacokinetics of Caelyx pegylated liposomal in humans differ significantly from those\nreported in the literature for standard doxorubicin hydrochloride preparations. At lower doses \n(10 mg/m2–20 mg/m2) Caelyx pegylated liposomal displayed linear pharmacokinetics. Over the dose \nrange of 10 mg/m2–60 mg/m2 Caelyx pegylated liposomal displayed non-linear pharmacokinetics. \nStandard doxorubicin hydrochloride displays extensive tissue distribution (volume of distribution: 700 \nto 1,100 l/m2) and a rapid elimination clearance (24 to 73 l/h/m2). In contrast, the pharmacokinetic \nprofile of Caelyx pegylated liposomal indicates that Caelyx pegylated liposomal is confined mostly to \nthe vascular fluid volume and that the clearance of doxorubicin from the blood is dependent upon the \nliposomal carrier. Doxorubicin becomes available after the liposomes are extravasated and enter the \ntissue compartment.\n\nAt equivalent doses, the plasma concentration and AUC values of Caelyx pegylated liposomal which \nrepresent mostly pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (containing 90% to 95% of the \nmeasured doxorubicin) are significantly higher than those achieved with standard doxorubicin \nhydrochloride preparations.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal should not be used interchangeably with other formulations of \ndoxorubicin hydrochloride.\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of Caelyx pegylated liposomal was evaluated in 120 patients from 10 different \nclinical trials using the population pharmacokinetic approach. The pharmacokinetics of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal over the dose range of 10 mg/m2 to 60 mg/m2 was best described by a two \ncompartment non-linear model with zero order input and Michaelis-Menten elimination. The mean \nintrinsic clearance of Caelyx pegylated liposomal was 0.030 l/h/m2 (range 0.008 to 0.152 l/h/m2) and \nthe mean central volume of distribution was 1.93 l/m2 (range 0.96-3.85 l/m2) approximating the plasma \nvolume. The apparent half-life ranged from 24-231 hours, with a mean of 73.9 hours.\n\nBreast cancer patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of Caelyx pegylated liposomal determined in 18 patients with breast carcinoma \nwere similar to the pharmacokinetics determined in the larger population of 120 patients with various \ncancers. The mean intrinsic clearance was 0.016 l/h/m2 (range 0.008-0.027 l/h/m2), the mean central \n\n\n\n22\n\nvolume of distribution was 1.46 l/m2 (range 1.10-1.64 l/m2). The mean apparent half-life was \n71.5 hours (range 45.2-98.5 hours).\n\nOvarian cancer patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of Caelyx pegylated liposomal determined in 11 patients with ovarian \ncarcinoma were similar to the pharmacokinetics determined in the larger population of 120 patients \nwith various cancers. The mean intrinsic clearance was 0.021 l/h/m2 (range 0.009–0.041 l/h/m2), the \nmean central volume of distribution was 1.95 l/m2 (range 1.67–2.40 l/m2). The mean apparent half-life \nwas 75.0 hours (range 36.1–125 hours).\n\nAIDS-related KS patients\nThe plasma pharmacokinetics of Caelyx pegylated liposomal were evaluated in 23 patients with KS \nwho received single doses of 20 mg/m2 administered by a 30-minute infusion. The pharmacokinetic \nparameters of Caelyx pegylated liposomal (primarily representing pegylated liposomal doxorubicin \nhydrochloride and low levels of unencapsulated doxorubicin hydrochloride) observed after the \n20 mg/m2 doses are presented in Table 10.\n\nTable 10. Pharmacokinetic parameters in Caelyx pegylated liposomal-treated AIDS-KS \npatients\n\nMean + standard error\nParameter 20 mg/m2 (n=23)\nMaximum plasma concentration* (µg/ml)\nPlasma clearance (l/h/m2)\nVolume of distribution (l/m2)\nAUC (µg/mlh)\n1 half-life (hours)\n2 half-life (hours)\n\n8.34  0.49\n0.041  0.004\n2.72  0.120\n\n590.00  58.7\n5.2  1.4\n55.0  4.8\n\n* Measured at the end of a 30-minute infusion\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn repeat dose studies conducted in animals, the toxicity profile of Caelyx pegylated liposomal appears \nvery similar to that reported in humans who receive long-term infusions of standard doxorubicin \nhydrochloride. With Caelyx pegylated liposomal, the encapsulation of doxorubicin hydrochloride in \npegylated liposomes results in these effects having a differing strength, as follows.\n\nCardiotoxicity\nStudies in rabbits have shown that the cardiotoxicity of Caelyx pegylated liposomal is reduced \ncompared with conventional doxorubicin hydrochloride preparations.\n\nDermal toxicity\nIn studies performed after the repeated administration of Caelyx pegylated liposomal to rats and dogs, \nserious dermal inflammations and ulcer formations were observed at clinically relevant dosages. In the \nstudy in dogs, the occurrence and severity of these lesions was reduced by lowering the dose or \nprolonging the intervals between doses. Similar dermal lesions, which are described as palmar-plantar \nerythrodysesthesia were also observed in patients after long-term intravenous infusion (see section \n4.8).\n\nAnaphylactoid response\nDuring repeat dose toxicology studies in dogs, an acute response characterised by hypotension, pale \nmucous membranes, salivation, emesis and periods of hyperactivity followed by hypoactivity and \nlethargy was observed following administration of pegylated liposomes (placebo). A similar, but less \nsevere response was also noted in dogs treated with Caelyx pegylated liposomal and standard\ndoxorubicin.\n\n\n\n23\n\nThe hypotensive response was reduced in magnitude by pretreatment with antihistamines. However, \nthe response was not life-threatening and the dogs recovered quickly upon discontinuation of \ntreatment.\n\nLocal toxicity\nSubcutaneous tolerance studies indicate that Caelyx pegylated liposomal, as against standard \ndoxorubicin hydrochloride, causes slighter local irritation or damage to the tissue after a possible \nextravasation.\n\nMutagenicity and carcinogenicity\nAlthough no studies have been conducted with Caelyx pegylated liposomal, doxorubicin \nhydrochloride, the pharmacologically active ingredient of Caelyx pegylated liposomal, is mutagenic \nand carcinogenic. Pegylated placebo liposomes are neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.\n\nReproductive toxicity\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal resulted in mild to moderate ovarian and testicular atrophy in mice after a \nsingle dose of 36 mg/kg. Decreased testicular weights and hypospermia were present in rats after \nrepeat doses  0.25 mg/kg/day and diffuse degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and a marked \ndecrease in spermatogenesis were observed in dogs after repeat doses of 1 mg/kg/day (see section 4.6).\n\nNephrotoxicity\nA study has shown that Caelyx pegylated liposomal at a single intravenous dose of over twice the \nclinical dose produces renal toxicity in monkeys. Renal toxicity has been observed with even lower \nsingle doses of doxorubicin HCl in rats and rabbits. Since an evaluation of the post-marketing safety \ndatabase for Caelyx pegylated liposomal in patients has not suggested a significant nephrotoxicity \nliability of Caelyx pegylated liposomal, these findings in monkeys may not have relevance to patient \nrisk assessment.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Caelyx pegylated liposomal is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Caelyx pegylated liposomal\n3. How to use Caelyx pegylated liposomal\n4. Possible side effects\n5 How to store Caelyx pegylated liposomal\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Caelyx pegylated liposomal is and what it is used for\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is an antitumour agent.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is used to treat cancer of the breast in patients at risk for heart problems. \nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is also used to treat cancer of the ovary. It is used to kill cancer cells, \nshrink the size of the tumour, delay the growth of the tumour, and extend your survival.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is also used in combination with another medicine, bortezomib, to treat \nmultiple myeloma, a cancer of the blood in patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is also used to produce an improvement in your Kaposi’s sarcoma \nincluding flattening, lightening and even shrinkage of the cancer. Other symptoms of Kaposi’s \nsarcoma, such as swelling around the tumour, may also improve or disappear.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal contains a medicine which is able to interact with cells in such a way as to \nselectively kill cancer cells. The doxorubicin hydrochloride in Caelyx pegylated liposomal is enclosed \nin tiny spheres called pegylated liposomes which help to deliver the medicinal product from the blood \nstream to the cancerous tissue rather than healthy normal tissue.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Caelyx pegylated liposomal\n\nDo not use Caelyx pegylated liposomal\n- if you are allergic to doxorubicin hydrochloride, peanut or soya, or any of the ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nYou should tell your doctor about any of the following:\n- if you are receiving any treatment for heart disease or liver disease;\n- if you are diabetic, because Caelyx pegylated liposomal contains sugar which may require an \n\nadjustment to the treatment of your diabetes;\n- if you have Kaposi’s sarcoma and have had your spleen removed;\n- if you notice sores, discolouration or any discomfort in your mouth.\n\n\n\n38\n\nChildren and adolescents\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal should not be used in children and adolescents, because it is not known \nhow the medicine will affect them.\n\nOther medicines and Caelyx pegylated liposomal\nTell your doctor or pharmacist\n- if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained \n\nwithout a prescription;\n- about any other cancer treatments you are on or have been taking, as particular care needs to be \n\ntaken with treatments which reduce the number of white blood cells, as this may cause further\nreduction in the number of white blood cells. If you are unsure about what treatments you have \nreceived or any illnesses you have had, discuss these with your doctor.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nBecause the active ingredient doxorubicin hydrochloride in Caelyx pegylated liposomal may cause \nbirth defects, it is important to tell your doctor if you think you are pregnant. Avoid becoming \npregnant while you or your partner are taking Caelyx pegylated liposomal and in the six months \nfollowing discontinuation of Caelyx pegylated liposomal treatment.\n\nBecause doxorubicin hydrochloride may be harmful to nursing infants, women must discontinue \nbreast-feeding before starting treatment with Caelyx pegylated liposomal. Health experts recommend \nthat HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order to avoid \ntransmission of HIV.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel tired or sleepy from treatment with Caelyx \npegylated liposomal.\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal contains soya oil and sodium\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal contains soya oil.  If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this \nmedicine.\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say \n‘essentially sodium-free’.\n\n3. How to use Caelyx pegylated liposomal\n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal is a unique formulation. It must not be used interchangeably with other \nformulations of doxorubicin hydrochloride.\n\nHow much Caelyx pegylated liposomal is given\nIf you are being treated for breast cancer or ovarian cancer, Caelyx pegylated liposomal will be \nadministered at a dose of 50 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and \nweight). The dose is repeated every 4 weeks for as long as the disease does not progress and you are \nable to tolerate the treatment.\n\nIf you are being treated for multiple myeloma, and have already received at least 1 prior therapy, \nCaelyx pegylated liposomal will be administered at a dose of 30 mg per square metre of your body\nsurface area (based on your height and weight) as a 1 hour intravenous infusion on day 4 of the \nbortezomib 3 week regimen immediately after the bortezomib infusion. The dose is repeated as long as \nyou respond satisfactorily and tolerate treatment.\n\nIf you are being treated for Kaposi’sarcoma, Caelyx pegylated liposomal will be administered at a \ndose of 20 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and weight). The dose\n\n\n\n39\n\nis repeated every 2 to 3 weeks for 2-3 months, then as often as necessary to maintain an improvement \nin your condition.\n\nHow Caelyx pegylated liposomal is given\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal will be given to you by your doctor in a drip (infusion) into a vein. \nDepending on the dose and indication, this may take from 30 minutes to more than one hour (i.e., \n90 minutes).\n\nIf you use more Caelyx pegylated liposomal than you should\nAcute overdosing worsens side effects like sores in the mouth or decreases the number of white blood \ncells and platelets in the blood. Treatment will include administration of antibiotics, platelet cell \ntransfusions, use of factors which stimulate production of white blood cells and symptomatic treatment\nof mouth sores.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nDuring the infusion of Caelyx pegylated liposomal, the following reactions may occur: flushing of the \nface, shortness of breath, headache, chills, back pain, tightness in the chest and/or throat, sore throat, \nlow or increase in blood pressure, rapid heart beat, puffing of the face, fever, dizziness, nausea, \nindigestion, itching, rash and sweating. In very rare cases, seizures (convulsions) have occurred. \nStinging or swelling of the skin at the site of injection may also occur. If the drip stings or hurts while \nyou are receiving a dose of Caelyx pegylated liposomal, tell your doctor immediately.\n\nContact your doctor immediately if:\n- you get reddening painful skin on your hands and feet;\n- you get painful reddening of the skin and/or blisters on the body or in the mouth;\n- you get heart problems;\n- you get mouth sores;\n- you develop a fever or any other sign of an infection;\n- you get sudden shortness of breath or sharp chest pain that may worsen with deep breathing or \n\ncoughing;\n- you get swelling, warmth, or tenderness in the soft tissues of your leg, sometimes with pain \n\nwhich gets worse when you stand or walk.\n\nOther side effects\nBetween infusions, the following may occur:\n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)\n- redness, swelling and sores on the palms of your hands and feet. These effects have been seen \n\nfrequently, and are sometimes severe. In severe cases, these effects may interfere with certain \ndaily activities, and may last for 4 weeks or longer before resolving completely. The doctor may \nwish to delay the start and/or reduce the dose of the next treatment (see Strategies to prevent and \ntreat hand-foot syndrome, below);\n\n- pain or sores in mouth or throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, loss of appetite, \nweight loss;\n\n- decrease in the number of white blood cells, which can increase the chances of infections.\nAnaemia (reduction in red blood cells) may cause tiredness, and decreased platelets in the blood \nmay increase the risk of bleeding. In rare cases, having low white blood cells may lead to severe \ninfection. It is because of the potential changes in your blood cells that you will have regular \nblood tests. From a clinical study in patients with AIDS-KS comparing Caelyx pegylated \nliposomal against another treatment (bleomycin/vincristine), there may be a higher chance of \nsome infections with Caelyx pegylated liposomal. However, in contrast to the experience with \n\n\n\n40\n\npatients with AIDS-KS, when Caelyx pegylated liposomal was compared to a standard \ntreatment for advanced ovarian cancer (topotecan), the risk of infections was substantially lower \nin the Caelyx pegylated liposomal-treated patients. The risk of low blood counts and infections \nwas similarly low in breast cancer studies. Some of these effects may be related to your disease \nand not to Caelyx pegylated liposomal; \n\n- general feeling of tiredness, weakness, feeling of pins and needles or pain in hands and feet;\n- hair loss.\n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n- stomach pain;\n- oral thrush (a fungal infection in the mouth), sores in nose, bleeding from your nose, cold sores, \n\nand tongue inflammation;\n- laboratory values related to the function of the liver may either increase or decrease while on \n\nCaelyx pegylated liposomal;\n- sleepiness, dizziness, fainting, bone pain, breast pain, abnormal muscle tension, muscle pain, leg \n\ncramps or swelling, general swelling, inflammation of the retina (the light-detecting membrane \nof the eye), increased tear production, blurred vision, feeling of pins and needles or pain in \nhands and feet;\n\n- inflammation of hair follicles, scaly skin, inflammation or rash, abnormal skin pigmentation \n(colouring), and nail disorder;\n\n- heart problems, e.g., irregular heart beat, enlarged blood vessels;\n- fever, increased temperature or any other sign of infection which may be related to your disease;\n- respiratory problems, i.e., difficulty in breathing or coughing which may be linked to infections \n\nyou have caught as a result of your disease;\n- not enough water in the body (dehydration), severe weight loss and muscle wasting, low levels \n\nof calcium, magnesium, potassium or sodium in the blood, high levels of potassium in the \nblood;\n\n- inflamed foodpipe, inflamed stomach lining, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, passing wind, \ninflamed gums (gingivitis), change in sense of taste;\n\n- inflammation of the vagina; \n- pain when passing urine;\n- if you have previously had skin reactions, i.e., pain, redness and dryness of skin, during \n\ntreatment with radiotherapy, this may also happen with Caelyx pegylated liposomal;\n- joint pain, decreased or abnormal sensation to stimulation, inflammation of the cornea, redness \n\nof the eye, redness of the scrotum may occur with a combination of Caelyx pegylated liposomal\nand bortezomib.\n\nWhen Caelyx pegylated liposomal is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and \nsome have not occurred at all.\n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)\n- confusion;\n- inflammation of the veins and formation of blood clots in the veins which could lead to \n\nblockage of blood flow to your lungs causing difficulty breathing, chest pain and palpitations;\n- abnormal heart rhythm, heart beat feels fast or uneven (palpitations), heart failure, which makes \n\nyou short of breath and may lead to swollen legs, cardiac arrest.\n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)\n- blue colour to the skin and mucosa caused by low oxygen in the blood;\n- patches of skin thickening.\n\nVery rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people)\n- serious skin reactions such as widespread peeling skin, blisters as well as mucous membrane \n\nerosion (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis);\n- oral cancer may occur when Caelyx pegylated liposomal is taken for a long time (more than one \n\nyear).\n\n\n\n41\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine.\n\nStrategies to prevent and treat hand-foot syndrome include:\n- soaking hands and/or feet in basins of cold water when possible (e.g., while watching television, \n\nreading, or listening to the radio);\n- keeping hands and feet uncovered (no gloves, socks, etc.);\n- staying in cool places;\n- taking cool baths during hot weather;\n- avoiding vigorous exercise that might cause trauma to the feet (e.g., jogging);\n- avoiding exposure of skin to very hot water (e.g., jacuzzis, saunas);\n- avoiding tight fitting footwear or high-heeled shoes.\n\nPyridoxine (Vitamin B6):\n- vitamin B6 is available without prescription;\n- take 50-150 mg daily beginning at the first signs of redness or tingling.\n\n5.

The use of gloves is \nrequired. If Caelyx pegylated liposomal comes into contact with skin or mucosa, wash immediately \nand thoroughly with soap and water. Caelyx pegylated liposomal must be handled and disposed of in a \nmanner consistent with that of other anticancer medicinal products.\n\nDetermine the dose of Caelyx pegylated liposomal to be administered (based upon the recommended \ndose and the patient's body surface area). Take the appropriate volume of Caelyx pegylated liposomal\nup into a sterile syringe. Aseptic technique must be strictly observed since no preservative or \nbacteriostatic agent is present in Caelyx pegylated liposomal. The appropriate dose of Caelyx \npegylated liposomal must be diluted in 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose solution for infusion prior to \nadministration. For doses < 90 mg, dilute Caelyx pegylated liposomal in 250 ml, and for doses \n 90 mg, dilute Caelyx pegylated liposomal in 500 ml.\n\nTo minimise the risk of infusion reactions, the initial dose is administered at a rate no greater than \n1 mg/minute. If no infusion reaction is observed, subsequent Caelyx pegylated liposomal infusions \nmay be administered over a 60-minute period.\n\nIn the breast cancer trial program, modification of the infusion was permitted for those patients \nexperiencing an infusion reaction as follows: 5% of the total dose was infused slowly over the first \n15 minutes. If tolerated without reaction, the infusion rate was doubled for the next 15 minutes. If \ntolerated, the infusion was completed over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes.\n\nIf the patient experiences early symptoms or signs of infusion reaction, immediately discontinue the \ninfusion, give appropriate premedications (antihistamine and/or short acting corticosteroid) and restart \nat a slower rate.\n\nThe use of any diluent other than 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose solution for infusion, or the presence of any \nbacteriostatic agent such as benzyl alcohol may cause precipitation of Caelyx pegylated liposomal.\n\nIt is recommended that the Caelyx pegylated liposomal infusion line be connected through the side \nport of an intravenous infusion of 5% (50 mg/ml) glucose. Infusion may be given through a peripheral \nvein. Do not use with in-line filters.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.
