This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nQarziba 4.5 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 mL of concentrate contains 4.5 mg dinutuximab beta. \nEach vial contains 20 mg dinutuximab beta in 4.5 mL. \n \nDinutuximab beta is a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody produced in a mammalian \ncell line (CHO) by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion \nClear, colourless liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nQarziba is indicated for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma in patients aged 12 months and \nabove, who have previously received induction chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response, \nfollowed by myeloablative therapy and stem cell transplantation, as well as patients with history of \nrelapsed or refractory neuroblastoma, with or without residual disease. Prior to the treatment of \nrelapsed neuroblastoma, any actively progressing disease should be stabilised by other suitable \nmeasures. \n \nIn patients with a history of relapsed/refractory disease and in patients who have not achieved a \ncomplete response after first line therapy, Qarziba should be combined with interleukin-2 (IL-2). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nQarziba is restricted to hospital-use only and must be administered under the supervision of a \nphysician experienced in the use of oncological therapies. It must be administered by a healthcare \nprofessional prepared to manage severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis in an environment \nwhere full resuscitation services are immediately available. \n \nPosology \nTreatment with Qarziba consists of 5 consecutive courses, each course comprising 35 days. The \nindividual dose is determined based on the body surface area and should be a total of 100 mg/m2 per \ncourse. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nTwo modes of administration are possible: \n• a continuous infusion over the first 10 days of each course (a total of 240 hours) at the daily \n\ndose of 10 mg/m2 \n• or five daily infusions of 20 mg/m2 administered over 8 hours, on the first 5 days of each course  \n \nWhen IL-2 is combined with Qarziba, it should be administered as subcutaneous injections of \n6×106 IU/m2/day, for 2 periods of 5 consecutive days, resulting in an overall dose of 60×106 IU/m2 per \ncourse. The first 5-day course should start 7 days prior to the first infusion of dinutuximab beta and the \nsecond 5-day course should start concurrently with dinutuximab beta infusion (days 1 to 5 of each \ndinutuximab beta course). \n \nPrior to starting each treatment course, the following clinical parameters should be evaluated and \ntreatment should be delayed until these values are reached:  \n• pulse oximetry > 94% on room air \n• adequate bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500/µL, platelet count \n\n≥ 20,000/µL, haemoglobin > 8.0 g/dL \n• adequate liver function: alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/ aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \n\n< 5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) \n• adequate renal function: creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate (GRF) \n\n> 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 \n \nDose modification of dinutuximab beta \n\nBased on the physician’s evaluation of the severity of adverse drug reactions to dinutuximab beta, \npatients may undergo a dose reduction of 50% or a temporary interruption of the infusion. As a \nconsequence, either the infusion period is prolonged or, if tolerated by the patient, the infusion rate \nmay be increased up to 3 mL/h (continuous infusion), in order to administer the total dose. \n \n\nRecommended dose modifications for dinutuximab beta \nAdverse reaction  Severity Treatment modification \n\nAny Grade 1 – 2 Decrease infusion rate to 50%, \nAfter resolution, resume infusion at \noriginal rate \n\nHypersensitivity \nreaction \n\ne.g. hypotension Interrupt infusion and administer \nsupportive measures, \nAfter resolution, resume infusion at \noriginal rate \n\nDilated pupils with sluggish light reflex +/- photophobia Interrupt infusion, \nAfter resolution, resume infusion at \n50% rate \n\nAny Grade ≥ 3 Interrupt infusion and administer \nsupportive measures, \nResume infusion at 50% rate if ADR \nresolves or improves to Grade 1 – 2, \nAfter resolution, increase to original \nrate \n\n Recurrent Discontinue infusion, \nResume next day if ADR resolves \n\nHypersensitivity \nreaction \n\ne.g. bronchospasm, angioedema Interrupt infusion immediately and \ntreat appropriately (see section 4.4), \nResume treatment for subsequent \ncourses \n\nCapillary leak \nsyndrome \n\n Interrupt infusion and administer \nsupportive measures, \nResume at 50% rate if ADR resolves \nor improves to Grade 1 – 2 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nTreatment with dinutuximab beta should be permanently discontinued if the following toxicities occur: \n• grade 3 or 4 anaphylaxis \n• prolonged grade 2 peripheral motor neuropathy \n• grade 3 peripheral neuropathy \n• grade 3 vision eye toxicity \n• grade 4 hyponatremia (< 120 mEq/L) despite appropriate fluid management \n• recurrent or grade 4 capillary leak syndrome (requires ventilator support) \n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\nThere are no data in patients with renal and hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Qarziba in children aged less than 12 months have not yet been established. \nNo data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration  \nQarziba is for intravenous infusion. The solution should be administered via a peripheral or central \nintravenous line. Other intravenously co-administered agents should be delivered via a separate \ninfusion line (see section 6.6). \n \nFor continuous infusions, the solution is administered at a rate of 2 mL per hour (48 mL per day) using \nan infusion pump. \n \nFor 8-hour daily infusions, the solution is administered at a rate of approximately 13 mL per hour.  \n \nPre-medication should always be considered before starting each infusion (see section 4.4). \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nAcute grade 3 or 4, or extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nPain \nNeuropathic pain usually occurs at the beginning of the treatment and premedication with analgesics, \nincluding intravenous opioids, prior to each infusion of dinutuximab beta is required. A triple therapy, \nincluding nonopioid analgesics (according to WHO guidelines), gabapentin and opioids, is \nrecommended for pain treatment. The individual dose may vary widely. \n \n\nNonopioid analgesics \n\nNonopioid analgesics should be used permanently during the treatment, e.g. paracetamol or ibuprofen. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nGabapentin \n\nThe patient should be primed with 10 mg/kg/day, starting 3 days prior to dinutuximab beta infusion. \nThe daily dose of gabapentin is increased to 2×10 mg/kg/day orally, the next day and to \n3×10 mg/kg/day orally, the day before the onset of dinutuximab beta infusion and thereafter. The \nmaximum single dose of gabapentin is 300 mg. This dosing schedule should be maintained for as long \nas required by the patient. \nOral gabapentin should be tapered off after weaning off intravenous morphine infusion, at the latest \nafter dinutuximab beta infusion therapy has stopped. \n \nOpioids \n\nTreatment with opioids is standard with dinutuximab beta. The first infusion day and course usually \nrequires a higher dose than subsequent days and courses.  \n \n• Before initiation of a continuous intravenous morphine infusion, a bolus infusion of 0.02 to \n\n0.05 mg/kg/hour morphine should be started 2 hours before dinutuximab beta infusion. \n• Subsequently, a dosing rate of 0.03 mg/kg/hour is recommended concomitantly with \n\ndinutuximab beta infusion. \n• With daily infusions of dinutuximab beta, morphine infusion should be continued at a decreased \n\nrate (e.g. 0.01 mg/kg/h) for 4 hours after the end of dinutuximab beta infusion. \n• With continuous infusion, in response to the patient’s pain perception, it may be possible to \n\nwean off morphine over 5 days by progressively decreasing its dosing rate (e.g. to \n0.02 mg/kg/hour, 0.01 mg/kg/hour, 0.005 mg/kg/hour).  \n\n• If continous morphine infusion is required for more than 5 days, treatment should be gradually \nreduced by 20% per day after the last day of dinutuximab beta infusion. \n\n \nAfter weaning off intravenous morphine, in case of severe neuropathic pain, oral morphine sulphate \n(0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours) can be administered on demand. For moderate neuropathic pain, \noral tramodol may be administered. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nSevere infusion-related reactions, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), anaphylactic and \nhypersensitivity reactions, may occur despite the use of premedication. Occurrence of a severe \ninfusion related reaction (including CRS) requires immediate discontinuation of dinutuximab beta \ntherapy and may necessitate emergency treatment. \n \nCytokine release syndrome frequently manifests itself within minutes to hours of initiating the first \ninfusion and is characterised by systemic symptoms such as fever, hypotension and urticaria.  \n \nAnaphylactic reactions may occur as early as within a few minutes of the first infusion with \ndinutuximab beta and are commonly associated with bronchospasm and urticaria. \n \nPremedication \n\nAntihistamine premedication (e.g. diphenhydramine) should be administered by intravenous injection \napproximately 20 minutes before starting each dinutuximab beta infusion. It is recommended that \nantihistamine administration be repeated every 4 to 6 hours as required during dinutuximab infusion.  \n \nPatients should be closely monitored for anaphylaxis and allergic reactions, particularly during the \nfirst and second treatment course. \n \nTreatment of hypersensitivity reactions \n\nIntravenous antihistamine, epinephrine (adrenaline) and prednisolone for intravenous administration \nshould be immediately available at the bedside during administration of dinutuximab beta to manage \nlife-threatening allergic reactions. It is recommended that treatment for such reactions include \nprednisolone administered by intravenous bolus, and epinephrine administered by intravenous bolus \nevery 3 to 5 minutes as necessary, according to clinical response. In case of bronchial and/or \npulmonary hypersensitivity reaction, inhalation with epinephrine (adrenaline) is recommended and \nshould be repeated every 2 hours, according to clinical response. \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \nCapillary leak syndrome (CLS) \nCLS is characterised by a loss of vascular tone and extravasation of plasma proteins and fluid into the \nextravascular space. CLS usually develops within hours after initiation of treatment, while clinical \nsymptoms (i.e. hypotension, tachycardia) are reported to occur after 2 to 12 hours. Careful monitoring \nof circulatory and respiratory function is required. \n \nNeurological disorders of the eye \nEye disorders may occur as dinutuximab beta binds to optic nerve cells. No dose modification is \nnecessary in the case of an impaired visual accommodation that is correctable with eye glasses, as long \nas this is judged to be tolerable. \nTreatment must be interrupted in patients who experience Grade 3 vision toxicity (i.e. subtotal vision \nloss per toxicity scale). In case of any eye problems, patients should be referred promptly to an \nophtalmology specialist. \n \nPeripheral neuropathy \nOccasional occurrences of peripheral neuropathy have been reported with Qarziba. Cases of motor or \nsensory neuropathy lasting more than 4 days must be evaluated and non-inflammatory causes, such as \ndisease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes and concomitant medication, should be \nexcluded. \n \nTreatment should be permanently discontinued in patients experiencing any objective prolonged \nweakness attributable to dinutuximab beta administration. For patients with moderate (Grade 2) \nneuropathy (motor with or without sensory), treatment should be interrupted and may be resumed after \nneurologic symptoms resolve. \n \nSystemic infections \nPatients are likely to be immunocompromised as a result of prior therapies. As they typically have a \ncentral venous catheter in situ, they are at risk of developing systemic infection. Patients should have \nno evidence of systemic infection and any identified infection should be under control before starting \ntherapy. \n \nHaematologic toxicities \nOccurrence of haematologic toxicities has been reported with Qarziba, such as erythropenia, \nthrombocytopenia or neutropenia. Grade 4 haematologic toxicities, improving to at least Grade 2 or \nbaseline values by start of next treatment course, do not require dose modification. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nRegulatory monitoring of liver function and electrolytes is recommended. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. A risk for indirect reduction of CYP activity due to \nhigher TNF-α and IL-6 levels and, therefore, interactions with concomitantly used medicinal products, \ncannot be excluded. \n \nCorticosteroids \n\nDue to their immunosuppressive activity, concomitant treatment with corticosteroids is not \nrecommended within 2 weeks prior to the first treatment course until 1 week after the last treatment \ncourse with dinutuximab beta, except for life-threatening conditions. \n \nVaccinations \n\nVaccinations should be avoided during administration of dinutuximab beta until 10 weeks after the last \ntreatment course, due to immune stimulation through dinutuximab beta and possible risk for rare \nneurological toxicities. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nIntravenous immunoglobulin \n\nConcomitant use of intravenous immunoglobulins is not recommended as they may interfere with \ndinutuximab beta-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data on pregnant women. No animal data are available on teratogenicity or \nembryotoxicity. Dinutuximab beta target (GD2) is expressed on neuronal tissues, especially during \nembryofetal development, and may cross the placenta; therefore, Qarziba may cause fetal harm when \nadministered to pregnant women. \n \nQarziba should not be used during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nThere are no data on lactating women. It is unknown whether dinutuximab beta is excreted in human \nmilk. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Qarziba and for 6 months after the \nlast dose. \n \nFertility \nThe effects of dinutuximab beta on fertility in humans are unknown. In animals, dedicated fertility \nstudies have not been conducted, but no adverse effects on reproductive organs were observed in \ntoxicity studies performed in Guinea pig and cynomolgous monkey. \n \nQarziba should not be used in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. It is \nrecommended that women of childbearing potential use contraception for 6 months after \ndiscontinuation of treatment with dinutuximab beta. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDinutuximab beta has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should not use \nor drive machines during treatment with dinutuximab beta. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of dinutuximab beta has been evaluated in 514 patients with high-risk and \nrelapsed/refractory neuroblastoma, who received it as a continuous infusion (98) or as repeated daily \ninfusions (416). It was combined with 13-cis retinoic in most patients and with IL-2 in 307 patients. \n \nThe most common adverse reactions were pyrexia (88%) and pain (77%) that occurred despite \nanalgesic treatment. Other frequent adverse reactions were hypersensitivity (63%), vomiting (57%), \ndiarrhoea (51%), capillary leak syndrome (40%) and hypotension (39%).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions are summarised in the table below. These adverse reactions are presented by \nMedDRA system organ class and frequency. Frequency categories are defined as: very common \n(≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100).

Cytokine release syndrome was also reported in 32% of the patients. Serious \nanaphylactic reactions occurred in 3.5% of the patients. \n \nPain \n\nPain typically occurs during the first infusion of dinutuximab beta and decreases over the treatment \ncourses. Most commonly, patients reported abdominal pain, pain in the extremities, back pain, chest \npain, or arthralgia.  \n \nCapillary leak syndrome (CLS) \n\nOverall, 10% of CLS were severe (grade 3-4) and their frequency decreased over the treatment \ncourses. \n \nEye problems \n\nThese included impaired visual accommodation that is correctable with eye glasses, as well as \nmydriasis (13%), blurred vision (3%) or photophobia (3%), which were usually reversible after \ntreatment discontinuation. Severe eye disorders were also reported including ophthalmoplegia (2%) \nand optic atrophy. \n \nPeripheral neuropathy \n\nBoth motor and sensory peripheral neuropathies have been reported, overall in 9% of the patients. \nMost events were of grade 1-2 and resolved.  \n \n\nSafety profile with and without IL-2 \nThe combination of Qarziba with IL-2 increases the risk of adverse drug reactions compared to \nQarziba without IL-2, especially for pyrexia (92% vs. 79%), CLS (50% vs. 25%), pain related to \ndinutuximab beta (75% vs. 63%), hypotension (43% vs. 26%), and peripheral neuropathy (14% vs. \n7%), respectively. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo cases of dinutuximab beta overdose have been reported. \nIn the case of overdose, patients should be carefully observed for signs or symptoms of adverse \nreactions and supportive care administered, as appropriate. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC \n \nMechanism of action \nDinutuximab beta is a chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is specifically directed against the \ncarbohydrate moiety of disialoganglioside 2 (GD2), which is overexpressed on neuroblastoma cells.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nDinutuximab beta has been shown in vitro to bind to neuroblastoma cell lines known to express GD2 \nand to induce both complement dependent cytoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cell-mediated \ncytoxicity (ADCC). In the presence of human effector cells, including peripheral blood nuclear cells \nand granulocytes from normal human donors, dinutuximab beta was found to mediate the lysis of \nhuman neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, in vivo \nstudies demonstrated that dinutuximab beta could suppress liver metastasis in a syngeneic liver \nmetastasis mouse model. \n \nNeurotoxicity associated to dinutuximab beta is likely due to the induction of mechanical allodynia \nthat may be mediated by the reactivity of dinutuximab beta with the GD2 antigen located on the \nsurface of peripheral nerve fibres and myelin. \n \nClinical efficacy \nThe efficacy of dinutuximab beta has been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial comparing the \nadministration of dinutuximab beta with or without IL-2 in the first-line treatment of patients with \nhigh-risk neuroblastoma and in two single-arm studies in the relapsed/refractory setting. \n \nRelapsed and refractory patients  \n\nIn a compassionate use programme (study 1), 54 patients received 10 mg/m2/day dinutuximab beta \ngiven by continuous 10-day intravenous infusion in a 5-week treatment course, concurrently with \nsubcutaneous IL-2 (6×106 IU/m²/day given on days 1-5 and 8-12 of each course) and followed by oral \n13-cis-RA treatment (160 mg/m2/day for 14 days per course). The same treatment regimen was used in \na Phase II study (study 2), which enrolled 44 patients. \n \nOverall, these 98 patients had primary refractory neuroblastoma (40) or relapsed neuroblastoma (49) \nwith an additional 9 patients enrolled after first-line therapy. These were 61 boys and 37 girls, aged 1 \nto 26 years (median 5 years). Most had an initial diagnosis of INSS stage 4 disease without MYCN \namplification (16% of the subjects had MYCN amplified tumours and in 14% this information was \nmissing). Most patients with relapsed disease were enrolled after their first relapse and the median \ntime from diagnosis to first relapse was about 14 months. Treatment of disease before immunotherapy \nincluded intensive chemotherapy regimen followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), \nradiotherapy, and surgery. At baseline, 72 patients had measurable disease and 26 patients had no \ndetectable disease.  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \nSurvival rates (event-free survival, overall survival) are presented by type of disease in Table 1. The \noverall response rate (complete response plus partial response) in patients with evidence of disease at \nbaseline was 36% (95% confidence interval [25; 48]) and was more favourable in patients with \nrefractory disease (41% [23; 57]) than in patients with relapsed disease (29% [15; 46]). \n \nTable 1: Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates in relapsed and refractory patients \n\n \nStudy 1 \nN=29 \n\nStudy 2 \nN=19 \n\nStudy 1 \nN=15 \n\nStudy 2 \nN=25 \n\nRelapsed patients Refractory patients \n\nEFS \n1 year 45% 42% 58% 60% \n\n2 years 31% 37% 29% 56% \n\nOS \n1 year 90% 74% 93% 100% \n\n2 years 69% 42% 70% 78% \n \nFirst-line patients who received autologous stem cell transplantation \n\nIn study 3, patients with high-risk neuroblastoma were enrolled after they had received induction \nchemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response, then myeloablative therapy and stem cell \ntransplantation. Patients with progressive disease were excluded. Dinutuximab beta was administered \nat a dose of 20 mg/m2/day on 5 consecutive days, given by 8-hour intravenous infusion in a 5-week \ntreatment course, and was combined with 13-cis-RA and with or without additional subcutaneous IL-2 \nat the same posologies as in the previous studies. \n \nA total of 370 patients were randomised and received treatment. These included 64% male and 36% \nfemale patients with a median age of 3 years (0.6 to 20); 89% had a tumour INSS stage 4 and MYCN \namplification was reported in 44% of the cases. The primary efficacy endpoint was 3-year EFS and \nsecondary endpoint was OS. EFS and OS rates are presented in Tables 2 and 3 according to the \nevidence of disease at baseline. \n \nFor patients without evidence of disease at baseline, addition of IL-2 did not improve EFS and OS. \n \nTable 2: Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates [95% confidence interval] in \npatients without evidence of disease at baseline (complete response to initial treatment) \n\nEfficacy \n\nwithout IL-2 \nN=104 \n\nwith IL-2 \nN=107 \n\n1 year 2 year 3 year 1 year 2 year 3 year \n\nEFS 77% [67; 84] \n67% \n\n[57; 75] \n62% \n\n[51; 71] \n73% \n\n[63; 80] \n70% \n\n[60; 77] \n66% \n\n[56; 75] \n\nOS 89% [81; 94] \n78% \n\n[68; 85] \n71% \n\n[60; 80] \n89% \n\n[81; 93] \n78% \n\n[68; 85] \n72% \n\n[61; 80] \n \nTable 3: Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates [95% confidence interval] in \npatients with evidence of disease at baseline (no complete response to initial treatment) \n\nEfficacy \n\nwithout IL-2 \nN=73 \n\nwith IL-2 \nN=76 \n\n1 year 2 year 3 year 1 year 2 year 3 year \n\nEFS 67% [55; 76] \n58% \n\n[45; 69] \n46% \n\n[33; 58] \n72% \n\n[60; 81] \n62% \n\n[49; 72] \n54% \n\n[41; 65] \n\nOS 83% [72; 90] \n73% \n\n[61; 82] \n54% \n\n[40; 66] \n86% \n\n[75; 92] \n71% \n\n[58; 80] \n63% \n\n[50; 74] \n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nImmunogenicity \nThe development of anti-drug antibodies is a class effect of monoclonal chimeric antibodies. Overall, \nmeasurable ADA titres were detected in 65 (62%) of the 105 patients examined.  \n \nGiven the limitation of the bioanalytical methods, data are currently insufficient to properly evaluate \nthe impact of the formation of anti-drug antibodies on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic \nparameters, as well as on the efficacy and safety of dinutuximab beta. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nQarziba in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in neuroblastoma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’. \nThis means that for ethical reasons it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this \nmedicinal product. The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may \nbecome available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \nCalculations of pharmacokinetic parameters for dinutuximab beta are based upon measurements using \nnon-validated bioanalytical methods. This has to be taken into consideration when interpreting PK \nparameters (Cmax, exposure, half-life) listed below. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of dinutuximab beta, based on 10-day continuous intravenous infusion of \n10 mg/m2/day (equal to a total dose of 100 mg/m2/course) were evaluated in studies 1 and 2. Mean \nplasma Cmax levels (around 12 micrograms/mL) were reached on the last day of infusion. Mean plasma \nCmax levels, observed during 8-hour infusions (20 mg/m2/day on five consecutive days), were \ndetermined in another study (n=15). The observed Cmax levels were slightly higher \n(16.5 micrograms/mL) and were reached on the fifth infusion. \n \nBiotransformation \nDinutuximab beta is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small \npeptides and individual amino acids by ubiquitous proteolytic enzmes. Classical biotransformation \nstudies have not been performed. \n \nElimination \nThe half-life observed in studies 1 and 2 was in the range of 190 hours, i.e. 8 days. \n \nSpecial population \nA population pharmacokinetic modelling approach was used to investigate the influence of covariates. \nThe population pharmacokinetic model included allometric scaling (reference weight of 18.1 kg) on \nclearance and volume of distribution with exponents of 0.75 and 1, respectively. \n \nThe exposure (Cmax and AUC24h on day 1 and day 10 during a 10-day infusion) is predicted to be \nsimilar in subjects with ages less than or equal to 12 years and decreases slightly for older, heavier \nsubjects. Effects of gender and age were not found to influence the pharmacokinetics of dinutuximab \nbeta but data in children less than 2 years of age are very limited and insufficient to support dosing. \n \nAn effect of ADA formation on the volume of distribution was found (increase of 37% in volume). \nTherefore, ADA formation would be predicted to have a slight impact (less than 10% decrease) on \nexposure within 24 hours after administration, under non-steady state conditions. After reaching \nsteady state, no difference in exposure is predicted, with and without ADA formation. \n \nMarkers for renal (eGFR) and hepatic (bilirubin) function did not show a relationship with exposure \n(Cmax and AUC24h on day 1 and day 10 during a 10-day infusion). \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nGeneral toxicology \nDinutuximab beta has been administered to male and female juvenile Guinea pigs, as well as male and \nfemale young cynomolgus monkeys, as repeat-dose regimens that exceeded the recommended clinical \ndose. Findings of note included changes (decrease) in thymus weight as well as bone marrow changes \n(atrophy affecting myeloid and erythroid precursor cell lines). The bone marrow changes were slight \nto severe and recovered after cessation of dosing. No effects on cardiovascular functions (ECG, blood \npressure) were observed in monkeys. \n \nOther \nNo non-clinical studies to evaluate the potential of dinutuximab beta to cause carcinogenicity, \ngenotoxicity or developmental and reproductive toxicity have been conducted. In the repeat-dose \ntoxicity studies in Guinea pigs and cynomolgus monkeys, no adverse effects of dinutuximab beta were \nobserved on reproductive organs at exposure levels above clinical levels.  \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you use Qarziba \n3. How to use Qarziba \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Qarziba \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Qarziba is and what it is used for \n \nQarziba contains dinutuximab beta, which belongs to a group of medicines called ‘monoclonal \nantibodies’. These are proteins, which specifically recognise and bind to other unique proteins in the \nbody. Dinutuximab beta binds to the molecule known as disialoganglioside 2 (GD2), which is present \non cancer cells, and this activates the body’s immune system, causing it to attack the cancer cells. \n \nQarziba is used to treat neuroblastoma that has a high risk of coming back after a series of \ntreatments, which include a stem cell transplantation for rebuilding the immune system. It is also used \nto treat neuroblastoma that has come back (relapsed) or could not be completely treated with previous \ntherapies. \n \nPrior to the treatment of relapsed neuroblastoma, your treating physician will stabilise any actively \nprogressing disease by other suitable measures. \n \nYour doctor will further decide whether the co-administration of a second medicine, interleukin-2, is \nnecessary for the treatment of your cancer. \n \nNeuroblastoma is a type of cancer that grows from abnormal nerve cells in the body, in particular in \nthe glands above the kidneys. It is one of the most common cancers in infancy. \n \nIt is used for patients aged 12 months and above. \n \n \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Qarziba \n \nDo not use Qarziba if you \n \n• are allergic to dinutuximab beta or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n• have acute grade 3 or 4, or extensive long-lasting graft-versus-host disease \n\nThis disease is a reaction in which cells of transplanted tissue attack cells of the recipient. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nBefore receiving Qarziba, you will have blood tests to check your liver, lung, renal and bone marrow \nfunctions. \n \nYou might notice the following when you first receive Qarziba and during the course of treatment: \n• pain \n\nPain is one of the most common side effects of Qarziba. It usually occurs at the beginning of \ninfusion. Therefore, your doctor will give you an appropriate pain treatment starting 3 days \nbefore and continuing during use of Qarziba. \n\n• allergic reactions or other infusion-related reactions \nTell your doctor or nurse if you have any kind of reaction during or after the infusion, such as: \n- fever, shivering and/or low blood pressure \n- difficulties in breathing \n- skin rash, hives \nYou will receive appropriate treatment to prevent these reactions and be closely monitored for \nthese symptoms during infusion of Qarziba. \n\n• leakage from small blood vessels (capillary leak syndrome) \nLeakage of blood components from small blood vessels may cause rapid swelling in arms, legs \nand other parts of the body. Rapid drop in blood pressure, light-headedness and breathing \ndifficulties are further signs. \n\n• eye problems \nYou may notice changes to your vision. \n\n• problems with your nerves \nYou may notice numbness, tingling or burning in your hands, feet, legs or arms, reduced \nsensation or weakness with movement. \n\n \nTell your doctor immediately if you notice any of these problems. \n \nYour doctor will do blood tests and may do eye tests while you are taking this medicine. \n \nChildren \n \nThis medicine should not be given to children under 12 months because there is insufficient \nexperience in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Qarziba \n \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nDo not use medicines that suppress the immune system from 2 weeks before the first dose of \nQarziba until 1 week after the last treatment course, unless prescribed by your doctor. Examples of \nmedicines that suppress the immune system are corticosteroids used to reduce inflammation or prevent \norgan transplant rejection. \n \nAvoid vaccinations during treatment with Qarziba and for 10 weeks afterwards.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  \n \nTalk to your doctor before you receive Qarziba if you are of childbearing age. It is recommended to \nuse contraception for 6 months after discontinuation of treatment with Qarziba. You may only use \nQarziba if your doctor assesses that benefits outweigh risks for a foetus. \n \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. Do not breast-feed during treatment with Qarziba and for \n6 months after the last dose. It is not known if the medicine can pass into breast-milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nQarziba has several side effects that may affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not perform \nthese activities if your ability to concentrate and react is affected. \n \n \n3. How to use Qarziba \n \nA doctor experienced in the use of medicines to treat cancer will supervise your treatment. It will be \ngiven to you by a doctor or nurse while you are in hospital. It is given into one of your veins \n(intravenous infusion) usually by using special tubes (catheters) and a pump. During and after the \ninfusion, you will be checked regularly for infusion-related side effects. \n \nQarziba will be given to you in five treatment courses of 35 days and the infusion will last 5 or 10 days \nin the beginning of each course. The recommended dose is 100 mg dinutuximab beta per square \nmetre of body surface per treatment course. The doctor will calculate your body surface area from \nyour height and weight. \n \nIf your doctor considers co-administration of interleukin-2, it will be given twice, by injection under \nthe skin, each time for 5 consecutive days (before and during treatment with Qarziba). \n \n \n4.

Meath \nK32 YD60 \nΙreland \n\n \nThis leaflet was last revised in {MM/YYYY}. \n \nOther sources of information \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments. \n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n \nQarziba is restricted to hospital-use only and must be administered under the supervision of a \nphysician experienced in the use of oncological therapies. It must be administered by a healthcare \nprofessional prepared to manage severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis in an environment \nwhere full resuscitation services are immediately available. \n \nPosology \nTreatment with dinutuximab beta consists of 5 consecutive courses, each course comprising 35 days. \nThe individual dose is determined based on the body surface area and should be a total of 100 mg/m2 \nper course. \n \nTwo modes of administration are possible: \n• a continuous infusion over the first 10 days of each course (a total of 240 hours) at the daily \n\ndose of 10 mg/m2 \n• or five daily infusions of 20 mg/m2 administered over 8 hours, on the first 5 days of each course \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nIf IL-2 is combined with dinutuximab beta, it should be given as subcutaneous injections for \n5 consecutive days twice during each course. First 5-day treatment should start 7 days prior to first \ndinutuximab beta infusion. Second 5-day treatment with IL-2 should start concurrently with \ndinutuximab beta infusion (days 1 to 5 of each course). IL-2 is administered as 6×106 IU/m2/day, \nresulting in an overall dose of 60×106 IU/m2/course. \n \nPreparation of the infusion \nThe solution for infusion must be prepared under aseptic conditions. The solution must not be exposed \nto direct sunlight or heat. \n \nThe patient-specific daily dose of Qarziba is calculated based on body surface area. Qarziba should be \ndiluted aseptically to the patient-specific concentration/dose with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \nsolution for infusion, containing 1% human albumin (e.g. 5 mL of human albumin 20% per 100 mL \nsodium chloride solution). \n \n• For continuous infusions, the solution for infusion can be prepared freshly on a daily basis, or \n\nsufficient for up to 5 days of continuous infusion. The daily dose is 10 mg/m2. The amount of \nsolution to be infused per day (within a treatment course of 10 consecutive days) should be \n48 mL; with 240 mL for a 5-day dose. It is recommended to prepare 50 mL solution in a 50 mL \nsyringe, or 250 mL in an infusion bag suitable for the employed infusion pump, i.e. an overfill \nof 2 mL (syringe) or 10 mL (infusion bag) to allow for dead volumes of the infusion systems. \n\n \n• For repeated daily infusions, the daily dose is 20 mg/m2 and the calculated dose should be \n\ndiluted in 100 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) containing 1% human albumin. \n \nAdministration of the infusion \nThe solution for infusion should be administered via a peripheral or central intravenous line. Other \nintravenously co-administered agents should be delivered via a separate infusion line. The container \nshould be inspected visually for particulates prior to administration. It is recommended that a \n0.22 micrometre in-line filter is used during infusion. \n \nFor continuous infusions, any medical device suitable for infusion at a rate of 2 mL per hour can be \napplied, e.g. syringe infusion pumps/infusors, electronic ambulatory infusion pumps. Note that \nelastomeric pumps are not considered suitable in combination with in-line filters. \n \nStorage of the diluted solution \nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for up to 48 hours at 25 °C (50 mL \nsyringe) and for up to 7 days at 37 ºC (250 mL infusion bag), after cumulative storage in a refrigerator \n(2 °C – 8 °C) for 72 hours. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \nwould not normally be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8 °C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled \nand validated aseptic conditions. \n \nDisposal \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
