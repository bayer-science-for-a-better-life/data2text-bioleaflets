CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRheumatoid Arthritis (RA) \nKineret is indicated in adults for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of RA in combination with \nmethotrexate, with an inadequate response to methotrexate alone. \n \nPeriodic fever syndromes \nKineret is indicated for the treatment of the following autoinflammatory periodic fever syndromes in \nadults, adolescents, children and infants aged 8 months and older with a body weight of 10 kg or \nabove: \n \nCryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) \nKineret is indicated for the treatment of CAPS, including: \n- Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID) / Chronic Infantile Neurological, \n\nCutaneous, Articular Syndrome (CINCA) \n- Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS) \n- Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) \n \nFamilial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) \nKineret is indicated for the treatment of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Kineret should be given \nin combination with colchicine, if appropriate. \n \nStill\u2019s Disease \nKineret is indicated in adults, adolescents, children and infants aged 8 months and older with a body \nweight of 10 kg or above for the treatment of Still\u2019s disease, including Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic \nArthritis (SJIA) and Adult-Onset Still\u2019s Disease (AOSD), with active systemic features of moderate to \nhigh disease activity, or in patients with continued disease activity after treatment with non-steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids. \n \nKineret can be given as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-inflammatory drugs and \ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nKineret treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of RA, CAPS, FMF and Still\u2019s disease, respectively. \n \nPosology \n \nRA: Adults \nThe recommended dose of Kineret is 100 mg administered once a day by subcutaneous injection. The \ndose should be administered at approximately the same time each day. \n \nCAPS: Adults, adolescents, children and infants aged 8 months and older with a body weight of 10 kg \nor above \n \nStarting dose \nThe recommended starting dose in all CAPS subtypes is 1-2 mg/kg/day by subcutaneous injection. \nThe therapeutic response is primarily reflected by reduction in clinical symptoms such as fever, rash, \njoint pain, and headache, but also in inflammatory serum markers (CRP/SAA levels), or occurrence of \nflares. \n \nMaintenance dose in mild CAPS (FCAS, mild MWS) \nPatients are usually well-controlled by maintaining the recommended starting dose (1-2 mg/kg/day). \n \nMaintenance dose in severe CAPS (MWS and NOMID/CINCA) \nDose increases may become necessary within 1-2 months based on therapeutic response. The usual \nmaintenance dose in severe CAPS is 3-4 mg/kg/day, which can be adjusted to a maximum of \n8 mg/kg/day. \n \nIn addition to the evaluation of clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers in severe CAPS, \nassessments of inflammation of the CNS, including the inner ear (MRI or CT, lumbar puncture, and \naudiology) and eyes (ophthalmological assessments) are recommended after an initial 3 months of \ntreatment, and thereafter every 6 months, until effective treatment doses have been identified. When \npatients are clinically well-controlled, CNS and ophthalmological monitoring may be conducted \nyearly. \n \nFMF \nThe recommended dose for patients weighing 50 kg or more is 100 mg/day by subcutaneous injection. \nPatients weighing less than 50 kg should be dosed by body weight with a recommended dose of 1-\n2 mg/kg/day. \n \nStill\u2019s disease \nThe recommended dose for patients weighing 50 kg or more is 100 mg/ day by subcutaneous injection. \nPatients weighing less than 50 kg should be dosed by body weight with a starting dose of \n1-2 mg/kg/day. \n \nResponse to treatment should be evaluated after 1 month: In case of persistent systemic manifestations \ndose may be adjusted in children or continued treatment with Kineret should be reconsidered by the \ntreating physician. \n \nElderly population (\u2265 65 years) \nRA: No dose adjustment is required. Posology and administration are the same as for adults 18 to \n64 years of age. \n \nCAPS: Data in elderly patients are limited. No dose adjustments are expected to be required. \n \nStill\u2019s disease: Data in elderly patients are limited. No dose adjustment are expected to be required. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPaediatric population (< 18 years) \nNo data are available in children under the age of 8 months. \n \nRA: The efficacy of Kineret in children with RA (JIA) aged 0 to 18 years has not been established. \n \nCAPS: Posology and administration in children and infants aged 8 months and older with a body \nweight of 10 kg or above are the same as for adult CAPS patients, based on body weight. \n \nFMF: Children weighing less than 50 kg are dosed by body weight with a recommended dose of \n1-2 mg/kg/day, patients weighing 50 kg or more are dosed with 100 mg/day. In children with \ninadequate response the dose can be escalated up to 4 mg/kg/day. \n \nThe efficacy data of Kineret in children under 2 years of age with FMF are limited. \n \nStill\u2019s disease: Children weighing less than 50 kg are dosed by body weight with a starting dose of \n1-2 mg/kg/day, patients weighing 50 kg or more are dosed with 100 mg/day. In children with \ninadequate response the dose can be escalated up to 4 mg/kg/day. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). \nKineret should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 to 89 ml/min). Kineret \nshould be used with caution in patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 59 ml/min). In \npatients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 ml/min) or end stage renal disease, including \ndialysis, administration of the prescribed dose of Kineret every other day should be considered. \n \nMethod of administration \nKineret is administered by subcutaneous injection. \n \nKineret is supplied ready for use in a graduated pre-filled syringe. The graduated pre-filled syringe \nallows for doses between 20 and 100 mg. As the minimum dose is 20 mg the syringe is not suitable for \npaediatric patients with a body weight below 10 kg. The pre-filled syringe should not be shaken. The \ninstructions for use and handling are given in section 6.6. \n \nAlternating the injection site is recommended to avoid discomfort at the site of injection. Cooling of \nthe injection site, warming the injection liquid to room temperature, use of cold packs (before and after \nthe injection), and use of topical glucocorticoids and antihistamines after the injection can alleviate the \nsigns and symptoms of injection site reactions. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to E. coli \nderived proteins. \n \nKineret treatment must not be initiated in patients with neutropenia (ANC <1.5 x 109/l) (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nAllergic reactions \nAllergic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported uncommonly. \nThe majority of these reactions were maculopapular or urticarial rashes. \n \nIf a severe allergic reaction occurs, administration of Kineret should be discontinued and appropriate \ntreatment initiated. \n \nHepatic Events \nIn clinical studies transient elevations of liver enzymes have been seen. These elevations have not \nbeen associated with signs or symptoms of hepatocellular damage, except for one patient with SJIA \nthat developed a serious hepatitis in connection with a cytomegalovirus infection. \n \nDuring post-marketing use hepatic events, not affecting liver function, have been reported. The \nmajority of patients have been treated for Still\u2019s disease or have had predisposing factors, e.g. a history \nof transaminase elevations. In addition cases of non-infectious hepatitis, including occasional events of \nacute liver failure, have been reported in patients with Still\u2019s disease during Kineret treatment. \n \nHepatic events in patients with Still\u2019s disease predominantly occur during the first month of Kineret \ntreatment. Routine testing of hepatic enzymes during the first month should be considered, especially \nif the patient has pre-disposing factors or develops symptoms indicating liver dysfunction. \nThe efficacy and safety of Kineret in patients with AST/ALT \u2265 1.5 x upper level of normal have not \nbeen evaluated. \n \nSerious infections \nKineret has been associated with an increased incidence of serious infections (1.8%) vs. placebo \n(0.7%) in RA patients. For a small number of patients with asthma, the incidence of serious infection \nwas higher in Kineret-treated patients (4.5%) vs. placebo-treated patients (0%), these infections were \nmainly related to the respiratory tract. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Kineret treatment in patients with chronic and serious infections have not \nbeen evaluated. \n \nKineret treatment should not be initiated in patients with active infections. Kineret treatment should be \ndiscontinued in RA patients if a serious infection develops. In Kineret treated CAPS or FMF patients, \nthere is a risk for disease flares when discontinuing Kineret treatment. With careful monitoring, \nKineret treatment can be continued also during a serious infection. \n \nMacrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in \npatients with Still\u2019s disease. If MAS occurs, or is suspected, evaluation and appropriate treatment \nshould be started as early as possible. Physicians should be attentive to symptoms of infection or \nworsening of Still\u2019s disease, as these are known triggers for MAS. Available data is limited regarding \nwhether Kineret can be continued during serious infections in patients with Still\u2019s disease. If Kineret \ntreatment is continued during serious infections to reduce the risk for a disease flare, careful \nmonitoring is required. \n \nDuring post-marketing use case reports of MAS in Kineret treated patients with Still\u2019s disease have \nbeen received. Patients with Still\u2019s disease have an increased risk of spontaneous development of \nMAS. A causal relationship between Kineret and MAS has not been established. \n \nPhysicians should exercise caution when administering Kineret to patients with a history of recurring \ninfections or with underlying conditions which may predispose them to infections. \n \nThe safety of Kineret in individuals with latent tuberculosis is unknown. There have been reports of \ntuberculosis in patients receiving several biological anti-inflammatory treatment regimens. Patients \nshould be screened for latent tuberculosis prior to initiating Kineret. The available medical guidelines \nshould also be taken into account. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nOther anti-rheumatic therapies have been associated with hepatitis B reactivation. Therefore, screening \nfor viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with published guidelines also before starting \ntherapy with Kineret. \n \nRenal impairment \nKineret is eliminated by glomerular filtration and subsequent tubular metabolism. Consequently \nplasma clearance of Kineret decreases with decreasing renal function. \n \nNo dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 to 89 ml/min). Kineret \nshould be used with caution in patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 59 ml/min). In \npatients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 ml/min) or end stage renal disease, including \ndialysis, administration of the prescribed dose of Kineret every other day should be considered. \n \nNeutropenia \nKineret was commonly associated with neutropenia (ANC < 1.5 x 109/l) in placebo-controlled studies \nin RA and cases of neutropenia have been observed in patients with CAPS and Still\u2019s disease. For \nmore information on neutropenia see section 4.8. \n \nKineret treatment should not be initiated in patients with neutropenia (ANC < 1.5 x 109/l). It is \nrecommended that neutrophil counts be assessed prior to initiating Kineret treatment, and while \nreceiving Kineret, monthly during the first 6 months of treatment and quarterly hereafter. In patients \nwho become neutropenic (ANC < 1.5 x 109/l) the ANC should be monitored closely and Kineret \ntreatment should be discontinued. The safety and efficacy of Kineret in patients with neutropenia have \nnot been evaluated. \n \nPulmonary Events \nDuring post-marketing use events of interstitial lung disease, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and \npulmonary hypertension have been reported mainly in paediatric patients with Still\u2019s disease treated \nwith IL-6 and IL-1 inhibitors, including Kineret. Patients with trisomy 21 seem to be overrepresented. \nA causal relationship with Kineret has not been established. \n \nImmunosuppression \nThe impact of treatment with Kineret on pre-existing malignancy has not been studied. Therefore the \nuse of Kineret in patients with pre-existing malignancy is not recommended. \n \nMalignancies \nRA patients may be at a higher risk (on average 2-3 fold) for the development of lymphoma. In \nclinical trials, whilst patients treated with Kineret had a higher incidence of lymphoma than the \nexpected rate in the general population, this rate is consistent with rates reported in general for RA \npatients. \n \nIn clinical trials, the crude incidence rate of malignancy was the same in the Kineret-treated patients \nand the placebo-treated patients and did not differ from that in the general population. Furthermore, \nthe overall incidence of malignancies was not increased during 3 years of patient exposure to Kineret. \n \nVaccinations \nIn a placebo-controlled clinical trial (n = 126), no difference was detected in anti-tetanus antibody \nresponse between the Kineret and placebo treatment groups when a tetanus/diphtheria toxoid vaccine \nwas administered concurrently with Kineret. No data are available on the effects of vaccination with \nother inactivated antigens in patients receiving Kineret. \n \nNo data are available on either the effects of live vaccination or on the secondary transmission of \ninfection by live vaccines in patients receiving Kineret. Therefore, live vaccines should not be given \nconcurrently with Kineret. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nElderly population (\u2265 65 years) \nA total of 752 RA patients \u2265 65 years of age, including 163 patients \u2265 75 years of age, were studied in \nclinical trials. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients \nand younger patients. There is limited experience in treating elderly CAPS, FMF and Still\u2019s disease \npatients. Because there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly population in general, caution \nshould be used in treating elderly patients. \n \nConcurrent Kineret and TNF-\u03b1 antagonist treatment \nConcurrent administration of Kineret and etanercept has been associated with an increased risk of \nserious infections and neutropenia compared to etanercept alone in RA patients. This treatment \ncombination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit. \n \nThe concurrent administration of Kineret and etanercept or other TNF-\u03b1 antagonists is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5). \n \nSodium content \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg dose, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteractions between Kineret and other medicinal products have not been investigated in formal \nstudies. In clinical trials, interactions between Kineret and other medicinal products (including \nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products, glucocorticoids, and DMARDs) have not been \nobserved. \n \nConcurrent Kineret and TNF-\u03b1 antagonist treatment \nIn a clinical trial with RA patients receiving background methotrexate, patients treated with Kineret \nand etanercept were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than \npatients treated with etanercept alone and higher than observed in previous trials where Kineret was \nused alone. Concurrent Kineret and etanercept treatment has not demonstrated increased clinical \nbenefit. \n \nThe concurrent use of Kineret with etanercept or any other TNF-\u03b1 antagonist is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nCytochrome P450 Substrates \nThe formation of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., IL-1) during \nchronic inflammation. Thus, it may be expected that for an IL-1 receptor antagonist, such as anakinra, \nthe formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized during treatment. This would be clinically \nrelevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. warfarin and phenytoin). Upon \nstart or end of Kineret treatment in patients on these types of medicinal products, it may be relevant to \nconsider therapeutic monitoring of the effect or concentration of these products and the individual \ndose of the medicinal product may need to be adjusted. \n \nFor information on vaccinations see section 4.4. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited amount of data from the use of anakinra in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a \nprecautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of anakinra during pregnancy and in woman of \nchildbearing potential not using contraception. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether anakinra/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/ \ninfants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Kineret. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIn placebo-controlled studies in RA patients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions with \nKineret were injection site reactions (ISRs), which were mild to moderate in the majority of patients. \nThe most common reason for withdrawal from study in Kineret-treated RA patients was injection site \nreaction. The subject incidence of serious adverse reactions in RA studies at the recommended dose of \nKineret (100 mg/day) was comparable with placebo (7.1% compared with 6.5% in the placebo group). \nThe incidence of serious infection was higher in Kineret-treated patients compared to patients \nreceiving placebo (1.8% vs. 0.7%). Neutrophil decreases occurred more frequently in patients \nreceiving Kineret compared with placebo.  \n \nAdverse reactions data in CAPS patients are based on an open-label study of 43 patients with \nNOMID/CINCA treated with Kineret for up to 5 years, with a total Kineret exposure of 159.8 patient \nyears. During the 5-year study 14 patients (32.6%) reported 24 serious events. Eleven serious events in \n4 (9.3%) patients were considered related to Kineret. No patient withdrew from Kineret treatment due \nto adverse reactions.  \n \nAdverse events data in patients with Still's disease is based on a partially open-label and partially \nblinded, placebo-controlled study of 15 SJIA patients, treated for up to 1.5 years. In addition, post-\nmarketing adverse event reports and published studies constitute supporting data. \n \nAdverse events data in patients with FMF are based on post-marketing adverse event reports and \npublished studies. \n \nThere are no indications either from these studies or from post-marketing adverse reaction reports that \nthe overall safety profile in patients with CAPS, FMF or Still\u2019s disease is different from that in \npatients with RA, with the exception of the risk for development of MAS in patients with Still\u2019s \ndisease. The adverse reactions table below therefore applies to Kineret treatment of RA, CAPS, FMF \nand Still\u2019s disease.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency category. \nFrequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10); common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare \n(< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nMedDRA Organ System Frequency Undesirable Effect \nInfections and infestations Common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) Serious infections \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) Neutropenia \nThrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) Allergic reactions including \nanaphylactic reactions, \nangioedema, urticaria and \npruritus \n\nNervous system disorders Very common (\u2265 1/10) Headache  \nHepatobiliary disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) Hepatic enzyme increased \n\nNot known \n(cannot be estimated from the \navailable data) \n\nNon-infectious hepatitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nVery common (\u2265 1/10) Injection site reaction \nUncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) Rash  \n\nInvestigations Very common (\u2265 1/10) Blood cholesterol increased \n \nSerious infections \nThe incidence of serious infections in RA studies conducted at the recommended dose (100 mg/day) \nwas 1.8% in Kineret treated patients and 0.7% in placebo-treated patients. In observations up to \n3 years, the serious infection rate remained stable over time. The infections observed consisted \nprimarily of bacterial events such as cellulitis, pneumonia, and bone and joint infections. Most patients \ncontinued on study medicinal product after the infection resolved. \n \nIn 43 CAPS patients followed for up to 5 years the frequency of serious infections was 0.1/year, the \nmost common being pneumonia and gastroenteritis. Kineret was temporarily stopped in one patient, \nall other patients continued Kineret treatment during the infections. \n \nIn 15 SJIA patients followed for up to 1.5 years, one patient developed a serious hepatitis in \nconnection with a cytomegalovirus infection. There are no indications from post-marketing experience \nthat types and severity of infections in patients with Still\u2019s disease differ from those in RA or CAPS \npatients. \n \nIn clinical studies and during post-marketing use, rare cases of opportunistic infections have been \nobserved and have included fungal, mycobacterial, bacterial, and viral pathogens. Infections have been \nnoted in all organ systems and have been reported in patients receiving Kineret alone or in \ncombination with immunosuppressive agents. \n \nNeutropenia \nIn placebo-controlled RA studies with Kineret, treatment was associated with small reductions in the \nmean values for total white blood count and absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Neutropenia \n(ANC < 1.5 x 109/l) was reported in 2.4% patients receiving Kineret compared with 0.4% of placebo \npatients. None of these patients had serious infections associated with the neutropenia. \n \nIn 43 CAPS patients followed for up to 5 years neutropenia was reported in 2 patients. Both episodes \nof neutropenia resolved over time with continued Kineret treatment. \n \nIn 15 SJIA patients followed for up to 1.5 years, one event of transient neutropenia was reported. \n \nThrombocytopenia \nIn clinical studies in RA patients, thrombocytopenia has been reported in 1.9% of treated patients \ncompared to 0.3% in the placebo group. The thrombocytopenias have been mild, i.e. platelet counts \nhave been > 75 x109/l. Mild thrombocytopenia has also been observed in CAPS patients. \n \nDuring post-marketing use of Kineret, thrombocytopenia has been reported, including occasional case \nreports indicating severe thrombocytopenia (i.e. platelet counts <10 x109/l). \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nAllergic reactions \nAllergic reactions including anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, urticaria, rash, and pruritus have \nbeen reported uncommonly with Kineret. The majority of these reactions were maculopapular or \nurticarial rashes. \n \nIn 43 CAPS patients followed for up to 5 years, no allergic event was serious and no event required \ndiscontinuation of Kineret treatment. \n \nIn 15 SJIA patients followed for up to 1.5 years, no allergic event was serious and no event required \ndiscontinuation of Kineret. \n \nIn 12 FMF patients treated 4 months with Kineret in a published randomized controlled study no \nallergic event was reported as serious and no event required discontinuation of Kineret. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn clinical trials in RA, up to 3% of adult patients tested seropositive at least once during the study for \nneutralizing anti-anakinra antibodies. The occurrence of antibodies was typically transient and not \nassociated with clinical adverse reactions or diminished efficacy. In addition, in a clinical trial 6% of \n86 paediatric patients with JIA, whereof none of the 15 SJIA subtype patients, tested seropositive at \nleast once during the study for neutralizing anti-anakinra antibodies. \n \nThe majority of CAPS patients in Study 03-AR-0298 developed anakinra anti-drug antibodies. This \nwas not associated with any clinically significant effects on pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety. \n \nHepatic Events \nIn clinical studies transient elevations of liver enzymes have been seen. These elevations have not \nbeen associated with signs or symptoms of hepatocellular damage, except for one patient with SJIA \nthat developed serious hepatitis in connection with a cytomegalovirus infection. \n \nDuring post-marketing use isolated case reports indicating non-infectious hepatitis have been received. \nHepatic events during post-marketing use have mainly been reported in patients that have been treated \nfor Still\u2019s disease and in patients with predisposing factors, e.g. a history of transaminase elevations \nbefore start of Kineret treatment. \n \nInjection site reactions \nISRs typically appear within 2 weeks of therapy and disappear within 4-6 weeks. The development of \nISRs in patients who had not previously experienced ISRs was uncommon after the first month of \ntherapy. \n \nIn RA patients the most common and consistently reported treatment-related adverse reactions \nassociated with Kineret were ISRs. The majority (95%) of ISRs were reported as mild to moderate. \nThese were typically characterised by 1 or more of the following: erythaema, ecchymosis, \ninflammation, and pain. At a dose of 100 mg/day, 71% of RA patients developed an ISR compared to \n28% of the placebo treated patients.  \n \nIn 43 CAPS patients followed for up to 5 years no patient permanently or temporarily discontinued \nKineret treatment due to injection site reactions. \n \nIn 15 SJIA patients followed for up to 1.5 years, the most common and consistently reported \ntreatment-related adverse reactions associated with Kineret treatment were ISRs. One out of the \n15 patients discontinued due to ISRs.  \n \nIn patients with FMF the types and frequencies of ISRs are similar to those seen in RA and SJIA. \nDiscontinuations due to ISRs have occurred also in patients with FMF. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nBlood cholesterol increase \nIn clinical studies of RA, 775 patients treated with daily Kineret doses of 30 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, \n1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg, there was an increase of 2.4% to 5.3% in total cholesterol levels 2 weeks after \nstart of Kineret treatment, without a dose-response relationship. A similar pattern was seen after \n24 weeks Kineret treatment. Placebo treatment (n=213) resulted in a decrease of approximately 2.2% \nin total cholesterol levels at week 2 and 2.3% at week 24. No data are available on LDL or HDL \ncholesterol. \n \nPaediatric population \nKineret has been studied in 36 CAPS patients, 15 SJIA patients and 71 patients with other forms of \nJIA, aged 8 months to <18 years, for up to 5 years. With the exception of infections and related \nsymptoms that were more frequently reported in patients <2 years of age, the safety profile was similar \nin all paediatric age groups. The safety profile in paediatric patients was similar to that seen in adult \npopulations and no clinically relevant new adverse reactions were seen. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicities were observed during clinical studies. \nIn studies of sepsis, 1,015 patients received Kineret at doses up to 2 mg/kg/hour i.v. (~35 times the \nrecommended dose in RA) over a 72 hour treatment period. The adverse event profile from these \nstudies show no overall difference from that seen in the rheumatoid arthritis studies. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC03 \n \nMechanism of action \nAnakinra neutralises the biologic activity of interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) by \ncompetitively inhibiting their binding to interleukin-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI). Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is \na pivotal pro-inflammatory cytokine mediating many cellular responses including those important in \nsynovial inflammation. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIL-1 is found in the plasma and synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and a correlation \nhas been reported between IL-1 concentrations in the plasma and the activity of the disease. \nAnakinra inhibits responses elicited by IL-1 in vitro, including the induction of nitric oxide and \nprostaglandin E2 and/or collagenase production by synovial cells, fibroblasts, and chondrocytes. \n \nSpontaneous mutations in the CIAS1/NLRP3 gene have been identified in a majority of patients with \nCAPS. CIAS1/NLRP3 encodes for cryopyrin, a component of the inflammasome. The activated \ninflammasome results in proteolytic maturation and secretion of IL-1\u03b2, which has a broad range of \neffects including systemic inflammation. Untreated CAPS patients are characterized by increased \nCRP, SAA and IL-6 relative to normal serum levels. Administration of Kineret results in a decrease in \nthe acute phase reactants and a decrease in IL-6 expression level has been observed. Decreased acute \nphase protein levels are noted within the first weeks of treatment. \n \nIn patients with FMF, mutation of the MEFV gene encoding for pyrin is leading to malfunctioning and \noverproduction of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in the FMF inflammasome. Untreated FMF is characterized \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n\nby increased CRP and SAA. Administration of Kineret results in a decrease in acute phase reactants \n(e.g. CRP and SAA). \n \nStill\u2019s disease, in addition to various degrees of arthritis, is characterised by systemic inflammatory \nfeatures such as spiking fever, skin rash, hepatosplenomegaly, serositis, and increased acute phase \nreactants driven by IL-1 activity. Systemically, IL-1 is known to cause the hypothalamic fever \nresponse and promote hyperalgesia. The role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of Still\u2019s disease has been \ndemonstrated by ex vivo and gene expression studies. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in RA \nThe safety and efficacy of anakinra in combination with methotrexate have been demonstrated in \n1,790 RA patients \u2265 18 years of age with varying degrees of disease severity. \n \nA clinical response to anakinra generally appeared within 2 weeks of initiation of treatment and was \nsustained with continued administration of anakinra. Maximal clinical response was generally seen \nwithin 12 weeks after starting treatment. \n \nCombined anakinra and methotrexate treatment demonstrates a statistically and clinically significant \nreduction in the severity of the signs and symptoms of RA in patients who have had an inadequate \nresponse to methotrexate alone (38% vs. 22% responders as measured by ACR20 criteria). Significant \nimprovements are seen in the pain, tender joint count, physical function (HAQ score), acute phase \nreactants and in the patient\u2019s and physician\u2019s global assessment. \n \nX-ray examinations have been undertaken in one clinical study with anakinra. These have shown no \ndeleterious effect on joint cartilage. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in CAPS \nThe safety and efficacy of Kineret have been demonstrated in CAPS patients with varying degrees of \ndisease severity. In a clinical study including 43 adult and paediatric patients (36 patients aged \n8 months to < 18 years) with severe CAPS (NOMID/CINCA and MWS), a clinical response to \nanakinra was seen within 10 days after initiation of treatment in all patients and was sustained for up \nto 5 years with the continued administration of Kineret. \n \nKineret treatment significantly decreases the manifestations of CAPS, including a reduction in \nfrequently occurring symptoms as fever, rash, joint pain, headache, fatigue, and eye redness. A rapid \nand sustained decrease in the levels of the inflammatory biomarkers; serum amyloid A (SAA), \nC-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and a normalization of \ninflammatory hematological changes are seen. In the severe form of CAPS, long-term treatment \nimproves the systemic inflammatory organ manifestations of the eye, inner ear, and CNS. Hearing and \nvisual acuity did not deteriorate further during anakinra treatment. \n \nAnalysis of treatment-emergent AEs classified by presence of CIAS1 mutation showed that there were \nno major differences between the CIAS1 and non-CIAS1 groups in overall AE reporting rates, 7.4 and \n9.2, respectively. Similar rates were obtained for the groups on the SOC level, except for eye disorders \nwith 55 AEs (rate 0.5), whereof 35 ocular hyperemia (which could also be a symptom of CAPS) in the \nCIAS1 group, and 4 AEs in the non-CIAS1 group (rate 0.1). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in FMF \nThe safety and efficacy of Kineret in the treatment of patients with colchicine resistant FMF has been \ndemonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled published study with a treatment \nperiod of 4 months. Primary efficacy outcomes were number of attacks per month, and number of \npatients with a mean of <1 attack per month. 25 patients with colchicine resistant FMF were enrolled; \n12 randomized to receive Kineret and 13 to receive placebo. The mean number of attacks per patient \nper month was significantly lower in those receiving Kineret (1.7) compared to placebo (3.5). The \nnumber of patients with <1 attack per month was significantly higher in the Kineret group; 6 patients, \ncompared to none in the placebo group. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nAdditional published data in patients with FMF, intolerant to colchicine or with colchicine resistant \nFMF, demonstrate that the clinical effect of Kineret is evident in both clinical symptoms of attacks as \nwell as in reduced levels of inflammatory markers, such as CRP and SAA. In the published studies the \nsafety profile of anakinra in patients with FMF was generally similar to that in other indications. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in Still\u2019s disease \nThe safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in a published randomized controlled study in \n24 SJIA patients treated with Kineret for up to 1 year. After a 1-month blinded phase, 8 of 12 patients \nin the Kineret treated group were identified as modified ACRpedi30 responders compared to 1 of 12 in \nthe placebo group. At the same time point, 7 of 12 in the Kineret treated group were classified as \nACRpedi50 and 5 of 12 as ACRpedi70 responders compared to none in the placebo group. 16 patients \ncompleted the subsequent open label phase and among 7 responders at month 12, 6 had stopped \nglucocorticoid treatment and 5 of them had inactive disease. \n \nIn a published prospective, uncontrolled, observational cohort study of 20 patients with new-onset \nSJIA Kineret was used as initial therapy after failure to respond to NSAIDs, but before the use of \nDMARDs, systemic glucocorticoids, or other biologic agents. Treatment with Kineret resulted in \nnormalization of body temperature in 18 of 20 patients. At 1 year follow-up, 18 of 20 patients showed \nat least an adapted ACRpedi 70 response, and 17 of 20 patients reached an adapted ACRpedi 90 \nresponse as well as inactive disease. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Kineret versus DMARD have been reported in a published 24-week \nmulticenter, randomized, open-label study of 22 patients with glucocorticoid-dependent refractory \nAOSD. At Week 24, 6 of 12 patients on anakinra were in remission versus 2 of 10 patients on \nDMARDs. During an open-label extension phase, switching or add-on treatment with the comparator \ndrug was possible if improvement did not occur within 24 weeks. 17 patients completed the open-label \nextension phase (Week 52), of which 7 of 14 Kineret-treated patients, and 2 of 3 patients on \nDMARDs, were in remission at that time point. \n \nAdditional published data in Still\u2019s disease indicate that Kineret induces a rapid resolution of systemic \nfeatures such as fever, rash, and elevation of acute phase reactants. Glucocorticoid doses can in many \ncases be reduced after initiation of Kineret therapy. \n \nPaediatric population \nOverall, the efficacy and safety profile of Kineret is comparable in adult and paediatric patients with \nCAPS or Still\u2019s disease. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nKineret in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in CAPS and RA (JIA) (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \nSafety in paediatric RA (JIA) patients \nKineret was studied in a single randomized, blinded multi-center trial in 86 patients with polyarticular \ncourse JIA (ages 2-17 years) receiving a dose of 1 mg/kg subcutaneously daily, up to a maximum dose \nof 100 mg. The 50 patients who achieved a clinical response after a 12-week open-label run-in were \nrandomized to Kineret (25 patients) or placebo (25 patients), administered daily for an additional \n16 weeks. A subset of these patients continued open-label treatment with Kineret for up to 1 year in a \ncompanion extension study. An adverse event profile similar to that seen in adult RA patients was \nobserved in these studies. These study data are insufficient to demonstrate efficacy and, therefore, \nKineret is not recommended for paediatric use in JIA. \n \nImmunogenicity \nSee section 4.8. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of anakinra after a 70 mg subcutaneous bolus injection in healthy subjects \n(n = 11) is 95%. The absorption process is the rate-limiting factor for the disappearance of anakinra \nfrom the plasma after subcutaneous injection. In subjects with RA, maximum plasma concentrations \nof anakinra occurred at 3 to 7 hours after subcutaneous administration of anakinra at clinically relevant \ndoses (1 to 2 mg/kg; n = 18). The plasma concentration decreased with no discernible distribution \nphase and the terminal half-life ranged from 4 to 6 hours. In RA patients, no unexpected accumulation \nof anakinra was observed after daily subcutaneous doses for up to 24 weeks. Mean (SD) estimates of \nclearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (Vd/F) by population analysis of data from two PK \nstudies in 35 RA patients were 105(27) ml/min and 18.5(11) l, respectively. Human and animal data \ndemonstrated that the kidney is the major organ responsible for elimination of anakinra. The clearance \nof anakinra in RA patients increased with increasing creatinine clearance. \n \nThe influence of demographic covariates on the pharmacokinetics of anakinra was studied using \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis encompassing 341 patients receiving daily subcutaneous \ninjection of anakinra at doses of 30, 75, and 150 mg for up to 24 weeks. The estimated anakinra \nclearance increased with increasing creatinine clearance and body weight. Population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis demonstrated that the mean plasma clearance value after subcutaneous bolus administration \nwas approximately 14% higher in men than in women and approximately 10% higher in subjects \n< 65 years than in subjects \u2265 65 years. However, after adjusting for creatinine clearance and body \nweight, gender and age were not significant factors for mean plasma clearance. No dose adjustment is \nrequired based on age or gender. \n \nIn general the pharmacokinetics in CAPS patients is similar to that in RA patients. In CAPS patients \napproximate dose linearity with a slight tendency to higher than proportional increase has been noted. \nPharmacokinetic data in children < 4 years are lacking, but clinical experience is available from 8 \nmonths of age, and when started at the recommended daily dose of 1-2 mg/kg, no safety concerns have \nbeen identified. Pharmacokinetic data are lacking in older CAPS patients. Distribution into the \ncerebrospinal fluid has been demonstrated. \n \nThe median steady-state dose-normalized anakinra concentration in SJIA patients over 28 weeks was \ncomparable to that observed in RA patients.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nA study including 12 patients with hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh Class B) given a single 1mg/kg \nintravenous dose has been performed. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not substantially different \nfrom healthy volunteers, other than a decrease in clearance of approximately 30% in comparison with \ndata from a study with healthy volunteers. A corresponding decrease in creatinine clearance was seen \nin the hepatic failure population. Accordingly, the decrease in clearance is most likely explained by a \ndecrease in renal function in this population. These data support that no dose adjustment is required \nfor patients with hepatic dysfunction of Child-Pugh Class B. See section 4.2. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe mean plasma clearance of Kineret in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml / min) and \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) renal insufficiency was reduced by 16% and 50%, \nrespectively. In severe renal insufficiency and end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance \n< 30 ml/min), mean plasma clearance declined by 70% and 75%, respectively. Less than 2.5% of the \nadministered dose of Kineret was removed by hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal \ndialysis. These data support that no dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild renal impairment \n(CLcr 50 to 80 ml/minute). See section 4.2. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAnakinra had no observed effect on the fertility, early development, embryo-foetal development, or \nperi- and postnatal development in the rat at doses up to 100 times the human dose (2 mg/kg/day). No \neffects on embryo-foetal development in the rabbit were observed at doses 100 times the human dose. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \nIn a standard battery of tests designed to identify hazards with respect to DNA, anakinra did not \ninduce bacterial or mammalian cell gene mutations. Neither did anakinra increase the incidence of \nchromosomal abnormalities or micronuclei in bone marrow cells in mice. Long-term studies have not \nbeen performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of anakinra. Data from mice over expressing \nIL-1ra and IL-1ra mutant knock-out mice, did not indicate an increased risk of tumour development. \n \nA formal toxicologic and toxicokinetic interaction study in rats revealed no evidence that Kineret \nalters the toxicologic or pharmacokinetic profile of methotrexate. \n \nJuvenile rats treated at doses up to 100 times the human dose from day 7 postparturition up to \nadolescence did not show any signs of adverse effects of the treatment. \n \n \n6.

What Kineret is and what it is used for \n \nKineret contains the active substance anakinra. This is a type of cytokine (an immunosuppressive \nagent) that is used to treat: \n- Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) \n- Periodic fever syndromes: \n\n- Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) \no Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), also called Chronic \n\nInfantile Neurological, Cutaneous, Articular Syndrome (CINCA), \no Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), \no Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) \n\n- Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) \n- Still\u00b4s disease including Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) and Adult-Onset Still\u2019s \n\nDisease (AOSD) \n \nCytokines are proteins made by your body that co-ordinate communication between cells and help \ncontrol cell activity. In RA, CAPS, FMF and in Still\u2019s disease, your body produces too much of a \ncytokine called interleukin-1. This results in harmful effects leading to inflammation, causing the \nsymptoms of the disease. Normally, your body produces a protein that blocks the harmful effects of \ninterleukin-1. The active substance of Kineret is anakinra, this works in the same way as your natural \ninterleukin-1 blocking protein. Anakinra is produced by DNA technology using the micro-organism \nE. coli. \n \nFor RA, Kineret is used to treat the signs and symptoms of the disease in adults (age 18 years and \nover) in combination with another medicine called methotrexate. Kineret is for patients whose \nresponse to methotrexate on its own is not good enough to control the rheumatoid arthritis. \n \nFor CAPS, Kineret is used to treat the signs and symptoms of inflammation associated with the \ndisease such as rash, joint pain, fever, headache and fatigue in adults and children (age 8 months and \nolder). \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nFor FMF, Kineret is used to treat the signs and symptoms of inflammation associated with the disease \nsuch as recurrent fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, muscle or joint pain and rash. Kineret can be used \ntogether with colchicine, if appropriate. \n \nFor Still\u00b4s disease, Kineret is used to treat the signs and symptoms of inflammation associated with the \ndisease such as rash, joint pain and fever. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Kineret \n \nDo not use Kineret \n- if you are allergic to anakinra or any of the other ingredients of this medicine, listed in section 6; \n- if you are allergic to other products that are produced by DNA technology using the micro-\n\norganism E. coli; \n- if you have neutropenia (low white blood cell count) determined after a blood test. \n \nContact your doctor immediately \n- if you get a rash all over your body, shortness of breath, wheezing, fast pulse or sweating after \n\nyour Kineret injection. These may be signs that you are allergic to Kineret. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using Kineret: \n- if you have a history of recurring infections, or if you suffer from asthma. Kineret may worsen \n\nthese conditions; \n- if you have cancer. Your doctor will have to decide if you can still be given Kineret; \n- if you have a history of increased levels of liver enzymes; \n- if you require vaccinations. You must not be given live vaccines while being treated with \n\nKineret. \n \nStill\u2019s disease \n- Patients with Still\u2019s disease may develop a condition called macrophage activation syndrome \n\n(MAS), which can be life-threatening. The risk for developing MAS is increased if you have an \ninfection or if your Still\u2019s disease symptoms are poorly controlled. Symptoms of MAS can be \ne.g. persistent high fever, swelling of lymph nodes, and persistent rash. If you develop signs of \nan infection or worsening of your Still\u2019s disease symptoms you should contact your health care \nprovider as soon as possible. \n\n- In rare cases patients with Still's disease, mainly children, may develop lung disease, also during \nKineret treatment. The risk may be increased in patients with Down's syndrome (trisomy 21). \nSymptoms of lung disease can be e.g. shortness of breath during light exercise, morning cough, \nand difficulties breathing. If you develop signs of lung disease you should contact your health \ncare provider as soon as possible.  \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n- RA: Use of Kineret in children and adolescents with Rheumatoid Arthritis has not been fully \n\ninvestigated and therefore cannot be recommended. \n- CAPS, FMF, Still\u00b4s disease: Kineret is not recommended for children younger than 8 months of \n\nage because there is no data in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Kineret \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nMedicines called tumour necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitors, such as etanercept should not be used \nwith Kineret because this may increase the risk of infections. \n \nWhen you start taking Kineret the chronic inflammation in your body will decrease. This could mean \nthat the doses of some other medicines, e.g. warfarin or phenytoin, have to be adjusted. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nKineret has not been tested in pregnant women. Use of Kineret is not recommended during pregnancy \nand in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. It is important to tell your doctor if \nyou are pregnant, if you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor will \ndiscuss with you the potential risks of taking Kineret during pregnancy. \n \nIt is not known whether anakinra is excreted in human milk. You must not breast-feed if you use \nKineret. \n \nKineret contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Kineret \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. Kineret must be injected under your skin (subcutaneous) daily. You should try to \nhave the injection at the same time each day. \n \nThe recommended dose is either 20 to 90 mg or 100 mg. Your doctor will tell you the dose that you \nneed or whether you need a dose higher than 100 mg. \n \nInjecting Kineret yourself \nYour doctor may decide that it would be more convenient for you to inject Kineret yourself. Your \ndoctor or nurse will show you how to inject yourself. Do not try to inject yourself if you have not been \ntrained. \n \nFor instructions on how to inject yourself or your child with Kineret, please read the \u201cInstructions for \npreparing and giving an injection of Kineret\u201d section at the end of this leaflet. \n \nIf you use more Kineret than you should \nYou should have no serious problems if you accidentally take more Kineret than you need. However, \nyou should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if this does happen. If you feel unwell in any way \nyou should contact your doctor or nurse immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Kineret \nIf you have forgotten to take a dose of Kineret, you should contact your doctor to discuss when you \nshould take the next dose. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nPossible side effects are similar regardless if you are treated with Kineret for RA, CAPS, FMF or \nStill\u2019s disease. \n \nIf any of the following happen, tell your doctor immediately: \n \n- Serious infections such as pneumonia (a chest infection) or infections of the skin can occur during \n\nKineret treatment. Symptoms might be persistent high fever, shivers, cough, headache, and \nredness and tenderness of the skin. Also persistent low-grade fever, weight loss, and persistent \ncough can be signs of an infection. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n- Serious allergic reactions are uncommon. However, any of the following symptoms may \n\nindicate an allergic reaction to Kineret, so you should seek immediate medical attention. Do not \ninject more Kineret. \n- Swelling of the face, tongue or throat \n- Trouble swallowing or breathing \n- Suddenly feeling fast pulse or sweating \n- Itchy skin or rash \n\n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n- Redness, swelling, bruising or itching at the injection site. These symptoms are generally mild \n\nto moderate and are more common at the start of your treatment. \n- Headaches. \n- Increased total blood cholesterol levels. \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- Neutropenia (low white blood cell count) determined after a blood test. This might increase the \n\nrisk of you getting an infection. Symptoms of infection might include a fever or a sore throat. \n- Serious infections such as pneumonia (a chest infection) or infections of the skin. \n- Thrombocytopenia (low level of blood platelets). \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n- Serious allergic reactions including swelling of the face, tongue or throat, trouble swallowing or \n\nbreathing, suddenly feeling fast pulse or sweating and itchy skin or rash. \n- Elevated levels of liver enzymes determined after a blood test. \n \nSide effects with frequency not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n- Signs of liver disorders such as yellow skin and eyes, nausea, loss of appetite, dark-coloured \n\nurine and light-coloured stools. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Kineret \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and carton after EXP. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \nStore in a refrigerator (2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C). Do not freeze. \nStore in original carton in order to protect from light. \n \nDo not use Kineret if you think it has been frozen. Once a syringe has been removed from the \nrefrigerator and has reached room temperature (up to 25 \u00b0C) it must either be used within 12 hours or \ndisposed of. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n32 \n\n6.

It is \nimportant that you do not try to give yourself or your child the injection unless you have received \ntraining from a doctor, nurse or pharmacist. If you have questions about how to inject, please ask your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist for assistance. \n \nHow do you or the person injecting you, use the Kineret pre-filled syringe? \n \nYou will need to give yourself or your child an injection at the same time every day. Kineret is \ninjected just under the skin. This is called a subcutaneous injection. \n \n\n \n \nEquipment: \n \nTo give yourself or your child a subcutaneous injection you will need: \n \n\u2022 a pre-filled syringe of Kineret \n \n\u2022 alcohol wipes or similar; and \n \n\u2022 a sterile gauze or tissue \n \nWhat should you do before you give yourself or your child a subcutaneous injection of Kineret? \n \n1. Take your Kineret pre-filled syringe out of the refrigerator. \n \n2. Do not shake the pre-filled syringe. \n \n3. Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed \n\nthe last day of the month shown. \n \n4. Check the appearance of Kineret. It must be a clear, colourless-to-white solution. There may be \n\nsome translucent-to-white particles of protein in the solution. The presence of these particles \ndoes not affect the quality of the product. The solution should not be used if it is discoloured or \ncloudy, or if any particles other than translucent-to-white particles are present. \n\n \n5. For a more comfortable injection, leave at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes or \n\nhold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few minutes. Do not warm Kineret in any \nother way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water). \n\n \n6. Do not remove the cover from the syringe until you are ready to inject. \n \n7. Wash your hands thoroughly. \n \n8. Find a comfortable, well-lit, clean surface and put all the equipment you need within reach. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n9. Make sure you know what Kineret dose your doctor has prescribed; 20 to 90 mg, 100 mg or \nhigher.  \n\n\u2022 If your doctor has prescribed a 100 mg dose you should continue to the \u201cHow to prepare a \n100 mg dose\u201d section. \n\n\u2022 If your doctor has prescribed a lower dose you should continue to the \u201cHow to prepare a 20 to \n90 mg dose\u201d section. \n\n \nHow to prepare a 100 mg dose \n \nBefore you inject Kineret you must do the following: \n \n1. Hold the syringe barrel and gently remove the cover \n\nfrom the needle without twisting. Pull straight as \nshown in Figure A. Do not touch the needle or push \nthe plunger. Immediately discard the needle cover. \n\n \n2. You may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled \n\nsyringe. You do not have to remove the air bubble \nbefore injecting. Injecting the solution with the air \nbubble is harmless. \n\n \n3. You can now use the pre-filled syringe as described in the \u201cWhere should you give your \n\ninjection?\u201d section and \u201cHow do you give your injection?\u201d section.  \n \nHow to prepare a 20 to 90 mg dose \n \nBefore you inject Kineret you must do the following: \n \n1. Hold the syringe barrel and gently remove the cover from the \n\nneedle without twisting. Pull straight as shown in Figure A. Do \nnot touch the needle or push the plunger. Immediately discard the \nneedle cover. \n\n \n2. You should position the syringe in one hand with the needle \n\npointing straight upwards as shown in Figure B. Put your thumb \non the plunger rod and push slowly until you see a tiny liquid drop \nat the tip of the needle. \n\n \n3. Turn the syringe so that the needle is now pointing \n\ndownwards. Place a sterile gauze or tissue on a flat surface and \nhold the syringe above it with the needle pointing towards the \ngauze or tissue, as shown in Figure C. Make sure the needle \ndoes not touch the gauze or tissue. \n \n\n4. Put your thumb on the plunger rod and push slowly until the \nplunger front has reached the scale mark of your Kineret dose. \n(Your doctor will have told you what dose you need to use.) \nThe ejected liquid will be absorbed by the gauze or tissue as \nshown in Figure C. \n\n \n5. If you are not able to set the correct dose, dispose of the \n\nsyringe and use a new one. \n \n\n6. You can now use the pre-filled syringe as described in the \n\u201cWhere should you give your injection?\u201d section and the \n\u201cHow do you give your injection?\u201d section. \n \n\nFigure A \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nWhere should you give your injection? \n \nThe most suitable places to inject yourself or your child are (See Figure D): \n \n\u2022 the abdomen (except for the area around the navel) \n\u2022 the top of the thighs \n\u2022 the upper outer areas of the buttocks; and \n\u2022 the outer area of the upper arms \n \n\nAdult        Child \n \n\n \n \n\n \nChange the place that you inject each time so you don\u2019t become sore in one area. If someone else is \ninjecting for you, they can also use the back of your arms. \n \nHow do you give your injection? \n \n1. Disinfect the skin by using the alcohol wipe and pinch the skin between your thumb and \n\nforefinger, without squeezing it. \n \n2. Put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your nurse or doctor. \n \n3. Inject the liquid slowly and evenly, always keeping the skin pinched as in Figure E. \n \n\n \n4. After injecting the liquid, remove the needle and let go of the skin. \n \n5. Any unused medicine must be discarded. Only use each syringe for one injection. Do not reuse \n\na syringe as this can cause infection. \n \nRemember \n \nIf you have any problems, please do not be afraid to ask your doctor or nurse for help and advice. \n\nFigure D \n \n\nFigure E  \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \nDisposing of used syringes and supplies \n \n\u2022 Do not put the cover back on used needles. \n \n\u2022 Keep used syringes out of reach and sight of children. \n \n\u2022 Never put the pre-filled syringes that you have used into your normal household rubbish bin. \n\n \n\u2022 If you had a dose lower than 100 mg you will have been told to eject liquid from the syringe \n\nonto a gauze or tissue. After your injection discard the wet gauze or tissue with your syringe and \nclean the surface with a fresh tissue. \n\n \n\u2022 The used pre-filled syringe and any gauze or tissue with Kineret solution should be disposed of \n\nin accordance with local requirements. Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of medicines no \nlonger required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

"do not use kineret - if you are allergic to anakinra or any of the other ingredients of this medicine, listed in section 6; - if you are allergic to other products that are produced by dna technology using the micro- organism e. coli; - if you have neutropenia (low white blood cell count) determined after a blood test. contact your doctor immediately - if you get a rash all over your body, shortness of breath, wheezing, fast pulse or sweating after your kineret injection. these may be signs that you are allergic to kineret. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before using kineret: - if you have a history of recurring infections, or if you suffer from asthma. kineret may worsen these conditions; - if you have cancer. your doctor will have to decide if you can still be given kineret; - if you have a history of increased levels of liver enzymes; - if you require vaccinations. you must not be given live vaccines while being treated with kineret. still's disease - patients with still's disease may develop a condition called macrophage activation syndrome (mas), which can be life-threatening. the risk for developing mas is increased if you have an infection or if your still's disease symptoms are poorly controlled. symptoms of mas can be e.g. persistent high fever, swelling of lymph nodes, and persistent rash. if you develop signs of an infection or worsening of your still's disease symptoms you should contact your health care provider as soon as possible. - in rare cases patients with still's disease, mainly children, may develop lung disease, also during kineret treatment. the risk may be increased in patients with down's syndrome (trisomy 21). symptoms of lung disease can be e.g. shortness of breath during light exercise, morning cough, and difficulties breathing. if you develop signs of lung disease you should contact your health care provider as soon as possible. children and adolescents - ra: use of kineret in children and adolescents with rheumatoid arthritis has not been fully investigated and therefore cannot be recommended. - caps, fmf, still\u00b4s disease: kineret is not recommended for children younger than 8 months of age because there is no data in this age group. other medicines and kineret tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. medicines called tumour necrosis factor (tnf-\u03b1) inhibitors, such as etanercept should not be used with kineret because this may increase the risk of infections. when you start taking kineret the chronic inflammation in your body will decrease. this could mean that the doses of some other medicines, e.g. warfarin or phenytoin, have to be adjusted. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. kineret has not been tested in pregnant women. use of kineret is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. it is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. your doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of taking kineret during pregnancy. it is not known whether anakinra is excreted in human milk. you must not breast-feed if you use kineret.
