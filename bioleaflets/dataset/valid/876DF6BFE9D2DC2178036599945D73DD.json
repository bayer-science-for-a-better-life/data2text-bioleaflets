CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAYVAKYT is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the platelet-derived growth factor \nreceptor alpha (PDGFRA) D842V mutation. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of anticancer therapy. \n \nPatient selection for treatment of unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V \nmutation should be based on a validated test method. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended starting dose of avapritinib is 300 mg orally once daily, on an empty stomach (see \nMethod of administration). The dose should be adjusted based on safety and tolerability.  \n \nTreatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \n \nConcomitant use of avapritinib with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If \nconcomitant use with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, the starting dose of avapritinib \nshould be reduced from 300 mg orally once daily to 100 mg orally once daily (see section 4.5). \n \nIf vomiting occurs after taking a dose of avapritinib, the patient should not take an additional dose but \ncontinue with the next scheduled dose.  \n \n\nMissed doses \n\nIf a dose of avapritinib is missed, the patient should make up for the missed dose unless the next \nscheduled dose is within 8 hours (see Method of administration). If the dose has not been taken at least \n8 hours prior to the next dose, then that dose should be omitted and the patient should resume \ntreatment with the next scheduled dose. \n \nDose modifications for adverse reactions \n\nInterruption of treatment with or without dose reduction may be considered to manage adverse \nreactions based on severity and clinical presentation.  \n \nPatients may have their dose reduced by 100 mg increments to a minimum dose of 100 mg once daily. \n \nRecommended dose modifications are indicated in Table 1.  \n \nTable 1. Recommended dose modifications for AYVAKYT for adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reaction Severity* Dosage modification \nIntracranial haemorrhage  \n(see section 4.4) \n\nAll Grades Permanently discontinue \nAYVAKYT. \n\nCognitive effects** \n(see section 4.4) \n\nGrade 1 Continue at the same dose or \ninterrupt until improvement to \nbaseline or resolution. Resume \nat the same dose or a reduced \ndose. \n\nGrade 2 or Grade 3 Interrupt therapy until \nimproved to baseline, Grade 1, \nor resolution. Resume at the \nsame dose or at a reduced dose. \n\nGrade 4 Permanently discontinue \nAYVAKYT. \n\nOther  \n(also see section 4.4 and \nsection 4.8) \n \n\nGrade 3 or Grade 4 Interrupt therapy until less than \nor equal to Grade 2. Resume at \nthe same dose or at a reduced \ndose, if warranted. \n\n* The severity of adverse reactions graded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common \nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 and 5.0 \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n** Adverse reactions with impact on Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) for Grade 2 or higher adverse \nreactions \n \nSpecial populations \n \n\nElderly \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients aged 65 years and above. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin within \nupper limit of normal [ULN] and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN or total bilirubin greater \nthan 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) and moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3.0 \ntimes ULN and any AST). Avapritinib has not been studied in subjects with severe (Child-Pugh class \nC) hepatic impairment and therefore its use in patients with severe hepatic impairment cannot be \nrecommended (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment  \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment [creatinine \nclearance (CLcr) 30-89 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault]. Avapritinib has not been studied in \npatients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15-29 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (CLcr \n<15 mL/min), therefore its use in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease \ncannot be recommended (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of AYVAKYT in children aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been established. \nNo data are available. \n \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nAYVAKYT is for oral use. \n \nThe tablets should be taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after a meal \n(see section 5.2). \n \nPatients should swallow the tablet(s) whole with a glass of water.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHaemorrhages \n \nIn patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST, avapritinib has been associated with an increased \nincidence of haemorrhagic events, including serious and severe events, like gastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage, hepatic, tumour and intracranial haemorrhages. Gastrointestinal haemorrhagic events \nwere the most commonly reported haemorrhagic events during avapritinib treatment (see section 4.8). \n \nRoutine surveillance of haemorrhagic events should include physical examination, and blood counts \nand coagulation parameters should be monitored, particularly in patients with conditions predisposing \nto bleeding, and in those treated with anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin and phenprocoumon) or other \nconcomitant medicinal products that increase the risk of bleeding.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nIntracranial haemorrhages \n \nSerious adverse reactions of intracranial haemorrhage were reported in patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic GIST receiving avapritinib (see section 4.8). The exact mechanism is unknown.  \n \nBefore initiating AYVAKYT the risk for intracranial haemorrhage should be carefully considered in \npatients with risk factors such as severe thrombocytopenia, and in patients with increased risk of \nintracranial haemorrhage such as those with a vascular aneurysm or a history of intracranial \nhaemorrhage within the prior year, a history of a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischaemic \nattack. Patients who experience clinically relevant neurological signs and symptoms (e.g. severe \nheadache, vision problems, somnolence, or focal weakness) during treatment with AYVAKYT should \ninform their healthcare professional immediately. Brain imaging by magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) or computed tomography (CT) may be performed at the discretion of the physician based on \nseverity and the clinical presentation.  \n \nFor patients with observed intracranial haemorrhage during treatment with avapritinib, regardless of \nGrade, avapritinib should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2). \n \nThere is no clinical trial experience using AYVAKYT in patients with brain metastases. \n \nCognitive effects \n \nCognitive effects can occur in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST receiving AYVAKYT \n(see section 4.8). These include memory impairment, cognitive disorder, confusional state, and \nencephalopathy. The mechanism of the cognitive effects is not known. \n \nIt is recommended that patients are clinically monitored for signs and symptoms of cognitive events \nsuch as new or increased forgetfulness, confusion, or difficulty with cognitive functioning. Patients \nshould notify their healthcare professional immediately if they experience new or worsening cognitive \nsymptoms.  \nFor patients with observed cognitive effects related to treatment with AYVAKYT, the recommended \ndose modification in Table 1 should be followed (see section 4.2). In clinical trials, dose reductions or \ninterruptions improved Grade \u22652 cognitive effects compared to no action. \n \nFluid retention \n \nOccurrences of fluid retention, including severe cases of localised oedema (facial, periorbital, \nperipheral oedema and/or pleural effusion) or generalised oedemas, have been reported with a \nfrequency category of at least common in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST taking \navapritinib. Other localised oedemas (laryngeal oedema and/or pericardial effusion) have been \nreported uncommonly (see section 4.8).  \n \n\nTherefore, it is recommended that patients be evaluated for these adverse reactions including regular \nassessment of weight and respiratory symptoms. An unexpected rapid weight gain or respiratory \nsymptoms indicating fluid retention should be carefully investigated and appropriate supportive care \nand therapeutic measures, such as diuretics, should be undertaken.  \n \nQT interval prolongation \n \nProlongation of QT interval has been observed in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST treated \nwith avapritinib in clinical trials. QT interval prolongation may induce an increased risk of ventricular \narrhythmias, including Torsade de pointes.  \nAYVAKYT should be used with caution in patients with known QT interval prolongation or at risk of \nQT interval prolongation (e.g. due to concomitant medicinal products, pre-existing cardiac disease \nand/or electrolyte disturbances). Concomitant administration with moderate or strong CYP3A4 \ninhibitors should be avoided due to the increased risk of adverse reactions, including QT prolongation \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nand related arrhythmias (see section 4.5). If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot \nbe avoided, see section 4.2 for dose modification instructions. \nInterval assessments of QT by ECG should be considered if AYVAKYT is taken concurrently with \nmedicinal products that can prolong QT interval. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders  \n \nDiarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions \nin patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST (see section 4.8). Supportive care for gastrointestinal \nadverse reactions requiring treatment may include medicinal products with antiemetic, antidiarrheal, \nor antacid properties.  \nThe hydration status of patients experiencing gastrointestinal adverse reactions must be closely \nmonitored and treated as per standard clinical practice. \n \nLaboratory tests \n \nTreatment with avapritinib in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST is associated with \nanaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.8). Complete blood counts should be \nperformed on a regular basis during the treatment with AYVAKYT.  \nTreatment with avapritinib is associated in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST with \nelevations in bilirubin and liver transaminases (see section 4.8). Liver function (transaminases, \nbilirubin) should be monitored regularly in patients receiving AYVAKYT. \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers \n \nCo-administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided because it may \nincrease the plasma concentration of avapritinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).  \nCo-administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers should be avoided because it may \ndecrease the plasma concentrations of avapritinib (see section 4.5). \n \nPhotosensitivity reaction \n \nExposure to direct sunlight should be avoided or minimised due to the risk of phototoxicity associated \nwith AYVAKYT. Patients should be instructed to use measures such as protective clothing and \nsunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). \n \nSodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nActive substances that may have an effect on AYVAKYT \n \nStrong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of AYVAKYT with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased avapritinib plasma \nconcentrations and may result in increased adverse reactions. Co-administration of itraconazole \n(200 mg twice daily on Day 1 followed by 200 mg once daily for 13 days) with a single 200 mg dose \nof avapritinib on Day 4 in healthy subjects increased avapritinib Cmax by 1.4-fold and AUC0-inf by 4.2-\nfold, relative to a  200 mg dose of avapritinib administered alone.  \n \nConcomitant use of avapritinib with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (such as antifungals \nincluding ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole; certain macrolides such as \nerythromycin, clarithromycin and telithromycin; active substances to treat human immunodeficiency \nvirus infections/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) such as cobicistat, indinavir, \nlopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir and saquinavir; as well as conivaptan for hyponatremia and boceprevir \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nto treat hepatitis) including grapefruit or grapefruit juice should be avoided. If concomitant use with a \nmoderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, the starting dose of AYVAKYT should be reduced \nfrom 300 mg orally once daily to 100 mg orally once daily (see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nStrong and moderate CYP3A inducers \n\nCo-administration of AYVAKYT with a strong CYP3A inducer decreased avapritinib plasma \nconcentrations and may result in decreased efficacy of avapritinib. Co-administration of rifampin \n(600 mg once daily for 18 days) with a single 400 mg dose of avapritinib on Day 9 in healthy subjects \ndecreased avapritinib Cmax by 74% and AUC0-inf by 92%, relative to a 400 mg dose of avapritinib \nadministered alone.  \nCo-administration of AYVAKYT with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. dexamethasone, \nphenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital, fosphenytoin, primidone, bosentan, efavirenz, \netravirine, modafinil, dabrafenib, nafcillin or Hypericum perforatum, also known as St. John\u2019s Worth) \nshould be avoided. \n \nEffect of AYVAKYT on other active substances  \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrated that avapritinib is a direct inhibitor of CYP3A and a time-dependent \ninhibitor of CYP3A. Therefore, avapritinib may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations \nof co-administered medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A. \n \nIn vitro studies indicated that avapritinib is an inducer of CYP3A. Therefore, avapritinib may have the \npotential to decrease plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are substrates \nof CYP3A. \nCaution should be exercised with co-administration of avapritinib with narrow therapeutic index \nCYP3A substrates as their plasma concentrations may be altered.  \n \nAvapritinib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, MATE2-K, and BSEP in vitro. Therefore, \navapritinib has the potential to alter concentrations of co-administered substrates of these transporters. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \nWomen of childbearing potential should be informed that avapritinib may cause foetal harm (see \nsection 5.3).  \n \nThe pregnancy status of women of reproductive potential should be verified prior to initiating \nAYVAKYT treatment. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 month \nafter the last dose of AYVAKYT.  \n \nPatients should be advised to contact their healthcare professional immediately if they become \npregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking AYVAKYT. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of avapritinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \nAYVAKYT is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception.  \n \nIf AYVAKYT is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking AYVAKYT, \nthe patient should be advised of the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether avapritinib/ metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \n \nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \n \nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with AYVAKYT and for 2 weeks following \nthe final dose.  \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effect of AYVAKYT on human fertility. No relevant effects on fertility were \nobserved in a rat fertility study (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nAYVAKYT may cause adverse reactions such as cognitive effects that may influence the ability to \ndrive and use machines. \nPatients should be made aware of the potential for adverse reactions that affect their ability to \nconcentrate and react. Patients who experience these adverse effects should take special care when \ndriving a car or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety database includes a total of 585 patients with GIST (all doses), of which 550 patients \nreceived avapritinib at a starting dose of 300 mg or 400 mg, see section 5.1.  \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions of any Grade during treatment with AYVAKYT were \nnausea (45%), fatigue (40%), anaemia (39%), periorbital oedema (33%), face oedema (27%), \nhyperbilirubinaemia (28%), diarrhoea (26%), vomiting (24%), oedema peripheral (23%), lacrimation \nincreased (22%), decreased appetite (21%) and memory impairment (20%).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 23% of patients receiving avapritinib. The most common serious \nadverse reactions during treatment with avapritinib were anaemia (6%), and pleural effusion (1%).  \n \nThe most common adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were fatigue, \nencephalopathy and intracranial haemorrhage (< 1% each). Adverse reactions leading to a dose \nreduction included anaemia, fatigue, neutrophil count decreased, blood bilirubin increased, memory \nimpairment, cognitive disorder, periorbital oedema, nausea and face oedema.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions that were reported in clinical trials  in  \u22651% of patients are listed below (Table 2) \nexcept for adverse reactions mentioned in the section 4.4 which are included regardless of frequency, \naccording to the MedDRA System Organ Class and frequency.  \n \nFrequencies are defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to \n<1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nTable 2.

The median time to improvement and \nresolution was 25 weeks for intracranial haemorrhage of Grade \u22652. \n \n\nCognitive effects \n\nCognitive effects occurred in 194 (33%) of the 585 patients with GIST (all doses) and in 182 (33%) of \nthe 550 patients with GIST who received AYVAKYT at starting doses of either 300 or 400 mg once \ndaily (see section 4.4). In the patients who had an event (any Grade), the median time to onset was \n8 weeks.  \n \nMost cognitive effects were Grade 1, with Grade \u22652 occurring in 11% of 550 patients. Among patients \nwho experienced a cognitive effect of Grade \u22652 (impacting activities of daily living) the median time \nto improvement was 15 weeks.  \n \nMemory impairment occurred in 20% of patients, <1% of these events were Grade 3. Cognitive \ndisorder occurred in 12% of patients; <1% of these events were Grade 3. Confusional state occurred in \n5% of patients; <1% of these events were Grade 3. Encephalopathy occurred in <1% of patients; <1% \nof these events were Grade 3. Serious adverse reactions of cognitive effects were reported for 9 of 585 \n(1.5%) of the GIST patients (all doses), of which 7 of the 550 (1.3%) patients were observed in the \nGIST group receiving a starting dose of either 300 or 400 mg once daily.  \nOverall, 1.3% of patients required permanent discontinuation of AYVAKYT for a cognitive effect. \n \nCognitive effects occurred in 37% of the patients aged \u226565 years receiving a starting dose of either \n300 or 400 mg once daily.  \n \nElderly \n\nIn NAVIGATOR and VOYAGER (N=550), 39% of patients were 65 years of age and older, and 9% \nwere 75 years of age and older. Compared with younger patients (<65), more patients \u226565 years old \nhad reported adverse reactions that led to dose reductions (55% versus 45%) and dose discontinuation \n(18% versus 4%). The types of adverse reactions reported were similar regardless of age. Older \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\npatients reported more Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions compared to younger patients (63% versus \n50%). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nNo cases of overdose have been reported in clinical trials with avapritinib. The maximum dose of \nAYVAKYT studied clinically is 600 mg orally once daily. Adverse reactions observed at this dose \nwere consistent with the safety profile at 300 mg or 400 mg once daily (see section 4.8). \n \nManagement \n \nThere is no known antidote for AYVAKYT overdose. In the event of suspected overdose, AYVAKYT \nshould be interrupted and supportive care instituted. Based on the large volume of distribution of \navapritinib and extensive protein binding, dialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of \navapritinib. \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01EX18. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAvapritinib is a Type 1 kinase inhibitor that has demonstrated biochemical in vitro activity on the \nPDGFRA D842V and KIT D816V mutants associated with resistance to imatinib, sunitinib and \nregorafenib with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 0.24 nM and 0.27 nM, respectively, \nand greater potency against clinically relevant KIT exon 11 and KIT exon 17 mutants than against the \nKIT wild-type enzyme.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \n\nPotential to prolong the QT interval  \n\nThe ability of avapritinib to prolong the QT interval was assessed in 27 patients administered \nAYVAKYT at doses of 300/400 mg once daily in an open-label, single-arm study in patients with \nGIST. The estimated mean change from baseline in QTcF was 6.55 ms (90% confidence interval [CI]: \n1.80 to 11.29) at the observed steady state geometric mean Cmax of 899 ng/mL. No effect on heart rate \nor cardiac conduction (PR, QRS, and RR intervals) was observed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of AYVAKYT was assessed in a multi-centre, single-arm, open-label clinical \ntrial (BLU-285-1101; NAVIGATOR). Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of GIST and an Eastern \nClinical Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 (58% and 3% of patients had \nECOG status 1 and 2, respectively) were included in the study.  A total of 217 patients received a \nstarting dose of either 300 mg or 400 mg once daily. \n \nEfficacy was assessed on the basis of overall response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation \nCriteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 modified for patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n(mRECIST v1.1) and duration of response (DOR), as evaluated by a Blinded Independent Central \nReview (BICR).  \n \nIn addition, a total of 239 patients have received treatment with avapritinib at the relevant starting dose \nin an ongoing open-label, randomised phase 3 trial (BLU-285-1303; VOYAGER) in which PFS is the \nprimary endpoint. Ninety six additional patients received avapritinib in this trial after disease \nprogression on the regorafenib control treatment (crossover). As of the last data cut-off date, 9th \nMarch 2020, the median treatment duration was 8.9 months in patients with GIST harbouring the \nPDGFRA D842V mutation included in this study, which provides some preliminary comparative \nsafety data. \n \nPDGFRA D842V mutation \n\n \nA total of 38 patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation \nwere enrolled and treated with AYVAKYT at a starting dose of either 300 mg or 400 mg once daily. \nIn the NAVIGATOR trial 71% of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring the \nPDGFRA D842V mutation had dose reductions to 200 mg or 100 mg once daily during the course of \ntherapy. Median time to dose reduction was 12 weeks. The GIST patients were required to have \nunresectable or metastatic disease and have a documented PDGFRA D842V mutation determined by a \nlocally available diagnostic test. At 12 months, 27 patients were still on AYVAKYT with 22% \nreceiving 300 mg once daily, 37% receiving 200 mg once daily and 41% receiving 100 mg once daily.  \n \nBaseline demographics and disease characteristics were median age of 64 years (range: 29 to \n90 years), 66% male, 66% white, ECOG PS of 0-2 (61% and 5% of patients had ECOG status 1 and 2, \nrespectively), 97% had metastatic disease, largest target lesion was >5 cm for 58%, 90% had prior \nsurgical resection, and median number of prior lines of tyrosine kinase inhibitors of 1 (range: 0 to 5).  \n \nEfficacy results from study BLU-285-1101 (NAVIGATOR) for GIST patients harbouring the \nPDGFRA D842V mutation are summarised in Table 3. The data represent a median duration of \nfollow-up of 26 months across all patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations who were alive, the \nmedian OS had not been reached with 74% of patients alive. The median progression free survival was \n24 months. Radiographic tumour reductions were observed in 98% of patients.  \n \nTable 3.

The \nmedian PFS there was not estimable in patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations randomized to \navapritinib (95% CI: 9.7, NE) compared to 4.5 months in patients receiving regorafenib (95% CI: 1.7, \nNE). \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \nElderly population \n \nForty-two percent of the patients who received AYVAKYT at a starting dose of 300 mg and 400 mg \nonce daily in NAVIGATOR were 65 years or older. No overall differences in efficacy were observed \nin comparison with younger patients. Only limited data are available from the use of avapritinib in \npatients aged 75 years or older (8% (3 out of 38)). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nAYVAKYT in one or more subsets of the paediatric population with a relapsed/refractory solid \ntumour harbouring mutations in either KIT or PDGFRA (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse). \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called \u2018conditional approval\u2019 scheme. \nThis means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing administration of avapritinib once daily, steady state was reached by 15 days. After a single \ndose and repeat dosing of avapritinib, systemic exposure of avapritinib was dose-proportional over the \ndose range of 30 to 400 mg once daily. The geometric mean accumulation ratio after repeat dosing \nwas 3.1 to 4.6.  \n \nThe steady state geometric mean (CV%) maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the \nconcentration-time curve (AUC0-tau) of avapritinib at 300 mg once daily was 813 ng/mL (52%) and \n15400 h\u2022ng/mL (48%), respectively.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing administration of single oral doses of avapritinib of 30 to 400 mg, the median time to peak \nconcentration (Tmax) ranged from 2.0 to 4.1 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability has not been \ndetermined. \n \nEffect of food  \n\nAvapritinib Cmax and AUCinf were increased by 59% and 27%, respectively, in healthy subjects \nadministered avapritinib after a high fat meal (approximately 909 calories, 58 grams carbohydrate, \n56 grams fat and 43 grams protein) compared to the Cmax and AUCinf after overnight fasting.  \n \nDistribution \n \nAvapritinib is 98.8% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro and the binding is not concentration-\ndependent. The blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.95. Following a single 300 mg oral dose of avapritinib, the \ngeometric mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of avapritinib was 17 L/kg, indicating \nextensive distribution into tissues from plasma. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrated that oxidative metabolism of avapritinib is predominantly mediated by \nCYP3A4, CYP3A5 and to a minor extent by CYP2C9. The relative contributions of CYP2C9 and \nCYP3A to the in vitro metabolism of avapritinib were 15.1% and 84.9%, respectively. The formation \nof the glucuronide M690 is catalysed mainly by UGT1A3. \nFollowing a single dose of approximately 310 mg (~100 \u00b5Ci) [14C]avapritinib to healthy subjects, \noxidation, glucuronidation, oxidative deamination and N-dealkylation were the primary metabolic \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\npathways. Unchanged avapritinib (49%) and metabolites, M690 (hydroxy glucuronide; 35%) and \nM499 (oxidative deamination; 14%) were the major circulating radioactive components. Following \noral administration of avapritinib 300 mg once daily in patients, the steady state AUC of the \nconstitutive enantiomers of M499, BLU111207 and BLU111208 are approximately 35% and 42% of \nthe AUC of avapritinib. Compared to avapritinib (IC50 = 4 nM), the enantiomers BLU111207 \n(IC50 = 41.8 nM) and BLU111208 (IC50 = 12.4 nM) are 10.5- and 3.1-fold less potent against KIT \nD816V in vitro.  \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrated that avapritinib is a direct inhibitor of CYP3A and a time-dependent \ninhibitor of CYP3A4, at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 4.5). In vitro, avapritinib did \nnot inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at clinically relevant \nconcentrations. \n \nIn vitro, at clinically relevant concentrations, avapritinib induced CYP3A (see section 4.5). In vitro, \navapritinib did not induce CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 at clinically relevant concentrations.  \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing single doses of AYVAKYT of 30 to 400 mg, the mean plasma elimination half-life of \navapritinib was 32 to 57 hours. \nFollowing oral administration of AYVAKYT 300 mg once daily, the steady state geometric mean \napparent oral clearance (CL/F) of avapritinib was 19.5 L/h. \nFollowing a single oral dose of approximately 310 mg (~100 \u00b5Ci) [14C]avapritinib to healthy subjects, \n70% of the radioactive dose was recovered in faeces and 18% excreted in urine. Unchanged \navapritinib accounted for 11% and 0.23% of the administered radioactive dose excreted in faeces and \nurine, respectively.  \n \nEffects of avapritinib on transport proteins \nIn vitro, avapritinib is not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, \nOATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K and BSEP at clinically relevant concentrations. \n \nAvapritinib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, MATE2-K, and BSEP in vitro (see section 4.5). \nIn vitro, avapritinib did not inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, or OCT2 at clinically \nrelevant concentrations. \n \nGastric acid reducing active substances \nNo clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted. Based on both population and \nnoncompartmental pharmacokinetic analyses for patients with GIST taking gastric acid reducing \nagents, the effect of gastric acid reducing agents on the bioavailability of avapritinib is not clinically \nrelevant. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that age, race, sex, body weight, and albumin \nconcentration have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of avapritinib. In clinical \nstudies, no relevant differences in exposure, safety or efficacy were observed between elderly (aged 65 \nyears and above) and younger patients (see also section 4.8 and section 5.1). \n \nHepatic impairment  \n\nAs hepatic elimination is a major route of excretion for avapritinib, hepatic impairment may result in \nincreased plasma avapritinib concentrations. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, \navapritinib exposures were similar between 53 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin \nwithin upper limit of normal [ULN] and AST > ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any \nAST), 6 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3.0 times ULN and any \nAST), and 284 subjects with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST within ULN). The \npharmacokinetics of avapritinib in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3.0 times \nULN and any AST) has not been studied. \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \nRenal impairment  \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, avapritinib exposures were similar among \n88 subjects with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60-89 mL/min), 24 subjects with moderate renal \nimpairment (CLcr 30-59 mL/min) and 230 subjects with normal renal function (CLcr \u226590 mL/min), \nsuggesting that no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. \nThe pharmacokinetics of avapritinib in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15-29 mL/min) or \nend-stage renal disease (CLcr <15 mL/min) has not been studied.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeat dose toxicology studies \nRepeat dose studies in dogs indicated haemorrhage and choroid plexus oedema in the brain at \u2265 0.4 \ntimes the human exposure at the clinical dose of 300 mg once daily. Rats manifested convulsions, \nwhich was potentially secondary to inhibition of Nav 1.2 at systemic exposures \u22658-fold higher than the \nexposure in patients at the clinical dose of 300 mg once daily. This effect was not seen in dogs. \n \nMutagenicity/carcinogenicity  \nAvapritinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test). It was \npositive in the in vitro chromosome aberration test in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes \nbut negative in the rat bone marrow micronucleus test, and thus, overall non-genotoxic. \nCarcinogenicity studies with avapritinib have not been conducted. \n \nEmbryotoxicitiy / Teratogenicity \nA combined male and female fertility and early embryonic development study was conducted in rats at \noral avapritinib doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day for males, and 3, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day for females. \nMale rats were dosed 4 weeks prior to mating and through mating and female rats were dosed 2 weeks \nprior to mating and to gestation day 7. No effect on male or female fertility was noted. The high dose \nof 30 mg/kg/day is approximately equivalent to the human recommended dose, based on body surface \narea. \n \nAvapritinib showed embryotoxic and teratogenic effects (decreases in foetal weights and viability, and \nincreases in visceral and skeletal malformations) in an embryo-foetal development toxicity study in \nrats.  \n \nPhototoxicity studies \nAn in vitro phototoxicity study in 3T3 mouse fibroblasts as well as a phototoxicity study in pigmented \nrats demonstrated that avapritinib has a slight potential for phototoxicity.  \n \n \n6.

Cells that make up \nthe cancer usually have changes (mutations) in the genes involved in making specific kinases \nassociated with the growth and spread of cancer cells. This medicine is intended to treat GIST that has \na specific mutation (D842V) in the gene responsible for making a kinase called platelet-derived \ngrowth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA). \n \nIf you have any questions about how AYVAKYT works or why this medicine has been prescribed for \nyou, please ask your doctor. \n \n \n2.

Cells that make up \nthe cancer usually have changes (mutations) in the genes involved in making specific kinases \nassociated with the growth and spread of cancer cells. This medicine is intended to treat GIST that has \na specific mutation (D842V) in the gene responsible for making a kinase called platelet-derived \ngrowth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA). \n \nIf you have any questions about how AYVAKYT works or why this medicine has been prescribed for \nyou, please ask your doctor. \n \n \n2.
